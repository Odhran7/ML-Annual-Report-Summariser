general 

fmc corporation is a global agricultural sciences company dedicated to helping growers produce food feed fiber and fuel for an expanding world population while adapting to a changing environment fmc’s innovative crop protection solutions – including biologicals crop nutrition digital and precision agriculture – enable growers crop advisers and turf and pest management professionals to address their toughest challenges economically without compromising safety or the environment fmc is committed to discovering new herbicide insecticide and fungicide active ingredients product formulations and pioneering technologies that are consistently better for the planet 

fmc strategy 

we have streamlined our portfolio over the past ten years to become a tierone leader and the fifth largest global innovation provider in the agricultural chemicals market our strong competitive position is driven by our technology and innovation as well as our geographic balance and crop diversity which helped fmc to take market share in 2019 2020 and 2021 

our leading fungicides herbicides insecticides and biological technologies that farmers throughout the world rely on to protect their crops from disease and pests were produced at five active ingredient plants 18 formulation and packaging sites and sold in more than 120 countries helping farmers grow more food sustainably on less arable land requires a continual stream of new products and technologies we are investing in the agricultural industry’s most productive crop protection pipeline featuring more than 25 new active ingredients in discovery 11 new active ingredients in development and more than 20 molecules featuring new modes of action 

we own and operate a total of 23 manufacturing plants and we have the scale to operate with strong resources and global reach to address changing market conditions our supply chain organization effectively managed to continue supplying our customers and growing our business despite multiple shutdowns and other disruptions in the chinese chemical sector in the last several years as an agricultural sciences company we are considered an essential industry in the countries in which we operate we have avoided significant plant closures and all our manufacturing facilities and distribution warehouses remain operational and fully staffed we will continue to assess the impacts of the pandemic on our business and enact commercial plans cost savings andor liquidity actions as appropriate we made significant investments in our employees as a result of the covid pandemic including through enhanced dependent care offerings recognition bonuses increased flexibility of work schedules and hours of work to accommodate remote working arrangements and investment in it infrastructure to promote remote work through these efforts we have successfully avoided any covid related furloughs or workforce reductions to date 

our revenues grew approximately 9 percent or 8 percent organically 1 excluding the impacts of foreign currency year over year in 2021 driven by strong volume growth and pricing gains in all regions approximately 400 million in sales for 2021 came from products launched in the last five years representing almost 8 percent of the total revenue in 2021 we had new product launches in australia including vantacor™ insect control based on rynaxypyr® active and overwatch® herbicide based on our isoflex™ active we had new product launches in north america for xyway fungicide and vantacor™ insect control products launched in 2021 accounted for approximately 120 million in sales our diamides rynaxypyr® and cyazypyr® active ingredients continued to be a significant part of our portfolio representing over 19 billion in combined sales and approximately 38 percent of the total revenue in 2021we also grew our plant health program which includes fmc’s biologicals platform by 20 percent plant health is now approximately 220 million in sales and outpacing market growth 

fmc performed better than the overall crop protection market in 2021 which we estimate grew in the midsingle digit percentage range versus 2020 foreign currency was a minor tailwind to full year revenue as mentioned above our growth rate was 9 percent and excluding the impact of foreign currency our organic 1 growth rate was 8 percent fmc’s innovation starting with our current portfolio of advanced products and continuing through our rd discovery development and new formulations contributed to our performance our technology portfolio includes specific innovations in plant health application technology and delivery systems as well as advanced agronomic insights through arc™ farm intelligence our precision agriculture tool that leverages artificial intelligence and machine learning

products and markets 

our portfolio is comprised of three major pesticide categories insecticides herbicides and fungicides the majority of our product lines consist of insecticides and herbicides and we have a small but fastgrowing portfolio of fungicides mainly used in high value crop segments our insecticides are used to control a wide spectrum of pests while our herbicide portfolio primarily targets a large variety of difficulttocontrol weeds in addition we are also investing substantially in our plant health program which includes biological crop protection products seed treatments and micronutrients biological technologies developed by fmc’s rd team in denmark offer excellent sustainability profiles and serve as strong complements to our synthetic products our biologicals feature attributes that exceed the competition such as high stability long shelf life low use rates and compatibility with other chemistries 

we have our own sales and marketing organizations and access the market through a combination of distributors retailers and coops in all four regions in addition we sell directly to large growers in select countries such as brazil through these and other alliances along with our own targeted marketing efforts access to novel technologies and our innovation initiatives we expect to maintain and enhance our access in key agricultural and noncrop markets and develop new products that will help us continue to compete effectively 

industry overview 

the three principal categories of agricultural and noncrop chemicals are herbicides insecticides and fungicides representing approximately 40 percent 30 percent and 27 percent of global industry revenue respectively 

the agrochemicals industry is more consolidated following several recent mergers of the leading crop protection companies which now include fmc chemchina owner of syngenta group which includes the former syngenta and adama bayer ag acquired monsanto in 2018 basf ag and corteva agriscience the agricultural division of former dowdupont spun out in june 2019 these five innovation companies currently represent approximately 75 percent of the crop protection industry’s global sales the next group of agrochemical producers include upl ltd upl also acquired arysta in february 2019 sumitomo chemical company ltd and nufarm ltd fmc employs various differentiated strategies and competes with unique technologies focusing on certain crops markets and geographies while also being supported by a lowcost manufacturing model 

growth 

we are among the leading agrochemical producers in the world several products from our portfolio are based on patentprotected active ingredients and continue to grow well above market patterns our complementary technologies combine improved formulation capabilities and a broader innovation pipeline resulting in new and differentiated products we will take advantage of enhanced market access positions and an expanded portfolio to deliver nearterm growth 

we will continue to grow by obtaining new and approved uses for existing product lines and acquiring accessing developing marketing distributing andor selling complementary chemistries and related technologies in order to strengthen our product portfolio and our capabilities to effectively service our target markets and customers 

our growth efforts focus on developing environmentally compatible and sustainable solutions that can effectively increase farmers’ yields and provide costeffective alternatives to chemistries which may be prone to resistance we are committed to providing unique differentiated products to our customers by acquiring and further developing technologies as well as investing in innovation to extend product life cycles our external growth efforts include product acquisitions inlicensing of chemistries and technologies and alliances that bolster our market access complement our existing product portfolio or provide entry into adjacent spaces we have entered into a range of development and distribution agreements with other companies that provide access to new technologies and products which we can subsequently commercialize 

in fmc precision agriculture we are broadening our awardwinning arc™ farm intelligence platform a proprietary mobile solution that helps farmers better understand and manage pest pressure through predictive modeling based on realtime and historical data entomological models hyperlocal weather information and infield sensors arc™ farm intelligence which is now available in more than 25 markets covering 16 million acres throughout latin america north america europe and asia allows farmers to address pest pressure more efficiently manage infestations before they escalate and target applications in a more sustainable manner 

our venture capital arm fmc ventures continued to build its portfolio in 2021 with new collaborations or strategic investments in startups and early stage companies working on new or disruptive technologies these engagements which support or augment our internal capabilities span several important technology segments including robotics pathogen detection soil health peptides and pheromones 

diamide growth strategy 

our product portfolio features two key diamideclass molecules – rynaxypyr® chlorantraniliprole and cyazypyr® cyantraniliprole actives – with combined annual revenues of approximately 19 billion in 2021 these two molecules are industryleading in terms of performance combining highly effective low dose rates with fastacting systemic long residual control these attributes quickly established rynaxypyr® active as the world’s leading insect control technology and we expect it to continue on a strong growth trajectory notwithstanding the expiration of composition of matter patents covering rynaxypyr® active in certain countries starting in late 2022 our cyazypyr® active a secondgeneration diamide is growing quickly as we obtain more product registrations we expect cyazypyr® active to continue to grow strongly notwithstanding the expiration of its active ingredient composition of matter patents starting in the mid2020s this expectation is based on not only our broad patent estate and the timing of key patent milestones but also on other critical elements that will allow fmc to continue to profitably grow the diamide franchise well beyond the expiration of key patents some of the critical elements supporting diamide growth include registration and data protection commercial strategies brand recognition as well as manufacturing and supply chain complexity and fmc efficiencies 

patents and trade secrets the fmc diamide insect control patent estate is made up of many different patent families which cover composition of matter – both active ingredients and certain intermediates manufacturing processes – both active ingredients and certain intermediates formulations uses and applications for rynaxypyr® and cyazypyr® actives related patents as of december 31 2021 we had 34 families with granted patents filed in up to 76 countries with a total of 857 active granted patents as well as numerous pending patent applications see patents trademarks and licenses within this item 1 for more details fmc’s process patents cover the manufacturing processes for both active ingredients – chlorantraniliprole and cyantraniliprole – as well as key intermediates that are used to make the final products chlorantraniliprole is a complex molecule to produce requiring 16 separate steps fmc owns granted patents covering many of these 16 process steps and several of the intermediate chemicals and we protect other aspects of the manufacturing processes by trade secret cyantraniliprole is similarly complex and covered by a comparable range of intellectual property many of these intermediate process patents run well past the expiration of the composition of matter patents and in some cases stretch until the end of this decade third parties that intend to manufacture and sell generic chlorantraniliprole or cyantraniliprole and rely on fmc’s extensive product safety data will be required to demonstrate that their product has the same regulatory safety profile as fmcs rynaxypyr® and cyazypyr® actives to meet regulatory requirements for such difficulttomanufacture molecules we believe that third parties will have to produce these active ingredients using the same processes that are patented by fmc and if so would be infringing before patent expiration and subject to our challenge for infringement fmc also owns formulation patents which cover the use of chlorantraniliprole or cyantraniliprole in specific formulations found in commercially important enduse products 

regulatory data protection in addition to the patent estate various pesticide laws and regulations around the world offer added protection to the initial active ingredient registrant in the form of data protection that can extend after the composition or process patents have expired these rules can effectively provide a product innovator and initial active ingredient registrant such as fmc with a further period of exclusive use of the key reference data even after the applicable active ingredient composition of matter patents have expired further in certain countries even after the period of exclusive use has expired a generic entrant seeking to rely on the initial registrant’s reference data may have to pay significant compensation to the initial registrant for fmc’s diamide products such rights apply in key markets including united states and the european union 

growing the fmc diamide franchise fmc is executing a strategy to supply enduse products containing rynaxypyr® and cyazypyr® actives to a broad range of companies prior to patent expiration and in return establishing longterm purchase commitments from these companies these arrangements may also include limited patent data andor trademark licenses such partner relationships allow us to grow our business by having others develop and sell diamidebased products to meet farmers needs not within our current portfolio offering those farmers a better alternative to competing insecticides with product safety or efficacy profiles which are less attractive than rynaxypyr® or cyazypyr® actives these agreements can require the thirdparty to use the wellknown and trusted rynaxypyr® or cyazypyr® brand names on the enduse products formulated with active ingredient supplied by fmc as of december 31 2021 we had global agreements with five major multinational companies and approximately 50 separate localcountry agreements covering 14 countries we are continuing to explore opportunities with additional companies beyond those with whom we are already engaged furthermore fmc is developing an extensive portfolio of new diamidecontaining products to address grower needs around the world the first of these products elevest® and vantacor® were launched in the us in late 2020 and early 2021 and will be launched in additional countries in 2022 onward our current diamide pipeline contains approximately 20 new products to be launched this decade and we continue to explore further innovations based on the diamide chemistry 

complexity of manufacturing today fmc manufactures all the required intermediates in the multistep processes as well as the final rynaxypyr® and cyazypyr® actives at our own active ingredient manufacturing plants or through key contract manufacturers who produce under longterm exclusive technologylicense agreements for a thirdparty to replicate this complex supply chain and manufacturing network would be a major undertaking with very large capital requirements in addition given our manufacturing knowhow scale of our operations and continual investment in manufacturing process improvement we believe fmc’s manufacturing costs will be substantially lower than any other party seeking to produce these diamide products 

collectively these four factors – deep patent estate proprietary regulatory data strong commercial approach leveraging our brand recognition and capabilities of managing large scale manufacturing complexity – provide us the basis for our expectation that fmc will be the company of choice to supply chlorantraniliprole and cyantraniliprole products to thirdparty partners and ultimately to farmers well into the future 

source and availability of raw materials 

we utilize numerous vendors to supply raw materials and intermediate chemicals to support operations these materials are sourced on a global basis to strategically balance fmc’s vendor portfolio 

patents trademarks and licenses 

as an agricultural sciences company fmc believes in innovation and in protecting that innovation through intellectual property rights we own and license a significant number of us and foreign patents trademarks trade secrets and other intellectual property that are cumulatively important to our business in addition we seek to license our proprietary technologies through partnering arrangements that effectively allow us to capitalize from our intellectual property the fmc intellectual property estate provides us with a significant competitive advantage which we seek to expand and renew on a continual basis we manage our technology investment to discover and develop new active ingredients and biological products as well as to continue to improve manufacturing processes and existing active ingredients through new formulations mixtures or other concepts fmc’s technology innovation processes capture those innovations and protect them through the most appropriate form of intellectual property rights we also inlicense certain active ingredients and other technologies under patents held by third parties and have granted licenses to certain of our patents to third parties 

our patents cover many aspects of our business including our chemical and biological active ingredients intermediate chemicals manufacturing processes to produce such active ingredients or intermediates formulations and product uses as well as many aspects of our research and development activities that support the fmc new product pipeline patents are granted by individual jurisdictions and the duration of our patents depends on their respective jurisdictions and payment of annuities 

as of december 31 2021 the company owned a total of approximately 200 active granted us patents and 2600 active granted foreign patents includes supplemental patent certificates we also have approximately 1700 patent applications pending globally 

in our current product portfolio our diamide insect control products based on rynaxypyr® chlorantraniliprole and cyazypyr® cyantraniliprole active ingredients have a substantial patent estate which will remain in force well into the future more details regarding our diamide granted patent estate are set forth in the tables below 



patent families were only placed under one type but may cover several types 



we also own many trademarks that are well recognized by customers or product endusers unlike patents ownership rights in trademarks can be continued indefinitely so long as the trademarks are properly used and renewal fees are paid 

we actively monitor and manage our patents and trademarks to maintain our rights in these assets and we strategically take aggressive action when we believe our intellectual property rights are being infringed during 2021 we initiated proceedings to enforce several of our patents and trademarks against generic producers and infringers resulting in multiple favorable judgments and settlements including in india and china in early 2022 we received notice that certain third parties are seeking to invalidate our chinese patents on a certain intermediate involved in producing chlorantraniliprole and a process to produce chlorantraniliprole we intend to defend vigorously the validity of both patents while we believe that the invalidity or loss of any particular patent trademark or license would be a remote possibility our patent and trademark estate related to our diamide insect control products based on rynaxypyr® and cyazypyr® active ingredients in the aggregate are of material importance to our operations 

seasonality 

the seasonal nature of the crop protection market and the geographic spread of our business can result in significant variations in quarterly earnings among geographic locations our products sold in the northern hemisphere north america europe and parts of asia serve seasonal agricultural markets from march through september generally resulting in significant earnings in the first and second quarters and to a lesser extent in the fourth quarter markets in the southern hemisphere latin america and parts of the asia pacific region including australia are served from july through february generally resulting in earnings in the third fourth and first quarters 

competition 

we encounter substantial competition in our business we market our products through our own sales organization and through alliance partners independent distributors and sales representatives the number of our principal competitors varies from market to market in general we compete by providing advanced technology high product quality reliability quality customer and technical service and by operating in a costefficient manner 

our business competes primarily in the global chemical crop protection market for insecticides herbicides and fungicides industry products include crop protection chemicals and biologicals for certain major competitors genetically engineered crop biotechnology products competition from generic agrochemical producers is significant as a number of key product patents have expired in the last two decades in general we compete as an innovator by focusing on product development including novel formulations proprietary mixes and advanced delivery systems and by acquiring or licensing mostly proprietary chemistries or technologies that complement our product and geographic focus we also differentiate ourselves by our global costcompetitiveness through our manufacturing strategies establishing effective product stewardship programs and developing strategic alliances that strengthen market access in key countries and regions 

research and development expense 

the rd efforts in our business focus on discovering and developing environmentally sound solutions — both new active ingredients and new product formulations — that meet the needs of farmers to maximize yields and control pests on june 24 2019 we announced our investment of more than 50 million at our fmc stine research center in newark delaware to upgrade infrastructure and complete construction on a new stateoftheart greenhouse and laboratory facility we anticipate that the project will be completed by the end of 2023

 item 1a risk factors 

among the factors that could have an impact on our ability to achieve operating results and meet our other goals are 

industry risks 

pricing and volumes in our markets are sensitive to a number of industry specific and global issues and events including 

• competition and new agricultural technologies  our business faces competition which could affect our ability to maintain or raise prices successfully enter certain markets or retain our market position competition for our business includes not only generic suppliers of the same pesticidal active ingredients but also alternative proprietary pesticide chemistries and crop protection technologies that are bred into or applied onto seeds increased generic presence in agricultural chemical markets has been driven by the number of significant product patents and product data protections that have expired in the last decade and this trend is expected to continue also there are changing competitive dynamics in the agrochemical industry as some of our competitors have consolidated resulting in them having greater scale and diversity as well as market reach these competitive differences may not be overcome and may erode our business agriculture in many countries is changing and new technologies eg precision pest prediction or application data management continue to emerge at this time the scope and potential impact of these technologies are largely unknown but could have the potential to disrupt our business 

• climatic conditions  our markets are affected by climatic conditions which could adversely impact crop pricing and pest infestations for example drought may reduce the need for fungicides which could result in fewer sales and greater unsold inventories in the market whereas excessive rain could lead to increased plant disease or weed growth requiring growers to purchase and use more pesticides drought andor increased temperatures may change insect pest pressures requiring growers to use more less or different insecticides natural disasters can impact production at our facilities in various parts of the world the nature of these events makes them difficult to predict 

• geographic cyclicality  while our business is well balanced geographically in any given calendar quarter a certain geographyies will predominate in light of seasonal variations in the demand for our products given the nature of the crop protection market and the geographic regions in which we operate unexpected market conditions in any such predominating geographyies such as adverse weather pest pressures or other risks described herein may impact our business if occurring during a calendar quarter in which such geographyies is predominating 

• changing regulatory environment and public perception  changes in the regulatory environment particularly in the us brazil china india argentina and the european union could adversely impact our ability to continue producing andor selling certain products in our domestic and foreign markets or could increase the cost of doing so we are sensitive to regulatory risk given the need to obtain and maintain pesticide registrations in every country in which we sell our products many countries require reregistration of pesticides to meet new and more challenging requirements while we defend our products vigorously these reregistration processes may result in significant additional data costs reduced number of permitted product uses or potential product cancellation compliance with changing laws and regulations may involve significant costs or capital expenditures or require changes in business practice that could result in reduced profitability in the european union the regulatory risk specifically includes the chemicals regulation known as reach registration evaluation and authorization of chemicals which requires manufacturers to verify through a special registration system that their chemicals can be marketed safely climate change may result in changes to the governmental regulation of greenhouse gases depending on their nature and scope this could subject our manufacturing operations to significant additional costs or limits on operations and affect the sources and supply of energy changes to the regulatory environment may be influenced by nongovernment public pressure as a result of negative perception regarding the use of our crop protection products products reviewed by regulators and labeled safe for use may still be challenged by others which could lead to negative public perception or regulatory action competing products labeled safe for use were subject to lawsuits or claims and a similar situation for our products could result in negative impacts 

• geographic presence outside of us  we have a strong presence in latin america europe and asia as well as in the us we have continued to grow our geographic footprint particularly in europe and key asian countries such as india which means that developments outside the us will generally have a more significant effect on our operations than in the past our operations outside the us are subject to special risks and restrictions including fluctuations in currency values exchange control regulations changes in local political or economic conditions governmental pricing directives import and trade restrictions or tariffs import or export licensing requirements and trade policy restrictions on the ability to repatriate funds and other potentially detrimental domestic and foreign governmental practices or policies affecting us companies doing business abroad 

• climate change and land use impacts  climate change may impact markets in which we sell our products where for example a prolonged drought may result in decreased demand for our products the more gradual effects of persistent temperature change in geographies with significant agricultural lands may result in changes in lands suitable for agriculture or changes in the mix of crops suitable for cultivation and the pests that may be present in such geographies for example prolonged increase in average temperature may make northern lands suitable for growing crops not grown historically in such climes leading farmers to shift from crops such as wheat to soybean and may result in new or different weed plant disease or insect pressures on such crops – such changes would impact the mix of pesticide products farmers would purchase which may be adverse for us depending on the local market and our product mix additionally changes in the governmental regulation of greenhouse gases depending on their nature and scope could subject our manufacturing operations to significant additional costs or limits on operations 

• fluctuations in commodity prices  our operating results could be significantly affected by the cost of commodities  both chemical raw material commodities and harvested crop commodities we may not be able to raise prices or improve productivity sufficiently to offset future increases in chemical raw material commodity pricing accordingly increases in such commodity prices may negatively affect our financial results we use hedging strategies to address material commodity price risks where hedging strategies are available on reasonable terms however we are unable to avoid the risk of medium and longterm increases additionally fluctuations in harvested crop commodity prices could negatively impact our customers ability to sell their products at previously forecasted prices resulting in reduced customer liquidity inadequate customer liquidity could affect our customers’ abilities to pay for our products and therefore affect existing and future sales or our ability to collect on customer receivables 

• supply arrangements  certain raw materials are critical to our production processes and our purchasing strategy and supply chain design are complex while we have made supply arrangements to meet planned operating requirements an inability to obtain the critical raw materials or operate under contract manufacturing arrangements would adversely impact our ability to produce certain products and could lead to operational disruption and increase uncertainties 

around business performance we source critical intermediates and finished products from a number of suppliers largely outside of the us and principally in china an inability to obtain these products or execute under contract sourcing arrangements would adversely impact our ability to sell products 

operational risks 

• covid and global pandemic cycles  the persistence of the coronavirus covid19 outbreak has caused significant disruptions in the us and global economies and economists expect the impact will continue to be significant as an agricultural sciences company we are considered an essential industry in the countries in which we operate we have avoided significant plant closures and all our manufacturing facilities and distribution warehouses remain operational and properly staffed our research laboratories and greenhouses also have continued to operate throughout the pandemic and we have sustained our operations with safety as a priority we are closely monitoring raw material and supply chain costs the extent to which covid will continue to impact us will depend on future developments many of which remain uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence including the duration of the pandemic further actions to be taken to contain the pandemic or mitigate its impact and the extent of the direct and indirect economic effects of the pandemic and containment measures among others external and internal factors and events related to covid could result in employee isolation and burnout leading to operational disruption and unexpected regrettable attrition which may impact the sustainability of our high touch agile culture we have seen some logistics challenges supply chain challenges and shortages of packaging materials and containers as many industries have increased ecommerce and delivery of goods creating extra demand on packaging materials as well as related higher costs and pockets of demand reduction we may continue to experience disruption caused by covid in our supply chain logistics and pockets of demand as well as on farm worker labor required for planting harvesting and packing crops especially fruits vegetables and other specialty crops in the food chain going forward this outbreak may impact access to our production sites or our ability to adequately and safely staff these sites the ability of raw material suppliers to produce and deliver goods to us our ability to ship our products to production warehousing or customer sites the ability of our sales organization to make sales or for customers or indirect customers such as farmers to purchase our products or the ability to collect on customer receivables our supply chain and business operations could be disrupted from the temporary closure of thirdparty supplier and manufacturer facilities interruptions in product supply or restrictions on the export or shipment of our products any disruption of our suppliers and contract manufacturers could impact our sales and operating results the outbreak and governmental responses to the outbreak have caused disruption in certain food distribution systems and labor markets for planting and harvesting which in turn have created operational and financial pressures on some farmers who are the ultimate users of the vast majority of our products if those pressures continue and grow more widespread or severe and if farmers materially change their planting decisions or choose not to protect their crops with our products such pressures on farmers could impact our sales and operating results other global health concerns could also result in social economic and labor instability in the countries in which we or our customers and suppliers operate these uncertainties could have a material adverse effect on our business and our results of operation and financial condition a widespread health crisis could adversely affect the global economy resulting in an economic downturn that could impact demand for our products although our production operations that support agriculture have generally been viewed as essential and exempted from governmental lockdown orders the future impact of the outbreak is highly uncertain and cannot be predicted and there is no assurance that the outbreak will not have a material adverse impact on the future results of the company the extent of the impact will depend on future developments including the availability of vaccines and other actions taken to contain the coronavirus 

• business disruptions  we produce products through a combination of owned facilities and contract manufacturers we own and operate largescale active ingredient manufacturing facilities in the us mobile puerto rico manati china jinshan denmark ronland and india panoli our operating results are dependent in part on the continued operation of these production facilities interruptions at these facilities may materially reduce the productivity of a particular manufacturing facility or the profitability of our business as a whole although we take precautions to enhance the safety of our operations and minimize the risk of disruptions our operations and those of our contract manufacturers are subject to hazards inherent in chemical manufacturing and the related storage and transportation of raw materials products and wastes these potential hazards include explosions fires severe weather and natural disasters mechanical failure unscheduled downtimes supplier disruptions labor shortages or other labor difficulties information technology systems outages disruption in our supply chain or manufacturing and distribution operations transportation interruptions chemical spills discharges or releases of toxic or hazardous substances or gases shipment of contaminated or offspecification product to customers storage tank leaks other environmental risks cyberattacks or other sudden disruption in business operations beyond our control as a result of events such as acts of sabotage terrorism or war civil or political unrest natural disasters large scale power outages and public health epidemicspandemics some of these hazards may cause severe damage to or destruction of property and equipment or personal injury and loss of life and may result in suspension of operations or the shutdown of affected facilities 

• climate change and physical risk to operation sites  the effects of climate change such as rising sea levels drought flooding hurricanes excessive heat and general volatility in seasonal temperatures could adversely affect our operations globally extreme weather events attributable to climate change may result in among other things physical damage to our property and equipment and interruptions to our supply chain 

• litigation and environmental risks  current reserves relating to our ongoing litigation and environmental liabilities may ultimately prove to be inadequate products reviewed by regulators and labeled safe for use may still be challenged by others which could result in lawsuits or claims 

• hazardous materials  we manufacture and transport certain materials that are inherently hazardous due to their toxic or volatile nature while we take precautions to handle and transport these materials in a safe manner if they are mishandled or released into the environment they could cause property damage or result in personal injury claims against us 

• environmental compliance  we are subject to extensive federal state local and foreign environmental and safety laws regulations directives rules and ordinances concerning among other things emissions in the air discharges to land and water and the generation handling treatment disposal and remediation of hazardous waste and other materials we may face liability arising out of the normal course of business including alleged personal injury or property damage due to exposure to chemicals or other hazardous substances at our current or former facilities or chemicals that we manufacture handle or own we take our environmental responsibilities very seriously but there is a risk of environmental impact inherent in our manufacturing operations and transportation of chemicals any substantial liability for environmental damage could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

technology risks 

• technological and new product discoverydevelopment  our ability to compete successfully depends in part upon our ability to maintain a superior technological capability and to continue to identify develop and commercialize new and innovative high valueadded products for existing and future customers our investment in the discovery and development of new pesticidal active ingredients relies on discovery of new chemical molecules or biological strains such discovery processes depend on our scientists being able to find new molecules and strains which are novel and outside of patents held by others and such moleculesstrains being efficacious against target pests and our ability to develop those molecules and strains into new products without creating an undue risk to human health and the environment and then meeting applicable regulatory criteria the timeline from active ingredient discovery through full development and product launch averages 810 years depending on local regulatory requirements the complexity and duration of developing new products create risks that product concepts may fail during development or when launched may not meet thencurrent market needs or competitive conditions 

portfolio management risks 

• portfolio management risks  we continuously review our portfolio which includes the evaluation of potential business acquisitions that may strategically fit our business and strategic growth initiatives if we are unable to successfully integrate and develop our acquired businesses we could fail to achieve anticipated synergies which would include expected cost savings and revenue growth failure to achieve these anticipated synergies could materially and adversely affect our financial results in addition to strategic acquisitions we evaluate the diversity of our portfolio in light of our objectives and alignment with our growth strategy in implementing this strategy we may not be successful in separating underperforming or nonstrategic assets the gains or losses on the divestiture of or lost operating income from such assets eg divesting may affect the company’s earnings moreover we may incur asset impairment charges related to acquisitions or divestitures that reduce earnings 

• innovation and intellectual property  our innovation efforts are protected by patents trade secrets and other intellectual property rights that cover many of our current products manufacturing processes and product uses as well as many aspects of our research and development activities supporting our new product pipeline trademarks protect valuable brands associated with our products patents and trademarks are granted by individual jurisdictions and the duration of our patents depends on their respective jurisdictions and payment of annuities our future performance will depend on our ability to address active ingredient composition of matter patent expirations through effective enforcement of our patents that continue to cover key chemical intermediates and process patents as well as portfolio life cycle management particularly for our high value diamide insecticides see diamide growth strategy and patents trademarks and licenses in item 1 for more details if our innovation efforts fail to continue to make process improvements to reduce costs such conditions could impede our competitive position some of our competitors may secure patents on production methods or uses of products that may limit our ability to compete costeffectively 

• enforcement of intellectual property rights  the composition of matter patents on our rynaxypyr® active ingredient is nearing its expiration in several key countries we have a broad estate of additional patents regarding the production of rynaxypyr® active ingredient as well as trademark and data exclusivity protection in certain countries that extend well beyond the active ingredient composition of matter patents see diamide growth strategy and patents 

trademarks and licenses in item 1 we intend to strategically and vigorously enforce our patents and other forms of intellectual property and have done so already against several third parties other third parties may seek to enter markets with infringing products or may find alternative production methods that avoid infringement or we may not be successful in litigating to enforce our patents due to the risks inherent in any litigation patents involve complex factual and legal issues and thus the scope validity or enforceability of any patent claims we have or may obtain cannot be clearly predicted patents may be challenged in the courts as well as in various administrative proceedings before us or foreign patent offices and may be deemed unenforceable invalidated or circumvented we are currently and may in the future be a party to various lawsuits or administrative proceedings involving our patents see patents trademarks and licenses in item 1 such challenges can result in some or all of the claims of the asserted patent being invalidated or deemed unenforceable in such circumstances an adverse patent enforcement decision which could lead to the entry of competing chlorantraniliprole products in relevant markets may materially and adversely impact our financial results 

• erp system stabilization and change governance  in the fourth quarter of 2020 we completed the golive on a single global instance of sap s4 hana there are execution and change management activities that may affect our ability to operationalize and monetize the investment made in the enterprise resource planning erp system not using the system as designed or intended may result in inconsistencies across business units and functions if left unresolved changes made within our global erp without proper governance could disable business transactions and disrupt or halt operations 

• potential tax implications of fmc lithium separation  we have received an opinion from outside counsel to the effect that the spinoff of fmc lithium as a distribution to our stockholders completed in march 2019 qualified as a nontaxable transaction for us federal income tax purposes the opinion is based on certain assumptions and representations as to factual matters from both fmc and fmc lithium as well as certain covenants by those parties the opinion cannot be relied upon if any of the assumptions representations or covenants is incorrect incomplete or inaccurate or is violated in any material respect the opinion of counsel is not binding upon the irs or the courts and there is no assurance that the irs or a court will not take a contrary position it is possible that the irs or a state or local taxing authority could take the position that aforementioned transaction results in the recognition of significant taxable gain by fmc in which case fmc may be subject to material tax liabilities 

financial risks 

• foreign exchange rate risks  we are an international company operating in many countries around the world and thus face foreign exchange rate risks in the normal course of our business we are particularly sensitive to the brazilian real chinese yuan indian rupee euro mexican peso and argentine peso while we engage in hedging and other strategies to mitigate those risks unexpected severe changes in foreign exchange may create risks that could materially and adversely affect our expected performance 

• uncertain tax rates  our future effective tax rates may be materially impacted by numerous items such as a future change in the composition of earnings from foreign and domestic tax jurisdictions as earnings in foreign jurisdictions are typically taxed at different statutory rates than the us federal statutory rate accounting for uncertain tax positions business combinations expiration of statute of limitations or settlement of tax audits changes in valuation allowance changes in tax law currency gains and losses and decisions to repatriate certain future foreign earnings on which us or foreign withholding taxes have not been previously accrued 

• uncertain recoverability of investments in longlived assets  we have significant investments in longlived assets and continually review the carrying value of these assets for recoverability in light of changing market conditions and alternative product sourcing opportunities we may recognize future impairments of longlived assets which could adversely affect our results of operations 

• pension and postretirement plans  our us qualified plan has been fully funded for the last several years and as such the primary investment strategy is a liability hedging approach with an objective of maintaining the funded status of the plan such that the funded status volatility is minimized and the likelihood that we will be required to make significant contributions to the plan is limited the portfolio is comprised of 100 percent fixed income securities and cash our plan assets and obligation under our us qualified plan is in excess of 1 billion additionally obligations related to our pension and postretirement plans reflect certain assumptions to the extent actual experience differs from these assumptions our costs and funding obligations could increase or decrease significantly while we provide other defined benefit defined contribution and postretirement benefits to our employees and retirees our risk if focused on our us qualified plan given its size to our consolidated financial position 

general risk factors 

• market access risk  our results may be affected by changes in distribution channels which could impact our ability to access the market 

• compliance with laws and regulations  the global regulatory environment is becoming increasingly complex and requires more resources to effectively manage which may increase the potential for misunderstanding or misapplication of regulatory standards 

• talent engagement and ethicsculture  the inability to recruit and retain key personnel the unexpected loss of key personnel or other external and internal factors and events could culminate in employee attrition and may adversely affect our operations in addition our future success depends in part on our ability to identify and develop talent to succeed senior management and other key members of the organization we operate in markets where business ethics and local customs may differ from our company standards increasing the risk of impropriety and regulatory enforcement significant effort will likely be required to ensure that the right mix of resources are trained engaged and focused on achieving business objectives while adhering to our core values of safety ethics and compliance 

• economic and political change  our business has been and could continue to be adversely affected by economic and political changes in the markets where we compete including inflation rates recessions trade restrictions tariff increases or potential new tariffs foreign ownership restrictions and economic embargoes imposed by the us or any of the foreign countries in which we do business changes in laws taxation and regulations and the interpretation and application of these laws taxes and regulations restrictions imposed by the us government or foreign governments through exchange controls or taxation policy nationalization or expropriation of property undeveloped property rights and legal systems or political instability other governmental actions and other external factors over which we have no control economic and political conditions within the us and foreign jurisdictions or strained relations between countries could result in fluctuations in demand price volatility loss of property state sponsored cyberattacks supply disruptions or other disruptions an open conflict or war across any region significant to our business could result in plant closures employee displacement and an inability to obtain key supplies and materials the current military conflict between russia and ukraine where we conduct limited operations could disrupt or otherwise adversely impact those operations and related sanctions export controls or other actions that may be initiated by nations including the us the european union or russia eg potential cyberattacks disruption of energy flows etc could adversely affect our business andor our supply chain business partners or customers in other countries beyond russia and ukraine 

• in argentina continued inflation and foreign exchange controls could adversely affect our business realignment of change in regional economic arrangements could have an operational impact on our businesses in china unpredictable enforcement of environmental regulations could result in unanticipated shutdowns in broad geographic areas impacting our contract manufacturers and raw material suppliers 

• information technology security and data privacy risks  as with all enterprise information systems our information technology systems and systems operated by our vendors and third parties could be penetrated by outside parties’ intent on extracting information corrupting information deploying ransomware or disrupting business processes remote and other work arrangements may leave the company more vulnerable to a cyberattack our systems have in the past been and likely will in the future be subject to unauthorized access attempts not timely implementing system updates or security patches could leave our company exposed to security breaches unauthorized access could disrupt our business operations and could result in failures or interruptions in our computer systems lockout from systems due to ransomware or in the loss of assets and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations we have not experienced a significant or material impact from these events to date we may need to expend significant resources to maintain or expand our protective and preventative measures untimely implementation of system updates or security patches could leave our company exposed to security breaches we engage in response planning simulations trainings tabletop exercises and other efforts to mitigate risks associated with cybersecurity breaches of our security measures or the accidental loss inadvertent disclosure or unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential information about the company our employees our vendors or our customers could result in litigation violations of various data privacy regulations in some jurisdictions and also potentially result in a liability while we have taken measures to assess the requirements of and to comply with the rapidly growing data privacy regulations in multiple jurisdictions these measures may be challenged by authorities that regulate datarelated compliance we could incur significant expense in facilitating and responding to investigations and if the measures we have taken prove to be inadequate we could face fines or penalties this could damage our reputation or otherwise harm our business financial condition or results of operations 

• access to debt and capital markets  we rely on cash generated from operations and external financing to fund our growth and working capital needs limitations on access to external financing could adversely affect our operating results moreover interest payments dividends and the expansion of our business or other business opportunities may require significant amounts of capital we believe that our cash from operations and available borrowings under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to meet these needs in the foreseeable future however if we need external financing our access to credit markets and pricing of our capital will be dependent upon maintaining sufficient credit ratings from credit rating agencies and the state of the capital markets generally there can be no assurances that we would be able to obtain equity or debt financing on terms we deem acceptable and it is possible that the cost of any 

financings could increase significantly thereby increasing our expenses and decreasing our net income if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow or raise adequate external financing including as a result of significant disruptions in the global credit markets we could be forced to restrict our operations and growth opportunities which could adversely affect our operating results 

• credit default risks  we may use our existing revolving credit facility to meet our cash needs to the extent available in the event of a default in this credit facility or any of our senior notes we could be required to immediately repay all outstanding borrowings and make cash deposits as collateral for all obligations the facility supports which we may not be able to do any default under any of our credit arrangements could cause a default under many of our other credit agreements and debt instruments without waivers from lenders party to those agreements any such default could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue to operate 

• exposure to global economic conditions  deterioration in the global economy and worldwide credit and foreign exchange markets could adversely affect our business a worsening of global or regional economic conditions or financial markets could adversely affect both our own and our customers ability to meet the terms of sale or our suppliers ability to perform all their commitments to us a slowdown in economic growth in our international markets or a deterioration of credit or foreign exchange markets could adversely affect customers suppliers and our overall business there customers in weakened economies may be unable to purchase our products or it could become more expensive for them to purchase imported products in their local currency or sell their commodities at prevailing international prices and we may be unable to collect receivables from such customers

 item 3 legal proceedings 

like hundreds of other industrial companies we have been named as one of many defendants in asbestosrelated personal injury litigation most of these cases allege personal injury or death resulting from exposure to asbestos in premises of fmc or to asbestoscontaining components installed in machinery or equipment manufactured or sold by discontinued operations the machinery and equipment businesses we owned or operated did not fabricate the asbestoscontaining component parts at issue in the litigation and to this day neither the us occupational safety and health administration nor the environmental protection agency has banned the use of these components further the asbestoscontaining parts for this machinery and equipment were accessible only at the time of infrequent repair and maintenance a few jurisdictions have permitted claims to proceed against equipment manufacturers relating to insulation installed by other companies on such machinery and equipment we believe that overall the claims against fmc are without merit 

as of december 31 2021 there were approximately 9650 premises and product asbestos claims pending against fmc in several jurisdictions since the 1980s approximately 118000 asbestos claims against fmc have been discharged the overwhelming majority of which have been dismissed without any payment to the claimant since the 1980s settlements with claimants have totaled approximately 162 million 

we intend to continue managing these asbestosrelated cases in accordance with our historical experience we have established a reserve for this litigation within our discontinued operations and believe that any exposure of a loss in excess of the established reserve cannot be reasonably estimated our experience has been that the overall trends in asbestos litigation have changed over time over the last several years we have seen changes in the jurisdictions where claims against fmc are being filed and changes in the mix of products named in the various claims because these claim trends have yet to form a predictable pattern we are presently unable to reasonably estimate our asbestos liability with respect to claims that may be filed in the future

• our gross margin of 21717 million increased 1197 million or approximately 6 percent versus last year the increase in gross margin was primarily driven by top line revenue growth which was partially offset by higher costs due to rising input costs and increasing logistics expenses gross margin as a percent of revenue of 43 percent decreased slightly from 44 percent in the prior year period driven by higher costs primarily increases in raw materials packaging and logistics 

• selling general and administrative expenses decreased from 7297 million to 7141 million due to lower transactionrelated charges resulting from the finalization of our worldwide erp system in the first quarter 2021 selling general and administrative expenses excluding transactionrelated charges of 7137 million increased 373 million or approximately 6 percent the increase was the result of resuming normal spending following costsaving measures in the prior year due to the pandemic transactionrelated charges are presented in our adjusted earnings nongaap financial measurement below under the section titled results of operations

2 the income tax expense benefit on corporate special charges income is determined using the applicable rates in the taxing jurisdictions in which the corporate special charge or income occurred and includes both current and deferred income tax expense benefit based on the nature of the nongaap performance measure 

3 we exclude the gaap tax provision including discrete items from the nongaap measure of income and instead include a nongaap tax provision based upon the annual nongaap effective tax rate the gaap tax provision includes certain discrete tax items including but not limited to income tax expenses or benefits that are not related to current year ongoing business operations tax adjustments associated with fluctuations in foreign currency remeasurement of certain foreign operations certain changes in estimates of tax matters related to prior fiscal years certain changes in the realizability of deferred tax assets and changes in tax law management believes excluding these discrete tax items assists investors and securities analysts in understanding the tax provision and the effective tax rate related to ongoing operations thereby providing investors with useful supplemental information about fmcs operational performance

corporate special charges income 

restructuring and other charges income 

our restructuring and other charges income are comprised of restructuring assets disposals and other charges income as described below 

 

1 see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k for more information 

restructuring charges in 2021 primarily consisted of 167 million of charges associated with the integration of the dupont crop protection business which was completed in 2020 except for certain inflight initiatives these charges primarily reflect noncash charges and to a lesser extent remaining severance restructuring charges associated with the dupont program are largely complete and any future charges are not expected to be material there were other restructuring charges of 134 million related to various actions to improve organizational structure as well as regional alignment activities which primarily included the move of our european headquarters types of costs primarily relate to facilityrelated shut down costs including asset impairments as well as employeerelated costs

nonoperating pension and postretirement charges income 

2021 vs 2020 

the charge for 2021 was 200 million compared to 212 million in 2020 and was not a material change 

2020 vs 2019 

the charge for 2020 was 212 million compared to 81 million in 2019 the increase in nonoperating pension and post retirement charges income is attributable to the continued approach of using the smoothed market related value of assets mrva as opposed to the actual fair value of plan assets in the determination of 2020 expense this continued approach will create some volatility in our nonoperating periodic pension cost since our qualified pension plan is 100 percent fixed income securities 

transactionrelated charges

1 tax adjustments in 2021 2020 and 2019 are materially attributable to the effects of certain changes in various tax reserves see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements included within this form 10k 

the primary drivers for the fluctuations in the effective tax rate for each period are provided in the table above excluding the items in the table above the changes in the nongaap effective tax rate were primarily due to the impact of geographic mix of earnings among our global subsidiaries see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements included within this form 10k for additional details related to the provisions for income taxes on continuing operations as well as items that significantly impact our effective tax rate 

discontinued operations net of income taxes 

our discontinued operations primarily reflect adjustments to retained liabilities from previously discontinued operations and include environmental liabilities other postretirement benefit liabilities selfinsurance longterm obligations related to legal proceedings and historical restructuring activities discontinued operations also includes the results of our discontinued fmc lithium business in periods up to its disposition on march 1 2019 see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included within this form 10k for additional details on our discontinued operations 

2021 vs 2020 

discontinued operations net of income taxes represented a loss of 682 million in 2021 compared to a loss of 283 million in 2020 the loss during both periods was primarily due to adjustments related to the retained liabilities from our previously discontinued operations offsetting the losses in 2021 and 2020 were the gain on sales of land in our discontinued sites of 15 million and 24 million net of taxes respectively 

2020 vs 2019

net income loss 

2021 vs 2020 

net income increased to 7340 million from 5506 million the higher results were driven by higher revenues and margins as well as lower selling general and administrative costs primarily resulting from lower transactionrelated charges additionally we had lower restructuring and other charges of 242 million interest expense net of 201 million and tax expense of 593 million these reductions were offset by higher discontinued operations charges of 399 million resulting from higher adjustments to retained liabilities and lower gains from real estate sales 

the only difference between net income loss and net income loss attributable to fmc stockholders is noncontrolling interest which period over period is immaterial 

2020 vs 2019 

net income loss increased to 5506 million from 4802 million the higher results were driven by a slight increase in revenue as well as costsaving measures in selling general and administrative and research and development expenses in response to the pandemic restructuring and other charges were 388 million lower versus prior year and discontinued operations expense decreased 350 million compared to the prior year these increases to income were partially offset by 

higher tax expense and higher provision for income taxes of 394 million and higher nonoperating pension and postretirement charges of 131 million

adjusted ebitda nongaap 

2021 vs 2020 

adjusted ebitda of 13242 million increased 738 million or approximately 6 percent versus the prior year period the increase was due to higher volumes and higher pricing which accounted for approximately 20 percent and 3 percent increases respectively these factors more than offset cost increases in raw materials packaging and logistics costs and to a lesser extent the reversal of some temporary cost savings in the prior year which had an unfavorable impact of approximately 15 percent and foreign currency fluctuations which had an unfavorable impact of approximately 2 percent on adjusted ebitda 

2020 vs 2019 

adjusted ebitda of 12504 million increased 299 million or approximately 2 percent versus the prior year period the increase was due to higher volumes higher pricing and strong cost management which accounted for approximately 9 percent 9 percent and 6 percent increases respectively these factors offset foreign currency fluctuations which had an unfavorable impact of approximately 22 percent on adjusted ebitda 

liquidity and capital resources 

as a global agricultural sciences company we require cash primarily for seasonal working capital needs capital expenditures and return of capital to shareholders we plan to meet these liquidity needs through available cash cash generated from operations commercial paper issuances and borrowings under our committed revolving credit facility as well as other liquidity facilities and in certain instances access to debt capital markets we believe our strong financial standing and credit ratings will ensure adequate access to the debt capital markets on favorable conditions information involving our material cash requirements is detailed below

outstanding debt 

at december 31 2021 we had total debt of 31725 million as compared to 32678 million at december 31 2020 total debt included 27317 million and 29295 million of longterm debt excluding current portions of 845 million and 936 million at december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively on may 26 2021 we amended our revolving credit agreement on november 22 2021 we borrowed 10 billion under our previously announced senior unsecured term loan facility the proceeds were used to pay off our 2017 term loan facility and senior notes maturing in 2022 as of december 31 2021 we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements included within this form 10k for further details we remain committed to solid investment grade credit metrics and expect fullyear average leverage to be in line with this commitment in 2021 

the decrease in longterm debt was primarily due to paying down 200 million of the 2021 term loan facility in december 

our shortterm debt consists of foreign borrowings and borrowings under our commercial paper program foreign borrowings increased from 984 million at december 31 2020 to 1122 million at december 31 2021 while outstanding commercial paper increased from 1463 million at december 31 2020 to 2441 million at december 31 2021 we provide parentcompany guarantees to lending institutions providing credit to our foreign subsidiaries

access to credit and future liquidity and funding needs 

at december 31 2021 our remaining borrowing capacity under our credit facility was 10934 million see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements included within this form 10k for discussion of the 2021 term loan agreement as well as the amendments to the revolving credit facility and term loan agreements undertaken in the current year our commercial paper program allows us to borrow at rates generally more favorable than those available under our credit facility at december 31 2021 we had 2441 million borrowings outstanding under the commercial paper program at an average borrowing rate of 045 percent our commercial paper balances fluctuate from year to year depending on working capital needs 

working capital initiatives 

the company works with suppliers to optimize payment terms and conditions on accounts payable to improve working capital and cash flows the company offers to a select group of suppliers a voluntary supply chain finance “scf” program with a global financial institution the suppliers at their sole discretion may sell their receivables to the financial institution based on terms negotiated between them our obligations to our suppliers are not impacted by our suppliers’ decisions to sell under these arrangements agreements under these supplier financing programs are recorded within accounts payable in our consolidated balance sheets and the associated payments are included in operating activities within our consolidated statements of cash flows we do not believe that changes in the availability of the supply chain finance program would have a significant impact on our liquidity 

from time to time the company may sell receivables on a nonrecourse basis to thirdparty financial institutions these sales are normally driven by specific market conditions including but not limited to foreign exchange environments customer credit management as well as other factors where the receivables may lay 

we account for these transactions as sales which result in a reduction in accounts receivables because the agreements transfer effective control and risk related to the receivables to the buyers the net cash proceeds received are presented within cash provided by operating activities within our consolidated statements of cash flows the cost of factoring these accounts receivables is recorded as an expense within the consolidated statements of income and has been inconsequential during each reporting period 

commitments 

we provide guarantees to financial institutions on behalf of certain customers principally customers in brazil for their seasonal borrowing the total of these guarantees was 2159 million at december 31 2021 these guarantees arise during the ordinary course of business from relationships with customers and nonconsolidated affiliates nonperformance by the guaranteed party triggers the obligation requiring us to make payments to the beneficiary of the guarantee based on our experience these types of guarantees have not had a material effect on our consolidated financial position or on our liquidity our expectation is that future payment or performance related to the nonperformance of others is considered unlikely 

in connection with certain of our property and asset sales and divestitures we have agreed to indemnify the buyer for certain liabilities including environmental contamination and taxes that occurred prior to the date of sale our indemnification obligations with respect to these liabilities may be indefinite as to duration and may or may not be subject to a deductible minimum claim amount or cap in cases where it is not possible for us to predict the likelihood that a claim will be made or to make a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential loss or range of loss no specific liability has been recorded if triggered we may be able to recover certain of the indemnity payments from third parties in cases where it is possible we have recorded a specific liability within our reserve for discontinued operations refer to note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included within this form 10k for further details 

taxes pension environmental and other discontinued liabilities

we have lease arrangements for equipment and facilities including office spaces it equipment transportation equipment machinery equipment furniture and fixtures and plant and facilities as of december 31 2021 we had fixed lease payment obligations of 2172 million with 292 million payable within 12 months

statement of cash flows 

cash provided required by operating activities was 8986 million 7368 million and 5556 million for 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively 

the table below presents the components of net cash provided required by operating activities of continuing operations 



 

1 the change in trade receivables in all periods include the impacts of seasonality and the receivable build intrinsic in our business the change in cash flows related to trade receivables in 2021 was driven by timing of collections as well as higher sales year over year collection timing is more pronounced in certain countries such as brazil where there may be terms significantly longer than the rest of our business additionally timing of collection is impacted as amounts for all periods include carryover balances remaining to be collected in latin america where collection periods are measured in months rather than weeks during 2021 we collected approximately 1118 million of receivables in brazil 

2 advance payments are typically received in the fourth quarter of each year primarily in our north america operations as revenue associated with advance payments is recognized generally in the first half of each year following the seasonality of that business as shipments are made and title ownership and risk of loss pass to the customer the change in 2021 was primarily related to substantially higher overall payments received due to a strong north america season 

3 these rebates are primarily associated within north america and to a lesser extent brazil and in north america generally settle in the fourth quarter of each year given the end of the respective crop cycle the changes in 2021 compared to 2020 are mostly associated with higher north america revenue primarily volume related as well as with the mix in sales eligible for rebates and incentives and timing of certain rebate payments 

4 the change in cash flows during 2021 reflect the inventory build required to meet business demand and to help manage supply chain volatility as well as higher input costs changes in inventory in 2019 are a result of inventory levels being adjusted to take into consideration the change in market conditions 

5 the change in cash flows related to accounts payable in 2021 2020 and 2019 is primarily due to timing of payments made to suppliers and vendors as well as in 2021 in line with the inventory build

10 interest payments were lower during 2021 largely due to lower foreign debt balances and rates as well as lower libor rates in the us 

11 amounts shown in the chart represent net tax payments of our continuing operations the increase in net tax payments in 2021 is primarily attributable to the 2021 remittance of previously deferred income tax payments in various jurisdictions as a result of the covid pandemic tax payments in 2019 primarily represent the payments of tax attributable to the nufarm limited sale transition tax and tax payments related to the acquired dupont crop protection business

cash provided required by investing activities of discontinued operations was 197 million 311 million and 92 million for 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively 

cash provided by investing activities of discontinued operations in 2021 represents the proceeds from the sale of land of our discontinued sites this resulted in a gain recognized within discontinued operations of approximately 154 million net of taxes 

cash provided by investing activities of discontinued operations in 2020 and 2019 represents the proceeds of approximately 31 million and 26 million from the sale of our two parcels of land of our discontinued site in newark california these sales resulted in a gain recognized within discontinued operations in each period of approximately 24 million and 21 million net of taxes respectively in 2019 this was partially offset by capital expenditures of our discontinued fmc lithium segment 

cash provided required by financing activities was 7479 million 2503 million and 870 million in 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively 

the change in cash required by financing activities in 2021 is primarily driven due to the payment of long term debt and the increase in share repurchases under our publicly announced program 

the change in cash required by financing activities in 2020 is primarily driven by the prior year proceeds from the senior notes and higher dividend payments offset by a reduction in the payment of long term debt and a reduction of repurchases of common stock under our publicly announced program 

the change in cash required by financing activities in 2019 is primarily due to the proceeds from the senior notes offset by cash outflows including higher repurchases of common stock repayment of longterm debt and higher dividend payments in 2019 as compared to the prior period 

cash provided required by financing activities of discontinued operations was zero  zero and 372 million in 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively 

cash required by financing activities of discontinued operations in 2019 represents debt repayments on fmc lithiums external debt as well as cash payments associated with its separation 

free cash flow 

we define free cash flow a nongaap financial measure as all cash inflows and outflows excluding those related to financing activities such as debt repayments dividends and share repurchases and acquisition related investing activities free cash flow is calculated as all cash from operating activities reduced by spending for capital additions and other investing activities as well as legacy and transformation spending therefore our calculation of free cash flow will almost always result in a lower amount than cash from operating activities from continuing operations the most directly comparable us gaap measure however the free cash flow measure is consistent with managements assessment of operating cash flow performance and we believe it provides a useful basis for investors and securities analysts about the cash generated by routine business operations including capital expenditures in addition to assessing our ability to repay debt fund acquisitions including cost and equity method investments and return capital to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends 

our use of free cash flow has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for an analysis of our results under us gaap first free cash flow is not a substitute for cash provided required by operating activities of continuing operations as it is not a measure of cash available for discretionary expenditures since we have nondiscretionary obligations primarily debt service that are not deducted from the measure second other companies may calculate free cash flow or similarly titled nongaap financial measures differently or may use other measures to evaluate their performance all of which could reduce the usefulness of free cash flow as a tool for comparison additionally the utility of free cash flow is further limited as it does not reflect our future contractual commitments and does not represent the total increase or decrease in our cash balance for a given period because of these and other limitations free cash flow should be considered along with cash provided required by operating activities of continuing operations and other comparable financial measures prepared and presented in accordance with us gaap 

the table below presents a reconciliation of free cash flow from the most directly comparable us gaap measure 

free cash flow reconciliation 

 

1 represents payments for legal and professional fees associated with the dupont crop protection business acquisition in addition to costs related to integrating the dupont crop protection business see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements included within this form 10k for more information 

2 adjusted cash from operations is defined as cash provided required by operating activities of continuing operations excluding the effects of transactionrelated cash flows which are included within legacy and transformation 

3 components of cash provided required by investing activities of continuing operations refer to the below discussion for further details 

4 cash spending associated with contract manufacturers was 188 million 174 million and 517 million for the years ended december 31 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively 

5 refer to the above discussion for further details 

6 includes our legacy liabilities such as environmental remediation and other legal matters and our discontinued investing activities that are reported in discontinued operations it also includes business integration costs associated with the dupont crop protection business acquisition and the implementation of our new sap system 

2022 cash flow outlook 

our cash needs for 2022 include operating cash requirements which are impacted by contributions to our pension plan as well as environmental asset retirement obligation and restructuring spending capital expenditures and legacy and transformation spending as well as mandatory payments of debt dividend payments and share repurchases we plan to meet our liquidity needs through available cash cash generated from operations commercial paper issuances and borrowings under our committed revolving credit facility at december 31 2021 our remaining borrowing capacity under our credit facility was 10934 million 

we expect 2022 free cash flow nongaap to fall within a range of approximately 515 million to 735 million at the midpoint of the range there is a reduction year over year driven by reduced adjusted cash from operations primarily due to working capital growth and higher capital expenditures we expect a year over year increase in capital additions as we expand capacity to meet growing demand especially for our new products 

although we provide a forecast for free cash flow a nongaap financial measure we are not able to forecast the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with us gaap which is cash provided required by operating activities of continuing operations certain elements of the composition of the us gaap amount are not predictable making it impractical for us to forecast such elements include but are not limited to restructuring acquisition charges and discontinued operations as a result no us gaap outlook is provided 

cash from operating activities of continuing operations 

we expect equal or lower cash from operating activities excluding the effects of transactionrelated cash flows to be in the range of approximately 750 million to 910 million working capital growth reflects our current expectations of a return to more normal advance payment levels in north america among other factors negatively impacting working capital in 2022 transactionrelated cash flows are included within legacy and transformation which is consistent with how we evaluate our business operations from a cash flow standpoint see below for further discussion cash from operating activities includes cash requirements related to our pension plans environmental sites restructuring and asset retirement obligations taxes and interest on borrowings 

pension 

we do not expect to make any voluntary cash contributions to our us qualified defined benefit pension plan in 2022 the plan is slightly overfunded and our portfolio is comprised of 100 percent fixed income securities and cash our investment strategy is a liability hedging approach with an objective of maintaining the funded status of the plan such that the funded status volatility is minimized and the likelihood that we will be required to make significant contributions to the plan is limited 

environmental 

projected 2022 spending net of recoveries includes approximately 25 million to 35 million of net environmental remediation spending for our sites accounted for within continuing operations environmental obligations for continuing operations primarily represent obligations at shut down or abandoned facilities within businesses that do not meet the criteria for presentation as discontinued operations 

projected 2022 spending net of recoveries includes approximately 45 million to 55 million of net environmental remediation spending for our discontinued sites which is part of legacy and transformation noted below these projections include spending as a result of a settlement reached in the second quarter of 2019 at our middleport new york site the settlement will result in spending 10 million maximum per year on average until the remediation is complete 

total projected 2022 environmental spending inclusive of sites accounted for within both continuing operations and discontinued sites is expected to be in the range of 70 million to 90 million 

restructuring and asset retirement obligations 

we expect to make payments of approximately 30 to 40 million in 2022 of which approximately 10 million is related to exit and disposal costs as a result of our previous decision in 2019 to exit sales of all carbofuran formulations including furadan® insecticidenematicide as well as curaterr® insecticidenematicide and any other brands used with carbofuran products 

capital additions and other investing activities 

projected 2022 capital expenditures and expenditures related to contract manufacturers are expected to be in the range of approximately 145 million to 175 million the spending is mainly driven by continuing to expand capacity to meet growing demand especially for our new products expenditures related to contract manufacturers are included within other investing activities 

legacy and transformation 

projected 2022 legacy and transformation spending are expected to be in the range of approximately 30 million to 60 million this is primarily driven by environmental remediation spending for our discontinued sites discussed above and other legacy liabilities we completed the integration of the dupont crop protection business in 2020 other than the completion of certain inflight initiatives associated with the finalization of our worldwide erp system in early 2021 as such transformation spending in 2022 is not expected to be material 

share repurchases 

during the year ended december 31 2021 40 million shares were repurchased under the publicly announced repurchase program for approximately 400 million at december 31 2021 approximately 150 million remained unused under our boardauthorized repurchase program however in february 2022 the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to 1 billion of the companys common stock the 1 billion share repurchase program is replacing in its entirety the previous authorization this repurchase program does not include a specific timetable or price targets and may be suspended or terminated at any time shares may be purchased through open market or privately negotiated transactions at the discretion of management based on its evaluation of market conditions and other factors we also reacquire shares from time to time from employees in connections with vesting exercise and forfeiture of awards under our equity compensation plans 

we intend to purchase between 500 million to 600 million of our common shares in 2022 

dividends 

on january 20 2022 we paid dividends aggregating 668 million to our shareholders of record as of december 31 2021 this amount is included in accrued and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2021 for the years ended december 31 2021 2020 and 2019 we paid 2472 million 2285 million and 2103 million in dividends respectively we expect to continue to make quarterly dividend payments future cash dividends as always will depend on a variety of factors including earnings capital requirements financial condition general economic conditions and other factors considered relevant by us and is subject to final determination by our board of directors

climate change 

as a global corporate citizen we are concerned about the consequences of climate change and will take prudent and cost effective actions that reduce green house gas ghg emissions to the atmosphere 

fmc is committed to continuing to do its part to address climate change and its impacts our 2030 intensity reduction targets for energy and greenhouse gas emissions are both 25 percent from our 2018 baseline year fmc has been reporting its ghg emissions and mitigation strategy to cdp formerly carbon disclosure project since 2016 fmc detailed the business risks and opportunities we have due to climate change and its impacts in our cdp climate change reports fmc received a b  in the cdp climate change questionnaire in 2021 as part of fmc’s continued commitment to address climate change in august of 2021 fmc announced its goal to achieve netzero ghg emissions by 2035 fmc fmc committed to the science based target initiative sbti netzero standard aligned with keeping the global temperature at 15°c above preindustrial times fmc anticipates submitting targets to sbti in the first quarter of 2022 

even as we take action to control the release of ghgs additional warming is anticipated longterm higher average global temperatures could result in induced changes in natural resources growing seasons precipitation patterns weather patterns species distributions water availability sea levels and biodiversity these impacts could cause changes in supplies of raw materials used to maintain fmc’s production capacity and could lead to possible increased sourcing costs depending on how 

pervasive the climate impacts are in the different geographic locations experiencing changes in natural resources fmc’s customers could be impacted demand for fmc’s products could increase if our products meet our customers’ needs to adapt to climate change impacts or decrease if our products do not meet their needs in addition extreme weather events attributable to climate change may result in among other things physical damage to our property and equipment and interruptions to our supply chain 

though the nature of these events makes them difficult to predict to respond to the uncertainty and better understand our risks and opportunities as they relate to climate change we are conducting climate related scenario analyses consistent with the recommendations provided by the taskforce for climaterelated financial disclosures tcfd as part of the tcfd scenario analysis we are currently evaluating the potential risks at operation sites leveraging scenarios published by the international energy agency iea and the united nations’ intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc results of this analysis will help determine where strategic capital could be deployed to address risks and opportunities 

to lessen fmc’s overall environmental footprint we have taken actions to increase the energy efficiency in our manufacturing sites we have also committed to new 2030 goals to reduce our water use intensity in highrisk areas by 20 percent and to maintain our 2018 waste disposed intensity which otherwise would increase by 55 percent due to expected growth and shifts in production mix along with our ambitious netzero ghg emissions goal fmc will also be reevaluating our waste and water reduction targets in order to set more aggressive goals 

in our product portfolio we see market opportunities for our products to address climate change and its impacts for example fmcs agricultural solutions can help customers increase yield energy and water efficiency and decrease greenhouse gas emissions our solutions can also help growers adapt to more unpredictable growing conditions and the effects these types of threats have on crops fmc has committed to invest 100 percent of our research and development pipeline budget to developing sustainable products and solutions for future use 

we are improving existing products and developing new platforms and technologies that help mitigate impacts of climate change these opportunities could lead to new products and services for our existing and potential customers beyond our products and operations fmc recognizes that energy consumption throughout our supply chain can impact climate change and product costs fmc has committed to netzero ghg emissions across our entire value which includes reductions across our entire supply chain therefore we will actively work with our entire value chain  suppliers contractors and customers  to improve their energy efficiencies and to reduce their ghg emissions 

we continue to follow legislative and regulatory developments regarding climate change because the regulation of greenhouse gases depending on their nature and scope could subject some of our manufacturing operations to additional costs or limits on operations in december 2015 195 countries at the united nations climate change conference in paris reached an agreement to reduce ghgs in november 2021 the above parties reconvened at the united nations climate change conference in glasgow to reaffirm the paris agreement and urged countries to reach 15°c level reductions by the 2030s to lessen the impacts of climate change although it remains to be seen how and when each of these countries will implement this agreement fmc has echoed this commitment with our netzero by 2035 goal which allows us to do our part in reaching 15°c level reductions 

fmc will actively manage climate risks and incorporate them in our decision making as indicated in our responses to the cdp climate change module fmc will also use recommendations outlined in the tcfd to evaluate potential risks and opportunities and incorporate these into our overall strategy and risk management 

some of our foreign operations are subject to national or local energy management or climate change regulation such as our plant in denmark that is subject to the eu emissions trading scheme at present that plant’s emissions are below its designated cap 

in december 2019 the european commission approved the european green deal with the goal of making the eu carbon neutral by 2050 the green deal includes investment plans and a roadmap to fight against climate change fmc is closely following updates and the discussion surrounding the green deal the costs of complying with possible future requirements are difficult to estimate at this time 

future ghg regulatory requirements may result in increased costs of energy additional capital costs for emissions control or new equipment andor costs associated with cap and trade or carbon taxes we are currently monitoring regulatory developments the costs of complying with possible future climate change requirements are difficult to estimate at this time

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles us gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses we have described our accounting policies in note 1 principal accounting policies and related financial information to our consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k we have reviewed these accounting policies identifying those that we believe to be critical to the preparation and understanding of our consolidated financial statements we have reviewed these critical accounting policies with the audit committee of the board of directors critical accounting policies are central to our presentation of results of operations and financial condition in accordance with us gaap and require management to make estimates and judgments on certain matters we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience current conditions and other reasonable factors our most critical accounting estimates and assumptions which are those that involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and have had or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations include impairments and valuation of longlived and indefinitelived assets pension and other postretirement benefits and the allowance for credit losses on our trade receivables additional critical accounting policies are included within the list below 

revenue recognition and trade receivables 

we recognize revenue when or as we satisfy our performance obligation which is when the customer obtains control of the good or service rebates due to customers are accrued as a reduction of revenue in the same period that the related sales are recorded based on the contract terms refer to note 3 to our consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k for more information 

we record amounts billed for shipping and handling fees as revenue costs incurred for shipping and handling are recorded as costs of sales and services amounts billed for sales and use taxes valueadded taxes and certain excise and other specific transactional taxes imposed on revenueproducing transactions are presented on a net basis and excluded from sales in the consolidated income statements we record a liability until remitted to the respective taxing authority 

we periodically enter into prepayment arrangements with customers and receive advance payments for product to be delivered in future periods these advance payments are recorded as deferred revenue and classified as advance payments from customers on the consolidated balance sheet revenue associated with advance payments is recognized as shipments are made and transfer of control to the customer takes place 

trade receivables consist of amounts owed to us from customer sales and are recorded when revenue is recognized the allowance for trade receivables represents our best estimate of the probable losses associated with potential customer defaults in developing our allowance for trade receivables we use a two stage process which includes calculating a general formula to develop an allowance to appropriately address the uncertainty surrounding collection risk of our entire portfolio and specific allowances for customers where the risk of collection has been reasonably identified either due to liquidity constraints or disputes over contractual terms and conditions 

our method of calculating the general formula consists of estimating the recoverability of trade receivables based on historical experience current collection trends and external business factors such as economic factors including regional bankruptcy rates and political factors our analysis of trade receivable collection risk is performed quarterly and the allowance is adjusted accordingly 

we also hold longterm receivables that represent longterm customer receivable balances related to pastdue accounts which are not expected to be collected within the current year our policy for the review of the allowance for these receivables is consistent with the discussion in the preceding paragraph above on trade receivables therefore on an ongoing basis we continue to evaluate the credit quality of our longterm receivables utilizing aging of receivables collection experience and writeoffs as well as existing economic conditions to determine if an additional allowance is necessary 

we believe our allowance for credit losses is a critical accounting estimate because the underlying assumptions used for the reserve can change from time to time and potentially have a material impact on our results of operations based on a combination of historical trends as well as current economic factors we apply judgment to reserve for expected credit losses in the period in which the sale is recorded a substantial change in the operating environments in any of our key locations driven by weather conditions industry specific events and macroeconomic conditions may result in actual adjustments that differ from our original assumptions 

environmental obligations and related recoveries 

we provide for environmentalrelated obligations when they are probable and amounts can be reasonably estimated where the available information is sufficient to estimate the amount of liability that estimate has been used where the information is only sufficient to establish a range of probable liability and no point within the range is more likely than any other the lower end of the range has been used 

estimated obligations to remediate sites that involve oversight by the united states environmental protection agency epa or similar government agencies are generally accrued no later than when a record of decision rod or equivalent is issued or upon completion of a remedial investigationfeasibility study rifs or equivalent that is submitted by us to the appropriate government agency or agencies estimates are reviewed quarterly by our environmental remediation management as well as by financial and legal management and if necessary adjusted as additional information becomes available the estimates can change substantially as additional information becomes available regarding the nature or extent of site contamination required remediation methods and other actions by or against governmental agencies or private parties 

our environmental liabilities for continuing and discontinued operations are principally for costs associated with the remediation andor study of sites at which we are alleged to have released hazardous substances into the environment such costs principally include among other items rifs site remediation costs of operation and maintenance of the remediation plan management costs fees to outside law firms and consultants for work related to the environmental effort and future monitoring costs estimated site liabilities are determined based upon existing remediation laws and technologies specific site consultants’ engineering studies or by extrapolating experience with environmental issues at comparable sites 

included in our environmental liabilities are costs for the operation maintenance and monitoring of site remediation plans omm such reserves are based on our best estimates for these omm plans over time we may incur omm costs in excess of these reserves however we are unable to reasonably estimate an amount in excess of our recorded reserves because we cannot reasonably estimate the period for which such omm plans will need to be in place or the future annual cost of such remediation as conditions at these environmental sites change over time such additional omm costs could be significant in total but would be incurred over an extended period of years 

included in the environmental reserve balance other assets balance and disclosure of reasonably possible loss contingencies are amounts from thirdparty insurance policies which we believe are probable of recovery 

provisions for environmental costs are reflected in income net of probable and estimable recoveries from named potentially responsible parties prps or other third parties in the fourth quarter of 2019 we increased our reserves for the pocatello tribal matter by 728 million which represents both the historical and discounted present value of future annual use permit fees as well as the associated legal costs see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements included within this form 10k for further information all other environmental provisions incorporate inflation and are not discounted to their present value 

in calculating and evaluating the adequacy of our environmental reserves we have taken into account the joint and several liability imposed by comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla and the analogous state laws on all prps and have considered the identity and financial condition of the other prps at each site to the extent possible we have also considered the identity and financial condition of other third parties from whom recovery is anticipated as well as the status of our claims against such parties although we are unable to forecast the ultimate contributions of prps and other third parties with absolute certainty the degree of uncertainty with respect to each party is taken into account when determining the environmental reserve by adjusting the reserve to reflect the facts and circumstances on a sitebysite basis our liability includes our best estimate of the costs expected to be paid before the consideration of any potential recoveries from third parties we believe that any recorded recoveries related to prps are realizable in all material respects recoveries are recorded as either an offset in environmental liabilities continuing and discontinued or as other assets in our consolidated balance sheets in accordance with us accounting literature 

see note 12 to our consolidated financial statements included within this form 10k for changes in estimates associated with our environmental obligations 

impairments and valuation of longlived and indefinitelived assets 

our longlived assets primarily include property plant and equipment goodwill and intangible assets the assets and liabilities of acquired businesses are measured at their estimated fair values at the dates of acquisition the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired including identified intangibles is recorded as goodwill the determination and allocation of fair value to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is based on various assumptions and valuation methodologies requiring considerable management judgment including estimates based on historical information current market data and future expectations although the estimates were deemed reasonable by management based on information available at the dates of acquisition those estimates are inherently uncertain 

we test for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the net book value of our property plant and equipment may not be recoverable from the estimated undiscounted expected future cash flows expected to result from their use and eventual disposition in cases where the estimated undiscounted expected future cash flows are less than net book value an impairment loss is recognized equal to the amount by which the net book value exceeds the estimated fair value of assets which is based on discounted cash flows at the lowest level determinable the estimated cash flows reflect our assumptions about selling prices volumes costs and market conditions over a reasonable period of time 

we perform an annual impairment test of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets in the third quarter of each year or more frequently whenever an event or change in circumstances occurs that would require reassessment of the recoverability of those assets in performing our evaluation we assess qualitative factors such as overall financial performance of our reporting units anticipated changes in industry and market structure competitive environments planned capacity and cost factors such as raw material prices 

we estimate the fair value of the reporting unit using a discounted cash flow model as part of the income approach we assess the appropriateness of projected financial information by comparing projected revenue growth rates profit margins and tax rates to historical performance industry data and selected guideline companies where applicable our key assumptions include future cash flow projections tax rates terminal growth rates and discount rates 

we employ the relief from royalty method of the income approach to value our brand portfolios indefinitelived intangible assets the principle behind this method is that the value of the intangible asset is equal to the present value of the aftertax royalty savings attributable to owning the intangible asset primary inputs and key assumptions include revenue forecasts attributable to each portfolio royalty rates considering both external market data and internal arrangements tax rates terminal growth rates and discount rates 

estimating the fair value requires significant judgment and actual results may differ due to changes in the overall market conditions we believe we have applied reasonable assumptions which considers both internal and external factors 

we believe that an accounting estimate relating to asset impairment is a critical accounting estimate because of the inherent uncertainty within the underlying assumptions an adverse change in any of these assumptions could result in an impairment charge which would potentially have a material impact on our results of operations 

based on the annual assessment we concluded the fair value of the reporting unit substantially exceeded the carrying value additionally the fair value of each indefinitelived intangible asset exceeded its carrying value by at least 20 

see note 9 to our consolidated financial statements included within this form 10k for charges associated with longlived asset disposal costs and the activity associated with the restructuring reserves 

pension and other postretirement benefits 

we provide qualified and nonqualified defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans as well as postretirement health care and life insurance benefit plans to our employees and retirees the costs benefits and obligations related to these benefits reflect key assumptions related to general economic conditions including interest discount rates healthcare cost trend rates expected rates of return on plan assets and the rates of compensation increase for employees the costs benefits and obligations for these benefit programs are also affected by other assumptions such as average retirement age mortality employee turnover and plan participation to the extent our plans’ actual experience as influenced by changing economic and financial market conditions or by changes to our own plans’ demographics differs from these assumptions the costs and obligations for providing these benefits as well as the plans’ funding requirements could increase or decrease when actual results differ from our assumptions the difference is typically recognized over future periods in addition the unrealized gains and losses related to our pension and postretirement benefit obligations may also affect periodic benefit costs benefits in future periods 

we use several assumptions and statistical methods to determine the asset values used to calculate both the expected rate of return on assets component of pension cost and to calculate our plans’ funding requirements the expected rate of return on plan assets is based on a marketrelated value of assets that recognizes investment gains and losses over a fiveyear period we use an actuarial value of assets to determine our plans’ funding requirements the actuarial value of assets must be within a certain range high or low of the actual market value of assets and is adjusted accordingly 

we select the discount rate used to calculate pension and other postretirement obligations based on a review of available yields on highquality corporate bonds as of the measurement date in selecting a discount rate as of december 31 2021 we placed particular emphasis on a discount rate yieldcurve provided by our actuary this yieldcurve when populated with projected cash flows that represent the expected timing and amount of our plans benefit payments produced an effective discount rate of 284 percent for our us qualified plan 218 percent for our us nonqualified and 239 percent for our us other postretirement benefit plans 

the discount rates used to determine projected benefit obligation at our december 31 2021 and 2020 measurement dates for the us qualified plan were 284 percent and 249 percent respectively the effect of the change in the discount rate from 249 percent to 284 percent at december 31 2021 resulted in a 557 million decrease to our us qualified pension benefit obligations the effect of the change in the discount rate used to determine net annual benefit cost income from 322 percent at december 31 2020 to 249 percent at december 31 2021 resulted in a 44 million decrease to the 2021 us qualified pension expense 

the change in discount rate from 249 percent at december 31 2020 to 284 percent at december 31 2021 was attributable to an increase in yields on high quality corporate bonds with cash flows matching the timing and amount of our expected future benefit payments between the 2020 and 2021 measurement dates using the december 31 2021 and 2020 yield curves our us qualified plan cash flows produced a single weightedaverage discount rate of approximately 284 percent and 249 percent respectively 

in developing the assumption for the longterm rate of return on assets for our us plan we take into consideration the technical analysis performed by our outside actuaries including historical market returns information on the assumption for longterm real returns by asset class inflation assumptions and expectations for standard deviation related to these best estimates our longterm rate of return for the fiscal year ended december 31 2021 2020 and 2019 was 225 percent 300 percent and 425 percent respectively 

for the sensitivity of our pension costs to incremental changes in assumptions see our discussion below 

sensitivity analysis related to key pension and postretirement benefit assumptions 

a onehalf percent increase in the assumed discount rate would have decreased pension and other postretirement benefit obligations by 661 million and 726 million at december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively and increased pension and other postretirement benefit costs by 04 million zero and 06 million for 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively a onehalf percent decrease in the assumed discount rate would have increased pension and other postretirement benefit obligations by 721 million and 793 million at december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively and decreased pension and other postretirement benefit costs by 04 million in 2021 01 million in 2020 and increased costs by 05 million in 2019 

a onehalf percent increase in the assumed expected longterm rate of return on plan assets would have decreased pension costs by 63 million 62 million and 63 million for 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively a onehalf percent decrease in the assumed longterm rate of return on plan assets would have increased pension costs by 63 million 62 million and 63 million for 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively 

further details on our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and net periodic benefit costs benefits are found in note 15 to our consolidated financial statements in this form 10k 

income taxes 

we have recorded a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets in certain jurisdictions to the amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized in assessing the need for this allowance we have considered a number of factors including future taxable income the jurisdictions in which such income is earned and our ongoing tax planning strategies in the event that we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period such determination was made similarly should we conclude that we would be able to realize certain deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase income in the period such determination was made 

additionally we file income tax returns in the us federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions certain income tax returns for fmc entities taxable in the us and significant foreign jurisdictions are open for examination and adjustment we assess our income tax positions and record a liability for all years open to examination based upon our evaluation of the facts circumstances and information available at the reporting date for those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained we have recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information we adjust these liabilities if necessary upon the completion of tax audits or changes in tax law 

see note 13 to our consolidated financial statements included within this form 10k for additional discussion surrounding income taxes 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

our earnings cash flows and financial position are exposed to market risks relating to fluctuations in commodity prices interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates our policy is to minimize exposure to our cash flow over time caused by changes in commodity interest and currency exchange rates to accomplish this we have implemented a controlled program of risk management consisting of appropriate derivative contracts entered into with major financial institutions 

the analysis below presents the sensitivity of the market value of our financial instruments to selected changes in market rates and prices the range of changes chosen reflects our view of changes that are reasonably possible over a oneyear period market value estimates are based on the present value of projected future cash flows considering the market rates and prices chosen 

at december 31 2021 our net financial instrument position was a net asset of 194 million compared to a net liability of 253 million at december 31 2020 the change in the net financial instrument position was primarily due to exchange rate fluctuations in our foreign exchange portfolio 

since our risk management programs are generally highly effective the potential loss in value for each risk management portfolio described below would be largely offset by changes in the value of the underlying exposure 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

the primary currencies for which we have exchange rate exposure are the us dollar versus the brazilian real chinese yuan indian rupee euro mexican peso and argentine peso foreign currency debt and foreign exchange forward contracts are used in countries where we do business thereby reducing our net asset exposure foreign exchange forward contracts are also used to hedge firm and highly anticipated foreign currency cash flows 

to analyze the effects of changing foreign currency rates we have performed a sensitivity analysis in which we assume an instantaneous 10 percent change in the foreign currency exchange rates from their levels at december 31 2021 and 2020 with all other variables including interest rates held constant 



interest rate risk 

one of the strategies that we can use to manage interest rate exposure is to enter into interest rate swap agreements in these agreements we agree to exchange at specified intervals the difference between fixed and variable interest amounts calculated on an agreedupon notional principal amount in the quarter ended december 31 2021 we had outstanding interest rate swap contracts in place with an aggregate notional value of 1000 million 

to analyze the effects of changing interest rates we have performed a sensitivity analysis in which we assume an instantaneous one percent change in the interest rates from their levels at december 31 2021 and 2020 with all other variables held constant 



our debt portfolio at december 31 2021 is composed of 64 percent fixedrate debt and 36 percent variablerate debt the variablerate component of our debt portfolio principally consists of borrowings under our 2021 term loan facility credit facility commercial paper program variablerate industrial and pollution control revenue bonds and amounts outstanding under foreign subsidiary credit lines changes in interest rates affect different portions of our variablerate debt portfolio in different ways 

based on the variablerate debt in our debt portfolio at december 31 2021 a one percentage point increase in interest rates would have increased gross interest expense by 114 million and a one percentage point decrease in interest rates would have decreased gross interest expense by 29 million for the year ended december 31 2021

 item 1 business 

general 

we are a pureplay agricultural sciences company providing innovative solutions to growers around the world with a robust product portfolio fueled by a marketdriven discovery and development pipeline in crop protection plant health precision agriculture and professional pest and turf management this powerful combination of advanced technologies includes leading insect control products based on rynaxypyr® and cyazypyr® active ingredients authority® boral® centium® command® and gamit® branded herbicides isoflex™ active herbicide ingredient talstar® and hero® branded insecticides 1  and flutriafolbased fungicides the fmc portfolio also includes arc™ farm intelligence and biologicals such as quartzo® and presence® bionematicides our products are used in agriculture to enhance crop yield and quality by controlling a broad spectrum of insects weeds and disease as well as in nonagricultural markets for pest and turf management 

fmc strategy 

we have streamlined our portfolio over the past ten years to become a tierone leader and the fifth largest global innovation provider in the global agricultural chemicals market our strong competitive position is driven by our technology and innovation as well as our geographic balance and crop diversity which helped fmc to take market share in 2018 2019 and 2020 

we have industryleading insecticides and herbicides the majority of which are patented technologies exceptional discovery research capabilities and a global manufacturing network we expect to spend approximately 65 percent of sales on research and development annually our rd pipeline includes 11 molecules and biological strains in our development pipeline approximately 17 years away from commercialization and more than 25 additional molecules and biological strains in our discovery pipeline approximately 810 years from commercialization we expect the first four product launches including the first two significant active ingredients out of this pipeline will occur in 2021 we own and operate a total of 25 manufacturing plants and we have the scale to operate with strong resources and global reach to address changing market conditions our supply chain organization effectively managed to continue supplying our customers and growing our business despite multiple shutdowns and other disruptions in the chinese chemical sector in 2018 and 2019 in the fourth quarter of 2020 we experienced logistics and supply chain constraints in the us mostly due to the covid19 pandemic we do not expect this to be completely resolved by the first quarter of 2021 but we are focused on ensuring we can mitigate supply chain risks and continue to expand our market growth opportunities we posted solid overall results in 2020 despite numerous challenges related to the covid19 pandemic as an agricultural sciences company we are considered an essential industry in the countries in which we operate we have avoided significant plant closures and all our manufacturing facilities and distribution warehouses remain operational and fully staffed we will continue to assess the need related to costsaving measures as appropriate 

our revenues grew approximately 1 percent or 7 percent organically 2 excluding the impacts of foreign currency year over year in 2020 driven by doubledigit growth for our diamides rynaxypyr® and cyazypyr® active ingredients though we saw growth in additional active ingredients the aggregate of the rest of our portfolio excluding diamides amounted to a midsingle digit decline inclusive of a 2 percent decline in product registrations and rationalizations which mostly offset the diamide growth discussed above rynaxypyr® and cyazypyr® actives now represent over 18 billion in combined sales representing approximately 55 percent growth since we acquired these molecules in november 2017 products launched in 2020 and 2019 also contributed to revenue growth we successfully launched our new bixafen fungicide under the lucento® fungicide brand in north america in 2019 and we are on track to accomplish the 30 million to 50 million revenue target for this new active ingredient we also launched several new formulated products in 2020 which is key to lifecycle management of our products approximately 50 million of our 2020 revenue growth came from 2020 product launches 

fmc performed slightly better than the overall crop protection market in 2020 which we estimate was flat versus 2019 growth for fmc and the market was offset by significant headwinds from foreign currency as mentioned above our growth rate was 1 percent and excluding the impact of foreign currency our organic 1 growth rate was 7 percent fmc’s innovation starting with our current portfolio of advanced products and continuing through our rd discovery development and new formulations contributed to our performance our technology portfolio includes specific innovations in plant health application technology and delivery systems as well as advanced agronomic insights through arc™ farm intelligence our precision agriculture tool that leverages artificial intelligence and machine learning

acquisitions and divestitures 

in may 2020 fmc entered into a binding offer with isagro spa isagro to acquire the remaining rights for fluindapyr active ingredient assets from isagro in july 2020 we entered into an asset sale and purchase agreement with isagro on october 2 2020 we closed on the transaction with a purchase price of approximately 65 million fluindapyr has been jointly developed by fmc and isagro under a 2012 research and development collaboration agreement the transaction provides fmc with full global rights to the fluindapyr active ingredient including key us european asian and latin american fungicide markets the transaction transfers to fmc all intellectual property knowhow registrations product formulations and other global assets of the proprietary broadspectrum fungicide molecule the acquired assets have been classified as inprocess research and development see note 9 in the consolidated financial statements included within this form 10k for accounting considerations the transaction will expand our fungicide portfolio by giving us full global rights to the fluindapyr active ingredient and is an important strategic addition to our product line 

in 2019 we completed the separation of our fmc lithium segment which was renamed livent corporation or livent following its initial public offering ipo that closed on october 15 2018 after completion of the ipo fmc owned 123 million shares of livents common stock representing approximately 84 percent of the total outstanding shares of livents common stock on march 1 2019 we completed the distribution of 123 million shares of common stock of livent as a pro rata dividend on shares of fmc following the distribution fmc has zero shares of livent and zero exposure to lithium markets the financial information within this filing has been recast to present the former fmc lithium as a discontinued operation retrospectively for all relevant periods presented

with a worldwide manufacturing and distribution infrastructure we are better able to respond rapidly to global customer needs offset downward economic trends in one region with positive trends in another and match local revenues to local costs to reduce the impact of currency volatility the charts below detail our sales by major geographic region and major product category 

the following table provides our longlived assets by major geographical region 



products and markets 

our portfolio is comprised of three major pesticide categories insecticides herbicides and fungicides the majority of our product lines consist of insecticides and herbicides and we have a small but fastgrowing portfolio of fungicides mainly used in high value crop segments our insecticides are used to control a wide spectrum of pests while our herbicide portfolio primarily targets a large variety of difficulttocontrol weeds we are also investing substantially in a plant health program that includes biological crop protection products seed treatments and micronutrients biological technologies developed by fmc’s rd team in denmark offer excellent sustainability profiles and serve as strong complements to our synthetic products our biologicals feature attributes that exceed the competition such as high stability long shelf life low use rates and compatibility with other chemistries 

in the latin american region which includes the large agricultural market of brazil we sell directly to large growers through our own sales and marketing organization and we access the market through independent distributors and coops in north america we access the market through several major national and regional distributors and have our own sales and marketing organization in canada we access the europe middle east  africa markets through our own sales and marketing organizations we access key asian markets through large distributors in addition to either local independent distributors or our own sales and marketing organizations through these and other alliances along with our own targeted marketing efforts access to novel technologies and our innovation initiatives we expect to maintain and enhance our access in key agricultural and noncrop markets and develop new products that will help us continue to compete effectively 

industry overview 

the three principal categories of agricultural and noncrop chemicals are herbicides insecticides and fungicides representing approximately 40 percent 30 percent and 28 percent of global industry revenue respectively 

the agrochemicals industry is more consolidated following several recent mergers of the leading crop protection companies which now include fmc chemchina owner of syngenta group which includes the former syngenta and adama bayer ag 

acquired monsanto in 2018 basf ag and corteva agriscience the agricultural division of former dowdupont spun out in june 2019 these five innovation companies currently represent approximately 75 percent of the crop protection industry’s global sales the next group of agrochemical producers include upl ltd upl also acquired arysta in february 2019 sumitomo chemical company ltd and nufarm ltd fmc employs various differentiated strategies and competes with unique technologies focusing on certain crops markets and geographies while also being supported by a lowcost manufacturing model 

growth 

we are among the leading agrochemical producers in the world some of our key insecticides are predominantly based on patentprotected active ingredients and continue to grow well above market patterns our complementary technologies combine improved formulation capabilities and a broader innovation pipeline resulting in new and differentiated products we will take advantage of enhanced market access positions and an expanded portfolio to deliver nearterm growth 

we will continue to grow by obtaining new and approved uses for existing product lines and acquiring accessing developing marketing distributing andor selling complementary chemistries and related technologies in order to strengthen our product portfolio and our capabilities to effectively service our target markets and customers 

our growth efforts focus on developing environmentally compatible and sustainable solutions that can effectively increase farmers’ yields and provide costeffective alternatives to chemistries which may be prone to resistance we are committed to providing unique differentiated products to our customers by acquiring and further developing technologies as well as investing in innovation to extend product life cycles our external growth efforts include product acquisitions inlicensing of chemistries and technologies and alliances that bolster our market access complement our existing product portfolio or provide entry into adjacent spaces we have entered into a range of development and distribution agreements with other companies that provide access to new technologies and products which we can subsequently commercialize 

in 2020 we announced the launch of our arc™ farm intelligence platform an exclusive precision agriculture platform that enables growers and advisors to more accurately predict pest pressure before it becomes a problem nearly 4 million acres across six countries were covered by our platform during its pilot rollout it is expanding significantly and supports product recommendations for multiple fmc active ingredients led by our diamides we have other precision agriculture initiatives and new product launches such as isoflex™ herbicide we also launched fmc ventures our new venture capital arm targeting strategic investments in startups and earlystage companies that are developing and applying emerging technologies in the agricultural industry the group will be making small seed type investments 

diamide growth strategy 

our product portfolio features two key diamideclass molecules – rynaxypyr® chlorantraniliprole and cyazypyr® cyantraniliprole actives – with combined annual revenues of approximately 18 billion in 2020 these two molecules are industryleading in terms of performance combining highly effective low dose rates with fastacting systemic long residual control these attributes quickly established rynaxypyr® active as the world’s leading insect control technology and we expect it to continue on a strong growth trajectory notwithstanding the expiration of composition of matter patents covering rynaxypyr® active in certain countries starting in late 2022 our cyazypyr® active a secondgeneration diamide is growing quickly as we obtain more product registrations we expect it to continue to grow strongly notwithstanding the expiration of its active ingredient composition of matter patents starting in the mid2020s this expectation is based on not only our broad patent estate and the timing of key patent milestones but also on other critical elements that will allow fmc to continue to profitably grow the diamide franchise well beyond the expiration of key patents these other critical elements include registration and data protection commercial strategies brand recognition as well as manufacturing and supply chain complexity and fmc efficiencies 

patents and trade secrets the fmc diamide insect control patent estate is made up of many different patent families which cover composition of matter – both active ingredients and certain intermediates manufacturing processes – both active ingredients and certain intermediates formulations uses and applications for rynaxypyr® and cyazypyr® actives related patents as of december 31 2020 we had 33 families with granted patents filed in up to 76 countries with a total of 897 active granted patents as well as numerous pending patent applications see patents trademarks and licenses within this item 1 for more details fmc’s process patents cover the manufacturing processes for both active ingredients – chlorantraniliprole and cyantraniliprole – as well as key intermediates that are used to make the final products chlorantraniliprole is a complex molecule to produce requiring 16 separate steps fmc owns granted patents covering many of these 16 process steps and several of the intermediate chemicals and we protect other aspects of the manufacturing processes by trade secret cyantraniliprole is similarly complex and covered by a comparable range of intellectual property many of these intermediate process patents run well past the expiration of the composition of matter patents and in some cases stretch until the end of this decade third parties that intend to manufacture and sell generic chlorantraniliprole or cyantraniliprole and rely on fmc’s extensive product safety data will be required to demonstrate that their product has the same regulatory safety profile as fmc rynaxypyr® and cyazypyr® actives to meet regulatory requirements for such difficulttomanufacture molecules we believe 

that third parties will have to produce these active ingredients using the same processes that are patented by fmc and if so would be infringing before patent expiration and subject to our challenge for infringement fmc also owns formulation patents which cover the use of chlorantraniliprole or cyantraniliprole in specific formulations found in commercially important enduse products 

regulatory data protection in addition to the patent estate various pesticide laws and regulations around the world offer added protection to the initial active ingredient registrant in the form of data protection and registration timelines that can extend after the composition or process patents have expired these rules can effectively provide a product innovator and initial active ingredient registrant such as fmc with a further period of exclusive use of the key reference data even after the applicable ai composition of matter patents have expired further in certain countries even after the period of exclusive use has expired a generic entrant seeking to rely on the initial registrant’s reference data may have to pay significant compensation to the initial registrant for fmc’s diamide products such rights apply in key markets including united states brazil and the european union 

growing the branded fmc diamide franchise fmc is executing its strategy to supply enduse pesticide products that include rynaxypyr® and cyazypyr® actives to a broad range of companies prior to patent expiration and in return establishing longterm commitments from the companies to purchase the diamide active ingredients from fmc these arrangements may also include limited patent data andor trademark licenses such partner relationships allow us to grow our business by having others develop and sell diamidebased products to meet farmers needs not within our current portfolio offering those farmers a better alternative to competing insecticides with product safety or efficacy profiles which are less attractive than rynaxypyr® or cyazypyr® actives these agreements can require the third party to use the wellknown and trusted rynaxypyr® or cyazypyr® brand names on the enduse products formulated with active ingredient supplied by fmc as of december 31 2020 we had global agreements with four major multinational companies and approximately 50 separate localcountry agreements covering 14 countries we are continuing to explore opportunities with additional companies beyond those with whom we are already engaged 

complexity of manufacturing today fmc manufactures all the required intermediates in the multistep processes as well as the final rynaxypyr® and cyazypyr® actives at our own active ingredient manufacturing plants or through key contract manufacturers who produce under longterm exclusive technologylicense agreements for a third party to replicate this complex supply chain and manufacturing network would be a major undertaking with very large capital requirements in addition given our manufacturing knowhow scale of our operations and continual investment in manufacturing process improvement we believe fmc’s manufacturing costs will be substantially lower than any other party seeking to produce these diamide products 

collectively these four factors  deep patent estate proprietary regulatory data strong commercial approach leveraging our brand recognition and capabilities of managing large scale manufacturing complexity – provide us the basis for our expectation that fmc will be the company of choice to supply chlorantraniliprole and cyantraniliprole products to thirdparty partners and ultimately to farmers well into the future 

source and availability of raw materials 

we utilize numerous vendors to supply raw materials and intermediate chemicals to support operations these materials are sourced on a global basis to strategically balance fmc’s vendor portfolio 

patents trademarks and licenses 

as an agricultural sciences company fmc believes in innovation and in protecting that innovation through intellectual property rights we own and license a significant number of us and foreign patents trademarks trade secrets and other intellectual property that are cumulatively important to our business in addition we seek to license our proprietary technologies through partnering arrangements that effectively allow us to capitalize from our intellectual property the fmc intellectual property estate provides us with a significant competitive advantage which we seek to expand and renew on a continual basis we manage our technology investment to discover and develop new active ingredients and biological products as well as to continue to improve manufacturing processes and existing active ingredients through new formulations mixtures or other concepts fmc’s technology innovation processes capture those innovations and protect them through the most appropriate form of intellectual property rights we also inlicense certain active ingredients and other technologies under patents held by third parties and have granted licenses to certain of our patents to third parties 

our patents cover many aspects of our business including our chemical and biological active ingredients intermediate chemicals manufacturing processes to produce such active ingredients or intermediates formulations and product uses as well as many aspects of our research and development activities that support the fmc new product pipeline patents are granted by individual jurisdictions and the duration of our patents depends on their respective jurisdictions and payment of annuities 

as of december 31 2020 the company owned a total of approximately 220 active granted us patents and 2600 active granted foreign patents includes supplemental patent certificates we also have approximately 1600 patent applications pending globally 

in our current product portfolio our diamide insect control products based on rynaxypyr® chlorantraniliprole and cyazypyr® cyantraniliprole active ingredients have a substantial patent estate which will remain in force well into the future more details regarding our diamide granted patent estate are set forth in the tables below 



patent families were only placed under one type but may cover several types 



we also own many trademarks that are well recognized by customers or product endusers unlike patents ownership rights in trademarks can be continued indefinitely so long as the trademarks are properly used and renewal fees are paid 

we actively monitor and manage our patents and trademarks to maintain our rights in these assets and we strategically take aggressive action when we believe our intellectual property rights are being infringed while we believe that the invalidity or loss of any particular patent trademark or license would be a remote possibility our patent and trademark estate related to our diamide insect control products based on rynaxypyr® and cyazypyr® active ingredients in the aggregate are of material importance to our operations 

seasonality 

the seasonal nature of the crop protection market and the geographic spread of our business can result in significant variations in quarterly earnings among geographic locations our products sold in the northern hemisphere north america europe and parts of asia serve seasonal agricultural markets from march through september generally resulting in significant earnings in the first and second quarters and to a lesser extent in the fourth quarter markets in the southern hemisphere latin america and parts of the asia pacific region including australia are served from july through february generally resulting in earnings in the third fourth and first quarters 

competition 

we encounter substantial competition in our business we market our products through our own sales organization and through alliance partners independent distributors and sales representatives the number of our principal competitors varies from market to market in general we compete by providing advanced technology high product quality reliability quality customer and technical service and by operating in a costefficient manner 

our business competes primarily in the global chemical crop protection market for insecticides herbicides and fungicides industry products include crop protection chemicals and for certain major competitors genetically engineered crop biotechnology products competition from generic agrochemical producers is significant as a number of key product patents have expired in the last two decades in general we compete as an innovator by focusing on product development including novel formulations proprietary mixes and advanced delivery systems and by acquiring or licensing mostly proprietary chemistries or technologies that complement our product and geographic focus we also differentiate ourselves by our global costcompetitiveness through our manufacturing strategies establishing effective product stewardship programs and developing strategic alliances that strengthen market access in key countries and regions 

research and development expense 

the rd efforts in our business focus on discovering and developing environmentally sound solutions — both new active ingredients and new product formulations — that meet the needs of farmers to maximize yields and control pests by providing new products that utilize both existing and new active ingredient chemistries on june 24 2019 we announced our investment of more than 50 million at our fmc stine research center in newark delaware to upgrade infrastructure and complete construction on a new stateoftheart greenhouse and laboratory facility due to the pandemic work on the greenhouse project did not progress as anticipated during 2020 we anticipate that the project will be completed by 2023

• competition and new agricultural technologies  our business faces competition which could affect our ability to maintain or raise prices successfully enter certain markets or retain our market position competition for our business includes not only generic suppliers of the same pesticidal active ingredients but also alternative proprietary pesticide chemistries and crop protection technologies that are bred into or applied onto seeds increased generic presence in agricultural chemical markets has been driven by the number of significant product patents and product data protections that have expired in the last decade and this trend is expected to continue also there are changing competitive dynamics in the agrochemical industry as some of our competitors have consolidated resulting in them having greater scale and diversity as well as market reach these competitive differences may not be overcome and may erode our business agriculture in many countries is changing and new technologies eg precision pest prediction or application data management continue to emerge at this time the scope and potential impact of these technologies are largely unknown but could have the potential to disrupt our business 

• climatic conditions  our markets are affected by climatic conditions which could adversely impact crop pricing and pest infestations for example drought may reduce the need for fungicides which could result in fewer sales and greater unsold inventories in the market whereas excessive rain could lead to increased plant disease or weed growth requiring growers to purchase and use more pesticides drought andor increased temperatures may change insect pest pressures requiring growers to use more less or different insecticides natural disasters can impact production at our facilities in various parts of the world the nature of these events makes them difficult to predict 

• geographic cyclicality  while our business is well balanced geographically in any given calendar quarter a certain geographyies will predominate in light of seasonal variations in the demand for our products given the nature of the crop protection market and the geographic regions in which we operate unexpected market conditions in any such predominating geographyies such as adverse weather pest pressures or other risks described herein may impact our business if occurring during a calendar quarter in which such geographyies is predominating 

• changing regulatory environment and public perception  changes in the regulatory environment particularly in the us brazil china india argentina and the european union could adversely impact our ability to continue producing andor selling certain products in our domestic and foreign markets or could increase the cost of doing so additionally changes to the regulatory environment may be influenced by nongovernment public pressure as a result of negative perception regarding the use of our crop protection products we are sensitive to this regulatory risk given the need to obtain and maintain pesticide registrations in every country in which we sell our products many countries require reregistration of pesticides to meet new and more challenging requirements while we defend our products vigorously these reregistration processes may result in significant additional data costs reduced number of permitted product uses or potential product cancellation compliance with changing laws and regulations may involve significant costs or capital expenditures or require changes in business practice that could result in reduced profitability in the european union the regulatory risk specifically includes the chemicals regulation known as reach registration evaluation and authorization of chemicals which requires manufacturers to verify through a special registration system that their chemicals can be marketed safely 

• geographic presence outside of us  we have a strong presence in latin america europe and asia as well as in the us growth of our geographic footprint particularly in europe and key asian countries such as india means that developments outside the us will generally have a more significant effect on our operations than in the past our operations outside the us are subject to special risks and restrictions including fluctuations in currency values exchange control regulations changes in local political or economic conditions governmental pricing directives import and trade restrictions or tariffs import or export licensing requirements and trade policy restrictions on the ability to repatriate funds and other potentially detrimental domestic and foreign governmental practices or policies affecting us companies doing business abroad 

• climate change and government regulation of greenhouse gases  the effects of climate change such as rising sea levels drought flooding and general volatility in seasonal temperatures could adversely affect our operations globally extreme weather events attributable to climate change may result in among other things physical damage to our property and equipment and interruptions to our supply chain climate change may also impact markets in which we sell our products where for example a prolonged drought may result in decreased demand for our products the more gradual effects of persistent temperature change in geographies with significant agricultural lands may result in changes in lands suitable for agriculture or changes in the mix of crops suitable for cultivation and the pests that may be present in such geographies for example prolonged increase in average temperature may make northern lands suitable for growing crops not grown historically in such climes leading farmers to shift from crops such as wheat to soybean and may result in new or different weed plant disease or insect pressures on such crops – such changes would impact the mix of pesticide products farmers would purchase which may be adverse for us depending on the local market and our product mix additionally changes in the governmental regulation of greenhouse gases depending on their nature and scope could subject our manufacturing operations to significant additional costs or limits on operations 

• fluctuations in commodity prices  our operating results could be significantly affected by the cost of commodities  both chemical raw material commodities and harvested crop commodities we may not be able to raise prices or improve productivity sufficiently to offset future increases in chemical raw material commodity pricing accordingly increases in such commodity prices may negatively affect our financial results we use hedging strategies to address material commodity price risks where hedge strategies are available on reasonable terms however we are unable to avoid the risk of medium and longterm increases additionally fluctuations in harvested crop commodity prices could negatively impact our customers ability to sell their products at previously forecasted prices resulting in reduced customer liquidity inadequate customer liquidity could affect our customers’ abilities to pay for our products and therefore affect existing and future sales or our ability to collect on customer receivables 

• supply arrangements  certain raw materials are critical to our production processes and our purchasing strategy and supply chain design are complex while we have made supply arrangements to meet planned operating requirements an inability to obtain the critical raw materials or operate under contract manufacturing arrangements would adversely impact our ability to produce certain products and could lead to operational disruption and increase uncertainties around business performance we source critical intermediates and finished products from a number of suppliers largely outside of the us and principally in china an inability to obtain these products or execute under contract sourcing arrangements would adversely impact our ability to sell products 

operational risks 

• covid19 and global pandemic cycles  the rapid spread of the novel coronavirus covid19 outbreak has caused significant disruptions in the us and global economies and economists expect the impact will continue to be significant as an agricultural sciences company we are considered an essential industry in the countries in which we operate we have avoided significant plant closures and all our manufacturing facilities and distribution warehouses remain operational and fully staffed while we have maintained business continuity and sustained our operations with safety as a priority the full extent of the disruptions on either our business and operations or the global economy are ongoing in addition the duration of the pandemic and its adverse effects are unknown and rapidly evolving external and internal factors and events related to covid19 could result in employee isolation and burnout leading to operational disruption and unexpected regrettable attrition which may impact the sustainability of our high touch agile culture we have seen some logistics challenges and shortages of packaging materials and containers as many industries have increased ecommerce and delivery of goods creating extra demand on packaging materials as well as related higher costs and pockets of demand reduction we may continue to experience disruption caused by covid19 in our supply chain logistics and pockets of demand as well as on farm worker labor required for planting harvesting and packing crops especially fruits vegetables and other specialty crops in the food chain going forward this outbreak may impact access to our production sites or our ability to adequately and safely staff these sites the ability of raw material suppliers to produce and deliver goods to us our ability to ship our products to production warehousing or customer sites the ability of our sales organization to make sales or for customers or indirect customers such as farmers to purchase our products or the ability to collect on customer receivables our supply chain and business operations could be disrupted from the temporary closure of thirdparty supplier and manufacturer facilities interruptions in product supply or restrictions on the export or shipment of our products any disruption of our suppliers and contract manufacturers could impact our sales and operating results the outbreak and governmental responses to the outbreak have caused disruption in certain food distribution systems and labor markets for planting and harvesting which in turn have created operational and financial pressures on some farmers who are the ultimate users of the vast majority of our products if those pressures continue and grow more widespread or severe and if farmers materially change their planting decisions or choose not to protect their crops with our products such pressures on farmers could impact our sales and operating results global health concerns such as coronavirus could also result in social economic and labor instability in the countries in which we or our customers and suppliers 

operate these uncertainties could have a material adverse effect on our business and our results of operation and financial condition a widespread health crisis could adversely affect the global economy resulting in an economic downturn that could impact demand for our products although our production operations that support agriculture have generally been viewed as essential and exempted from governmental lockdown orders the future impact of the outbreak is highly uncertain and cannot be predicted and there is no assurance that the outbreak will not have a material adverse impact on the future results of the company the extent of the impact will depend on future developments including the availability of vaccines and other actions taken to contain the coronavirus 

• business disruptions  we produce products through a combination of owned facilities and contract manufacturers we own and operate largescale active ingredient manufacturing facilities in the us mobile puerto rico manati china jinshan denmark ronland and india panoli our operating results are dependent in part on the continued operation of these production facilities interruptions at these facilities may materially reduce the productivity of a particular manufacturing facility or the profitability of our business as a whole although we take precautions to enhance the safety of our operations and minimize the risk of disruptions our operations and those of our contract manufacturers are subject to hazards inherent in chemical manufacturing and the related storage and transportation of raw materials products and wastes these potential hazards include explosions fires severe weather and natural disasters mechanical failure unscheduled downtimes supplier disruptions labor shortages or other labor difficulties information technology systems outages disruption in our supply chain or manufacturing and distribution operations transportation interruptions chemical spills discharges or releases of toxic or hazardous substances or gases shipment of contaminated or offspecification product to customers storage tank leaks other environmental risks or other sudden disruption in business operations beyond our control as a result of events such as acts of sabotage terrorism or war civil or political unrest natural disasters large scale power outages and public health epidemicspandemics some of these hazards may cause severe damage to or destruction of property and equipment or personal injury and loss of life and may result in suspension of operations or the shutdown of affected facilities 

• litigation and environmental risks  current reserves relating to our ongoing litigation and environmental liabilities may ultimately prove to be inadequate 

• hazardous materials  we manufacture and transport certain materials that are inherently hazardous due to their toxic or volatile nature while we take precautions to handle and transport these materials in a safe manner if they are mishandled or released into the environment they could cause property damage or result in personal injury claims against us 

• environmental compliance  we are subject to extensive federal state local and foreign environmental and safety laws regulations directives rules and ordinances concerning among other things emissions in the air discharges to land and water and the generation handling treatment disposal and remediation of hazardous waste and other materials we may face liability arising out of the normal course of business including alleged personal injury or property damage due to exposure to chemicals or other hazardous substances at our current or former facilities or chemicals that we manufacture handle or own we take our environmental responsibilities very seriously but there is a risk of environmental impact inherent in our manufacturing operations and transportation of chemicals any substantial liability for environmental damage could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

technology risks 

• technological and new product discoverydevelopment  our ability to compete successfully depends in part upon our ability to maintain a superior technological capability and to continue to identify develop and commercialize new and innovative high valueadded products for existing and future customers our investment in the discovery and development of new pesticidal active ingredients relies on discovery of new chemical molecules or biological strains such discovery processes depend on our scientists being able to find new molecules and strains which are novel and outside of patents held by others and such moleculesstrains being efficacious against target pests and our ability to develop those molecules and strains into new products without creating an undue risk to human health and the environment and then meeting applicable regulatory criteria the timeline from active ingredient discovery through full development and product launch averages 810 years depending on local regulatory requirements the complexity and duration of developing new products create risks that product concepts may fail during development or when launched may not meet thencurrent market needs or competitive conditions 

portfolio management and integration risks 

• portfolio management risks  we continuously review our portfolio which includes the evaluation of potential business acquisitions that may strategically fit our business and strategic growth initiatives if we are unable to successfully integrate and develop our acquired businesses we could fail to achieve anticipated synergies which would include expected cost savings and revenue growth failure to achieve these anticipated synergies could materially and adversely affect our financial results in addition to strategic acquisitions we evaluate the diversity of our portfolio in light of our objectives and alignment with our growth strategy in implementing this strategy we may not be successful in separating underperforming or nonstrategic assets the gains or losses on the divestiture of or lost operating 

income from such assets eg divesting may affect the company’s earnings moreover we may incur asset impairment charges related to acquisitions or divestitures that reduce earnings significant effort will likely be required to ensure that the right mix of resources are trained engaged and focused on achieving business objectives while adhering to our core values of safety ethics and compliance 

• innovation and intellectual property  our innovation efforts are protected by patents trade secrets and other intellectual property rights that cover many of our current products manufacturing processes and product uses as well as many aspects of our research and development activities supporting our new product pipeline trademarks protect valuable brands associated with our products patents and trademarks are granted by individual jurisdictions and the duration of our patents depends on their respective jurisdictions and payment of annuities our future performance will depend on our ability to address active ingredient composition of matter patent expirations through effective enforcement of our patents that continue to cover key chemical intermediates and process patents as well as portfolio life cycle management particularly for our high value diamide insecticides see diamide growth strategy and patents trademarks and licenses in item 1 for more details if our innovation efforts fail to continue to make process improvements to reduce costs such conditions could impede our competitive position some of our competitors may secure patents on production methods or uses of products that may limit our ability to compete costeffectively 

• enforcement of intellectual property rights  the composition of matter patents on our rynaxypyr® active ingredient is nearing its expiration in several key countries we have a broad estate of additional patents regarding the production of rynaxypyr® active ingredient as well as trademark and data exclusivity protection in certain countries that extend well beyond the active ingredient composition of matter patents see diamide growth strategy and patents trademarks and licenses in item 1 we intend to strategically and vigorously enforce our patents and other forms of intellectual property and have done so already against several third parties other third parties may seek to enter markets with infringing products or may find alternative production methods that avoid infringement or we may not be successful in litigating to enforce our patents due to the risks inherent in any litigation patents involve complex factual and legal issues and thus the scope validity or enforceability of any patent claims we have or may obtain cannot be clearly predicted patents may be challenged in the courts as well as in various administrative proceedings before us or foreign patent offices and may be deemed unenforceable invalidated or circumvented we are currently and may in the future be a party to various lawsuits or administrative proceedings involving our patents such challenges can result in some or all of the claims of the asserted patent being invalidated or deemed unenforceable in such circumstances an adverse patent enforcement decision which could lead to the entry of competing chlorantraniliprole products in relevant markets may materially and adversely impact our financial results 

• major enterprise initiatives  in the fourth quarter of 2020 we completed the golive on a single global instance of sap s4 hana there are execution and change management activities that may affect our ability to operationalize and monetize the investment made in the system the post implementation period may place significant demands on certain of our internal functional groups particularly finance and information technology as we continue to adapt to the new system failure to successfully execute and realize the expected synergies from a single global instance could materially and adversely affect our expected performance 

• potential tax implications of fmc lithium separation  we have received an opinion from outside counsel to the effect that the spinoff of fmc lithium as a distribution to our stockholders completed in march 2019 qualified as a nontaxable transaction for us federal income tax purposes the opinion is based on certain assumptions and representations as to factual matters from both fmc and fmc lithium as well as certain covenants by those parties the opinion cannot be relied upon if any of the assumptions representations or covenants is incorrect incomplete or inaccurate or is violated in any material respect the opinion of counsel is not binding upon the irs or the courts and there is no assurance that the irs or a court will not take a contrary position it is possible that the irs or a state or local taxing authority could take the position that aforementioned transaction results in the recognition of significant taxable gain by fmc in which case fmc may be subject to material tax liabilities 

financial risks 

• foreign exchange rate risks  we are an international company operating in many countries around the world and thus face foreign exchange rate risks in the normal course of our business we are particularly sensitive to the brazilian real the euro the indian rupee the chinese yuan the mexican peso the argentine peso and the us dollar while we engage in hedging and other strategies to mitigate those risks unexpected severe changes in foreign exchange may create risks that could materially and adversely affect our expected performance 

• uncertain tax rates  our future effective tax rates may be materially impacted by numerous items including a future change in the composition of earnings from foreign and domestic tax jurisdictions as earnings in foreign jurisdictions are typically taxed at different statutory rates than the us federal statutory rate accounting for uncertain tax positions business combinations expiration of statute of limitations or settlement of tax audits changes in valuation allowance changes in tax law currency gains and losses and the potential decision to repatriate certain future foreign earnings on which us or foreign withholding taxes have not been previously accrued 

• uncertain recoverability of investments in longlived assets  we have significant investments in longlived assets and continually review the carrying value of these assets for recoverability in light of changing market conditions and alternative product sourcing opportunities we may recognize future impairments of longlived assets which could adversely affect our results of operations 

• pension and postretirement plans  our us plan reached fully funded status during 2018 the primary investment strategy is a liability hedging approach with an objective of maintaining the funded status of the plan such that the funded status volatility is minimized and the likelihood that we will be required to make significant contributions to the plan is limited the portfolio is comprised of 100 percent fixed income securities and cash nevertheless obligations related to our pension and postretirement plans reflect certain assumptions to the extent actual experience differs from these assumptions our costs and funding obligations could increase or decrease significantly 

general risk factors 

• market access risk  our results may be affected by changes in distribution channels which could impact our ability to access the market 

• compliance with laws and regulations  the global regulatory environment is becoming increasingly complex and requires more resources to effectively manage which may increase the potential for misunderstanding or misapplication of regulatory standards 

• talent engagement and culture  the inability to recruit and retain key personnel the unexpected loss of key personnel or other external and internal factors and events could culminate in employee attrition and may adversely affect our operations in addition our future success depends in part on our ability to identify and develop talent to succeed senior management and other key members of the organization 

• economic and political change  our business has been and could continue to be adversely affected by economic and political changes in the markets where we compete including inflation rates recessions trade restrictions tariff increases or potential new tariffs foreign ownership restrictions and economic embargoes imposed by the us or any of the foreign countries in which we do business changes in laws taxation and regulations and the interpretation and application of these laws taxes and regulations restrictions imposed by the us government or foreign governments through exchange controls or taxation policy nationalization or expropriation of property undeveloped property rights and legal systems or political instability other governmental actions and other external factors over which we have no control economic and political conditions within the us and foreign jurisdictions or strained relations between countries could result in fluctuations in demand price volatility loss of property state sponsored cyberattacks supply disruptions or other disruptions in argentina continued inflation and foreign exchange controls could adversely affect our business realignment of change in regional economic arrangements could have an operational impact on our businesses in china unpredictable enforcement of environmental regulations could result in unanticipated shutdowns in broad geographic areas impacting our contract manufacturers and raw material suppliers 

• information technology security and data privacy risks  as with all enterprise information systems our information technology systems could be penetrated by outside parties’ intent on extracting information corrupting information deploying ransomware or disrupting business processes remote and other work arrangements may leave the company more vulnerable to a cyberattack our systems have in the past been and likely will in the future be subject to unauthorized access attempts unauthorized access could disrupt our business operations and could result in failures or interruptions in our computer systems lockout from systems due to ransomware or in the loss of assets and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations in addition breaches of our security measures or the accidental loss inadvertent disclosure or unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential information about the company our employees our vendors or our customers could result in litigation violations of various data privacy regulations in some jurisdictions and also potentially result in a liability while we have taken measures to assess the requirements of and to comply with the european unions general data protection regulation and data privacy regulations in other countries these measures may be challenged by authorities that regulate datarelated compliance we could incur significant expense in facilitating and responding to investigations and if the measures we have taken prove to be inadequate we could face fines or penalties this could damage our reputation or otherwise harm our business financial condition or results of operations 

• access to debt and capital markets  we rely on cash generated from operations and external financing to fund our growth and working capital needs limitations on access to external financing could adversely affect our operating results moreover interest payments dividends and the expansion of our business or other business opportunities may require significant amounts of capital we believe that our cash from operations and available borrowings under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to meet these needs in the foreseeable future however if we need external financing our access to credit markets and pricing of our capital will be dependent upon maintaining sufficient credit ratings from credit rating agencies and the state of the capital markets generally there can be no assurances that we would be able to obtain equity or debt financing on terms we deem acceptable and it is possible that the cost of any financings could increase significantly thereby increasing our expenses and decreasing our net income if we are 

unable to generate sufficient cash flow or raise adequate external financing including as a result of significant disruptions in the global credit markets we could be forced to restrict our operations and growth opportunities which could adversely affect our operating results 

• credit default risks  we may use our existing revolving credit facility to meet our cash needs to the extent available in the event of a default in this credit facility or any of our senior notes we could be required to immediately repay all outstanding borrowings and make cash deposits as collateral for all obligations the facility supports which we may not be able to do any default under any of our credit arrangements could cause a default under many of our other credit agreements and debt instruments without waivers from lenders party to those agreements any such default could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue to operate 

• exposure to global economic conditions  deterioration in the global economy and worldwide credit and foreign exchange markets could adversely affect our business a worsening of global or regional economic conditions or financial markets could adversely affect both our own and our customers ability to meet the terms of sale or our suppliers ability to perform all their commitments to us a slowdown in economic growth in our international markets or a deterioration of credit or foreign exchange markets could adversely affect customers suppliers and our overall business there customers in weakened economies may be unable to purchase our products or it could become more expensive for them to purchase imported products in their local currency or sell their commodities at prevailing international prices and we may be unable to collect receivables from such customers

 item 3 legal proceedings 

like hundreds of other industrial companies we have been named as one of many defendants in asbestosrelated personal injury litigation most of these cases allege personal injury or death resulting from exposure to asbestos in premises of fmc or to asbestoscontaining components installed in machinery or equipment manufactured or sold by discontinued operations the machinery and equipment businesses we owned or operated did not fabricate the asbestoscontaining component parts at issue in the litigation and to this day neither the us occupational safety and health administration nor the environmental protection agency has banned the use of these components further the asbestoscontaining parts for this machinery and equipment were accessible only at the time of infrequent repair and maintenance a few jurisdictions have permitted claims to proceed against equipment manufacturers relating to insulation installed by other companies on such machinery and equipment we believe that overall the claims against fmc are without merit 

as of december 31 2020 there were approximately 9100 premises and product asbestos claims pending against fmc in several jurisdictions since the 1980s approximately 117000 asbestos claims against fmc have been discharged the overwhelming majority of which have been dismissed without any payment to the claimant since the 1980s settlements with claimants have totaled approximately 130 million 

we intend to continue managing these asbestosrelated cases in accordance with our historical experience we have established a reserve for this litigation within our discontinued operations and believe that any exposure of a loss in excess of the established reserve cannot be reasonably estimated our experience has been that the overall trends in asbestos litigation have changed over time over the last several years we have seen changes in the jurisdictions where claims against fmc are being filed and changes in the mix of products named in the various claims because these claim trends have yet to form a predictable pattern we are presently unable to reasonably estimate our asbestos liability with respect to claims that may be filed in the future

covid19 pandemic 

in march 2020 the world health organization characterized covid19 as a pandemic and the president of the united states declared the covid19 outbreak a national emergency the rapid spread of the outbreak has caused significant disruptions in the us and global economies 

as an agricultural sciences company we are considered an essential industry in the countries in which we operate we have avoided significant plant closures and all our manufacturing facilities and distribution warehouses remain operational and fully staffed however we did have a third party us toller that was disrupted in the fourth quarter because of covidrelated staffing issues which signifies one of the ongoing business risks that the pandemic creates we do not yet know the full extent of the disruptions on either our business and operations or the global economy nor the duration of the pandemic and its adverse effects 

we have implemented new procedures to support the health and safety of our employees and we are following all us centers for disease control and prevention as well as state and regional health department guidelines the wellbeing of our employees is fmcs top priority although most fmc officebased employees around the world have been working remotely during this period we have implemented procedures to safely return to the workplace in regions where the pandemic is controlled and local health officials have deemed this to be safe in compliance with any government regulations in addition we have thousands of employees who continue operating our manufacturing sites and distribution warehouses in all our facilities we are using a variety of best practices to address covid19 risks following the protocols and procedures recommended by leading health authorities we are monitoring the situation in regions where the pandemic continues to escalate and in such regions will remain in a remote working environment until it is safe to return to the workplace during 2020 we have made significant investments in our employees as a result of the covid19 pandemic including through enhanced dependent care pay policies recognition bonuses increased flexibility of work schedules and hours of work to accommodate remote working arrangements and investment in it infrastructure to promote remote work through these efforts we have successfully avoided any covid19 related furloughs or workforce reductions to date 

in addition to addressing the needs of the company and our employees fmc has been a leader in supporting the needs of the communities in which fmc has operations and those generally in need as a result of the pandemic since the advent of the pandemic we have donated in excess of 233000 personal protective equipment supplies including n95 masks surgical masks protective cover suits goggles and similar items we have also donated more than 1800 containers and canisters used to transport alcoholbased disinfecting solution additional efforts include financial contributions to hungerrelief organizations assisting with disinfecting schools and other public spaces in villages and supporting various community initiatives 

in our supply chain sourcing of raw materials and intermediates was not a significant issue although we continued to see some logistics challenges and related higher costs we are conscious of the potential downside risks in future periods and expect to continue to experience disruption caused by covid19 in our supply chain and logistics we have also seen some pockets of reduced demand as a result of covid19 primarily related to disruptions of farm worker labor required for planting harvesting and packing crops especially fruits vegetables and other specialty crops which may continue going forward as discussed in our 2020 quarterly reports we implemented price increases and costsaving measures across the company to offset impacts of the covid19 pandemic and related foreign currency headwinds we amended our debt covenants with our banks on april 22 2020 see note 11 for more details to provide significant additional headroom above any of the covid19 related scenarios assessed by the company we will continue to monitor the economic environment related to the pandemic on an ongoing basis and assess the impacts on our business 

2020 highlights 

the following are the more significant developments in our businesses during the year ended december 31 2020 

• revenue of 46421 million in 2020 increased 323 million or approximately 1 percent versus last year a more detailed review of revenues is included under the section entitled results of operations  on a regional basis sales in north america decreased 8 percent driven primarily by timing of shipments and supply chain disruptions including covid related factors sales in latin america increased by 1 percent sales in europe middle east and africa increased by 4 percent and sales in asia increased 6 percent primarily by volume growth 

• our gross margin of 20520 million decreased 316 million or approximately 2 percent versus last year the decrease in gross margin was primarily driven by unfavorable foreign currency impacts primarily in latin america gross margin as a percent of revenue of 44 percent decreased slightly from 45 percent in the prior year period primarily due to unfavorable foreign currency headwinds 

• selling general and administrative expenses decreased from 7929 million to 7297 million selling general and administrative expenses excluding transactionrelated charges of 6764 million decreased 387 million or approximately 5 percent these decreases were a result of costsaving measures implemented in response to the pandemic transactionrelated charges are presented in our adjusted earnings nongaap financial measurement below under the section titled results of operations  

• research and development expenses of 2879 million decreased 102 million or 3 percent the decrease was primarily due to costsaving measures taken in response to the covid19 pandemic we did not cancel any research and development projects but we phased some differently to allow lower costs this year in response to the pandemic without fundamentally impacting longterm timelines we maintain our commitment to invest resources to discover new active ingredients and formulations that support resistance management and sustainable agriculture 

• net income loss attributable to fmc stockholders of 5515 million increased 741 million or approximately 16 percent from 4774 million in the prior year period the higher results were driven by costsaving measures of a combined 734 million in selling general and administrative and research and development expenses combined in response to the pandemic restructuring and other charges were 388 million lower versus prior year and discontinued operations expense decreased 35 million compared to the prior year these increases to income were slightly offset by higher tax expense and higher provision for income taxes of 394 million and higher nonoperating pension and postretirement charges of 131 million adjusted aftertax earnings from continuing operations attributable to fmc stockholders of 8090 million increased 53 million or approximately 1 percent see the disclosure of our adjusted earnings nongaap financial measurement under the section titled results of operations  

other 2020 highlights 

in november 2020 we successfully completed the implementation of our new sap system we now have a single modern system across the entire company for the first time in our history 

on october 2 2020 we closed on the previously disclosed transaction with isagro spa isagro for a purchase price of approximately 65 million which resulted in a charge in the fourth quarter of 2020 the fluindapyr acquisition has been treated as an asset acquisition for accounting purposes as it does not meet the definition of a business therefore any acquired inprocess research and development was immediately expensed see note 9 in the consolidated financial statements included within this form 10k for further details 

in june 2020 we launched fmc ventures our new venture capital arm targeting strategic investments in startups and earlystage companies that are developing and applying emerging technologies in the agricultural industry the group will be making small seed type investments 

in may 2020 we announced the launch of our arc™ farm intelligence platform a proprietary precision agriculture platform that enables growers and advisors to more accurately predict pest pressure before it becomes a problem

our 2021 expectation for the overall global crop protection market growth is that it will be up lowsingle digits on a percentage basis in us dollars commodity prices for many of the major crops are higher and stocktouse ratios have improved compared to this time last year all regions are seeing some benefit from better crop commodity prices while the impacts from covid on crop demand appear to be lessening 

we expect 2021 revenue will be in the range of approximately 49 billion to 51 billion up approximately 8 percent at the midpoint versus 2020 we also expect adjusted ebitda 1 of 132 billion to 142 billion which represents 10 percent growth at the midpoint versus 2020 results 2021 adjusted earnings are expected to be in the range of 665 to 735 per diluted share 1  up 13 percent at the midpoint versus 2020 excluding any impact from potential share repurchases in 2021 for cash flow outlook refer to the liquidity and capital resources section below 

1 although we provide forecasts for adjusted earnings per share and adjusted ebitda nongaap financial measures we are not able to forecast the most directly comparable measures calculated and presented in accordance with us gaap certain elements of the composition of the us gaap amounts are not predictable making it impractical for us to forecast such elements include but are not limited to restructuring acquisition charges and discontinued operations as a result no us gaap outlook is provided

overview 

the following charts provide a reconciliation of adjusted ebitda adjusted earnings and organic revenue growth all of which are nongaap financial measures from the most directly comparable gaap measure adjusted ebitda is provided to assist the readers of our financial statements with useful information regarding our operating results our operating results are presented based on how we assess operating performance and internally report financial information for management purposes we report operating performance based on earnings before interest income taxes depreciation and amortization discontinued operations and corporate special charges our adjusted earnings measure excludes corporate special charges net of income taxes discontinued operations attributable to fmc stockholders net of income taxes and certain nongaap tax adjustments these are excluded by us in the measure we use to evaluate business performance and determine certain performancebased compensation organic revenue growth excludes the impacts of foreign currency changes which we believe is a meaningful metric to evaluate our revenue changes these items are discussed in detail within the other results of operations section that follows in addition to providing useful information about our operating results to investors we also believe that excluding the effect of corporate special charges net of income taxes and certain nongaap tax adjustments from operating results and discontinued operations allows management and investors to compare more easily the financial performance of our underlying business from period to period these measures should not be considered as substitutes for net income loss or other measures of performance or liquidity reported in accordance with us gaap

2 the income tax expense benefit on corporate special charges income is determined using the applicable rates in the taxing jurisdictions in which the corporate special charge or income occurred and includes both current and deferred income tax expense benefit based on the nature of the nongaap performance measure 

3 we exclude the gaap tax provision including discrete items from the nongaap measure of income and instead include a nongaap tax provision based upon the annual nongaap effective tax rate the gaap tax provision includes certain discrete tax 

items including but not limited to income tax expenses or benefits that are not related to current year ongoing business operations tax adjustments associated with fluctuations in foreign currency remeasurement of certain foreign operations certain changes in estimates of tax matters related to prior fiscal years certain changes in the realizability of deferred tax assets and changes in tax law which includes the impact of the tax cuts and jobs act the act enacted on december 22 2017 management believes excluding these discrete tax items assists investors and securities analysts in understanding the tax provision and the effective tax rate related to ongoing operations thereby providing investors with useful supplemental information about fmcs operational performance

emea revenue increased approximately 4 percent versus the prior year period or approximately 10 percent excluding foreign currency headwinds primarily due to the successful launch of battle® delta herbicides and cyazypyr® insect control registrations across the region favorable weather demand for our diamide products and higher pricing throughout the region also contributed to the increase these increases were partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency impacts 

asia revenue increased approximately 3 percent versus the prior year period or approximately 8 percent excluding foreign currency headwinds primarily driven by continued strong growth in india and new products across the region partially offsetting the increases were adverse weather conditions in australia and challenged rice markets in china 

in late march 2019 there was an explosion within an industrial park in china which impacted one plant operated by one of our contract manufacturing tollers the local government had temporarily shut down the entire park to investigate the cause of the explosion during 2020 our toller received approval for a phased reopening that began during the fourth quarter and will continue through 2021 our global manufacturing network provides significant supply chain flexibility due to the strength of our partnerships and our alternate sourcing options we have been able to secure supply of the active ingredients normally manufactured at this location

corporate special charges income 

restructuring and other charges income 

our restructuring and other charges income are comprised of restructuring assets disposals and other charges income as described below 



 

1 see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k for more information 

restructuring charges in 2020 primarily consisted of 402 million of charges associated with the integration of the dupont crop protection business which was completed during the second quarter of 2020 except for certain inflight initiatives these charges included severance accelerated depreciation on certain fixed assets and other costs benefits there were other miscellaneous restructuring charges 24 million 

other charges income net in 2020 includes 656 million of charges related to our acquisition of the remaining rights for fluindapyr active ingredient assets from isagro see note 9 for further information regarding this matter additional charges of 249 million consists of charges of environmental sites 

restructuring charges in 2019 primarily consisted of 341 million of charges related to our decision to exit sales of all carbofuran formulations globally and 264 million of charges associated with the integration of the dupont crop protection business these charges included severance accelerated depreciation on certain fixed assets and other costs benefits there were other miscellaneous restructuring charges 17 million 

other charges income net in 2019 primarily consists of charges of environmental sites during the fourth quarter of 2019 we recorded a charge of 728 million a result of an unfavorable court ruling we received in relation to the pocatello tribal litigation at one of our environmental sites see note 12 for further information regarding this matter 

restructuring charges in 2018 were primarily associated with restructuring charges associated with the integration of the dupont crop protection business these charges primarily consisted of approximately 59 million of charges related to the change in our market access model in india and approximately 28 million of charges due to our decision to exit the ewing rd center refer to note 9 for more information other restructuring charges related to the integration of the acquired dupont crop protection business totaled approximately 22 million 

other charges income net in 2018 primarily consists of income from the gain on sales of 872 million from the divestment of a portion of fmcs european herbicide portfolio to nufarm limited and certain products of our india portfolio to crystal crop protection limited these divestitures satisfied fmcs commitment to the european commission and the competition commission of india respectively for regulatory requirements in order to complete the dupont crop protection acquisition additionally there were environmental related charges of 217 million for remediation activities and 26 million of other charges 

nonoperating pension and postretirement charges income 

2020 vs 2019 

the charge for 2020 was 212 million compared to 81 million in 2019 the increase in nonoperating pension and post retirement charges income is attributable to the continued approach of using the smoothed market related value of assets mrva as opposed to the actual fair value of plan assets in the determination of 2020 expense this continued approach will create some volatility in our nonoperating periodic pension cost since our qualified pension plan is 100 percent fixed income securities 

2019 vs 2018 

the charge for 2019 was 81 million compared to income of 05 million in 2018 the change was due to lower expected return on plan assets of approximately 10 million resulting from the full shift to a fixed income investment portfolio for the full year of 2019 versus the shift to a primarily fixed income investment portfolio for only a portion of the year in 2018 see note 15 for more information 

transactionrelated charges 

a detailed description of the transaction related charges is included in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements included within this form 10k 

provision for income taxes 

provision for income taxes for 2020 was expense of 1509 million resulting in an effective tax rate of 207 percent provision for income taxes for 2019 was expense of 1115 million resulting in an effective tax rate of 170 percent provision for income taxes for 2018 was expense of 708 million resulting in an effective tax rate of 116 percent note 13 to the consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k includes more details on the drivers of the gaap effective rate and yearoveryear changes we believe showing the reconciliation below of our gaap to nongaap effective tax rate provides investors with useful supplemental information about our tax rate on the core underlying business 



 

1 tax adjustments in 2020 2019 and 2018 are materially attributable to the effects of certain changes in prior year tax matters and the realizability of deferred tax assets in certain jurisdictions tax adjustments in 2018 also include the effects of the act primarily related to the onetime transition tax and the decrease in the us federal tax rate see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements included within this form 10k for additional discussion 

the primary drivers for the fluctuations in the effective tax rate for each period are provided in the table above excluding the items in the table above the changes in the nongaap effective tax rate were primarily due to the impact of geographic mix of earnings among our global subsidiaries see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for additional details related to the provisions for income taxes on continuing operations as well as items that significantly impact our effective tax rate 

discontinued operations net of income taxes 

our discontinued operations in periods up to its disposition represent our discontinued fmc lithium and fmc health and nutrition business results as well as adjustments to retained liabilities from other previously discontinued operations the primary liabilities retained include environmental liabilities other postretirement benefit liabilities selfinsurance longterm obligations related to legal proceedings and historical restructuring activities see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for additional details on our discontinued operations 

2020 vs 2019 

discontinued operations net of income taxes represented a loss of 283 million in 2020 compared to a loss of 633 million in 2019 the loss during both periods was primarily due to adjustments related to the retained liabilities from our previously discontinued operations offsetting the loss in both 2019 and 2020 were the gain on sale of two parcels of land in our discontinued site in newark california of 21 million and 24 million net of taxes respectively additionally during 2019 we included the net loss from our discontinued fmc lithium segment primarily due to separationrelated costs up to its separation date on march 1 2019 

2019 vs 2018 

discontinued operations net of income taxes represented a loss of 633 million in 2019 compared to a loss of 261 million in 2018 2019 included the net loss from our discontinued fmc lithium segment primarily due to separationrelated costs up to its separation date on march 1 2019 compared to income for the full year in 2018 offsetting the loss was the gain on sale from the sale of the first of two parcels of land of our discontinued site in newark california in 2019 during 2018 we recorded a charge of approximately 106 million as a result of active negotiations for a settlement agreement primarily to address discontinued operations at our middleport new york plant which was the subject of an administrative order on consent entered into with the epa and nysdec in 1991 the charge consisted of incremental estimated costs of remediation for certain offsite operable units associated with historic site operations as we engaged in settlement discussions with nysdec to resolve the path forward regarding remediation refer to note 12 for further details 

net income loss attributable to fmc stockholders 

2020 vs 2019 

net income loss attributable to fmc stockholders increased to 5515 million from 4774 million the higher results were driven by a slight increase in revenue as well as costsaving measures in selling general and administrative and research and development expenses in response to the pandemic restructuring and other charges were 388 million lower versus prior year and discontinued operations expense decreased 35 million compared to the prior year these increases to income were partially offset by higher tax expense and higher provision for income taxes of 394 million and higher nonoperating pension and postretirement charges of 131 million 

2019 vs 2018 

net income loss attributable to fmc stockholders decreased to 4774 million from 5021 million the decrease was primarily due to higher costs and expenses particularly restructuring and other charges associated with environmental remediation at our decommissioned plant near pocatello higher tax provisions and higher net interest expense this was partially offset by higher adjusted ebitda from higher volumes and pricing 

liquidity and capital resources 

cash and cash equivalents at december 31 2020 and 2019 were 5689 million and 3391 million respectively we held more cash on the balance sheet as a result of significantly increased cash from operations year over year and held it in advance of a seasonal working capital build in the first quarter of the cash and cash equivalents balance at december 31 2020 5605 million was held by our foreign subsidiaries the cash held by foreign subsidiaries for permanent reinvestment is generally used to finance the subsidiaries’ operating activities and future foreign investments we have not provided income taxes for other outside basis differences inherent in our investments in subsidiaries because the investments and related unremitted earnings are essentially permanent in duration or we have concluded that no additional tax liability will arise upon disposal or remittance see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements included within this form 10k for more information 

at december 31 2020 we had total debt of 32678 million as compared to 32588 million at december 31 2019 total debt included 29295 million and 30311 million of longterm debt excluding current portions of 936 million and 828 million at december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively early in the second quarter of 2020 we amended the revolving credit facility and 2017 term loan agreements to increase the maximum leverage ratio in order to address potential liquidity constraints that might arise due to the covid19 pandemic although we had not then and have not since experienced any liquidity issues as a result of the economic impacts of the pandemic we determined that it would be prudent to take this step as the higher leverage ratio provides significant headroom above any of the covid19 related scenarios assessed by the company additionally during the second quarter we fully repaid the 500 million revolver draw made late in the first quarter at the height of the pandemic’s impact on shortterm financing markets as of december 31 2020 we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants see note 14 in the consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k for further details we remain committed to solid investment grade credit metrics and expect fullyear average leverage to be in line with this commitment in 2020 

the decrease in longterm debt was primarily due to paydowns on the 2017 term loan facility which is scheduled to mature on november 1 2022 the borrowings under the 2017 term loan facility will bear interest at a floating rate which will be a base rate or a eurocurrency rate equal to the london interbank offered rate for the relevant interest period plus in each case an applicable margin as determined in accordance with the provisions of the 2017 term loan facility the decrease in longterm debt was offset by the increase in shortterm debt 

our shortterm debt consists of foreign borrowings and our commercial paper program foreign borrowings decreased from 1449 million at december 31 2019 to 984 million at december 31 2020 while outstanding commercial paper increased from zero at december 31 2019 to 1463 million at december 31 2020 we provide parentcompany guarantees to lending institutions providing credit to our foreign subsidiaries 

our commercial paper program allows us to borrow at rates generally more favorable than those available under our credit facility at december 31 2020 we had 1463 million borrowings outstanding under the commercial paper program at an average borrowing rate of 05 percent our commercial paper balances fluctuate from year to year depending on working capital needs and status on receivables collections 

revolving credit facility and 2017 term loan agreement amendment 

on april 22 2020 we amended both our revolving credit agreement and 2017 term loan agreement which among other things increased the maximum leverage ratio financial covenant and added a negative covenant restricting purchases of the company’s stock if at any time the maximum leverage ratio exceeds 35 through the period ending june 30 2021 see note 14 for further details 

statement of cash flows 

cash provided required by operating activities was 7368 million 5556 million and 3627 million for 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively 

the table below presents the components of net cash provided required by operating activities for comparability the prior period amounts for change in all other operating assets and liabilities have been recast to reflect the current period presentation 



 

1 the change in trade receivables in all periods include the impacts of seasonality and the receivable build intrinsic in our business the change in cash flows related to trade receivables in 2020 was driven by timing of collections as well as higher sales collection timing is more pronounced in certain countries such as brazil where there may be terms significantly longer than the rest of our business additionally timing of collection is impacted as amounts for all periods include carryover balances remaining to be collected in latin america where collection periods are measured in months rather than weeks during 2020 we collected approximately 931 million of receivables in brazil 

2 advance payments are typically received in the fourth quarter of each year primarily in our north america operations as revenue associated with advance payments is recognized generally in the first half of each year following the seasonality of that business as shipments are made and title ownership and risk of loss pass to the customer the change in 2020 was primarily related to lower overall payments received and higher application of funds to accounts receivable balances year over year 

3 these rebates are primarily associated within north america and to a lesser extent brazil and in north america generally settle in the fourth quarter of each year given the end of the respective crop cycle the changes year over year are associated with the mix in sales eligible for rebates and incentives in 2020 compared to 2019 and 2018 and timing of certain rebate payments 

4 changes in inventory in 2020 are a result of significant market impacts during the fourth quarter related to logistics and supply chain constraints in the us reduced demand in the us brazil and argentina and products held by foreign customs changes in inventory in 2019 and 2018 are a result of inventory levels being adjusted to take into consideration the change in market conditions 

5 the change in cash flows related to accounts payable in 2020 2019 and 2018 is primarily due to timing of payments made to suppliers and vendors 2019 was partially impacted during portions of 2019 from global supply chain issues primarily in china which required us to obtain raw materials on payment terms shorter than normal

9 there were no voluntary contributions to our us qualified defined benefit plan in 2020 amounts in 2019 and 2018 include voluntary contributions to our us qualified defined benefit plan of 70 million and 300 million respectively 

10 interest payments were basically flat versus prior year 

11 amounts shown in the chart represent net tax payments of our continuing operations the decrease in net tax payments in 2020 as compared to prior periods is primarily attributable to the deferral of income tax payments in various jurisdictions as a result of the covid19 pandemic tax payments in 2019 primarily represent the payments of tax attributable to the nufarm limited sale transition tax and tax payments related to the acquired dupont crop protection business tax payments in 2018 primarily represent the payments of tax attributable to the fmc health and nutrition segment disposition transition tax and full year tax payments related to the acquired dupont crop protection business

cash required in 2019 is primarily due to capital expenditures and spending related to our contract manufacturing arrangements as well as continued spending during that period associated with the implementation of a new sap system 

cash required in 2018 is primarily due to higher capital expenditure spending as well as incremental capitalizable corporate level spending associated with the implementation of a new sap system partially offset by the sale of product portfolios of approximately 88 million that were required to complete the dupont crop protection business acquisition

cash provided required by financing activities was 2503 million 870 million and 3973 million in 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively 

the change in cash required by financing activities in 2020 is primarily driven by the prior year proceeds from the senior notes and higher dividend payments offset by a reduction in the payment of long term debt and a reduction of repurchases of common stock under our publicly announced program 

the change in cash required by financing activities in 2019 is primarily due to the proceeds from the senior notes offset by cash outflows including higher repurchases of common stock repayment of longterm debt and higher dividend payments in 

2019 as compared to the prior period 2018 included the net proceeds from the ipo of fmc lithium which were more than offset by repayments of longterm debt dividend payments and repurchases of common stock 

cash provided required by financing activities of discontinued operations was zero  372 million and 340 million in 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively 

cash required by financing activities of discontinued operations in 2019 represents debt repayments on fmc lithiums external debt as well as cash payments associated with its separation cash provided by financing activities of discontinued operations in 2018 represents the proceeds from borrowing of longterm debt of our discontinued fmc lithium segment 

free cash flow 

we define free cash flow a nongaap financial measure as all cash inflows and outflows excluding those related to financing activities such as debt repayments dividends and share repurchases and acquisition related investing activities free cash flow is calculated as all cash from operating activities reduced by spending for capital additions and other investing activities as well as legacy and transformation spending therefore our calculation of free cash flow will almost always result in a lower amount than cash from operating activities from continuing operations the most directly comparable us gaap measure however the free cash flow measure is consistent with managements assessment of operating cash flow performance and we believe it provides a useful basis for investors and securities analysts about the cash generated by routine business operations including capital expenditures in addition to assessing our ability to repay debt fund acquisitions and return capital to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends 

our use of free cash flow has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for an analysis of our results under us gaap first free cash flow is not a substitute for cash provided required by operating activities of continuing operations as it is not a measure of cash available for discretionary expenditures since we have nondiscretionary obligations primarily debt service that are not deducted from the measure second other companies may calculate free cash flow or similarly titled nongaap financial measures differently or may use other measures to evaluate their performance all of which could reduce the usefulness of free cash flow as a tool for comparison additionally the utility of free cash flow is further limited as it does not reflect our future contractual commitments and does not represent the total increase or decrease in our cash balance for a given period because of these and other limitations free cash flow should be considered along with cash provided required by operating activities of continuing operations and other comparable financial measures prepared and presented in accordance with us gaap 

the table below presents a reconciliation of free cash flow from the most directly comparable us gaap measure 

free cash flow reconciliation 



 

1 represents payments for legal and professional fees associated with the dupont crop protection business acquisition in addition to costs related to integrating the dupont crop protection business see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for more information 

2 adjusted cash from operations is defined as cash provided required by operating activities of continuing operations excluding the effects of transactionrelated cash flows which are included within legacy and transformation 

3 components of cash provided required by investing activities of continuing operations refer to the below discussion for further details 

4 cash spending associated with contract manufacturers was 174 million 517 million and 131 million for the years ended december 31 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively 

5 refer to the above discussion for further details 

6 includes our legacy liabilities such as environmental remediation and other legal matters that are reported in discontinued operations as well as business integration costs associated with the dupont crop protection business acquisition and the implementation of our new sap system 

2021 cash flow outlook 

our cash needs for 2021 include operating cash requirements which are impacted by contributions to our pension plan as well as environmental asset retirement obligation and restructuring spending capital expenditures and legacy and transformation spending as well as mandatory payments of debt dividend payments and share repurchases we plan to meet our liquidity needs through available cash cash generated from operations commercial paper issuances and borrowings under our committed revolving credit facility at december 31 2020 our remaining borrowing capacity under our credit facility was 11396 million 

we expect 2021 free cash flow nongaap to increase to a range of approximately 530 million to 620 million driven by growth in adjusted cash from operations and reduced legacy and transformation spending which is forecasted to be partially offset by a significant year over year increase in capital additions this increase in capital additions primarily relates to resuming or advancing projects that were delayed or deferred in 2020 due to the pandemic 

although we provide a forecast for free cash flow a nongaap financial measure we are not able to forecast the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with us gaap which is cash provided required by operating activities of continuing operations certain elements of the composition of the us gaap amount are not predictable making it impractical for us to forecast such elements include but are not limited to restructuring acquisition charges and discontinued operations as a result no us gaap outlook is provided 

cash from operating activities of continuing operations 

we expect higher cash from operating activities excluding the effects of transactionrelated cash flows primarily driven by higher forecasted adjusted ebitda as well as continued improvement in working capital to be in the range of approximately 790 million to 950 million transactionrelated cash flows are included within legacy and transformation which is consistent with how we evaluate our business operations from a cash flow standpoint see below for further discussion cash from operating activities includes cash requirements related to our pension plans environmental sites restructuring and asset retirement obligations taxes and interest on borrowings 

pension 

we do not expect to make any voluntary cash contributions to our us qualified defined benefit pension plan in 2021 the plan is fully funded and our portfolio is comprised of 100 percent fixed income securities and cash our investment strategy is a liability hedging approach with an objective of maintaining the funded status of the plan such that the funded status volatility is minimized and the likelihood that we will be required to make significant contributions to the plan is limited 

environmental 

projected 2021 spending includes approximately 58 million to 68 million of net environmental remediation spending for our sites accounted for within continuing operations environmental obligations for continuing operations primarily represent obligations at shut down or abandoned facilities within businesses that do not meet the criteria for presentation as discontinued operations this spending includes approximately 43 million related to our environmental remediation site near pocatello idaho primarily as a result of a litigation judgment against us in the pocatello tribal litigation described in note 12 of the total 2021 projected spend at this site 205 million was paid in the first quarter of 2021 and an additional 117 million payment for past years permit fees plus interest associated with these payments will also be made in 2021 

total projected 2021 environmental spending inclusive of both sites accounted for within continuing operations and discontinued sites discussed within legacy and transformation below is expected to be in the range of 115 million to 125 million 

restructuring and asset retirement obligations 

we expect to make payments of approximately 25 to 35 million in 2021 of which approximately 10 million is related to exit and disposal costs as a result of our decision to exit sales of all carbofuran formulations including furadan® insecticidenematicide as well as curaterr® insecticidenematicide and any other brands used with carbofuran products see note 9 for more information 

capital additions and other investing activities 

projected 2021 capital expenditures and expenditures related to contract manufacturers are expected to be in the range of approximately 160 million to 200 million the spending is mainly driven by continuing progress on projects delayed or deferred in 2020 due to the pandemic primarily for diamide capacity expansion and new active ingredient capacity expenditures related to contract manufacturers are included within other investing activities 

legacy and transformation 

projected 2021 legacy and transformation spending are expected to be in the range of approximately 100 million to 130 million this is primarily driven by environmental remediation spending and legacy liabilities except for the completion of certain inflight initiatives primarily associated with the finalization of our worldwide erp system we completed the integration of the dupont crop protection business as of june 30 2020 as noted the tsa is now terminated and the last phase of the erp system transition went live in november 2020 with a stabilization period that will go into the first quarter of 2021 cash outflows for these initiatives are expected to be approximately 15 million in 2021 

projected 2021 spending includes approximately 53 million to 63 million of net environmental remediation spending for our discontinued sites these projections include spending as a result of a settlement reached in the second quarter of 2019 at our middleport new york site the settlement will result in spending of approximately 25 million in 2021 

total projected 2021 environmental spending inclusive of both sites accounted for within continuing operations discussed within cash from operating activities of continuing operations above and discontinued sites is expected to be in the range of 115 million to 125 million 

share repurchases 

during the year ended december 31 2020 04 million shares were repurchased under the publicly announced repurchase program for approximately 50 million at december 31 2020 approximately 550 million remained unused under our boardauthorized repurchase program we intend to purchase between 400 million to 500 million of our common shares in 2021 this repurchase program does not include a specific timetable or price targets and may be suspended or terminated at any time shares may be purchased through open market or privately negotiated transactions at the discretion of management based on its evaluation of market conditions and other factors we also reacquire shares from time to time from employees in connections with vesting exercise and forfeiture of awards under our equity compensation plans 

dividends 

on january 21 2021 we paid dividends aggregating 623 million to our shareholders of record as of december 31 2020 this amount is included in accrued and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2020 for the years ended december 31 2020 2019 and 2018 we paid 2285 million 2103 million and 892 million in dividends respectively we expect to continue to make quarterly dividend payments future cash dividends as always will depend on a variety of factors including earnings capital requirements financial condition general economic conditions and other factors considered relevant by us and is subject to final determination by our board of directors 

commitments 

we provide guarantees to financial institutions on behalf of certain customers principally customers in brazil for their seasonal borrowing the total of these guarantees was 1406 million at december 31 2020 these guarantees arise during the ordinary course of business from relationships with customers and nonconsolidated affiliates nonperformance by the guaranteed party triggers the obligation requiring us to make payments to the beneficiary of the guarantee based on our experience these types of guarantees have not had a material effect on our consolidated financial position or on our liquidity our expectation is that future payment or performance related to the nonperformance of others is considered unlikely 

in connection with certain of our property and asset sales and divestitures we have agreed to indemnify the buyer for certain liabilities including environmental contamination and taxes that occurred prior to the date of sale our indemnification obligations with respect to these liabilities may be indefinite as to duration and may or may not be subject to a deductible minimum claim amount or cap in cases where it is not possible for us to predict the likelihood that a claim will be made or to make a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential loss or range of loss no specific liability has been recorded if triggered we may be able to recover certain of the indemnity payments from third parties in cases where it is possible we have recorded a specific liability within our reserve for discontinued operations refer to note 11 for further details 

our total significant committed contracts that we believe will affect cash over the next four years and beyond are as follows 



 

1 excluding discounts 

2 contractual interest is the interest we are contracted to pay on our longterm debt obligations we had 7000 million of longterm debt subject to variable interest rates at december 31 2020 the rate assumed for the variable interest component of the contractual interest obligation was the rate in effect at december 31 2020 variable rates are determined by the market and will fluctuate over time 

3 obligations associated with operating leases before sublease rental income 

4 purchase obligations consist of agreements to purchase goods and services that are enforceable and legally binding and specify all significant terms including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased price provisions and timing of the transaction we have entered into a number of purchase obligations for the sourcing of materials and energy where takeorpay arrangements apply since the majority of the minimum obligations under these contracts are takeorpay commitments over the life of the contract and not a year by year takeorpay the obligations in the table related to these types of contacts are presented in the earliest period in which the minimum obligation could be payable under these types of contracts 

5 as of december 31 2020 the liability for uncertain tax positions was 831 million this liability is excluded from the table above additionally accrued pension and other postretirement benefits and our environmental liabilities as recorded on our consolidated balance sheets are excluded from the table above due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of potential future cash flows associated with these liabilities we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and periods in which these liabilities might be paid also excluded from the table above is the liability attributable to the transition tax on deemed repatriated foreign earnings incurred as a result of the act of 1078 million

climate change 

as a global corporate citizen we are concerned about the consequences of climate change and will take prudent and cost effective actions that reduce green house gas ghg emissions to the atmosphere 

fmc is committed to continuing to do its part to address climate change and its impacts our 2030 intensity reduction targets for energy and greenhouse gas emissions are both 25 percent from our 2018 baseline year fmc has been reporting its ghg emissions and mitigation strategy to cdp formerly carbon disclosure project since 2016 fmc detailed the business risks and opportunities we have due to climate change and its impacts in our cdp climate change reports fmc received a b  in the cdp climate change questionnaire in 2020 in 2021 fmc will begin conducting climate related scenario analyses in line with the taskforce for climaterelated financial disclosures recommendations to better understand our risks and opportunities with respect to climate change 

even as we take action to control the release of ghgs additional warming is anticipated longterm higher average global temperatures could result in induced changes in natural resources growing seasons precipitation patterns weather patterns species distributions water availability sea levels and biodiversity these impacts could cause changes in supplies of raw materials used to maintain fmc’s production capacity and could lead to possible increased sourcing costs depending on how pervasive the climate impacts are in the different geographic locations experiencing changes in natural resources fmc’s customers could be impacted demand for fmc’s products could increase if our products meet our customers’ needs to adapt to climate change impacts or decrease if our products do not meet their needs within our own operations we continually assess our manufacturing sites worldwide for risks and opportunities to increase our preparedness for climate change we are continuing to evaluate sea level rise and storm surge at our plants to understand timing of potential impacts and proactive responses that may need to be taken to lessen fmc’s overall environmental footprint we have taken actions to increase the energy efficiency in our manufacturing sites we have also committed to new 2030 goals to reduce our water use intensity in 

highrisk areas by 20 percent and to maintain our 2018 waste disposed intensity which otherwise would increase by 55 percent due to expected growth and shifts in production mix 

in our product portfolio we see market opportunities for our products to address climate change and its impacts for example fmcs agricultural products can help customers increase yield energy and water efficiency and decrease greenhouse gas emissions our products can also help growers adapt to more unpredictable growing conditions and the effects these types of threats have on crops fmc has committed to invest 100 percent of our innovation budget to developing sustainable products and solutions for future use 

we are improving existing products and developing new platforms and technologies that help mitigate impacts of climate change fmc is developing products with a lighter environmental footprint in its biologicals products these opportunities could lead to new products and services for our existing and potential customers beyond our products and operations fmc recognizes that energy consumption throughout our supply chain can impact climate change and product costs therefore we will actively work with our entire value chain  suppliers contractors and customers  to improve their energy efficiencies and to reduce their ghg emissions 

we continue to follow legislative and regulatory developments regarding climate change because the regulation of greenhouse gases depending on their nature and scope could subject some of our manufacturing operations to additional costs or limits on operations in december 2015 195 countries at the united nations climate change conference in paris reached an agreement to reduce ghgs it remains to be seen how and when each of these countries will implement this agreement 

fmc will actively manage climate risks and incorporate them in our decision making as indicated in our responses to the cdp climate change module the united states climate alliance a coalition of 24 states governing 55 percent of the population and unincorporated selfgoverning territories in the united states have expressed their commitment to upholding the objectives of the 2015 paris agreement on climate change within their borders several of our manufacturing and rd sites fall within this alliance territory fmc remains deeply committed to reducing our ghg emissions and energy consumption at all our facilities around the world 

some of our foreign operations are subject to national or local energy management or climate change regulation such as our plant in denmark that is subject to the eu emissions trading scheme at present that plant’s emissions are below its designated cap 

in december 2019 the european commission approved the european green deal with the goal of making the eu carbon neutral by 2050 the green deal includes investment plans and a roadmap to fight against climate change fmc is closely following updates and the discussion surrounding the green deal the costs of complying with possible future requirements are difficult to estimate at this time 

future ghg regulatory requirements may result in increased costs of energy additional capital costs for emissions control or new equipment andor costs associated with cap and trade or carbon taxes we are currently monitoring regulatory developments the costs of complying with possible future climate change requirements are difficult to estimate at this time

critical accounting policies 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles us gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses we have described our accounting policies in note 1 principal accounting policies and related financial information to our consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k we have reviewed these accounting policies identifying those that we believe to be critical to the preparation and understanding of our consolidated financial statements we have reviewed these critical accounting policies with the audit committee of the board of directors critical accounting policies are central to our presentation of results of operations and financial condition in accordance with us gaap and require management to make estimates and judgments on certain matters we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience current conditions and other reasonable factors 

revenue recognition and trade receivables 

we recognize revenue when or as we satisfy our performance obligation which is when the customer obtains control of the good or service rebates due to customers are accrued as a reduction of revenue in the same period that the related sales are recorded based on the contract terms refer to note 3 to our consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k for more information 

we record amounts billed for shipping and handling fees as revenue costs incurred for shipping and handling are recorded as costs of sales and services amounts billed for sales and use taxes valueadded taxes and certain excise and other specific transactional taxes imposed on revenueproducing transactions are presented on a net basis and excluded from sales in the consolidated income statements we record a liability until remitted to the respective taxing authority 

we periodically enter into prepayment arrangements with customers and receive advance payments for product to be delivered in future periods these advance payments are recorded as deferred revenue and classified as advance payments from customers on the consolidated balance sheet revenue associated with advance payments is recognized as shipments are made and transfer of control to the customer takes place 

trade receivables consist of amounts owed to us from customer sales and are recorded when revenue is recognized the allowance for trade receivables represents our best estimate of the probable losses associated with potential customer defaults in developing our allowance for trade receivables we use a two stage process which includes calculating a general formula to develop an allowance to appropriately address the uncertainty surrounding collection risk of our entire portfolio and specific allowances for customers where the risk of collection has been reasonably identified either due to liquidity constraints or disputes over contractual terms and conditions 

our method of calculating the general formula consists of estimating the recoverability of trade receivables based on historical experience current collection trends and external business factors such as economic factors including regional bankruptcy rates and political factors our analysis of trade receivable collection risk is performed quarterly and the allowance is adjusted accordingly 

we also hold longterm receivables that represent longterm customer receivable balances related to pastdue accounts which are not expected to be collected within the current year our policy for the review of the allowance for these receivables is consistent with the discussion in the preceding paragraph above on trade receivables therefore on an ongoing basis we continue to evaluate the credit quality of our longterm receivables utilizing aging of receivables collection experience and writeoffs as well as existing economic conditions to determine if an additional allowance is necessary 

environmental obligations and related recoveries 

we provide for environmentalrelated obligations when they are probable and amounts can be reasonably estimated where the available information is sufficient to estimate the amount of liability that estimate has been used where the information is only sufficient to establish a range of probable liability and no point within the range is more likely than any other the lower end of the range has been used 

estimated obligations to remediate sites that involve oversight by the united states environmental protection agency epa or similar government agencies are generally accrued no later than when a record of decision rod or equivalent is issued or upon completion of a remedial investigationfeasibility study rifs or equivalent that is submitted by us to the appropriate government agency or agencies estimates are reviewed quarterly by our environmental remediation management as well as by financial and legal management and if necessary adjusted as additional information becomes available the estimates can change substantially as additional information becomes available regarding the nature or extent of site contamination required remediation methods and other actions by or against governmental agencies or private parties 

our environmental liabilities for continuing and discontinued operations are principally for costs associated with the remediation andor study of sites at which we are alleged to have released hazardous substances into the environment such costs principally include among other items rifs site remediation costs of operation and maintenance of the remediation 

plan management costs fees to outside law firms and consultants for work related to the environmental effort and future monitoring costs estimated site liabilities are determined based upon existing remediation laws and technologies specific site consultants’ engineering studies or by extrapolating experience with environmental issues at comparable sites 

included in our environmental liabilities are costs for the operation maintenance and monitoring of site remediation plans omm such reserves are based on our best estimates for these omm plans over time we may incur omm costs in excess of these reserves however we are unable to reasonably estimate an amount in excess of our recorded reserves because we cannot reasonably estimate the period for which such omm plans will need to be in place or the future annual cost of such remediation as conditions at these environmental sites change over time such additional omm costs could be significant in total but would be incurred over an extended period of years 

included in the environmental reserve balance other assets balance and disclosure of reasonably possible loss contingencies are amounts from third party insurance policies which we believe are probable of recovery 

provisions for environmental costs are reflected in income net of probable and estimable recoveries from named potentially responsible parties prps or other third parties in the fourth quarter of 2019 we increased our reserves for the pocatello tribal matter by 728 million which represents both the historical and discounted present value of future annual use permit fees as well as the associated legal costs see note 12 for further information all other environmental provisions incorporate inflation and are not discounted to their present value 

in calculating and evaluating the adequacy of our environmental reserves we have taken into account the joint and several liability imposed by comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla and the analogous state laws on all prps and have considered the identity and financial condition of the other prps at each site to the extent possible we have also considered the identity and financial condition of other third parties from whom recovery is anticipated as well as the status of our claims against such parties although we are unable to forecast the ultimate contributions of prps and other third parties with absolute certainty the degree of uncertainty with respect to each party is taken into account when determining the environmental reserve by adjusting the reserve to reflect the facts and circumstances on a sitebysite basis our liability includes our best estimate of the costs expected to be paid before the consideration of any potential recoveries from third parties we believe that any recorded recoveries related to prps are realizable in all material respects recoveries are recorded as either an offset in environmental liabilities continuing and discontinued or as other assets in our consolidated balance sheets in accordance with us accounting literature 

see note 12 to our consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k for changes in estimates associated with our environmental obligations 

impairments and valuation of longlived and indefinitelived assets 

our longlived assets primarily include property plant and equipment goodwill and intangible assets the assets and liabilities of acquired businesses are measured at their estimated fair values at the dates of acquisition the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired including identified intangibles is recorded as goodwill the determination and allocation of fair value to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is based on various assumptions and valuation methodologies requiring considerable management judgment including estimates based on historical information current market data and future expectations the principal assumptions utilized in our valuation methodologies include revenue growth rates operating margin estimates and discount rates although the estimates were deemed reasonable by management based on information available at the dates of acquisition those estimates are inherently uncertain 

we test for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the net book value of our property plant and equipment may not be recoverable from the estimated undiscounted expected future cash flows expected to result from their use and eventual disposition in cases where the estimated undiscounted expected future cash flows are less than net book value an impairment loss is recognized equal to the amount by which the net book value exceeds the estimated fair value of assets which is based on discounted cash flows at the lowest level determinable the estimated cash flows reflect our assumptions about selling prices volumes costs and market conditions over a reasonable period of time 

we perform an annual impairment test of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets in the third quarter of each year or more frequently whenever an event or change in circumstances occurs that would require reassessment of the recoverability of those assets in performing our evaluation we assess qualitative factors such as overall financial performance of our reporting units anticipated changes in industry and market structure competitive environments planned capacity and cost factors such as raw material prices based on our assessment for 2020 we determined that no goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets impairment charge to our continuing operations was required 

see note 9 to our consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k for charges associated with longlived asset disposal costs and the activity associated with the restructuring reserves 

pension and other postretirement benefits 

we provide qualified and nonqualified defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans as well as postretirement health care and life insurance benefit plans to our employees and retirees the costs benefits and obligations related to these benefits reflect key assumptions related to general economic conditions including interest discount rates healthcare cost trend rates expected rates of return on plan assets and the rates of compensation increase for employees the costs benefits and obligations for these benefit programs are also affected by other assumptions such as average retirement age mortality employee turnover and plan participation to the extent our plans’ actual experience as influenced by changing economic and financial market conditions or by changes to our own plans’ demographics differs from these assumptions the costs and obligations for providing these benefits as well as the plans’ funding requirements could increase or decrease when actual results differ from our assumptions the difference is typically recognized over future periods in addition the unrealized gains and losses related to our pension and postretirement benefit obligations may also affect periodic benefit costs benefits in future periods 

we use several assumptions and statistical methods to determine the asset values used to calculate both the expected rate of return on assets component of pension cost and to calculate our plans’ funding requirements the expected rate of return on plan assets is based on a marketrelated value of assets that recognizes investment gains and losses over a fiveyear period we use an actuarial value of assets to determine our plans’ funding requirements the actuarial value of assets must be within a certain range high or low of the actual market value of assets and is adjusted accordingly 

we select the discount rate used to calculate pension and other postretirement obligations based on a review of available yields on highquality corporate bonds as of the measurement date in selecting a discount rate as of december 31 2020 we placed particular emphasis on a discount rate yieldcurve provided by our actuary this yieldcurve when populated with projected cash flows that represent the expected timing and amount of our plans benefit payments produced an effective discount rate of 249 percent for our us qualified plan 162 percent for our us nonqualified and 191 percent for our us other postretirement benefit plans 

the discount rates used to determine projected benefit obligation at our december 31 2020 and 2019 measurement dates for the us qualified plan were 249 percent and 322 percent respectively the effect of the change in the discount rate from 322 percent to 249 percent at december 31 2020 resulted in a 1059 million increase to our us qualified pension benefit obligations the effect of the change in the discount rate used to determine net annual benefit cost income from 436 percent at december 31 2019 to 322 percent at december 31 2020 resulted in a 01 million decrease to the 2020 us qualified pension expense 

the change in discount rate from 322 percent at december 31 2019 to 249 percent at december 31 2020 was attributable to a decrease in yields on high quality corporate bonds with cash flows matching the timing and amount of our expected future benefit payments between the 2019 and 2020 measurement dates using the december 31 2020 and 2019 yield curves our us qualified plan cash flows produced a single weightedaverage discount rate of approximately 249 percent and 322 percent respectively 

in developing the assumption for the longterm rate of return on assets for our us plan we take into consideration the technical analysis performed by our outside actuaries including historical market returns information on the assumption for longterm real returns by asset class inflation assumptions and expectations for standard deviation related to these best estimates our longterm rate of return for the fiscal year ended december 31 2020 2019 and 2018 was 300 percent 425 percent and 500 percent respectively 

for the sensitivity of our pension costs to incremental changes in assumptions see our discussion below 

sensitivity analysis related to key pension and postretirement benefit assumptions 

a onehalf percent increase in the assumed discount rate would have decreased pension and other postretirement benefit obligations by 726 million and 721 million at december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively and decreased pension and other postretirement benefit costs by zero 06 million and 04 million for 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively a onehalf percent decrease in the assumed discount rate would have increased pension and other postretirement benefit obligations by 793 million and 794 million at december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively and increased pension and other postretirement benefit cost by 01 million 05 million and 01 million for 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively 

a onehalf percent increase in the assumed expected longterm rate of return on plan assets would have decreased pension costs by 62 million 63 million and 64 million for 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively a onehalf percent decrease in the assumed longterm rate of return on plan assets would have increased pension costs by 62 million 63 million and 64 million for 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively 

further details on our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and net periodic benefit costs benefits are found in note 15 to our consolidated financial statements in this form 10k 

income taxes 

we have recorded a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets in certain jurisdictions to the amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized in assessing the need for this allowance we have considered a number of factors including future taxable income the jurisdictions in which such income is earned and our ongoing tax planning strategies in the event that we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period such determination was made similarly should we conclude that we would be able to realize certain deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase income in the period such determination was made 

additionally we file income tax returns in the us federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions certain income tax returns for fmc entities taxable in the us and significant foreign jurisdictions are open for examination and adjustment we assess our income tax positions and record a liability for all years open to examination based upon our evaluation of the facts circumstances and information available at the reporting date for those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained we have recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information we adjust these liabilities if necessary upon the completion of tax audits or changes in tax law 

on december 22 2017 the act was enacted in the united states the act reduced the us federal corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent required companies to pay a onetime transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred and created new taxes on certain foreign sourced earnings at december 31 2018 the company had completed its accounting for the impacts of the enactment of the act 

see note 13 to our consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k for additional discussion surrounding income taxes 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

our earnings cash flows and financial position are exposed to market risks relating to fluctuations in commodity prices interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates our policy is to minimize exposure to our cash flow over time caused by changes in commodity interest and currency exchange rates to accomplish this we have implemented a controlled program of risk management consisting of appropriate derivative contracts entered into with major financial institutions 

the analysis below presents the sensitivity of the market value of our financial instruments to selected changes in market rates and prices the range of changes chosen reflects our view of changes that are reasonably possible over a oneyear period market value estimates are based on the present value of projected future cash flows considering the market rates and prices chosen 

at december 31 2020 our net financial instrument position was a net liability of 253 million compared to a net liability of 89 million at december 31 2019 the change in the net financial instrument position was primarily due to exchange rate fluctuations in our foreign exchange portfolio 

since our risk management programs are generally highly effective the potential loss in value for each risk management portfolio described below would be largely offset by changes in the value of the underlying exposure 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

the primary currencies for which we have exchange rate exposure are the us dollar versus the euro the chinese yuan the brazilian real mexican peso indian rupee and the argentine peso foreign currency debt and foreign exchange forward contracts are used in countries where we do business thereby reducing our net asset exposure foreign exchange forward contracts are also used to hedge firm and highly anticipated foreign currency cash flows 

to analyze the effects of changing foreign currency rates we have performed a sensitivity analysis in which we assume an instantaneous 10 percent change in the foreign currency exchange rates from their levels at december 31 2020 and 2019 with all other variables including interest rates held constant 



interest rate risk 

one of the strategies that we can use to manage interest rate exposure is to enter into interest rate swap agreements in these agreements we agree to exchange at specified intervals the difference between fixed and variable interest amounts calculated on an agreedupon notional principal amount in the quarter ended december 31 2020 we had outstanding interest rate swap contracts in place with an aggregate notional value of 1000 million 

to analyze the effects of changing interest rates we have performed a sensitivity analysis in which we assume an instantaneous one percent change in the interest rates from their levels at december 31 2020 and 2019 with all other variables held constant 



our debt portfolio at december 31 2020 is composed of 72 percent fixedrate debt and 28 percent variablerate debt the variablerate component of our debt portfolio principally consists of borrowings under our 2017 term loan facility credit facility commercial paper program variablerate industrial and pollution control revenue bonds and amounts outstanding under foreign subsidiary credit lines changes in interest rates affect different portions of our variablerate debt portfolio in different ways 

based on the variablerate debt in our debt portfolio at december 31 2020 a one percentage point increase in interest rates would have increased gross interest expense by 93 million and a one percentage point decrease in interest rates would have decreased gross interest expense by 26 million for the year ended december 31 2020

 item 1 business 

general 

we are a pureplay agricultural sciences company providing innovative solutions to growers around the world with a robust product portfolio fueled by a marketdriven discovery and development pipeline in crop protection plant health and professional pest and turf management this powerful combination of advanced technologies includes leading insect control products based on rynaxypyr® and cyazypyr® active ingredients authority® boral® centium® command® and gamit® branded herbicides talstar® and hero® branded insecticides and flutriafolbased fungicides the fmc portfolio also includes biologicals such as quartzo® and presence® bionematicides our products are used in agriculture to enhance crop yield and quality by controlling a broad spectrum of insects weeds and disease as well as in nonagricultural markets for pest control 

fmc strategy 

we have streamlined our portfolio over the past nine years to become a tierone leader and the fifth largest global provider in the global agricultural chemicals market our strong competitive position is based on our technology and innovation as well as our geographic balance and crop balance which helped fmc to take market share in both 2018 and 2019 

we have industryleading insecticides and herbicides the majority of which are patented technologies exceptional discovery research capabilities and a global manufacturing network we expect to spend approximately 7 percent of sales on research and development annually our rd pipeline includes 7 molecules in our development pipeline approximately 17 years away from commercialization and an additional 15 molecules in our discovery pipeline approximately 810 years from commercialization we expect the first two significant product launches out of this pipeline will occur in 2021 we own a total of 26 manufacturing plants and we have the scale to operate with strong resources and global reach to address changing market conditions our supply chain organization effectively managed to continue supplying our customers and growing our business despite multiple shutdowns and other disruptions in the chinese chemical sector in 2018 and 2019 

our revenues grew approximately 8 percent year over year in 2019 driven by lowteens growth for our insecticides rynaxypr® and cyazypyr® insect control as well as midsingle digit growth for the rest of our portfolio rynaxypr® and cyazypyr® insect control now represent over 16 billion in combined sales representing approximately 40 percent growth since we acquired these molecules in november 2017 products launched in 2019 also contributed to revenue growth we successfully launched our new bixafen fungicide under the lucento® brand in north america in 2019 and we now expect peak sales to exceed the original 30 million to 50 million range we forecasted for this new active ingredient at our 2018 investor day we also launched 30 new formulated products in 2019 which is key to lifecycle management of our products 

fmc far outperformed the crop protection market in 2019 which we estimate was flat versus 2018 fmc’s innovation is driving this outperformance starting with our current portfolio of advanced products and continuing through our rd discovery development and new formulations our technology portfolio includes specific innovations in plant health application technology and delivery systems and it is expanding to offer advanced agronomic insights through precision agriculture tools that will leverage artificial intelligence and machine learning 

we maintain our commitment to enterprise sustainability including responsible product stewardship we are committed to delivering products that maintain a safe and secure food supply and to do so with a reduced impact on the planet to reflect this commitment and to reset the baseline following our transformation into a pureplay agricultural sciences company we reset our sustainability goals in october 2019 as we grow we will do so in a responsible way safety and business ethics will remain of utmost importance meeting and exceeding our customers’ expectations will continue to be a primary focus 

acquisitions and divestitures 

in 2017 we completed the acquisition from e i du pont de nemours and company “dupont of certain assets relating to duponts crop protection business and research and development organization dupont crop protection business collectively the dupont crop protection business acquisition in connection with this transaction we sold to dupont our fmc health and nutrition segment and paid dupont 12 billion in cash our fmc health and nutrition business and its results have been presented as a discontinued operation for all periods presented throughout this document 

in 2019 we completed the separation of our fmc lithium segment which was renamed livent corporation or livent following its initial public offering ipo that closed on october 15 2018 after completion of the ipo fmc owned 123 million shares of livents common stock representing approximately 84 percent of the total outstanding shares of livents common stock on march 1 2019 we completed the distribution of 123 million shares of common stock of livent as a pro rata dividend on shares of fmc following the distribution fmc has zero shares of livent and zero exposure to lithium markets we have recast all the data within this filing to present the former fmc lithium as a discontinued operation retrospectively for all periods presented 

financial information about our business 

financial information in millions 

the following table shows the principal products produced by our business its raw materials and uses 



with a worldwide manufacturing and distribution infrastructure we are better able to respond rapidly to global customer needs offset downward economic trends in one region with positive trends in another and match local revenues to local costs to reduce the impact of currency volatility the charts below detail our sales by major geographic region and major product category 

the following table provides our longlived assets by major geographical region 



products and markets 

our portfolio is comprised of three major pesticide categories insecticides herbicides and fungicides the majority of our product lines consist of insecticides and herbicides and we have a small but fastgrowing portfolio of fungicides mainly used in high value crop segments our insecticides are used to control a wide spectrum of pests while our herbicide portfolio primarily targets a large variety of difficulttocontrol weeds we are also investing substantially in a plant health program that includes biological crop protection products seed treatments and micronutrients 

in the latin american region which includes the large agricultural market of brazil we sell directly to large growers through our own sales and marketing organization and we access the market through independent distributors and coops in north america we access the market through several major national and regional distributors and have our own sales and marketing organization in canada we access the european markets through our own sales and marketing organizations we access key asian markets through large distributors in addition to either local independent distributors or our own sales and marketing organizations through these and other alliances along with our own targeted marketing efforts access to novel technologies and our innovation initiatives we expect to maintain and enhance our access in key agricultural and noncrop markets and develop new products that will help us continue to compete effectively 

industry overview 

the three principal categories of agricultural and noncrop chemicals are herbicides insecticides and fungicides representing approximately 41 percent 29 percent and 27 percent of global industry revenue respectively 

the agrochemicals industry is more consolidated following several recent mergers of the leading crop protection companies which now include fmc chemchina owners of syngenta and adama bayer ag acquired monsanto in 2018 basf ag and corteva agriscience the agricultural division of former dowdupont spun out in june 2019 these five companies currently represent approximately 68 percent of the crop protection industry’s global sales the next tier of agrochemical producers include sumitomo chemical company ltd nufarm ltd and united phosphorous ltd upl also acquired arysta in february 2019 fmc employs various differentiated strategies and competes with unique technologies focusing on certain crops markets and geographies while also being supported by a lowcost manufacturing model 

growth 

we are among the leading agrochemical producers in the world some of our key insecticides are predominantly based on patentprotected active ingredients and continue to grow well above market patterns our complementary technologies combine improved formulation capabilities and a broader innovation pipeline resulting in new and differentiated products we will take advantage of enhanced market access positions and an expanded portfolio to deliver nearterm growth 

we will continue to grow by obtaining new and approved uses for existing product lines and acquiring accessing developing marketing distributing andor selling complementary chemistries and related technologies in order to strengthen our product portfolio and our capabilities to effectively service our target markets and customers 

our growth efforts focus on developing environmentally compatible and sustainable solutions that can effectively increase farmers’ yields and provide costeffective alternatives to chemistries which may be prone to resistance we are committed to providing unique differentiated products to our customers by acquiring and further developing technologies as well as investing in innovation to extend product life cycles our external growth efforts include product acquisitions inlicensing of chemistries and technologies and alliances that bolster our market access complement our existing product portfolio or provide entry into adjacent spaces we have entered into a range of development and distribution agreements with other companies that provide access to new technologies and products which we can subsequently commercialize 

diamide growth strategy 

our product portfolio features two key diamideclass molecules – rynaxypyr® chlorantraniliprole and cyazypyr® cyantraniliprole insect controls – with combined annual revenues of approximately 16 billion in 2019 these two molecules are classleading in terms of performance combining highly effective low dose rates with fastacting systemic long residual control these attributes quickly established rynaxypyr® as the world’s leading insect control technology and we expect it to continue on a strong growth trajectory notwithstanding the expiration of composition of matter patents covering chlorantraniliprole active ingredients ai in certain countries starting in late 2022 our cyazypyr® insect control product a secondgeneration diamide is growing quickly as we obtain more product registrations and we expect it as well to continue to grow strongly notwithstanding the expiration of its active ingredient composition of matter patents starting in the mid2020s this expectation is based on not only our broad patent estate and the timing of key patent milestones but also on other critical elements that will allow fmc to continue to profitably grow the diamide franchise well beyond the expiration of key patents these other critical elements include registration and data protection commercial strategies brand recognition as well as manufacturing and supply chain complexity and fmc efficiencies 

patents and trade secrets the fmc diamide insect control patent estate is made up of many different patent families which cover composition of matter – both ai and certain intermediates manufacturing processes – both ai and certain intermediates formulations uses and applications for rynaxypyr® insect control as of december 31 2019 we had 21 granted patent families filed in 76 countries with a total of 639 granted and pending patents together with cyazypyr® insect control related patents we have over 30 patent families and close to 1000 granted and pending patents see “patents trademarks and licenses” within this item 1 for more details fmc’s process patents cover the manufacturing processes for both active ingredients – chlorantraniliprole and cyantraniliprole – as well as key intermediates that are used to make the final products chlorantraniliprole is a complex molecule to produce requiring 16 separate steps fmc owns granted patents covering many of these 16 process steps and several of the intermediate chemicals and we protect other aspects of the manufacturing processes by trade secret cyantraniliprole is similarly complex and covered by a comparable range of intellectual property many of these intermediate process patents run well past the expiration of the composition of matter patents and in some cases stretch until the end of this decade third parties that intend to manufacture and sell generic chlorantraniliprole or cyantraniliprole and rely on fmc’s extensive product safety data will be required to demonstrate that their product has the same regulatory safety profile as fmc rynaxypyr® and cyazypyr® insect controls to meet regulatory requirements for such difficulttomanufacture molecules we believe that third parties will have to produce these active ingredients using the same processes that are patented by fmc and if so would be infringing before patent expiration and subject to our challenge for infringement fmc also owns formulation patents which cover the use of chlorantraniliprole or cyantraniliprole in specific formulations found in commercially important enduse products 

regulatory data protection in addition to the patent estate various pesticide laws and regulations around the world offer added protection to the initial active ingredient registrant in the form of data protection and registration timelines that can extend after the composition or process patents have expired these rules can effectively provide a product innovator and initial active ingredient registrant such as fmc with a further period of exclusive use of the key reference data even after the applicable ai composition of matter patents have expired further in certain countries even after the period of exclusive use has expired a generic entrant seeking to rely on the initial registrant’s reference data may have to pay significant compensation to the initial registrant for fmc’s diamide products such rights apply in key markets including united states brazil and the european union 

growing the branded fmc diamide franchise fmc is actively pursuing a strategy of allowing others to sell enduse pesticide products that include rynaxypyr® and cyazypyr® insect controls before patent expiration these arrangements may include limited patent data andor trademark licenses as well as longterm commitments to purchase the diamide active ingredients from fmc such partner relationships allow us to grow our business by having others develop and sell diamidebased products to meet farmers needs not within our current portfolio offering those farmers a better alternative to competing insecticides with product safety or efficacy profiles which are less attractive than rynaxypyr® or cyazypyr® insect controls these agreements generally require the third party to use the wellknown and trusted rynaxypyr® or cyazypyr® brand names on the enduse products formulated with active ingredient supplied by fmc as of december 31 2019 we had four global agreements and 41 separate localcountry agreements covering 11 countries we are continuing to explore opportunities with additional companies beyond those with whom we are already engaged 

complexity of manufacturing today fmc manufactures all the required intermediates in the multistep processes as well as the final rynaxypyr® and cyazypyr® products at our own active ingredient manufacturing plants or through key contract manufacturers who produce under longterm exclusive technologylicense agreements for a third party to replicate this complex supply chain and manufacturing network would be a major undertaking with very large capital requirements in addition given our manufacturing knowhow scale of our operations and continual investment in manufacturing process improvement we believe fmc’s manufacturing costs will be substantially lower than any other party seeking to produce these diamide products 

collectively these four factors  deep patent estate proprietary regulatory data strong commercial approach leveraging our brand recognition and capabilities of managing large scale manufacturing complexity – provide us the basis for our expectation that fmc will be the company of choice to supply chlorantraniliprole and cyantraniliprole products to thirdparty partners and ultimately to farmers well into the future 

source and availability of raw materials 

we utilize numerous vendors to supply raw materials and intermediate chemicals to support operations these materials are sourced on a global basis to strategically balance fmc’s vendor portfolio 

patents trademarks and licenses 

as an agricultural sciences company fmc believes in innovation and in protecting that innovation through intellectual property rights we own and license a significant number of us and foreign patents trademarks trade secrets and other intellectual property that are cumulatively important to our business the fmc intellectual property estate provides us with a significant competitive advantage which we seek to expand and renew on a continual basis we manage our technology investment to discover and develop new active ingredients and biological products as well as to continue to improve manufacturing processes and existing active ingredients through new formulations mixtures or other concepts fmc’s technology innovation processes capture those innovations and protect them through the most appropriate form of intellectual property rights we also inlicense certain active ingredients and other technologies under patents held by third parties and have granted licenses to certain of our patents to third parties 

our patents cover many aspects of our business including our chemical and biological active ingredients intermediate chemicals manufacturing processes to produce such active ingredients or intermediates formulations and product uses as well as many aspects of our research and development activities that support the fmc new product pipeline patents are granted by individual jurisdictions and the duration of our patents depends on their respective jurisdictions and payment of annuities 

as of december 31 2019 the company owned a total of approximately 200 active granted us patents and over 2500 active granted foreign patents we also have approximately 1600 patent applications pending globally 

in our current product portfolio our diamide insect control products based on rynaxypyr® chlorantraniliprole and cyazypyr® cyantraniliprole active ingredients have a substantial patent estate which will remain in force well into the future more details regarding our diamide granted patent estate are set forth in the tables below 



patent families were only placed under one type but may cover several types 



we also own many trademarks that are well recognized by customers or product endusers unlike patents ownership rights in trademarks can be continued indefinitely so long as the trademarks are properly used and renewal fees are paid 

we actively monitor and manage our patents and trademarks to maintain our rights in these assets and we strategically take aggressive action when we believe our intellectual property rights are being infringed while we believe that the invalidity or loss of any particular patent trademark or license would be a remote possibility our patent and trademark estate related to our diamide insect control products based on rynaxypyr® and cyazypyr® active ingredients in the aggregate are of material importance to our operations 

seasonality 

the seasonal nature of the crop protection market and the geographic spread of our business can result in significant variations in quarterly earnings among geographic locations our products sold in the northern hemisphere north america europe and parts of asia serve seasonal agricultural markets from march through september generally resulting in significant earnings in the first and second quarters and to a lesser extent in the fourth quarter markets in the southern hemisphere latin america and parts of the asia pacific region including australia are served from july through february generally resulting in earnings in the third fourth and first quarters 

competition 

we encounter substantial competition in our business we market our products through our own sales organization and through alliance partners independent distributors and sales representatives the number of our principal competitors varies from market to market in general we compete by providing advanced technology high product quality reliability quality customer and technical service and by operating in a costefficient manner 

our business competes primarily in the global chemical crop protection market for insecticides herbicides and fungicides industry products include crop protection chemicals and for certain major competitors genetically engineered crop biotechnology products competition from generic agrochemical producers is significant as a number of key product patents have expired in the last two decades in general we compete as an innovator by focusing on product development including novel formulations proprietary mixes and advanced delivery systems and by acquiring or licensing mostly proprietary chemistries or technologies that complement our product and geographic focus we also differentiate ourselves by our global costcompetitiveness through our manufacturing strategies establishing effective product stewardship programs and developing strategic alliances that strengthen market access in key countries and regions 

research and development expense 

the development efforts in our business focus on developing environmentally sound solutions — both new active ingredients and new product formulations — that costeffectively increase farmers’ yields and provide alternatives to existing and new chemistries on june 24 2019 we announced our investment of more than 50 million over the next three years at our fmc stine research center in newark delaware to upgrade infrastructure and complete construction on a new stateoftheart greenhouse and laboratory facility

 item 1a risk factors 

among the factors that could have an impact on our ability to achieve operating results and meet our other goals are 

industry risks 

pricing and volumes in our markets are sensitive to a number of industry specific and global issues and events including 

• competition and new agricultural technologies  our business faces competition which could affect our ability to maintain or raise prices successfully enter certain markets or retain our market position competition for our business includes not only generic suppliers of the same pesticidal active ingredients but also alternative proprietary pesticide chemistries and crop protection technologies that are bred into or applied onto seeds increased generic presence in agricultural chemical markets has been driven by the number of significant product patents and product data protections that have expired in the last decade and this trend is expected to continue also there are changing competitive dynamics in the agrochemical industry as some of our competitors have consolidated resulting in them having greater scale and diversity as well as market reach these competitive differences may not be overcome and may erode our business agriculture in many countries is changing and new technologies eg precision pest prediction or application data management continue to emerge at this time the scope and potential impact of these technologies are largely unknown but could have the potential to disrupt our business 

• climatic conditions  our markets are affected by climatic conditions which could adversely impact crop pricing and pest infestations for example drought may reduce the need for fungicides which could result in fewer sales and greater unsold inventories in the market whereas excessive rain could lead to increased plant disease or weed growth requiring growers to purchase and use more pesticides drought andor increased temperatures may change insect pest pressures requiring growers to use more less or different insecticides natural disasters can impact production at our facilities in various parts of the world the nature of these events makes them difficult to predict 

• cyclicality  while our business is well balanced geographically in any given calendar quarter a certain geographyies will predominate in light of seasonal variations in the demand for our products given the nature of the crop protection market and the geographic regions in which we operate unexpected market conditions in that predominating geographyies such as adverse weather pest pressures or other risks described herein may impact our business if occurring during a calendar quarter in which such geographyies is predominating 

• changing regulatory environment and public perception  changes in the regulatory environment particularly in the us brazil china india argentina and the european union could adversely impact our ability to continue producing andor selling certain products in our domestic and foreign markets or could increase the cost of doing so additionally changes to the regulatory environment may be influenced by nongovernment public pressure as a result of negative perception regarding the use of our crop protection products we are sensitive to this general regulatory risk given the need to obtain and maintain pesticide registrations in every country in which we sell our products many countries require reregistration of pesticides to meet new and more challenging requirements while we defend our products vigorously these reregistration processes may result in significant additional data costs reduced number of permitted product uses or potential product cancellation compliance with changing laws and regulations may involve significant costs or capital expenditures or require changes in business practice that could result in reduced profitability in the european union the regulatory risk specifically includes the chemicals regulation known as reach registration evaluation and authorization of chemicals which requires manufacturers to verify through a special registration system that their chemicals can be marketed safely 

• geographic presence outside of us  we have a strong presence in latin america europe and asia as well as in the us growth of our geographic footprint particularly in europe and key asian countries such as india means that developments outside the us will generally have a more significant effect on our operations than in the past our operations outside the us are subject to special risks and restrictions including fluctuations in currency values exchange control regulations changes in local political or economic conditions governmental pricing directives import and trade restrictions or tariffs import or export licensing requirements and trade policy restrictions on the ability to repatriate funds and other potentially detrimental domestic and foreign governmental practices or policies affecting us companies doing business abroad 

• climate change and government regulation of greenhouse gases  the effects of climate change such as rising sea levels drought flooding and general volatility in seasonal temperatures could adversely affect our operations globally extreme weather events attributable to climate change may result in among other things physical damage to our property and equipment and interruptions to our supply chain climate change may also impact markets in which we sell our products where for example a prolonged drought may result in decreased demand for our products the more gradual effects of persistent temperature change in geographies with significant agricultural lands may result in changes in lands suitable for agriculture or changes in the mix of crops suitable for cultivation and the pests that may be present in such geographies for example prolonged increase in average temperature may make northern lands suitable for growing crops not grown historically in such climes leading farmers to shift from crops such as wheat to 

soybean and may result in new or different weed plant disease or insect pressures on such crops – such changes would impact the mix of pesticide products farmers would purchase which may be adverse for us depending on the local market and our product mix additionally changes in the governmental regulation of greenhouse gases depending on their nature and scope could subject our manufacturing operations to significant additional costs or limits on operations 

• fluctuations in commodity prices  our operating results could be significantly affected by the cost of commodities  both chemical raw material commodities and harvested crop commodities we may not be able to raise prices or improve productivity sufficiently to offset future increases in chemical raw material commodity pricing accordingly increases in such commodity prices may negatively affect our financial results we use hedging strategies to address material commodity price risks where hedge strategies are available on reasonable terms however we are unable to avoid the risk of medium and longterm increases additionally fluctuations in harvested crop commodity prices could negatively impact our customers ability to sell their products at previously forecasted prices resulting in reduced customer liquidity inadequate customer liquidity could affect our customers’ abilities to pay for our products and therefore affect existing and future sales or our ability to collect on customer receivables 

• supply arrangements  certain raw materials are critical to our production processes and our purchasing strategy and supply chain design are complex while we have made supply arrangements to meet planned operating requirements an inability to obtain the critical raw materials or operate under contract manufacturing arrangements would adversely impact our ability to produce certain products and could lead to operational disruption and increase uncertainties around business performance we increasingly source critical intermediates and finished products from a number of suppliers largely outside of the us and principally in china an inability to obtain these products or execute under contract sourcing arrangements would adversely impact our ability to sell products 

• economic and political change  our business has been and could continue to be adversely affected by economic and political changes in the markets where we compete including inflation rates recessions trade restrictions tariff increases or potential new tariffs foreign ownership restrictions and economic embargoes imposed by the us or any of the foreign countries in which we do business changes in laws taxation and regulations and the interpretation and application of these laws taxes and regulations restrictions imposed by the us government or foreign governments through exchange controls or taxation policy nationalization or expropriation of property undeveloped property rights and legal systems or political instability other governmental actions and other external factors over which we have no control economic and political conditions within the us and foreign jurisdictions or strained relations between countries can cause fluctuations in demand price volatility supply disruptions or loss of property in argentina continued inflation and foreign exchange controls could adversely affect our business realignment of change in regional economic arrangements could have an operational impact on our businesses in china unpredictable enforcement of environmental regulations could result in unanticipated shutdowns in broad geographic areas impacting our contract manufacturers and raw material suppliers 

operational risks 

• market access risk  our results may be affected by changes in distribution channels which could impact our ability to access the market 

• business disruptions  we produce products through a combination of owned facilities and contract manufacturers we own and operate largescale active ingredient manufacturing facilities in the us mobile puerto rico manati china pudong and jinshan denmark ronland and india panoli our operating results are dependent in part on the continued operation of these production facilities interruptions at these facilities may materially reduce the productivity of a particular manufacturing facility or the profitability of our business as a whole although we take precautions to enhance the safety of our operations and minimize the risk of disruptions our operations and those of our contract manufacturers are subject to hazards inherent in chemical manufacturing and the related storage and transportation of raw materials products and wastes these potential hazards include explosions fires severe weather and natural disasters mechanical failure unscheduled downtimes supplier disruptions labor shortages or other labor difficulties information technology systems outages disruption in our supply chain or manufacturing and distribution operations transportation interruptions chemical spills discharges or releases of toxic or hazardous substances or gases shipment of contaminated or offspecification product to customers storage tank leaks other environmental risks or other sudden disruption in business operations beyond our control as a result of events such as acts of sabotage terrorism or war civil or political unrest natural disasters large scale power outages and public health epidemicspandemics some of these hazards may cause severe damage to or destruction of property and equipment or personal injury and loss of life and may result in suspension of operations or the shutdown of affected facilities further outbreaks of pandemics such as the covid19 wuhan coronavirus currently impacting china and other countries or the fear of such events could provoke responses including government imposed travel restrictions which may impact access to our production sites the ability of raw material suppliers to produce and deliver goods to us our ability to ship our products to production warehousing or customer sites or the ability of our sales organization to make sales or for customers or indirect customers such as farmers to purchase our products 

• litigation and environmental risks  current reserves relating to our ongoing litigation and environmental liabilities may ultimately prove to be inadequate 

• hazardous materials  we manufacture and transport certain materials that are inherently hazardous due to their toxic or volatile nature while we take precautions to handle and transport these materials in a safe manner if they are mishandled or released into the environment they could cause property damage or result in personal injury claims against us 

• environmental compliance  we are subject to extensive federal state local and foreign environmental and safety laws regulations directives rules and ordinances concerning among other things emissions in the air discharges to land and water and the generation handling treatment disposal and remediation of hazardous waste and other materials we may face liability arising out of the normal course of business including alleged personal injury or property damage due to exposure to chemicals or other hazardous substances at our current or former facilities or chemicals that we manufacture handle or own we take our environmental responsibilities very seriously but there is a risk of environmental impact inherent in our manufacturing operations and transportation of chemicals any substantial liability for environmental damage could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows 

• compliance with laws and regulations  the global regulatory environment is becoming increasingly complex and requires more resources to effectively manage which may increase the potential for misunderstanding or misapplication of regulatory standards 

• workforce  the inability to recruit and retain key personnel or the unexpected loss of key personnel may adversely affect our operations in addition our future success depends in part on our ability to identify and develop talent to succeed senior management and other key members of the organization 

technology risks 

• information technology security and data privacy risks  as with all enterprise information systems our information technology systems could be penetrated by outside parties’ intent on extracting information corrupting information deploying ransomware or disrupting business processes our systems have in the past been and likely will in the future be subject to unauthorized access attempts unauthorized access could disrupt our business operations and could result in failures or interruptions in our computer systems lockout from systems due to ransomware or in the loss of assets and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations in addition breaches of our security measures or the accidental loss inadvertent disclosure or unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential information about the company our employees our vendors or our customers could result in litigation violations of various data privacy regulations in some jurisdictions and also potentially result in a liability while we have taken measures to assess the requirements of and to comply with the european unions general data protection regulation and data privacy regulations in other countries these measures may be challenged by authorities that regulate datarelated compliance we could incur significant expense in facilitating and responding to investigations and if the measures we have taken prove to be inadequate we could face fines or penalties this could damage our reputation or otherwise harm our business financial condition or results of operations 

• technological and new product discoverydevelopment  our ability to compete successfully depends in part upon our ability to maintain a superior technological capability and to continue to identify develop and commercialize new and innovative high valueadded products for existing and future customers our investment in the discovery and development of new pesticidal active ingredients relies on discovery of new chemical molecules or biological strains such discovery processes depend on our scientists being able to find new molecules and strains which are novel and outside of patents held by others and such moleculesstrains being efficacious against target pests and our ability to develop those molecules and strains into new products without creating an undue risk to human health and the environment and then meeting applicable regulatory criteria the timeline from active ingredient discovery through full development and product launch averages 810 years depending on local regulatory requirements the complexity and duration of developing new products create risks that product concepts may fail during development or when launched may not meet thencurrent market needs or competitive conditions 

portfolio management and integration risks 

• portfolio management risks  we continuously review our portfolio which includes the evaluation of potential business acquisitions that may strategically fit our business and strategic growth initiatives if we are unable to successfully integrate and develop our acquired businesses we could fail to achieve anticipated synergies which would include expected cost savings and revenue growth failure to achieve these anticipated synergies could materially and adversely affect our financial results in addition to strategic acquisitions we evaluate the diversity of our portfolio in light of our objectives and alignment with our growth strategy in implementing this strategy we may not be successful in separating underperforming or nonstrategic assets the gains or losses on the divestiture of or lost operating income from such assets eg divesting may affect the company’s earnings moreover we may incur asset 

impairment charges related to acquisitions or divestitures that reduce earnings significant effort will likely be required to ensure that the right mix of resources are trained engaged and focused on achieving business objectives while adhering to our core values of safety ethics and compliance 

• innovation and intellectual property  our innovation efforts are protected by patents trade secrets and other intellectual property rights that cover many of our current products manufacturing processes and product uses as well as many aspects of our research and development activities supporting our new product pipeline trademarks protect valuable brands associated with our products patents and trademarks are granted by individual jurisdictions and the duration of our patents depends on their respective jurisdictions and payment of annuities our future performance will depend on our ability to address active ingredient composition of matter patent expirations through effective enforcement of our patents that continue to cover key chemical intermediates and process patents as well as portfolio life cycle management particularly for our high value diamide insecticides see diamide growth strategy and patents trademarks and licenses in item 1 for more details if our innovation efforts fail to continue to make process improvements to reduce costs such conditions could impede our competitive position some of our competitors may secure patents on production methods or uses of products that may limit our ability to compete costeffectively 

• enforcement of intellectual property rights  the composition of matter patents on our rynaxypyr® active ingredient is nearing its expiration in several key countries we have a broad estate of additional patents regarding the production of rynaxypyr® active ingredient as well as trademark and data exclusivity protection in certain countries that extend well beyond the active ingredient composition of matter patents see diamide growth strategy and patents trademarks and licenses in item 1 we intend to strategically and vigorously enforce our patents and other forms of intellectual property and have done so already against several third parties other third parties may seek to enter markets with infringing products or may find alternative production methods that avoid infringement or we may not be successful in litigating to enforce our patents due to the risks inherent in any litigation patents involve complex factual and legal issues and thus the scope validity or enforceability of any patent claims we have or may obtain cannot be clearly predicted patents may be challenged in the courts as well as in various administrative proceedings before us or foreign patent offices and may be deemed unenforceable invalidated or circumvented we are currently and may in the future be a party to various lawsuits or administrative proceedings involving our patents such challenges can result in some or all of the claims of the asserted patent being invalidated or deemed unenforceable in such circumstances an adverse patent enforcement decision which could lead to the entry of competing chlorantraniliprole products in relevant markets may materially and adversely impact our financial results 

• system implementation and integration risks  failure to successfully integrate the acquired dupont crop protection business and transition the management information systems of the dupont crop protection business from the erp system provided under transition services agreement by dupont to a management information system integrated with fmc’s legacy processes could result in interruption of operations or failure to achieve synergies we expect this could cause our future results of operations to be materially worse than expected 

• major enterprise initiatives  in addition to the continued integration of the dupont crop protection business assets we are implementing other major initiatives such as the migration to a single global instance of sap s4 hana these projects will place significant demands on certain of our internal functional groups particularly finance and information technology failure to successfully execute these projects could materially and adversely affect our expected performance 

• potential tax implications of fmc lithium separation  we have received an opinion from outside counsel to the effect that the spinoff of fmc lithium as a distribution to our stockholders qualified as a nontaxable transaction for us federal income tax purposes the opinion is based on certain assumptions and representations as to factual matters from both fmc and fmc lithium as well as certain covenants by those parties the opinion cannot be relied upon if any of the assumptions representations or covenants is incorrect incomplete or inaccurate or is violated in any material respect the opinion of counsel is not binding upon the irs or the courts and there is no assurance that the irs or a court will not take a contrary position it is possible that the irs or a state or local taxing authority could take the position that aforementioned transaction results in the recognition of significant taxable gain by fmc in which case fmc may be subject to material tax liabilities 

financial risks 

• access to debt and capital markets  we rely on cash generated from operations and external financing to fund our growth and working capital needs limitations on access to external financing could adversely affect our operating results moreover interest payments dividends and the expansion of our business or other business opportunities may require significant amounts of capital we believe that our cash from operations and available borrowings under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to meet these needs in the foreseeable future however if we need external financing our access to credit markets and pricing of our capital will be dependent upon maintaining sufficient credit ratings from credit rating agencies and the state of the capital markets generally there can be no assurances that we would be able to obtain equity or debt financing on terms we deem acceptable and it is possible that the cost of any financings could increase significantly thereby increasing our expenses and decreasing our net income if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow or raise adequate external financing including as a result of significant disruptions in the global credit markets we could be forced to restrict our operations and growth opportunities which could adversely affect our operating results 

• credit default risks  we may use our existing revolving credit facility to meet our cash needs to the extent available in the event of a default in this credit facility or any of our senior notes we could be required to immediately repay all outstanding borrowings and make cash deposits as collateral for all obligations the facility supports which we may not be able to do any default under any of our credit arrangements could cause a default under many of our other credit agreements and debt instruments without waivers from lenders party to those agreements any such default could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue to operate 

• exposure to global economic conditions  deterioration in the global economy and worldwide credit and foreign exchange markets could adversely affect our business a worsening of global or regional economic conditions or financial markets could adversely affect both our own and our customers ability to meet the terms of sale or our suppliers ability to perform all their commitments to us a slowdown in economic growth in our international markets or a deterioration of credit or foreign exchange markets could adversely affect customers suppliers and our overall business there customers in weakened economies may be unable to purchase our products or it could become more expensive for them to purchase imported products in their local currency or sell their commodities at prevailing international prices and we may be unable to collect receivables from such customers 

• foreign exchange rate risks  we are an international company operating in many countries around the world and thus face foreign exchange rate risks in the normal course of our business we are particularly sensitive to the brazilian real the euro the indian rupee the chinese yuan the mexican peso the argentine peso and the us dollar while we engage in hedging and other strategies to mitigate those risks unexpected severe changes in foreign exchange may create risks that could materially and adversely affect our expected performance 

• uncertain tax rates  our future effective tax rates may be materially impacted by numerous items including a future change in the composition of earnings from foreign and domestic tax jurisdictions as earnings in foreign jurisdictions are typically taxed at different statutory rates than the us federal statutory rate accounting for uncertain tax positions business combinations expiration of statute of limitations or settlement of tax audits changes in valuation allowance changes in tax law currency gains and losses 

• uncertain recoverability of investments in longlived assets  we have significant investments in longlived assets and continually review the carrying value of these assets for recoverability in light of changing market conditions and alternative product sourcing opportunities we may recognize future impairments of longlived assets which could adversely affect our results of operations 

• pension and postretirement plans  obligations related to our pension and postretirement plans reflect certain assumptions to the extent actual experience differs from these assumptions our costs and funding obligations could increase or decrease significantly

 item 3 legal proceedings 

like hundreds of other industrial companies we have been named as one of many defendants in asbestosrelated personal injury litigation most of these cases allege personal injury or death resulting from exposure to asbestos in premises of fmc or to asbestoscontaining components installed in machinery or equipment manufactured or sold by discontinued operations the machinery and equipment businesses we owned or operated did not fabricate the asbestoscontaining component parts at issue in the litigation and to this day neither the us occupational safety and health administration nor the environmental protection agency has banned the use of these components further the asbestoscontaining parts for this machinery and equipment were accessible only at the time of infrequent repair and maintenance a few jurisdictions have permitted claims to proceed against equipment manufacturers relating to insulation installed by other companies on such machinery and equipment we believe that overall the claims against fmc are without merit 

as of december 31 2019 there were approximately 10400 premises and product asbestos claims pending against fmc in several jurisdictions since the 1980s approximately 116000 asbestos claims against fmc have been discharged the overwhelming majority of which have been dismissed without any payment to the claimant since the 1980s settlements with claimants have totaled approximately 106 million 

we intend to continue managing these asbestosrelated cases in accordance with our historical experience we have established a reserve for this litigation within our discontinued operations and believe that any exposure of a loss in excess of the established reserve cannot be reasonably estimated our experience has been that the overall trends in asbestos litigation have changed over time over the last several years we have seen changes in the jurisdictions where claims against fmc are being filed and changes in the mix of products named in the various claims because these claim trends have yet to form a predictable pattern we are presently unable to reasonably estimate our asbestos liability with respect to claims that may be filed in the future

other 2019 highlights 

on march 1 2019 we completed the previously announced distribution of 123 million shares of common stock of livent as a pro rata dividend on shares of fmc common stock outstanding at the close of business on the record date of february 25 2019 following the distribution we have zero shares of livent and zero exposure to lithium markets we have recast all the data within this filing to present fmc lithium as a discontinued operation retrospectively for all periods presented 

2020 outlook 

our 2020 expectation for the overall global crop protection market growth is that it will be up lowsingle digits in us dollars we expect all regions to be up lowsingle digits primarily driven by higher volumes in part due to new product launches in 2020 and to a lesser extent higher pricing slightly offset by negative foreign exchange impacts 

we expect 2020 revenue will be in the range of approximately 48 billion to 495 billion up approximately 6 percent at the midpoint versus 2019 we also expect adjusted ebitda 1 of 13 billion to 134 billion which represents 8 percent growth at the midpoint versus 2019 results 2020 adjusted earnings are expected to be in the range of 645 to 670 per diluted share 1  up 8 percent at the midpoint versus 2019 excluding any impact from potential share repurchases in 2020 for cash flow outlook refer to the liquidity and capital resources section below 

1 although we provide forecasts for adjusted earnings per share and adjusted ebitda nongaap financial measures we are not able to forecast the most directly comparable measures calculated and presented in accordance with us gaap certain elements of the composition of the us gaap amounts are not predictable making it impractical for us to forecast such elements include but are not limited to restructuring acquisition charges and discontinued operations as a result no us gaap outlook is provided 

results of operations — 2019 2018 and 2017 

overview 

the following charts provide a reconciliation of adjusted ebitda and adjusted earnings both of which are nongaap financial measures from the most directly comparable gaap measure adjusted ebitda is provided to assist the readers of our financial statements with useful information regarding our operating results our operating results are presented based on how we assess operating performance and internally report financial information for management purposes we report operating performance based on earnings before interest income taxes depreciation and amortization discontinued operations and corporate special charges our adjusted earnings measure excludes corporate special charges net of income taxes discontinued operations attributable to fmc stockholders net of income taxes and certain nongaap tax adjustments these are excluded by us in the measure we use to evaluate business performance and determine certain performancebased compensation these items are discussed in detail within the “other results of operations” section that follows in addition to providing useful information about our operating results to investors we also believe that excluding the effect of corporate special charges net of income taxes and certain nongaap tax adjustments from operating results and discontinued operations allows management and investors to compare more easily the financial performance of our underlying business from period to period these measures should not be considered as substitutes for net income loss or other measures of performance or liquidity reported in accordance with us gaap 



 

1 referred to as operating profit 

2 adjusted ebitda is defined as operating profit excluding corporate special charges income and depreciation and amortization expense 

3 see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements included within this form 10k for details of restructuring and other charges income 

4 our nonoperating pension and postretirement charges income are defined as those costs benefits related to interest expected return on plan assets amortized actuarial gains and losses and the impacts of any plan curtailments or settlements these are excluded from our operating results and are primarily related to changes in pension plan assets and liabilities which are tied to financial market performance and we consider these costs to be outside our operational performance we continue to include the service cost and amortization of prior service cost in our operating results noted above these elements reflect the current year operating costs to our businesses for the employment benefits provided to active employees 

5 charges relate to the expensing of the inventory fair value stepup resulting from the application of purchase accounting transaction costs costs for transitional employees other acquired employee related costs integration related legal and professional thirdparty fees amounts represent the following 



 

1 represents transaction costs costs for transitional employees other acquired employees related costs and transactionalrelated costs such as legal and professional thirdparty fees these charges are recorded as a component of “selling general and administrative expense on the consolidated statements of income loss 

2 these charges are included in “costs of sales and services” on the consolidated statements of income loss 

adjusted earnings reconciliation 



 

1 represents restructuring and other charges income nonoperating pension and postretirement charges income and transactionrelated charges 

2 the income tax expense benefit on corporate special charges income is determined using the applicable rates in the taxing jurisdictions in which the corporate special charge or income occurred and includes both current and deferred income tax expense benefit based on the nature of the nongaap performance measure 

3 we exclude the gaap tax provision including discrete items from the nongaap measure of income and instead include a nongaap tax provision based upon the annual nongaap effective tax rate the gaap tax provision includes certain discrete tax items including but not limited to income tax expenses or benefits that are not related to current year ongoing business operations tax adjustments associated with fluctuations in foreign currency remeasurement of certain foreign operations certain changes in estimates of tax matters related to prior fiscal years certain changes in the realizability of deferred tax assets and changes in tax law which includes the impact of the act enacted on december 22 2017 management believes excluding these discrete tax items assists investors and securities analysts in understanding the tax provision and the effective tax rate related to ongoing operations thereby providing investors with useful supplemental information about fmcs operational performance 

results of operations 

in the discussion below all comparisons are between the periods unless otherwise noted 

revenue 

2019 vs 2018 

revenue of 46098 increased 3245 million or approximately 8 percent versus the prior year period the increase was driven by higher volumes primarily in latin america and pricing which contributed approximately 8 percent and 3 percent respectively slightly offset by unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations of approximately 3 percent 

2018 vs 2017 

revenue of 42853 million increased 17541 million or approximately 69 percent versus the prior year period the increase was primarily due to the revenue from the dupont crop protection acquisition which was completed on november 1 2017 and contributed approximately 1742 million to the increase 

refer to the pro forma financial results with the dupont crop protection business section below for further discussion 

pro forma financial results with the dupont crop protection business 

we believe that reviewing our operating results by combining actual and pro forma results is more useful in identifying trends in or reaching conclusions regarding the overall operating performance of our business our pro forma information includes adjustments as if the dupont crop protection business acquisition had occurred on january 1 2017 our pro forma data is also adjusted for the effects of acquisition accounting but does not include adjustments for costs related to integration activities cost savings or synergies that might be achieved by the combined businesses pro forma amounts presented are not necessarily indicative of what our results would have been had we operated the dupont crop protection business since january 1 2017 nor our future results

2019 vs 2018 

north america revenue increased approximately 3 percent in the year ended december 31 2019 primarily driven by volume growth and strength of rynaxypyr® and cyazypyr® insect control on specialty crops the launch of lucento® fungicide and strong herbicide sales in canada 

latin america revenue increased approximately 19 percent or approximately 23 percent excluding foreign currency headwinds for the year ended december 31 2019 compared to the prior year period due primarily to strong demand in brazil for insecticides on cotton herbicides on sugarcane and insecticides in soybean applications strong growth in argentina due to improved market access and strength of herbicides in soybean applications also contributed to the significant growth in the region 

emea revenue increased approximately 4 percent versus the prior year period or approximately 10 percent excluding foreign currency headwinds primarily due to the successful launch of battle® delta herbicides and cyazypyr® insect control registrations across the region favorable weather demand for our diamide products and higher pricing throughout the region also contributed to the increase these increases were partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency impacts 

asia revenue increased approximately 3 percent versus the prior year period or approximately 8 percent excluding foreign currency headwinds primarily driven by continued strong growth in india and new products across the region partially offsetting the increases were adverse weather conditions in australia and challenged rice markets in china 

in late march 2019 there was an explosion within an industrial park in china which impacted one plant operated by one of our contract manufacturing tollers the local government has temporarily shut down the entire park to investigate the cause of the explosion we received material from the clean out of the equipment during the fourth quarter of 2019 and we are working closely with the supplier to determine the exact restart date of the operation our global manufacturing network provides significant supply chain flexibility due to the strength of our partnerships and our alternate sourcing options we believe we can continue to secure supply of the active ingredients normally manufactured at this location as needed 

pro forma combined results  2018 vs 2017 

pro forma combined revenue of 42853 million increased by approximately 11 percent versus the prior year period 

north america increase in the year ended december 31 2018 was due to very strong demand for the acquired insecticides growth in us soy acreage in 2018 and strong demand across niche crops these were partially offset by unfavorable impacts from the delayed start to the spring season 

latin america increase in the year ended december 31 2018 was due to strong growth for the acquired insecticides in soybean and other crops strong acreage growth in cotton and higher prices in brazil as well as higher wheat acreage in argentina partially offsetting these increases were unfavorable foreign currency impacts and severe drought in argentina 

emea increase in the year ended december 31 2018 was primarily due to strong growth of the acquired insecticides and herbicides the move to direct market access in france as well as sales synergies of legacy fmc products these were partially offset by a forced divestiture antitrust remedy unfavorable weather conditions that led to a shorter growing season and lower demand in northern and central europe 

asia increase in the year ended december 31 2018 was due to strong performance in rice and soy insecticides in india and growth in rice herbicides in china which was partially offset by a forced divestiture in india antitrust remedy the rationalization of the legacy portfolio in india and extreme drought conditions in australia 

gross margin 

2019 vs 2018 

gross margin of 20836 million increased 2038 million or approximately 11 percent versus the prior year period gross margin excluding transactionrelated charges also increased versus the prior year period by 1342 million the increase was primarily due to higher revenues driven by increased volume and pricing partially offset by higher costs primarily raw material costs 

gross margin percent of approximately 45 percent slightly increased from approximately 44 percent in the prior year period the increase from higher pricing was nearly offset by higher costs primarily raw material costs gross margin percent excluding transactionrelated charges of approximately 45 percent remained relatively flat compared to the prior year period 

2018 vs 2017 

gross margin of 18798 million increased 9280 million or approximately 97 percent versus the prior year period gross margin excluding transactionrelated charges increased versus the prior year period by 9774 million gross margin percent of approximately 44 percent increased from approximately 38 percent in the prior year period gross margin percent excluding transactionrelated charges of approximately 45 percent increased compared to approximately 38 percent in the prior year period the increase was primarily driven by higher margin products as well as a full year of earnings from the acquired dupont crop protection business 

selling general and administrative expenses 

2019 vs 2018 

selling general and administrative expenses of 7929 million slightly increased by 29 million versus the prior year period selling general and administrative expenses excluding transactionrelated charges increased 120 million or approximately 2 percent versus the prior year period

selling general and administrative expenses of 7900 million increased 2083 million or approximately 36 percent versus the prior year period selling general and administrative expenses excluding transactionrelated charges increased 2516 million or approximately 56 percent versus the prior year period the increase was primarily driven by a full year of operations of the acquired dupont crop protection business 

research and development expenses 

2019 vs 2018 

research and development expenses of 2981 million increased 104 million or approximately 4 percent versus the prior year period primarily due to continued investments in our global discovery and product development 

2018 vs 2017 

research and development expenses of 2877 million increased 1493 million or approximately 108 percent versus the prior year period the increase was primarily due to investments in discovery and product development from the acquired state of the art facilities from the dupont crop protection business acquisition

4 for the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018 pro forma results and actual results are the same 

2019 vs 2018 

adjusted ebitda of 12205 million increased 1116 million or approximately 10 percent versus the prior year period the increase was due to the strong demand which led to higher volumes and higher pricing as discussed above which contributed approximately 18 percent and 12 percent to the increase respectively the price increases were primarily seen in latin america these factors more than offset the higher costs primarily driven by higher raw material costs and unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations which impacted the change in adjusted ebitda by approximately 15 percent and 5 percent respectively 

pro forma combined results  2018 vs 2017 

2018 pro forma combined adjusted ebitda of 11089 million increased approximately 15 percent compared to 2017 the increase was primarily driven by revenue growth discussed above as our sales organization leveraged valuable crossselling opportunities due to minimal customer overlap with dupont additionally we reduced expected operating costs for the acquired dupont crop protection business through accelerated functional integration leveraging our back office infrastructure and reducing manufacturing costs at the acquired plants these were partially offset by higher raw material costs which have had a negative impact on results year over year this impacted the chemical industry broadly as the chinese government has been shutting down industrial parks as part of their environmental program we have been able to mitigate and manage the impact on our ability to supply our customer due to our diversified supply chain network 

other results of operations 

depreciation and amortization 

2019 vs 2018 

depreciation and amortization of 1501 million remained relatively flat as compared to 2018 of 1502 million 

2018 vs 2017

interest expense net of 1585 million increased by 254 million or approximately 19 percent compared to 1331 million in 2018 the increase was driven by the issuance of the senior notes discussed further below which increased interest expense by approximately 7 million and higher average foreign debt balances throughout the year which increased interest expense by approximately 17 million 

2018 vs 2017 

interest expense net of 1331 million increased by approximately 68 percent compared to 791 million in 2017 the increase was driven by the addition of the 2017 term loan facility used to fund the 2017 acquisition which increased interest expense by approximately 30 million and higher interest rates which increased interest expense by approximately 6 million the remaining increase of approximately 17 million was due to zero interest allocated to discontinued operations in 2018 as compared to 2017 due to the divestment of the fmc health and nutrition business to dupont in 2017 interest was previously allocated in accordance with relevant discontinued operations accounting guidance 

corporate special charges income 

restructuring and other charges income 

our restructuring and other charges income are comprised of restructuring assets disposals and other charges income as described below 



 

1 see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k for more information 

2019 

restructuring charges in 2019 primarily consisted of 341 million of charges related to our decision to exit sales of all carbofuran formulations globally and 264 million of charges associated with the integration of the dupont crop protection business these charges included severance accelerated depreciation on certain fixed assets and other costs benefits there were other miscellaneous restructuring charges 17 million we expect integrationrelated activity to end in 2020 

other charges income net in 2019 primarily consists of charges of environmental sites during the fourth quarter of 2019 we recorded a charge of 728 million a result of an unfavorable court ruling we received in relation to the pocatello tribal litigation at one of our environmental sites see note 12 for further information regarding this matter 

restructuring charges in 2018 were primarily associated with restructuring charges associated with the integration of the dupont crop protection business these charges primarily consisted of approximately 59 million of charges related to the change in our market access model in india and approximately 28 million of charges due to our decision to exit the ewing rd center refer to note 9 for more information other restructuring charges as we continue to integrate the acquired dupont crop protection business totaled approximately 22 million 

other charges income net in 2018 primarily consists of income from the gain on sales of 872 million from the divestment of a portion of fmcs european herbicide portfolio to nufarm limited and certain products of our india portfolio to crystal crop protection limited these divestitures satisfied fmcs commitment to the european commission and the competition commission of india respectively for regulatory requirements in order to complete the dupont crop protection acquisition additionally there were environmental related charges of 217 million for remediation activities and 26 million of other charges 

restructuring charges in 2017 includes impairment charges of intangible assets of 22 million and asset writedowns of approximately 55 million amounts also include miscellaneous restructuring charges of 08 million 

other charges income net in 2017 consisted of a 421 million impairment on certain indefinitelived intangible assets from the acquired dupont crop protection business acquisition as a result of a triggering event due to the tax cuts and jobs act the act other charges income also includes 162 million for environmental sites additionally we incurred exit costs of 48 million resulting from the termination and deconsolidation of our interest in a variable interest entity that was previously consolidated we had other miscellaneous charges net of approximately 16 million 

nonoperating pension and postretirement charges income 

2019 vs 2018 

the charge for 2019 was 81 million compared to income of 05 million in 2018 the change was due to lower expected return on plan assets of approximately 10 million resulting from the full shift to a fixed income investment portfolio for the full year of 2019 versus the shift to a primarily fixed income investment portfolio for only a portion of the year in 2018 

2018 vs 2017 

the income for 2018 was 05 million compared to 163 million in 2017 the decrease was primarily due to lower expected return on plan assets due to the partial shift to a primarily fixed income investment portfolio of approximately 16 million versus 2017 see note 15 for more information 

transactionrelated charges 

a detailed description of the transaction related charges is included in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements included within this form 10k 

provision for income taxes 

a significant amount of our earnings is generated by our foreign subsidiaries eg singapore hong kong and switzerland which tax earnings at lower statutory rates than the united states federal statutory rate our future effective tax rates may be materially impacted by numerous items including a future change in the composition of earnings from foreign and domestic tax jurisdictions as earnings in foreign jurisdictions are typically taxed at more favorable statutory rates than the united states federal statutory rate accounting for uncertain tax positions business combinations expiration of statute of limitations or settlement of tax audits changes in valuation allowance changes in tax law and the potential decision to repatriate certain future foreign earnings on which united states or foreign withholding taxes have not been previously accrued 

provision for income taxes for 2019 was expense of 1115 million resulting in an effective tax rate of 170 percent provision for income taxes for 2018 was expense of 708 million resulting in an effective tax rate of 116 percent provision for income taxes for 2017 was expense of 2289 million resulting in an effective tax rate of 2389 percent primarily attributable to the 3036 million of provisional tax expense associated with the act note 13 to the consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k includes more details on the drivers of the gaap effective rate and yearoveryear changes we believe showing the reconciliation below of our gaap to nongaap effective tax rate provides investors with useful supplemental information about our tax rate on the core underlying business 



 

1 tax adjustments in 2019 are materially attributable to the effects of tax law changes and the realizability of deferred tax assets in certain jurisdictions tax adjustments in 2018 are materially attributable to the effects of the act and primarily relate to the onetime transition tax the decrease in the us federal tax rate and the realizability of certain us state deferred tax assets tax adjustments in 2017 were primarily associated with the provisional income tax expense recorded as a result of the enactment of the act in december 2017 see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements included within this form 10k for additional discussion 

the primary drivers for the fluctuations in the effective tax rate for each period are provided in the table above excluding the items in the table above the changes in the effective tax rate were primarily due to the impact of geographic mix of earnings among our global subsidiaries see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for additional details related to the provisions for income taxes on continuing operations as well as items that significantly impact our effective tax rate 

discontinued operations net of income taxes 

our discontinued operations in periods up to its disposition represent our discontinued fmc lithium and fmc health and nutrition business results as well as adjustments to retained liabilities from other previously discontinued operations the primary liabilities retained include environmental liabilities other postretirement benefit liabilities selfinsurance longterm obligations related to legal proceedings and historical restructuring activities see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for additional details on our discontinued operations 

2019 vs 2018 

discontinued operations net of income taxes represented a loss of 633 million in 2019 compared to a loss of 261 million in 2018 the current year included the net loss from our discontinued fmc lithium segment primarily due to separationrelated costs up to its separation date on march 1 2019 compared to income for the full year in 2018 offsetting the loss was the gain on sale from the sale of the first of two parcels of land of our discontinued site in newark california in the current year during 2018 we recorded a charge of approximately 106 million as a result of active negotiations for a settlement agreement primarily to address discontinued operations at our middleport new york plant which was the subject of an administrative order on consent entered into with the epa and nysdec in 1991 the charge consisted of incremental estimated costs of remediation for certain offsite operable units associated with historic site operations as we engaged in settlement discussions with nysdec to resolve the path forward regarding remediation refer to note 12 for further details 

2018 vs 2017 

discontinued operations net of income taxes represented a loss of 261 million in 2018 compared to income of 6715 million in 2017 the decrease was primarily driven by the divestiture of fmc health and nutrition to dupont in the fourth quarter of 2017 which resulted in an aftertax gain of approximately 727 million which did not recur in 2018 discontinued operations net of income taxes in 2017 also includes the impairment charge of approximately 148 million net of tax to reflect the write down of our omega3 business to its sales price during 2018 we recorded a charge of approximately 106 million related to our discontinued environmental site at our middleport new york refer to note 12 for further details 

net income loss attributable to fmc stockholders 

2019 vs 2018 

net income attributable to fmc stockholders decreased to 4774 million from 5021 million the decrease was primarily due to higher costs and expenses particularly restructuring and other charges associated with environmental remediation at our decommissioned plant near pocatello higher tax provisions and higher net interest expense this was partially offset by higher adjusted ebitda from higher volumes and pricing 

2018 vs 2017 

net income attributable to fmc stockholders decreased to 5021 million from 5358 million the decrease was primarily due to the gain on sale recorded in discontinued operations net of income taxes in 2017 as well as charges related to the middleport environmental settlement as discussed above these were partially offset by higher income from continuing operations driven by a full year of results from the dupont crop protection business which was completed on november 1 2017 

liquidity and capital resources 

cash and cash equivalents at december 31 2019 and 2018 were 3391 million and 1344 million respectively of the cash and cash equivalents balance at december 31 2019 1815 million was held by our foreign subsidiaries the cash held by foreign subsidiaries for permanent reinvestment is generally used to finance the subsidiaries’ operating activities and future foreign investments we have not provided income taxes for other outside basis differences inherent in our investments in subsidiaries because the investments and related unremitted earnings are essentially permanent in duration or we have concluded that no additional tax liability will arise upon disposal or remittance see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements included within this form 10k for more information 

at december 31 2019 we had total debt of 32588 million as compared to 26927 million at december 31 2018 total debt included 30311 million and 21450 million of longterm debt excluding current portions of 828 million and 3860 million at december 31 2019 and 2018 respectively as of december 31 2019 we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants see note 14 in the consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k for further details we remain committed to solid investment grade credit metrics and expect fullyear average leverage to be in line with this commitment in 2020 

the increase in longterm debt was primarily due to the issuance of senior notes discussed further below partially offsetting the increase were partial paydowns on the 2017 term loan facility which is scheduled to mature on november 1 2022 the borrowings under the 2017 term loan facility will bear interest at a floating rate which will be a base rate or a eurocurrency rate equal to the london interbank offered rate for the relevant interest period plus in each case an applicable margin as determined in accordance with the provisions of the 2017 term loan facility 

our shortterm debt consists of foreign borrowings and our commercial paper program foreign borrowings increased from 1065 million at december 31 2018 to 1449 million at december 31 2019 while outstanding commercial paper decreased entirely from 552 million at december 31 2018 we provide parentcompany guarantees to lending institutions providing credit to our foreign subsidiaries 

our commercial paper program allows us to borrow at rates generally more favorable than those available under our credit facility at december 31 2019 we had no borrowings outstanding under the commercial paper program 

senior notes 

on september 20 2019 we issued 500 million aggregate principal amount of 3200 senior notes due 2026 500 million aggregate principal amount 3450 senior notes due 2029 and 500 million aggregate principal amount 4500 senior notes due 2049 a portion of the net proceeds from the offering were used for paydowns of outstanding commercial paper 2017 term loan facility balances and general corporate purposes we used the remaining net proceeds of approximately 300 million to redeem all of our senior notes that matured in the fourth quarter of 2019 

fees incurred to secure the senior notes have been deferred and will be amortized over the terms of the arrangement 

see note 19 for details on the interest rate swap settlement which will also be amortized over the terms of the arrangement 

revolving credit facility 

on may 17 2019 we entered into an amended and restated credit agreement the revolving credit agreement the unsecured revolving credit agreement provides for a 15 billion revolving credit facility 400 million of which is available for the issuance of letters of credit for the account of the revolving borrowers and 50 million of which is available for swing loans to certain of the revolving borrowers with an option subject to certain conditions and limitations to increase the aggregate amount of the revolving credit commitments to 225 billion the “revolving credit facility” the current termination date of the revolving credit facility is may 17 2024 

revolving loans under the revolving credit agreement will bear interest at a floating rate which will be a base rate or a eurocurrency rate equal to the london interbank offered rate for the relevant interest period plus in each case an applicable margin as determined in accordance with the provisions of the revolving credit agreement the base rate will be the highest of the rate of interest announced publicly by citibank na in new york new york from time to time as its “base rate” the federal funds effective rate plus 12 of 1 and the eurocurrency rate for a onemonth period plus 1 the company is required to pay a facility fee on the average daily amount whether used or unused of each revolving credit lender’s revolving credit commitment from the effective date for such revolving credit lender until the termination date of such revolving credit lender at a rate per annum equal to an applicable percentage in effect from time to time for the facility fee as determined in accordance with the provisions of the revolving credit agreement the initial facility fee is 0125 per annum the applicable margin and the facility fee are subject to adjustment as provided in the revolving credit agreement 

the revolving credit agreement contains customary financial and other covenants including a maximum leverage ratio and minimum interest coverage ratio 

fees incurred to secure the revolving credit facility have been deferred and will be amortized over the term of the arrangement 

statement of cash flows 

cash provided required by operating activities was 5556 million 3627 million and 2320 million for 2019 2018 and 2017 respectively 

the table below presents the components of net cash provided required by operating activities for comparability the prior period amounts for change in all other operating assets and liabilities have been recast to reflect the current period presentation 



 

1 the change in trade receivables in all periods was primarily driven by timing of collections largely due to seasonality additionally the change in 2018 was related to receivable build from the acquired dupont crop protection business as we did not acquire any receivables as part of the transaction collection timing is more pronounced in certain countries such as brazil where there may be terms significantly longer than the rest of our business additionally timing of collection is impacted as amounts for all periods include carryover balances remaining to be collected in latin america where collection periods are measured in months rather than weeks during 2019 we collected approximately 1070 million of receivables in brazil 

2 advance payments are typically received in the fourth quarter of each year primarily in our north america operations as revenue associated with advance payments is recognized generally in the first half of each year following the seasonality of that business as shipments are made and title ownership and risk of loss pass to the customer 

3 these rebates are primarily associated with north america and to a lesser extent brazil and in north america are generally settled in the fourth quarter of each year given the end of that regions crop cycle the changes year over year are primarily associated with the mix in sales eligible for rebates and incentives and timing of rebate payments additionally the change in 2018 was related to the build in rebates as we did not acquire the rebates of the dupont crop protection business as part of the transaction 

4 changes in inventory are a result of inventory levels being adjusted to take into consideration the change in market conditions the increase in the change in 2018 was also driven by recovering inventory levels due to a faster return to full production from our china toll manufacturing partners 

5 the change in cash flows related to accounts payable is primarily due to timing of payments made to suppliers and vendors timing in 2019 was partially impacted during portions of 2019 from global supply chain issues primarily in china which required us to obtain raw materials on payment terms shorter than normal the change in accounts payable in both 2018 and 2017 was primarily impacted by the payable build from the acquired dupont crop protection business as we did not acquire any payables as part of the transactions 

6 changes in all periods presented primarily represent timing of payments associated with all other operating assets and liabilities additionally the 2019 and 2018 period includes the effects of the unfavorable contracts amortization of approximately 116 million and 103 million respectively 

7 see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k for further details 

8 included in our results for each of the years presented are environmental charges for environmental remediation of 1087 million 217 million and 162 million respectively the amounts in 2019 will be spent in future years the amounts represent environmental remediation spending which were recorded against preexisting reserves net of recoveries environmental obligations for continuing operations primarily represent obligations at shut down or abandoned facilities within businesses that do not meet the criteria for presentation as discontinued operations 

9 amounts include voluntary contributions to our us qualified defined benefit plan of 70 million 300 million and 440 million respectively these amounts are in excess of the minimum requirements our contributions in excess of minimums are done with the objective of avoiding variable rate pension benefit guaranty corporation premiums as well as potentially reducing future funding volatility 

10 the increase in interest payments in 2019 was primarily due to higher foreign borrowings and the issuance of the senior notes during the year the increase in 2018 was primarily due to higher foreign debt balances the addition of the 2017 term loan facility and increases in interest rates 

11 tax payments in 2019 primarily represent the payments of tax attributable to the nufarm limited sale transition tax and tax payments related to the acquired dupont crop protection business tax payments in 2018 primarily represent the payments of tax attributable to the fmc health and nutrition segment disposition transition tax and full year tax payments related to the acquired dupont crop protection business 

12 represents payments for legal and professional fees associated with the dupont crop protection business acquisition in addition to costs related to integrating the dupont crop protection business we expect these payments to cease by the end of 2020 see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for more information 

cash provided required by operating activities of discontinued operations was 671 million 57 million and 1035 million for 2019 2018 and 2017 respectively 

cash required by operating activities of discontinued operations is directly related to environmental other postretirement benefit liabilities selfinsurance longterm obligations related to legal proceedings and historical restructuring activities 

amounts in all periods also include the operating activities of our discontinued fmc lithium segment which was separated on march 1 2019 amounts in 2017 include the operating activities of our discontinued fmc health and nutrition segment and were partially offset by divestiture costs associated with its sale which was completed on november 1 2017 

cash provided required by investing activities of continuing operations was 1959 million 375 million and 12885 million for 2019 2018 and 2017 respectively 

cash required in 2019 is primarily due to capital expenditures and spending related to our contract manufacturing arrangements as well as continued spending associated with the implementation of a new sap system 

cash required in 2018 is primarily due to higher capital expenditure spending as well as incremental capitalizable corporate level spending associated with the implementation of a new sap system partially offset by the sale of product portfolios of approximately 88 million that were required to complete the dupont crop protection business acquisition 

the cash required by investing activities in 2017 was primarily due to the acquisition of the dupont crop protection business 

cash provided required by investing activities of discontinued operations was 92 million 934 million and 453 million for 2019 2018 and 2017 respectively 

cash provided by investing activities of discontinued operations in 2019 represents the proceeds from the sale of the first of two parcels of land of our discontinued site in newark california partially offset by capital expenditures of our discontinued fmc lithium segment cash required by investing activities of discontinued operations in 2018 represents the working capital payment associated with the divestiture of fmc health and nutrition as well as the capital expenditures of our discontinued fmc lithium segment 

cash required by investing activities of discontinued operations in 2017 represents the capital expenditures of our discontinued fmc lithium and fmc health and nutrition segments partially offset by the cash proceeds from the sale of the omega3 business for 380 million 

cash provided required by financing activities was 870 million 3973 million and 12131 million in 2019 2018 and 2017 respectively 

the change in cash required by financing activities in 2019 is primarily due to the proceeds from the senior notes offset by cash outflows including higher repurchases of common stock repayment of longterm debt and higher dividend payments in the current period as compared to the prior period the prior period included the net proceeds from the ipo of fmc lithium which were more than offset by repayments of longterm debt dividend payments and repurchases of common stock 

the change in cash required by financing activities in 2018 is due to higher repayments of longterm debt of approximately 200 million as compared to 2017 and 200 million in repurchases of common stock as part of the publicly announced repurchase program additionally there were significant borrowings of longterm debt in 2017 to fund the dupont transaction the cash required in 2018 was partially offset by the proceeds received from the ipo of fmc lithium of 3636 million 

cash provided required by financing activities was 372 million 340 million and zero in 2019 2018 and 2017 respectively 

cash required by financing activities of discontinued operations in 2019 represents debt repayments on fmc lithiums external debt as well as cash payments associated with its separation cash provided by financing activities of discontinued operations in 2018 represents the proceeds from borrowing of longterm debt of our discontinued fmc lithium segment 

free cash flow 

we define free cash flow a nongaap financial measure as all cash inflows and outflows excluding those related to financing activities such as debt repayments dividends and share repurchases and acquisition related investing activities free cash flow is calculated as all cash from operating activities reduced by spending for capital additions and other investing activities as well as legacy and transformation spending therefore our calculation of free cash flow will almost always result in a lower amount than cash from operating activities from continuing operations the most directly comparable us gaap measure however the free cash flow measure is consistent with managements assessment of operating cash flow performance and we believe it provides a useful basis for investors and securities analysts about the cash generated by routine business operations including capital expenditures in addition to assessing our ability to repay debt fund acquisitions and return capital to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends 

our use of free cash flow has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for an analysis of our results under us gaap first free cash flow is not a substitute for cash provided required by operating activities of continuing operations as it is not a measure of cash available for discretionary expenditures since we have nondiscretionary obligations primarily debt service that are not deducted from the measure second other companies may calculate free cash flow or similarly titled nongaap financial measures differently or may use other measures to evaluate their performance all of which could reduce the usefulness of free cash flow as a tool for comparison additionally the utility of free cash flow is further limited as it does not reflect our future contractual commitments and does not represent the total increase or decrease in our cash balance for a given period because of these and other limitations free cash flow should be considered along with cash provided required by operating activities of continuing operations and other comparable financial measures prepared and presented in accordance with us gaap 

the table below presents a reconciliation of free cash flow from the most directly comparable us gaap measure 

free cash flow reconciliation 



 

1 represents payments for legal and professional fees associated with the dupont crop protection business acquisition in addition to costs related to integrating the dupont crop protection business see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for more information 

2 adjusted cash from operations is defined as cash provided required by operating activities of continuing operations excluding the effects of transactionrelated cash flows which are included within legacy and transformation 

3 components of cash provided required by investing activities of continuing operations refer to the below discussion for further details 

4 cash spending associated with contract manufacturers was 517 million 131 million and 117 million for the years ended december 31 2019 2018 and 2017 respectively 

5 refer to the above discussion for further details 

6 includes our legacy liabilities such as environmental remediation and other legal matters that are reported in discontinued operations as well as business integration costs associated with the dupont crop protection business acquisition and the implementation of our new sap system 

2020 cash flow outlook 

our cash needs for 2020 include operating cash requirements which are impacted by contributions to our pension plan as well as environmental asset retirement obligation and restructuring spending capital expenditures and legacy and transformation spending as well as mandatory payments of debt dividend payments and share repurchases we plan to meet our liquidity needs through available cash cash generated from operations commercial paper issuances and borrowings under our committed revolving credit facility at december 31 2019 our remaining borrowing capacity under our credit facility was 12830 million 

we expect 2020 free cash flow nongaap to increase to a range of approximately 425 million to 525 million driven by higher cash from operating activities partially offset by higher capital expenditures and higher legacy and transformation costs we continue to believe we can drive free cash conversion substantially higher over the next two to three years as we finalize our sap system implementation ending the threeyear period of high cash spending on transformation activity and as we drive further improvement in working capital performance and continue to increase revenue and adjusted ebitda 

although we provide a forecast for free cash flow a nongaap financial measure we are not able to forecast the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with us gaap which is cash provided required by operating activities of continuing operations certain elements of the composition of the us gaap amount are not predictable making it impractical for us to forecast such elements include but are not limited to restructuring acquisition charges and discontinued operations as a result no us gaap outlook is provided 

cash from operating activities of continuing operations 

we expect higher cash from operating activities excluding the effects of transactionrelated cash flows primarily driven by higher forecasted adjusted ebitda as well as continued improvement in working capital to be in the range of approximately 735 million to 935 million transactionrelated cash flows are included within legacy and transformation which is consistent with how we evaluate our business operations from a cash flow standpoint see below for further discussion cash from operating activities includes cash requirements related to our pension plans environmental sites restructuring and asset retirement obligations taxes and interest on borrowings 

pension 

we do not expect to make any voluntary cash contributions to our us qualified defined benefit pension plan in 2020 the plan is fully funded and our portfolio is comprised of 100 percent fixed income securities and cash our investment strategy is a liability hedging approach with an objective of maintaining the funded status of the plan such that the funded status volatility is minimized and the likelihood that we will be required to make significant contributions to the plan is limited 

environmental 

projected 2020 spending includes approximately 45 million to 55 million of net environmental remediation spending for our sites accounted for within continuing operations environmental obligations for continuing operations primarily represent obligations at shut down or abandoned facilities within businesses that do not meet the criteria for presentation as discontinued operations this spending includes approximately 36 million related to our environmental remediation site near pocatello idaho primarily as a result of a litigation judgment against us in the pocatello tribal litigation described in note 12 in addition to the expected 2020 payments for pocatello the judgment resulted in the requirement for future payments of 15 million annually thereafter on february 4 2020 the ninth circuit granted our motion to stay the mandate and as a result payment of the judgement if necessary will not take place until final disposition by the supreme court 

total projected 2020 environmental spending inclusive of both sites accounted for within continuing operations and discontinued sites discussed within legacy and transformation below is expected to be in the range of 98 million to 108 million 

restructuring and asset retirement obligations 

we expect to make payments of approximately 30 million to 34 million in 2020 of which approximately 12 million is related to exit and disposal costs as a result of our decision to exit sales of all carbofuran formulations including furadan® insecticidenematicide as well as curaterr® insecticidenematicide and any other brands used with carbofuran products see note 9 for more information 

capital additions and other investing activities 

projected 2020 capital expenditures and expenditures related to contract manufacturers are expected to be in the range of approximately 135 million to 185 million the spending is primarily driven by diamide capacity expansion and new active ingredient capacity expenditures related to contract manufacturers are included within “other investing activities” 

legacy and transformation 

projected 2020 legacy and transformation spending are expected to be in the range of approximately 175 million to 225 million this is primarily driven by continued spending associated with the threeyear implementation of a new sap system and related costs we expect to continue to incur associated with the remaining integration of the dupont crop protection business due to its significance and complexity total spending related to these initiatives is expected to be approximately 125 million costs for these initiatives are expected to be immaterial beyond 2020 

projected 2020 spending includes approximately 48 million to 58 million of net environmental remediation spending for our discontinued sites these projections include spending as a result of a settlement reached in the second quarter of 2019 at our middleport new york site the settlement will result in spending of approximately 20 million to 30 million per year for 2020 and 2021 due to front loading of reimbursement in installments of past costs and a 10 million maximum per year on average until the remediation is complete see note 12 for further information 

total projected 2020 environmental spending inclusive of both sites accounted for within continuing operations discussed within cash from operating activities of continuing operations above and discontinued sites is expected to be in the range of 98 million to 108 million 

share repurchases 

during the year ended december 31 2019 47 million shares were repurchased under the publicly announced repurchase program at december 31 2019 approximately 600 million remained unused under our boardauthorized repurchase program we intend to purchase between 400 million to 500 million of our common shares in 2020 this repurchase program does not include a specific timetable or price targets and may be suspended or terminated at any time shares may be purchased through open market or privately negotiated transactions at the discretion of management based on its evaluation of market conditions and other factors we also reacquire shares from time to time from employees in connections with vesting exercise and forfeiture of awards under our equity compensation plans 

dividends 

on january 16 2020 we paid dividends aggregating 570 million to our shareholders of record as of december 31 2019 this amount is included in “accrued and other liabilities” on the consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2019 for the years ended december 31 2019 2018 and 2017 we paid 2103 million 892 million and 888 million in dividends respectively 

commitments 

we provide guarantees to financial institutions on behalf of certain customers principally customers in brazil for their seasonal borrowing the total of these guarantees was 778 million at december 31 2019 these guarantees arise during the ordinary course of business from relationships with customers and nonconsolidated affiliates nonperformance by the guaranteed party triggers the obligation requiring us to make payments to the beneficiary of the guarantee based on our experience these types of guarantees have not had a material effect on our consolidated financial position or on our liquidity our expectation is that future payment or performance related to the nonperformance of others is considered unlikely 

in connection with certain of our property and asset sales and divestitures we have agreed to indemnify the buyer for certain liabilities including environmental contamination and taxes that occurred prior to the date of sale our indemnification obligations with respect to these liabilities may be indefinite as to duration and may or may not be subject to a deductible minimum claim amount or cap in cases where it is not possible for us to predict the likelihood that a claim will be made or to make a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential loss or range of loss no specific liability has been recorded if triggered we may be able to recover certain of the indemnity payments from third parties in cases where it is possible we have recorded a specific liability within our reserve for discontinued operations refer to note 11 for further details 

our total significant committed contracts that we believe will affect cash over the next four years and beyond are as follows 



 

1 excluding discounts 

2 contractual interest is the interest we are contracted to pay on our longterm debt obligations we had 8000 million of longterm debt subject to variable interest rates at december 31 2019 the rate assumed for the variable interest component of the contractual interest obligation was the rate in effect at december 31 2019 variable rates are determined by the market and will fluctuate over time 

3 obligations associated with operating leases before sublease rental income 

4 purchase obligations consist of agreements to purchase goods and services that are enforceable and legally binding and specify all significant terms including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased price provisions and timing of the transaction we have entered into a number of purchase obligations for the sourcing of materials and energy where takeorpay arrangements apply since the majority of the minimum obligations under these contracts are takeorpay commitments over the life of the contract and not a year by year takeorpay the obligations in the table related to these types of contacts are presented in the earliest period in which the minimum obligation could be payable under these types of contracts 

5 as of december 31 2019 the liability for uncertain tax positions was 714 million this liability is excluded from the table above additionally accrued pension and other postretirement benefits and our environmental liabilities as recorded on our consolidated balance sheets are excluded from the table above due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of potential future cash flows associated with these liabilities we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and periods in which these liabilities might be paid also excluded from the table above is the liability attributable to the transition tax on deemed repatriated foreign earnings incurred as a result of the act of 1393 million

climate change 

as a global corporate citizen we are concerned about the consequences of climate change and will take prudent and cost effective actions that reduce green house gas ghg emissions to the atmosphere 

fmc is committed to continuing to do its part to address climate change and its impacts in 2019 we set new environmental goals to reflect the changes to our business with the acquisition of the dupont crop protection business and the separation of the fmc lithium business our new 2030 intensity reduction targets for energy and greenhouse gas emissions are both 25 percent from our 2018 baseline year fmc has been reporting its ghg emissions and mitigation strategy to cdp formerly carbon disclosure project since 2016 fmc detailed the business risks and opportunities we have due to climate change and its impacts in our cdp climate change reports in recognition of our commitment to address climate change fmc enhanced its cdp climate change score from a “c” in 2018 to a “b” in 2019 

even as we take action to control the release of ghgs additional warming is anticipated longterm higher average global temperatures could result in induced changes in natural resources growing seasons precipitation patterns weather patterns species distributions water availability sea levels and biodiversity these impacts could cause changes in supplies of raw materials used to maintain fmc’s production capacity and could lead to possible increased sourcing costs depending on how pervasive the climate impacts are in the different geographic locations experiencing changes in natural resources fmc’s customers could be impacted demand for fmc’s products could increase if our products meet our customers’ needs to adapt to climate change impacts or decrease if our products do not meet their needs within our own operations we continually assess our manufacturing sites worldwide for risks and opportunities to increase our preparedness for climate change we are continuing to evaluate sea level rise and storm surge at our plants to understand timing of potential impacts and proactive responses that may need to be taken to lessen fmc’s overall environmental footprint we have taken actions to increase the energy efficiency in our manufacturing sites we have also committed to new 2030 goals to reduce our water use intensity in 

highrisk areas by 20 percent and to maintain our 2018 waste disposed intensity which otherwise would increase by 55 percent due to expected growth and shifts in production mix 

in our product portfolio we see market opportunities for our products to address climate change and its impacts for example fmcs agricultural products can help customers increase yield energy and water efficiency and decrease greenhouse gas emissions our products can also help growers adapt to more unpredictable growing conditions and the effects these types of threats have on crops fmc has committed to invest 100 of our innovation budget to developing sustainable products and solutions for future use 

we are improving existing products and developing new platforms and technologies that help mitigate impacts of climate change fmc is developing products with a lighter environmental footprint in its biologicals products these opportunities could lead to new products and services for our existing and potential customers beyond our products and operations fmc recognizes that energy consumption throughout our supply chain can impact climate change and product costs therefore we will actively work with our entire value chain  suppliers contractors and customers  to improve their energy efficiencies and to reduce their ghg emissions 

we continue to follow legislative and regulatory developments regarding climate change because the regulation of greenhouse gases depending on their nature and scope could subject some of our manufacturing operations to additional costs or limits on operations in december 2015 195 countries at the united nations climate change conference in paris reached an agreement to reduce ghgs it remains to be seen how and when each of these countries will implement this agreement the united states was a signatory to the paris agreement then on november 4 2019 the united states announced that it will begin formally withdrawing the us from the paris climate accord the first step in a yearlong process that will lead to a complete withdrawal just after the 2020 presidential election 

notwithstanding the united states’ withdrawal from the paris agreement fmc will actively manage climate risks and incorporate them in our decision making as indicated in our responses to the cdp climate change module the united states climate alliance a coalition of 24 states governing 55 percent of the population and unincorporated selfgoverning territories in the united states have expressed their commitment to upholding the objectives of the 2015 paris agreement on climate change within their borders several of our manufacturing and rd sites fall within this alliance territory fmc remains deeply committed to reducing our ghg emissions and energy consumption at all our facilities around the world 

some of our foreign operations are subject to national or local energy management or climate change regulation such as our plant in denmark that is subject to the eu emissions trading scheme at present that plant’s emissions are below its designated cap 

in december 2019 the european commission approved the european green deal with the goal of making the eu carbon neutral by 2050 the deal includes investment plans and a roadmap to fight against climate change fmc is closely following updates and the discussion surrounding the green deal the costs of complying with possible future requirements are difficult to estimate at this time 

future ghg regulatory requirements may result in increased costs of energy additional capital costs for emissions control or new equipment andor costs associated with cap and trade or carbon taxes we are currently monitoring regulatory developments the costs of complying with possible future climate change requirements are difficult to estimate at this time

critical accounting policies 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles us gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses we have described our accounting policies in note 1 principal accounting policies and related financial information to our consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k we have reviewed these accounting policies identifying those that we believe to be critical to the preparation and understanding of our consolidated financial statements we have reviewed these critical accounting policies with the audit committee of the board of directors critical accounting policies are central to our presentation of results of operations and financial condition in accordance with us gaap and require management to make estimates and judgments on certain matters we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience current conditions and other reasonable factors 

revenue recognition and trade receivables 

we recognize revenue when or as we satisfy our performance obligation which is when the customer obtains control of the good or service rebates due to customers are accrued as a reduction of revenue in the same period that the related sales are recorded based on the contract terms refer to note 3 to our consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k for more information 

we record amounts billed for shipping and handling fees as revenue costs incurred for shipping and handling are recorded as costs of sales and services amounts billed for sales and use taxes valueadded taxes and certain excise and other specific transactional taxes imposed on revenueproducing transactions are presented on a net basis and excluded from sales in the consolidated income statements we record a liability until remitted to the respective taxing authority 

we periodically enter into prepayment arrangements with customers and receive advance payments for product to be delivered in future periods these advance payments are recorded as deferred revenue and classified as “advance payments from customers” on the consolidated balance sheet revenue associated with advance payments is recognized as shipments are made and transfer of control to the customer takes place 

trade receivables consist of amounts owed to us from customer sales and are recorded when revenue is recognized the allowance for trade receivables represents our best estimate of the probable losses associated with potential customer defaults in developing our allowance for trade receivables we use a two stage process which includes calculating a general formula to develop an allowance to appropriately address the uncertainty surrounding collection risk of our entire portfolio and specific allowances for customers where the risk of collection has been reasonably identified either due to liquidity constraints or disputes over contractual terms and conditions 

our method of calculating the general formula consists of estimating the recoverability of trade receivables based on historical experience current collection trends and external business factors such as economic factors including regional bankruptcy rates and political factors our analysis of trade receivable collection risk is performed quarterly and the allowance is adjusted accordingly 

we also hold longterm receivables that represent longterm customer receivable balances related to pastdue accounts which are not expected to be collected within the current year our policy for the review of the allowance for these receivables is consistent with the discussion in the preceding paragraph above on trade receivables therefore on an ongoing basis we continue to evaluate the credit quality of our longterm receivables utilizing aging of receivables collection experience and writeoffs as well as existing economic conditions to determine if an additional allowance is necessary 

environmental obligations and related recoveries 

we provide for environmentalrelated obligations when they are probable and amounts can be reasonably estimated where the available information is sufficient to estimate the amount of liability that estimate has been used where the information is only sufficient to establish a range of probable liability and no point within the range is more likely than any other the lower end of the range has been used 

estimated obligations to remediate sites that involve oversight by the united states environmental protection agency “epa” or similar government agencies are generally accrued no later than when a record of decision “rod” or equivalent is issued or upon completion of a remedial investigationfeasibility study “rifs” or equivalent that is submitted by us to the appropriate government agency or agencies estimates are reviewed quarterly by our environmental remediation management as well as by financial and legal management and if necessary adjusted as additional information becomes available the estimates can change substantially as additional information becomes available regarding the nature or extent of site contamination required remediation methods and other actions by or against governmental agencies or private parties 

our environmental liabilities for continuing and discontinued operations are principally for costs associated with the remediation andor study of sites at which we are alleged to have released hazardous substances into the environment such costs principally include among other items rifs site remediation costs of operation and maintenance of the remediation 

plan management costs fees to outside law firms and consultants for work related to the environmental effort and future monitoring costs estimated site liabilities are determined based upon existing remediation laws and technologies specific site consultants’ engineering studies or by extrapolating experience with environmental issues at comparable sites 

included in our environmental liabilities are costs for the operation maintenance and monitoring of site remediation plans omm such reserves are based on our best estimates for these omm plans over time we may incur omm costs in excess of these reserves however we are unable to reasonably estimate an amount in excess of our recorded reserves because we cannot reasonably estimate the period for which such omm plans will need to be in place or the future annual cost of such remediation as conditions at these environmental sites change over time such additional omm costs could be significant in total but would be incurred over an extended period of years 

included in the environmental reserve balance other assets balance and disclosure of reasonably possible loss contingencies are amounts from third party insurance policies which we believe are probable of recovery 

provisions for environmental costs are reflected in income net of probable and estimable recoveries from named potentially responsible parties “prps” or other third parties in the fourth quarter of 2019 we increased our reserves for the pocatello tribal matter by 728 million which represents both the historical and discounted present value of future annual use permit fees as well as the associated legal costs see note 12 for further information all other environmental provisions incorporate inflation and are not discounted to their present value 

in calculating and evaluating the adequacy of our environmental reserves we have taken into account the joint and several liability imposed by comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act “cercla” and the analogous state laws on all prps and have considered the identity and financial condition of the other prps at each site to the extent possible we have also considered the identity and financial condition of other third parties from whom recovery is anticipated as well as the status of our claims against such parties although we are unable to forecast the ultimate contributions of prps and other third parties with absolute certainty the degree of uncertainty with respect to each party is taken into account when determining the environmental reserve by adjusting the reserve to reflect the facts and circumstances on a sitebysite basis our liability includes our best estimate of the costs expected to be paid before the consideration of any potential recoveries from third parties we believe that any recorded recoveries related to prps are realizable in all material respects recoveries are recorded as either an offset in “environmental liabilities continuing and discontinued” or as “other assets” in our consolidated balance sheets in accordance with us accounting literature 

see note 12 to our consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k for changes in estimates associated with our environmental obligations 

impairments and valuation of longlived and indefinitelived assets 

our longlived assets primarily include property plant and equipment goodwill and intangible assets the assets and liabilities of acquired businesses are measured at their estimated fair values at the dates of acquisition the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired including identified intangibles is recorded as goodwill the determination and allocation of fair value to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is based on various assumptions and valuation methodologies requiring considerable management judgment including estimates based on historical information current market data and future expectations the principal assumptions utilized in our valuation methodologies include revenue growth rates operating margin estimates and discount rates although the estimates were deemed reasonable by management based on information available at the dates of acquisition those estimates are inherently uncertain 

we test for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the net book value of our property plant and equipment may not be recoverable from the estimated undiscounted expected future cash flows expected to result from their use and eventual disposition in cases where the estimated undiscounted expected future cash flows are less than net book value an impairment loss is recognized equal to the amount by which the net book value exceeds the estimated fair value of assets which is based on discounted cash flows at the lowest level determinable the estimated cash flows reflect our assumptions about selling prices volumes costs and market conditions over a reasonable period of time 

we perform an annual impairment test of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets in the third quarter of each year or more frequently whenever an event or change in circumstances occurs that would require reassessment of the recoverability of those assets in performing our evaluation we assess qualitative factors such as overall financial performance of our reporting units anticipated changes in industry and market structure competitive environments planned capacity and cost factors such as raw material prices based on our assessment for 2019 we determined that no goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets impairment charge to our continuing operations was required 

see note 9 to our consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k for charges associated with longlived asset disposal costs and the activity associated with the restructuring reserves 

pension and other postretirement benefits 

we provide qualified and nonqualified defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans as well as postretirement health care and life insurance benefit plans to our employees and retirees the costs benefits and obligations related to these benefits reflect key assumptions related to general economic conditions including interest discount rates healthcare cost trend rates expected rates of return on plan assets and the rates of compensation increase for employees the costs benefits and obligations for these benefit programs are also affected by other assumptions such as average retirement age mortality employee turnover and plan participation to the extent our plans’ actual experience as influenced by changing economic and financial market conditions or by changes to our own plans’ demographics differs from these assumptions the costs and obligations for providing these benefits as well as the plans’ funding requirements could increase or decrease when actual results differ from our assumptions the difference is typically recognized over future periods in addition the unrealized gains and losses related to our pension and postretirement benefit obligations may also affect periodic benefit costs benefits in future periods 

we use several assumptions and statistical methods to determine the asset values used to calculate both the expected rate of return on assets component of pension cost and to calculate our plans’ funding requirements the expected rate of return on plan assets is based on a marketrelated value of assets that recognizes investment gains and losses over a fiveyear period we use an actuarial value of assets to determine our plans’ funding requirements the actuarial value of assets must be within a certain range high or low of the actual market value of assets and is adjusted accordingly 

we select the discount rate used to calculate pension and other postretirement obligations based on a review of available yields on highquality corporate bonds as of the measurement date in selecting a discount rate as of december 31 2019 we placed particular emphasis on a discount rate yieldcurve provided by our actuary this yieldcurve when populated with projected cash flows that represent the expected timing and amount of our plans benefit payments produced an effective discount rate of 322 percent for our us qualified plan 274 percent for our us nonqualified and 289 percent for our us other postretirement benefit plans 

the discount rates used to determine projected benefit obligation at our december 31 2019 and 2018 measurement dates for the us qualified plan were 322 percent and 435 percent respectively the effect of the change in the discount rate from 435 percent to 322 percent at december 31 2019 resulted in a 1528 million increase to our us qualified pension benefit obligations the effect of the change in the discount rate used to determine net annual benefit cost income from 368 percent at december 31 2018 to 436 percent at december 31 2019 resulted in a 05 million decrease to the 2019 us qualified pension expense 

the change in discount rate from 435 percent at december 31 2018 to 322 percent at december 31 2019 was attributable to an increase in yields on high quality corporate bonds with cash flows matching the timing and amount of our expected future benefit payments between the 2018 and 2019 measurement dates using the december 31 2019 and 2018 yield curves our us qualified plan cash flows produced a single weightedaverage discount rate of approximately 322 percent and 435 percent respectively 

in developing the assumption for the longterm rate of return on assets for our us plan we take into consideration the technical analysis performed by our outside actuaries including historical market returns information on the assumption for longterm real returns by asset class inflation assumptions and expectations for standard deviation related to these best estimates our longterm rate of return for the fiscal year ended december 31 2019 2018 and 2017 was 425 percent 500 percent and 650 percent respectively 

for the sensitivity of our pension costs to incremental changes in assumptions see our discussion below 

sensitivity analysis related to key pension and postretirement benefit assumptions 

a onehalf percent increase in the assumed discount rate would have decreased pension and other postretirement benefit obligations by 721 million and 624 million at december 31 2019 and 2018 respectively and decreased pension and other postretirement benefit costs by 06 million 04 million and 04 million for 2019 2018 and 2017 respectively a onehalf percent decrease in the assumed discount rate would have increased pension and other postretirement benefit obligations by 794 million and 683 million at december 31 2019 and 2018 respectively and increased pension and other postretirement benefit cost by 05 million 01 million and 04 million for 2019 2018 and 2017 respectively 

a onehalf percent increase in the assumed expected longterm rate of return on plan assets would have decreased pension costs by 63 million 64 million and 60 million for 2019 2018 and 2017 respectively a onehalf percent decrease in the assumed longterm rate of return on plan assets would have increased pension costs by 63 million 64 million and 60 million for 2019 2018 and 2017 respectively 

further details on our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and net periodic benefit costs benefits are found in note 15 to our consolidated financial statements in this form 10k 

income taxes 

we have recorded a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets in certain jurisdictions to the amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized in assessing the need for this allowance we have considered a number of factors including future taxable income the jurisdictions in which such income is earned and our ongoing tax planning strategies in the event that we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period such determination was made similarly should we conclude that we would be able to realize certain deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase income in the period such determination was made 

additionally we file income tax returns in the us federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions certain income tax returns for fmc entities taxable in the us and significant foreign jurisdictions are open for examination and adjustment we assess our income tax positions and record a liability for all years open to examination based upon our evaluation of the facts circumstances and information available at the reporting date for those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained we have recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information we adjust these liabilities if necessary upon the completion of tax audits or changes in tax law 

on december 22 2017 the act was enacted in the united states the act reduced the us federal corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent required companies to pay a onetime transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred and created new taxes on certain foreign sourced earnings at december 31 2018 the company had completed its accounting for the impacts of the enactment of the act 

see note 13 to our consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k for additional discussion surrounding income taxes 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

our earnings cash flows and financial position are exposed to market risks relating to fluctuations in commodity prices interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates our policy is to minimize exposure to our cash flow over time caused by changes in commodity interest and currency exchange rates to accomplish this we have implemented a controlled program of risk management consisting of appropriate derivative contracts entered into with major financial institutions 

the analysis below presents the sensitivity of the market value of our financial instruments to selected changes in market rates and prices the range of changes chosen reflects our view of changes that are reasonably possible over a oneyear period market value estimates are based on the present value of projected future cash flows considering the market rates and prices chosen 

at december 31 2019 our net financial instrument position was a net liability of 89 million compared to a net asset of 114 million at december 31 2018 the change in the net financial instrument position was primarily due to exchange rate fluctuations in our foreign exchange portfolio 

since our risk management programs are generally highly effective the potential loss in value for each risk management portfolio described below would be largely offset by changes in the value of the underlying exposure 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

the primary currencies for which we have exchange rate exposure are the us dollar versus the euro the chinese yuan the brazilian real mexican peso indian rupee and the argentine peso foreign currency debt and foreign exchange forward contracts are used in countries where we do business thereby reducing our net asset exposure foreign exchange forward contracts are also used to hedge firm and highly anticipated foreign currency cash flows 

to analyze the effects of changing foreign currency rates we have performed a sensitivity analysis in which we assume an instantaneous 10 percent change in the foreign currency exchange rates from their levels at december 31 2019 and 2018 with all other variables including interest rates held constant 



interest rate risk 

one of the strategies that we can use to manage interest rate exposure is to enter into interest rate swap agreements in these agreements we agree to exchange at specified intervals the difference between fixed and variable interest amounts calculated on an agreedupon notional principal amount in the quarter ended december 31 2019 we had outstanding contracts in place to swap portions of our variablerate debt to fixedrate debt with an aggregate notional value of 2000 million 

to analyze the effects of changing interest rates we have performed a sensitivity analysis in which we assume an instantaneous one percent change in the interest rates from their levels at december 31 2019 and 2018 with all other variables held constant 



our debt portfolio at december 31 2019 is composed of 80 percent fixedrate debt and 20 percent variablerate debt the variablerate component of our debt portfolio principally consists of borrowings under our 2017 term loan facility credit facility variablerate industrial and pollution control revenue bonds and amounts outstanding under foreign subsidiary credit lines changes in interest rates affect different portions of our variablerate debt portfolio in different ways 

based on the variablerate debt in our debt portfolio at december 31 2019 a one percentage point increase in interest rates would have increased gross interest expense by 64 million and a one percentage point decrease in interest rates would have decreased gross interest expense by 64 million for the year ended december 31 2019

 item 1 

business 

tableend general 

we are a diversified chemical company serving agricultural consumer and industrial markets globally with innovative solutions applications and marketleading products we operate in two distinct business segments fmc agricultural solutions and fmc lithium our fmc agricultural solutions segment develops markets and sells all three major classes of crop protection chemicals insecticides herbicides and fungicides these products are used in agriculture to enhance crop yield and quality by controlling a broad spectrum of insects weeds and disease as well as in nonagricultural markets for pest control our fmc lithium segment manufactures lithium for use in a wide range of lithium products which are used primarily in energy storage specialty polymers and chemical synthesis application 

fmc lithium livent corporation 

in march 2017 we announced our intention to separate our fmc lithium segment subsequently renamed livent corporation or livent into a publicly traded company the initial step of the separation the initial public offering ipo of livent closed on october 15 2018 in connection with the ipo livent had granted the underwriters an option to purchase additional shares of common stock to cover overallotments at the ipo price less the underwriting discount on november 8 2018 the underwriters exercised in full their option to purchase additional shares after completion of the ipo and the underwriters exercise to purchase additional shares of common stock fmc owned 123 million shares of livents common stock representing approximately 84 percent of the total outstanding shares of livents common stock fmc presently intends to distribute the remaining livent shares to fmc stockholders the distribution on march 1 2019 we will continue to consolidate and present livent as the fmc lithium segment until the full separation date at that time results of fmc lithium will be presented as a discontinued operation 

dupont crop protection business 

on march 31 2017 we entered into a definitive transaction agreement the “transaction agreement” with e i du pont de nemours and company “dupont on november 1 2017 pursuant to the terms and conditions set forth in the transaction agreement we completed the acquisition of certain assets relating to duponts crop protection business and research and development organization dupont crop protection business collectively the dupont crop protection business acquisition in connection with this transaction we sold to dupont our fmc health and nutrition segment and paid dupont 12 billion in cash our fmc health and nutrition business and its results have been presented as a discontinued operation for all periods presented throughout this document 

fmc strategy 

fmc has streamlined its portfolio over the past eight years to focus on technologydriven end markets with attractive longterm demand trends the actions we have taken over the past year have better positioned each of our businesses to capitalize on future growth opportunities 

2018 was another pivotal year for fmc as we made substantial progress toward integrating the recently acquired dupont crop protection business into fmc agricultural solutions and toward separating our lithium business into a standalone public company livent corporation our agricultural solutions segment grew revenue by 11 percent on a pro forma basis due to robust demand for our acquired insecticides rynaxypr® and cyazypyr ® insect control and broad crossselling opportunities for all our products around the world rynaxypr® is now the second largest active ingredient in the crop protection market we also launched 30 new formulated products in 2018 which is key to life cycle management of our products we far outperformed the crop protection market which we estimate grew by just 2 to 3 percent in 2018 fmc will begin launching its technology pipeline of six new active ingredients starting with our bixafen fungicide launch  under the lucento brand  in north america in the first quarter of 2019 

the november 2017 acquisition of a significant portion of the dupont crop protection business transformed fmc into a tierone leader and the fifth largest global provider in the agricultural chemicals market the acquisition included dupont’s industryleading insecticides and herbicides the majority of which are patented technologies exceptional discovery research capabilities and a global manufacturing network the acquisition also added 16 discovery leads to our pipeline and we expect to spend approximately 

7 percent of fmc agricultural solutions sales on research and development annually fmc acquired 14 manufacturing plants from dupont and with 26 total plants today we have the scale to operate this business with greater resources and global reach to address changing market conditions 

livent corporation which is approximately 84 percent owned by fmc is one of the leading global producers of specialty lithium products and 2018 was another year of significant growth for the companys lithium products as an independent company livent will have a focused investor base and strong balance sheet ensuring it has the financial capacity to pursue its growth plans and be a leading force in this critical industry we made several strategic decisions during the last few years to focus fmc lithium on downstream highervalue products we convert most of our lithium carbonate and chloride production into highpurity materials including lithium hydroxide used in electric vehicle ev batteries and butyllithium and lithium metals for specialty applications in 2018 we had a full year of sales from our lithium hydroxide plant that we opened in china in the second half of 2017 that plant can produce 10000 metric tons per year in addition to the 10000 metric tons of annual production capacity at our bessemer city nc plant to meet accelerating demand for fmc’s hydroxide products 

we maintain our commitment to enterprise sustainability including responsible stewardship as we grow we will do so in a responsible way safety and business ethics will remain of utmost importance meeting and exceeding our customers’ expectations will continue to be a primary focus

our fmc agricultural solutions segment which represents approximately 91 percent  of our 2018  consolidated revenues operates in the agrochemicals industry this segment develops manufactures and sells a portfolio of crop protection professional pest control and lawn and garden products 

products and markets 

fmc agricultural solutions portfolio is comprised of three major pesticide categories insecticides herbicides and fungicides the majority of our product lines consist of insecticides and herbicides and we have a small but fastgrowing portfolio of fungicides mainly used in high value crop segments our insecticides are used to control a wide spectrum of pests while our herbicide portfolio primarily targets a large variety of difficulttocontrol weeds we are also investing substantially in a plant health program that includes biological crop protection products seed treatments and micronutrients 

in the latin american region which includes the large agricultural market of brazil we sell directly to large growers through our own sales and marketing organization and we access the market through independent distributors and coops in north america 

we access the market through several major national and regional distributors and have our own sales and marketing organization in canada we access the european markets through our own sales and marketing organizations with the 2017 acquisition of the dupont crop protection business we now access key asian markets through large distributors in addition to either local independent distributors or our own sales and marketing organizations through these and other alliances along with our own targeted marketing efforts access to novel technologies and our innovation initiatives we expect to maintain and enhance our access in key agricultural and noncrop markets and develop new products that will help us continue to compete effectively 

industry overview 

the three principal categories of agricultural and noncrop chemicals are herbicides insecticides and fungicides representing approximately 43 percent 25 percent and 29 percent of global industry revenue respectively 

the agrochemicals industry is more consolidated following several recent mergers of the leading crop protection companies which now include fmc chemchina owners of syngenta and adama bayer ag acquired monsanto in 2018 basf ag and dowdupont corteva agriscience the agricultural division of dowdupont is expected to be spun out in june 2019 these five companies currently represent approximately 74 percent of the crop protection industry’s global sales the next tier of agrochemical producers include sumitomo chemical company ltd nufarm ltd and united phosphorous ltd upl also acquired arysta on february 1 2019 fmc employs various differentiated strategies and competes with unique technologies focusing on certain crops markets and geographies while also being supported by a lowcost manufacturing model 

growth 

the 2017 acquisition of a significant portion of the dupont crop protection business positions fmc among leading agrochemical producers in the world the acquired insecticides are predominantly based on patentprotected active ingredients and are growing well above market patterns our complementary technologies combine improved formulation capabilities and a broader innovation pipeline resulting in new and differentiated products we will take advantage of enhanced market access positions and an expanded portfolio to deliver nearterm growth 

we will continue to grow by obtaining new and approved uses for existing product lines and acquiring accessing developing marketing distributing andor selling complementary chemistries and related technologies in order to strengthen our product portfolio and our capabilities to effectively service our target markets and customers

fmc lithium 

  

  

overview 

  

    

our fmc lithium segment represents 9 percent  of our 2018  consolidated revenues 

fmc lithium is a pureplay fully integrated lithium company with a long proven history of producing performance lithium compounds our primary products namely batterygrade lithium hydroxide butyllithium and high purity lithium metal are critical inputs used in various performance applications our strategy is to focus on supplying high performance lithium compounds to the fast growing ev battery market while continuing to maintain our position as a leading global producer of butyllithium and high purity lithium metal with extensive global capabilities over 60 years of continuous production experience applications and technical expertise and deep customer relationships we believe we are well positioned to capitalize on the accelerating trend of vehicle electrification 

fmc lithium produces lithium compounds for use in applications that have specific performance requirements including batterygrade lithium hydroxide for use in high performance lithiumion batteries we believe the demand for our compounds will continue to grow as the electrification of transportation accelerates and as the use of high nickel content cathode materials increases in the next generation of battery technology products we also supply butyllithium which is used as a synthesizer in the production of polymers and pharmaceutical products as well as a range of specialty lithium compounds including high purity lithium metal which is used in the production of lightweight materials for aerospace applications and nonrechargeable batteries it is in these applications that we have established a differentiated position in the market through our ability to consistently produce and deliver performance lithium compounds 

industry overview 

lithium is a soft naturally occurring silverywhite metal that is widely used in a range of energy storage and industrial applications lithium is the lightest of all metals and has the highest specific heat capacity among all elements a high charge density and low thermal expansion properties enabling highperformance characteristics in end use applications that could not otherwise be achieved these unique chemical and physical properties make it ideally suited for use in a variety of commercial applications 

prior to 2000 lithium was primarily used in a wide range of industrial market applications including air treatment ceramics glass greases metallurgy nonrechargeable batteries pharmaceuticals and polymers 

lithium’s use in energy storage applications accelerated in the 1990’s with the introduction of a commercially viable rechargeable lithiumion battery lithiumion battery technology provided a more efficient longerlasting and lighter alternative to incumbent battery technologies the introduction and adoption of portable electronic devices over the past two decades fueled the initial growth in demand for lithium compounds in energy storage applications in recent years advancements in lithiumion battery technology have resulted in increased adoption of lithiumion batteries for use in powering evs 

source and availability of raw materials 

raw materials used by fmc agricultural solutions primarily processed chemicals are obtained from a variety of suppliers worldwide our primary raw material used by fmc lithium is lithium which we extract through solar evaporation and a proprietary process from naturally occurring lithiumrich brines located in the andes mountains of argentina 

patents 

we own and license a significant number of us and foreign patents trademarks trade secrets and other intellectual property that are cumulatively important to our business the fmc intellectual property estate provides us with an important competitive advantage our patents cover many of our products processes and product uses as well as many aspects of our research and development activities supporting the fmc new product pipeline patents are granted by individual jurisdictions and the duration of our patents depends on their respective jurisdictions and payment of annuities we also own many trademarks that are well recognized by customers or product endusers unlike patents ownership rights in trademarks can be continued indefinitely so long as the trademarks are properly used and renewal fees are paid we actively monitor and manage our patents and trademarks to maintain our rights in these assets we believe that the invalidity or loss of any particular patent trademark or license would be a remote possibility andor would not likely have a material adverse effect on the overall business of fmc 

seasonality 

the seasonal nature of the crop protection market and the geographic spread of the fmc agricultural solutions business can result in significant variations in quarterly earnings among geographic locations fmc agricultural solutions products sold in the northern hemisphere north america europe and parts of asia serve seasonal agricultural markets from march through september generally resulting in significant earnings in the first and second quarters and to a lesser extent in the fourth quarter markets in the southern hemisphere latin america and parts of the asia pacific region including australia are served from july through february generally resulting in earnings in the third fourth and first quarters the remainder of our business is generally not subject to significant seasonal fluctuations 

competition 

we encounter substantial competition in each of our two business segments we market our products through our own sales organization and through alliance partners independent distributors and sales representatives the number of our principal competitors varies from segment to segment in general we compete by providing advanced technology high product quality reliability quality customer and technical service and by operating in a costefficient manner 

our fmc agricultural solutions segment competes primarily in the global chemical crop protection market for insecticides herbicides and fungicides industry products include crop protection chemicals and for certain major competitors genetically engineered crop biotechnology products competition from generic agrochemical producers is significant as a number of key product patents have expired in the last decade in general we compete as an innovator by focusing on product development including novel formulations proprietary mixes and advanced delivery systems and by acquiring or licensing mostly proprietary chemistries or technologies that complement our product and geographic focus we also differentiate ourselves by our global costcompetitiveness through our manufacturing strategies establishing effective product stewardship programs and developing strategic alliances that strengthen market access in key countries and regions 

fmc lithium sells its performance lithium compounds worldwide most markets for lithium compounds are global with significant growth occurring in asia driven primarily by the development and manufacture of lithiumion batteries the market for lithium compounds also faces some barriers to entry including access to an adequate and stable supply of lithium technical expertise and development lead time we compete by providing advanced technology high product quality reliability quality customer and technical service and by operating in a costefficient manner we believe we are a leading provider of batterygrade lithium hydroxide in ev battery applications and of performance greases and benefit from low production costs and a history of efficient capital deployment we also believe we are one of only a few global suppliers of butyllithium our primary competitor for performance lithium compounds is albemarle corporation we are the only producer of high purity lithium metal in the western hemisphere and enjoy competitive advantages from our vertically integrated manufacturing approach and low production costs our primary competitors within the lithium metal product category include jiangxi ganfeng lithium and other chinese producers 

research and development expense 

we perform research and development in both of our segments with the majority of our efforts focused in the fmc agricultural solutions segment the development efforts in the fmc agricultural solutions segment focus on developing environmentally sound solutions — both new active ingredients and new product formulations — that costeffectively increase farmers’ yields and provide alternatives to existing and new chemistries

legal proceedings 

tableend 

like hundreds of other industrial companies we have been named as one of many defendants in asbestosrelated personal injury litigation most of these cases allege personal injury or death resulting from exposure to asbestos in premises of fmc or to asbestoscontaining components installed in machinery or equipment manufactured or sold by discontinued operations the machinery and equipment businesses we owned or operated did not fabricate the asbestoscontaining component parts at issue in the litigation and to this day neither the us occupational safety and health administration nor the environmental protection agency has banned the use of these components further the asbestoscontaining parts for this machinery and equipment were accessible only at the time of infrequent repair and maintenance a few jurisdictions have permitted claims to proceed against equipment manufacturers relating to insulation installed by other companies on such machinery and equipment we believe that overall the claims against fmc are without merit 

as of december 31 2018  there were approximately 9400 premises and product asbestos claims pending against fmc in several jurisdictions since the 1980s approximately 115000 asbestos claims against fmc have been discharged the overwhelming majority of which have been dismissed without any payment to the claimant since the 1980s settlements with claimants have totaled approximately 99 million 

we intend to continue managing these asbestosrelated cases in accordance with our historical experience we have established a reserve for this litigation within our discontinued operations and believe that any exposure of a loss in excess of the established reserve cannot be reasonably estimated our experience has been that the overall trends in asbestos litigation have changed over 

time over the last several years we have seen changes in the jurisdictions where claims against fmc are being filed and changes in the mix of products named in the various claims because these claim trends have yet to form a predictable pattern we are presently unable to reasonably estimate our asbestos liability with respect to claims that may be filed in the future

fmc agricultural solutions 



2018  vs 2017 

revenue of 42853 million   increased   17541 million  or approximately 69 percent  versus the prior year period the increase was primarily due to the revenue from the dupont crop protection acquisition which was completed on november 1 2017 and contributed approximately 1742 million to the increase 

segment ebitda of 12178 million   increased  by 6417 million  or approximately 111 percent  compared to the prior year period the increase was primarily driven by the addition of the results from the acquired dupont crop protection business 

refer to the fmc agricultural solutions pro forma financial results with the dupont crop protection business section below for further discussion 

2017  vs 2016   

revenue of 25312 million increased approximately 11 percent versus the prior year period higher volumes contributed 12 percent to the increase while favorable foreign currency had an impact of 1 percent the acquired dupont crop protection business contributed 8 percent to these higher volumes or approximately 193 million these increases were partially offset by lower pricing which impacted revenue by 2 percent 

segment ebitda of 5761 million  increased approximately 20 percent  compared to the yearago period the higher volumes discussed above impacted the change in ebitda by approximately 43 percent and favorable foreign currency impacted the change in ebitda by approximately 5 percent the acquired business represented a majority of these higher volumes offsetting these increases were lower pricing which had an unfavorable impact of approximately 11 percent as well as higher costs which unfavorably impacted the segment by approximately 17 percent to the increase the higher costs were also due to the recently acquired business 

fmc agricultural solutions pro forma financial results with the dupont crop protection business 

we began to present pro forma combined results for the fmc agricultural solutions segment in the first quarter of 2018 we believe that reviewing our operating results by combining actual and pro forma results for the fmc agricultural solutions segment is more useful in identifying trends in or reaching conclusions regarding the overall operating performance of this segment our pro forma segment information includes adjustments as if the dupont crop protection business acquisition had occurred on january 1 2016 our pro forma data is also adjusted for the effects of acquisition accounting but does not include adjustments for 

costs related to integration activities cost savings or synergies that might be achieved by the combined businesses pro forma amounts presented are not necessarily indicative of what our results would have been had we operated the dupont crop protection business since january 1 2016 nor our future results 



 

 



 



pro forma combined results  2018  vs 2017   

pro forma combined revenue of 42853 million  increased by approximately 11 percent versus the prior year period refer to the fmc agricultural solutions pro forma combined revenue by region chart above for further discussion 

pro forma combined segment ebitda of 12178 million  increased approximately 15 percent compared to the prior year the increase was primarily driven by revenue growth discussed above as our sales organization leveraged valuable crossselling opportunities due to minimal customer overlap with dupont additionally we reduced expected operating costs for the acquired dupont crop protection business through accelerated functional integration leveraging our back office infrastructure and reducing manufacturing costs at the acquired plants these were partially offset by higher raw material costs which have had a negative impact on results year over year this is impacting the chemical industry broadly as the chinese government has been shutting down industrial parks as part of their environmental program we have been able to mitigate and manage the impact on our ability to supply our customer due to our diversified supply chain network 

for 2019  fullyear segment revenue is expected to be approximately 445 billion  to 455 billion  

fmc lithium 



2018  vs 2017   

revenue of 4425 million   increased  by approximately 27 percent  versus the prioryear period primarily driven by higher  volumes which impacted revenue by approximately 21 percent  additionally improved  pricing and mix added approximately 8 percent  to the change in revenue foreign currency had an unfavorable impact on the change in revenue of approximately 2 percent 

segment ebitda of 1957 million   increased  approximately 54 million  versus the year ago period the higher  volumes noted above impacted ebitda by 46 million  while improved  pricing and mix had an approximately 27 million  impact these increases were offset by approximately 20 million  in costs due to higher  raw material prices as well as standalone costs related to the separation of livent foreign currency had a slightly unfavorable impact on the change in ebitda 

we announced that we will distribute the remaining livent shares on march 1 2019 at that time results of fmc lithium will move to discontinued operations 

2017  vs 2016 

revenue of 3474 million increased by approximately 32 percent versus the prioryear period driven by improved pricing and mix which accounted for a 23 percent increase additionally higher volumes impacted revenue by 9 percent foreign currency had a minimal impact on the change in revenue 

segment ebitda of 1419 million  increased approximately 57 million versus the year ago period the improved pricing and mix noted above impacted ebitda by approximately 60 million while volume contributed to the change by approximately 11 million these increases were offset by higher raw material prices and energy prices as well as expansion related costs by approximately 13 million foreign currency had a negative impact of less than 1 million on the change in ebitda 

corporate and other 

corporate expenses are included as a component of the line item “selling general and administrative expenses” except for last in firstout lifo related charges that are included as a component of cost of sales and other services on our consolidated statements of income loss 

2018  vs 2017   

corporate and other expenses of 1089 million   increased  by 138 million  from 951 million  in 2017  the increase was primarily driven by higher lifo expense of approximately 5 million compared to the prior year additionally the increase was due to negative foreign currency impacts of approximately 3 million which was mainly due to the foreign exchange impacts on intercompany fund movements in 2018 

2017  vs 2016   

corporate and other expenses of 951 million  increased by 155 million from 796 million  in 2016 the increase was driven by approximately 6 million of corporate incentives due to higher business results and sharebased compensation additionally the prior period included approximately 7 million of lifo income that did not recur in 2017 the remaining increase was due to other corporate items including corporate facility costs foreign exchange losses and other shared corporate costs 

depreciation and amortization 

2018  vs 2017   

depreciation and amortization of 1682 million   increased   552 million  as compared to 2017  of 1130 million  approximately 56 million of the increase was due to the increase in intangible assets and property plant and equipment acquired as a result of the dupont crop protection business 

2017  vs 2016   

depreciation and amortization of 1130 million  increased 124 million  as compared to the prior year of 1006 million  approximately 14 million of the increase was due to the increase in intangible assets and property plant and equipment acquired as a result of the dupont crop protection business partially offset by decreased depreciation and amortization expense in the legacy fmc agricultural solutions segment 

interest expense net 

2018  vs 2017   

interest expense net of 1331 million   increased  by approximately 68 percent  compared to 791 million  in 2017  the increase was driven by the addition of the 2017 term loan facility which increased interest expense by approximately 30 million and higher interest rates which increased interest expense by approximately 6 million the remaining increase of approximately 17 million was due to zero interest allocated to discontinued operations in 2018 as compared to 2017 due to the divestment of the fmc health and nutrition business to dupont in 2017 interest was previously allocated in accordance with relevant discontinued operations accounting guidance 

2017  vs 2016 

interest expense net of 791 million increased by approximately 26 percent compared to 629 million in 2016 the increase was driven by the impacts of higher foreign debt balances of approximately 6 million the addition of the 2017 term loan facility of 6 million and increases in interest rates of approximately 4 million

other charges income net in 2016 consisted of 368 million for continuing environmental sites treated as corporate charges 132 million associated with a license agreement to obtain certain technology and intellectual property rights for new compounds still under development and 42 million as a result of the argentina governments action to devalue its currency these charges were partially offset by other miscellaneous income of 26 million 

nonoperating pension and postretirement charges income 

nonoperating pension and postretirement charges income are included in “selling general and administrative expenses” on our consolidated statements of income loss 

2018  vs 2017 

the charge for 2018  was 38 million  compared to 182 million  in 2017  2017 included 357 million of settlement charges primarily related to the termination of our uk plan the decrease in settlements was partially offset by lower expected return on plan assets due to the shift to a primarily fixed income investment portfolio of 155 million  versus 2017 see note 14 for more information 

2017  vs 2016 

the charge for 2017 was 182 million compared to 234 million in 2016 the decrease was the result of 228 million lower amortization of net actuarial losses as a result of a change in estimate in fiscal 2017 to amortize the gains and losses over the expected life time of the inactive population rather than the average remaining service period of the active participants which was partially offset by an increase of 154 million for recognized losses due to plan settlements see note 14 for more information 

transactionrelated charges 

a detailed description of the transaction related charges is included in note 20 to the consolidated financial statements included within this form 10k and in the segment results reconciliation above within the  results of operations  section of the managements discussion and analysis 

provision for income taxes 

a significant amount of our earnings is generated by our foreign subsidiaries eg singapore and hong kong which tax earnings at lower rates than the united states federal statutory rate our future effective tax rates may be materially impacted by numerous items including a future change in the composition of earnings from foreign and domestic tax jurisdictions as earnings in foreign jurisdictions are typically taxed at more favorable rates than the united states federal statutory rate accounting for uncertain tax positions business combinations expiration of statute of limitations or settlement of tax audits changes in valuation allowance 

changes in tax law and the potential decision to repatriate certain future foreign earnings on which united states or foreign withholding taxes have not been previously accrued 

provision for income taxes for 2018 was expense of 888 million  resulting in an effective tax rate of 119 percent  provision for income taxes for 2017 was expense of 2641 million  resulting in an effective tax rate of 1461 percent  primarily attributable to the 3159 million of provisional tax expense associated with the act provision for income taxes for 2016 was 501 million  resulting in an effective tax rate of 277 percent  note 12 to the consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k includes more details on the drivers of the gaap effective rate and yearoveryear changes we believe showing the reconciliation below of our gaap to nongaap effective tax rate provides investors with useful supplemental information about our tax rate on the core underlying business 



    

 

the primary drivers for the decrease in the yeartodate effective tax rate for 2018 compared to 2017 and 2017 compared to 2016 are shown in the table above the remaining change for 2017 compared to 2016 was due to reduced domestic earnings in our fmc agricultural solutions business and the impact of the full integration of cheminova into our global supply chain 

discontinued operations net of income taxes 

our discontinued operations in periods up to its sale represent our discontinued fmc health and nutrition and fmc alkali chemicals business results as well as adjustments to retained liabilities from other previously discontinued operations the primary liabilities retained include environmental liabilities other postretirement benefit liabilities selfinsurance longterm obligations related to legal proceedings and historical restructuring activities see note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for additional details on our discontinued operations 

2018  vs 2017   

discontinued operations net of income taxes represented a loss  of 1434 million  in 2018  compared to income  of 6217 million  in 2017  the decrease was primarily driven by the divestiture of fmc health and nutrition to dupont in the fourth quarter of 2017 which resulted in an aftertax gain of approximately 727 million  which did not recur in 2018 discontinued operations net of income taxes in 2017 also includes the impairment charge of approximately 148 million  net of tax to reflect the write down of our omega3 business to its sales price during 2018 we recorded a charge of approximately 106 million as a result of active negotiations for a settlement agreement primarily to address discontinued operations at our middleport new york plant which was the subject of an administrative order on consent entered into with the epa and nysdec in 1991 the charge consists of incremental estimated costs of remediation for certain offsite operable units associated with historic site operations as we engage in settlement discussions with nysdec to resolve the path forward regarding remediation refer to note 11 for further details 

2017  vs 2016   

discontinued operations net of income taxes represented income of 6217 million in 2017 compared to income of 810 million in 2016 the increase was primarily driven by the divestiture of fmc health and nutrition to dupont which resulted in an aftertax gain of approximately 727 million amount also includes the impairment charge of approximately 148 million net of tax to reflect the write down our omega3 business to its sales price 

net income loss attributable to fmc stockholders 

2018  vs 2017   

net income attributable to fmc stockholders decreased  to 5021 million  from 5358 million  the decrease  was primarily due to the gain on sale recorded in discontinued operations net of income taxes in the prior year as well as charges related to the middleport environmental settlement as discussed above these were offset by higher income from continuing operations driven by a full year of results from the dupont crop protection business which was completed on november 1 2017 

2017  vs 2016   

net income attributable to fmc stockholders increased to 5358 million from 2091 million the increase was primarily due to the gain on sale recorded in discontinued operations net of income taxes as discussed above offset by the impacts of us tax reform and increases in acquisitionrelated charges refer to note 12 to the consolidated financial statements included within this form 10k

the change in cash provided by financing activities in 2017 primarily related to the increase in proceeds from borrowings of longterm debt mostly to fund the dupont crop protection business acquisition partially offset by higher repayments of longterm debt during the year 

2019  outlook and other potential liquidity needs 

in 2019  we expect a continued improvement in cash generation in aggregate we expect operating cash flow nongaap to increase driven by higher earnings including the continued benefits from the integration of the dupont crop protection business partially offset by higher working capital requirements in 2019  

our cash needs for 2019  outside of costs to separate fmc lithium include operating cash requirements capital expenditures scheduled mandatory payments of longterm debt dividend payments share repurchases contributions to our pension plans environmental and asset retirement obligation spending and restructuring additionally we expect to continue to incur costs associated with integrating the dupont crop protection business due to its significance and complexity the majority of these costs are expected to completed by the first quarter of 2020 we plan to meet our liquidity needs through available cash cash 

generated from operations commercial paper issuances and borrowings under our committed revolving credit facility at december 31 2018  our remaining borrowing capacity under our credit facility was 12458 million  

projected 2019  capital expenditures and expenditures related to contract manufacturers are expected to increase excluding fmc lithium to approximately 150 million the increase is primarily driven by capacity expansion additionally we will continue to incur spending associated with the twoyear implementation of a new sap system 

projected 2019  spending includes approximately 75 million to 80 million of net environmental remediation spending at both our continuing and discontinued sites this projected spending for 2019 includes spending as a result of active negotiations for a settlement agreement primarily to address discontinued operations at our middleport new york site we expect the settlement will result in spending of approximately 20 million to 30 million per year for years 2019  2021 due to front loading of reimbursement in installments of past costs and a 10 million maximum per year on average until the remediation is complete this projected spending does not include expected spending on capital projects relating to environmental control facilities or expected spending for environmental compliance costs which we will include as a component of costs of sales and services in our consolidated statements of income loss since these amounts are not covered by established reserves capital spending to expand maintain or replace equipment at our production facilities may trigger requirements for upgrading our environmental controls which may increase our spending for environmental controls over the foregoing projections 

as a result of the act we will continue to pay the remaining 1613 million  of transition tax over the next seven years 

our us pension plan assets decreased from  13349 million  at december 31 2017  to  12650 million  at december 31 2018  our us pension plan assets comprise approximately all of our total plan assets with the difference representing plan assets related to foreign pension plans see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements included within this form 10k for details on how we develop our longterm rate of return assumptions we made contributions of  300 million  and  440 million  in 2018  and 2017  respectively and intend to contribute 7 million  in 2019  our contributions in 2017  2018  and our intended contribution in 2019  are all in excess of the minimum requirements our contributions in excess of minimums are done with the objective of avoiding variable rate pension benefit guaranty corporation pbgc premiums as well as potentially reducing future funding volatility in 2017 we changed our us qualified pension plan’s investment strategy to a liability hedging approach with an objective of minimizing funded status volatility as a result we expect lower contributions in future periods the portfolio is comprised of 100 percent  fixed income securities and cash investment performance and related risks are measured and monitored on an ongoing basis through monthly liability measurements periodic asset liability studies and quarterly investment portfolio reviews

commitments 

we provide guarantees to financial institutions on behalf of certain fmc agricultural solutions customers principally brazilian customers for their seasonal borrowing the total of these guarantees was 713 million  at december 31 2018  these guarantees arise during the ordinary course of business from relationships with customers and nonconsolidated affiliates nonperformance by the guaranteed party triggers the obligation requiring us to make payments to the beneficiary of the guarantee based on our experience these types of guarantees have not had a material effect on our consolidated financial position or on our liquidity our expectation is that future payment or performance related to the nonperformance of others is considered unlikely 

shortterm debt consisted of foreign credit lines and commercial paper at december 31 2018  and foreign credit lines at december 31 2017  we provide parentcompany guarantees to lending institutions providing credit to our foreign subsidiaries 

in connection with our property and asset sales and divestitures we have agreed to indemnify the buyer for certain liabilities including environmental contamination and taxes that occurred prior to the date of sale our indemnification obligations with respect to these liabilities may be indefinite as to duration and may or may not be subject to a deductible minimum claim amount or cap in cases where it is not possible for us to predict the likelihood that a claim will be made or to make a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential loss or range of loss no specific liability has been recorded if triggered we may be able to recover 

certain of the indemnity payments from third parties in cases where it is possible we have recorded a specific liability within our reserve for discontinued operations refer to note 10 for further details 

our total significant committed contracts that we believe will affect cash over the next four years and beyond are as follows 



 

 contingencies 

see note 19 to our consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k 

climate change 

as a global corporate citizen we are concerned about the consequences of climate change and will take prudent and cost effective actions that reduce green house gas ghg emissions to the atmosphere 

fmc is committed to doing its part to address climate change and its impacts we have set 2025 goals that we will reduce both energy intensity and ghg intensity for our operations by 15 percent from our 2013 baseline year to date our fmc agricultural solutions and fmc lithium segments have reduced energy use by 18 percent and 13 percent and ghg intensity by 12 percent and 18 percent respectively fmc has been reporting its ghg emissions and mitigation strategy to cdp formerly carbon disclosure project since 2016 fmc detailed the business risks and opportunities we have due to climate change and its impacts in our cdp climate change reports 

even as we take action to control the release of ghgs additional warming is anticipated longterm higher average global temperatures could result in induced changes in natural resources growing seasons precipitation patterns weather patterns species distributions water availability sea levels and biodiversity these impacts could cause changes in supplies of raw materials used to maintain fmc’s production capacity and could lead to possible increased sourcing costs depending on how pervasive the climate impacts are in the different geographic locations experiencing changes in natural resources fmc’s customers could be impacted demand for fmc’s products could increase if our products meet our customers’ needs to adapt to climate change impacts or decrease if our products do not meet their needs within our own operations we continually assess our manufacturing sites worldwide for risks and opportunities to increase our preparedness for climate change we are continuing to evaluate sea level 

rise and storm surge at our plants located within 4 meters of sea level to understand timing of potential impacts and response actions that may need to be taken to lessen fmc’s overall environmental footprint we have taken actions to increase the energy efficiency in our manufacturing sites we have also committed to 2025 goals to reduce our water use in highrisk areas by 20 percent and our waste intensities by 15 percent to date fmc agricultural solutions and fmc lithium have reduced our water use in high risk areas by 25 percent and 14 percent and our waste disposal intensity by 28 percent and 18 percent respectively 

recently fmc has undergone significant changes with the acquisition of the dupont crop protection business the divestiture of fmc health and nutrition and the anticipated separation of fmc lithium therefore we are revising our goals to reflect these changes and they will be published in our 2018 sustainability report 

in our product portfolio we see market opportunities for our products to address climate change and its impacts for example fmcs agricultural products can help customers increase yield energy and water efficiency and decrease greenhouse gas emissions our products can also help growers adapt to more unpredictable growing conditions and the effects these types of threats have on crops 

we are improving existing products and developing new platforms and technologies that help mitigate impacts of climate change fmc agricultural solutions is developing products with a lighter environmental footprint in its biologicals products these opportunities could lead to new products and services for our existing and potential customers beyond our products and operations fmc recognizes that energy consumption throughout our supply chain can impact climate change and product costs therefore we will actively work with our entire value chain  suppliers contractors and customers  to improve their energy efficiencies and to reduce their ghg emissions 

we continue to follow legislative and regulatory developments regarding climate change because the regulation of greenhouse gases depending on their nature and scope could subject some of our manufacturing operations to additional costs or limits on operations in december 2015 195 countries at the united nations climate change conference in paris reached an agreement to reduce ghgs it remains to be seen how and when each of these countries will implement this agreement the united states is a signatory to the paris agreement but on june 1 2017 president trump announced that the united states would withdraw from the paris agreement and on august 4 2017 the united states delivered notice of its intention to withdraw to united nations on october 16 2017 the united states environmental protection agency epa filed notice of a rulemaking to repeal the lean power plan epa followed this action with the issuance of an advance notice of proposed rulemaking seeking comment on the proper roles of the state and federal government in regulating emissions from electric power plants and also seeking information on technologies and strategies for reducing emissions from existing plants 

notwithstanding the united states’ withdrawal from the paris agreement will actively manage climate risks and incorporate them in our decision making as indicated in our responses to the cdp climate change module the united states climate alliance a coalition of 21 states and unincorporated selfgoverning territories in the united states have expressed their commitment to upholding the objectives of the 2015 paris agreement on climate change within their borders several of our manufacturing and rd sites fall within this alliance territory fmc remains deeply committed to reducing our ghg emissions and energy consumption at all of our facilities around the world 

some of our foreign operations are subject to national or local energy management or climate change regulation such as our plant in denmark that is subject to the eu emissions trading scheme at present that plant’s emissions are below its designated cap 

future ghg regulatory requirements may result in increased costs of energy additional capital costs for emissions control or new equipment andor costs associated with cap and trade or carbon taxes we are currently monitoring regulatory developments the costs of complying with possible future climate change requirements are difficult to estimate at this time

critical accounting policies 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles us gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses we have described our accounting policies in note 1 principal accounting policies and related financial information to our consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k we have reviewed these accounting policies identifying those that we believe to be critical to the preparation and understanding of our consolidated financial statements we have reviewed these critical accounting policies with the audit committee of the board of directors critical accounting policies are central to our presentation of results of operations and financial condition in accordance with us gaap and require management to make estimates and judgments on certain matters we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience current conditions and other reasonable factors 

revenue recognition and trade receivables 

we recognize revenue when or as we satisfy our performance obligation which is when the customer obtains control of the good or service rebates due to customers are accrued as a reduction of revenue in the same period that the related sales are recorded based on the contract terms refer to note 3 to our consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k for more information 

we record amounts billed for shipping and handling fees as revenue costs incurred for shipping and handling are recorded as costs of sales and services amounts billed for sales and use taxes valueadded taxes and certain excise and other specific transactional taxes imposed on revenueproducing transactions are presented on a net basis and excluded from sales in the consolidated income statements we record a liability until remitted to the respective taxing authority 

we periodically enter into prepayment arrangements with customers primarily in our fmc agricultural solutions segment and receive advance payments for product to be delivered in future periods these advance payments are recorded as deferred revenue and classified as “advance payments from customers” on the consolidated balance sheet revenue associated with advance payments is recognized as shipments are made and transfer of control to the customer takes place 

trade receivables consist of amounts owed to us from customer sales and are recorded when revenue is recognized the allowance for trade receivables represents our best estimate of the probable losses associated with potential customer defaults in developing our allowance for trade receivables we use a two stage process which includes calculating a general formula to develop an allowance to appropriately address the uncertainty surrounding collection risk of our entire portfolio and specific allowances for customers where the risk of collection has been reasonably identified either due to liquidity constraints or disputes over contractual terms and conditions 

our method of calculating the general formula consists of estimating the recoverability of trade receivables based on historical experience current collection trends and external business factors such as economic factors including regional bankruptcy rates and political factors our analysis of trade receivable collection risk is performed quarterly and the allowance is adjusted accordingly 

we also hold longterm receivables that represent longterm customer receivable balances related to pastdue accounts which are not expected to be collected within the current year our policy for the review of the allowance for these receivables is consistent with the discussion in the preceding paragraph above on trade receivables therefore on an ongoing basis we continue to evaluate the credit quality of our longterm receivables utilizing aging of receivables collection experience and writeoffs as well as existing economic conditions to determine if an additional allowance is necessary 

on january 1 2018 accounting standards update 201409 revenue from contracts with customers became effective see note 2 to these consolidated financial statements for more information 

environmental obligations and related recoveries 

we provide for environmentalrelated obligations when they are probable and amounts can be reasonably estimated where the available information is sufficient to estimate the amount of liability that estimate has been used where the information is only sufficient to establish a range of probable liability and no point within the range is more likely than any other the lower end of the range has been used 

estimated obligations to remediate sites that involve oversight by the united states environmental protection agency “epa” or similar government agencies are generally accrued no later than when a record of decision “rod” or equivalent is issued or upon completion of a remedial investigationfeasibility study “rifs” or equivalent that is submitted by us to the appropriate government agency or agencies estimates are reviewed quarterly by our environmental remediation management as well as by 

financial and legal management and if necessary adjusted as additional information becomes available the estimates can change substantially as additional information becomes available regarding the nature or extent of site contamination required remediation methods and other actions by or against governmental agencies or private parties 

our environmental liabilities for continuing and discontinued operations are principally for costs associated with the remediation andor study of sites at which we are alleged to have released hazardous substances into the environment such costs principally include among other items rifs site remediation costs of operation and maintenance of the remediation plan management costs fees to outside law firms and consultants for work related to the environmental effort and future monitoring costs estimated site liabilities are determined based upon existing remediation laws and technologies specific site consultants’ engineering studies or by extrapolating experience with environmental issues at comparable sites 

included in our environmental liabilities are costs for the operation maintenance and monitoring of site remediation plans omm such reserves are based on our best estimates for these omm plans over time we may incur omm costs in excess of these reserves however we are unable to reasonably estimate an amount in excess of our recorded reserves because we cannot reasonably estimate the period for which such omm plans will need to be in place or the future annual cost of such remediation as conditions at these environmental sites change over time such additional omm costs could be significant in total but would be incurred over an extended period of years 

included in the environmental reserve balance other assets balance and disclosure of reasonably possible loss contingencies are amounts from third party insurance policies which we believe are probable of recovery 

provisions for environmental costs are reflected in income net of probable and estimable recoveries from named potentially responsible parties “prps” or other third parties such provisions incorporate inflation and are not discounted to their present values 

in calculating and evaluating the adequacy of our environmental reserves we have taken into account the joint and several liability imposed by comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act “cercla” and the analogous state laws on all prps and have considered the identity and financial condition of the other prps at each site to the extent possible we have also considered the identity and financial condition of other third parties from whom recovery is anticipated as well as the status of our claims against such parties although we are unable to forecast the ultimate contributions of prps and other third parties with absolute certainty the degree of uncertainty with respect to each party is taken into account when determining the environmental reserve by adjusting the reserve to reflect the facts and circumstances on a sitebysite basis our liability includes our best estimate of the costs expected to be paid before the consideration of any potential recoveries from third parties we believe that any recorded recoveries related to prps are realizable in all material respects recoveries are recorded as either an offset in “environmental liabilities continuing and discontinued” or as “other assets” in our consolidated balance sheets in accordance with us accounting literature 

see note 11 to our consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k for changes in estimates associated with our environmental obligations 

impairments and valuation of longlived and indefinitelived assets 

our longlived assets primarily include property plant and equipment goodwill and intangible assets the assets and liabilities of acquired businesses are measured at their estimated fair values at the dates of acquisition the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired including identified intangibles is recorded as goodwill the determination and allocation of fair value to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is based on various assumptions and valuation methodologies requiring considerable management judgment including estimates based on historical information current market data and future expectations the principal assumptions utilized in our valuation methodologies include revenue growth rates operating margin estimates and discount rates although the estimates were deemed reasonable by management based on information available at the dates of acquisition those estimates are inherently uncertain 

we test for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the net book value of our property plant and equipment may not be recoverable from the estimated undiscounted expected future cash flows expected to result from their use and eventual disposition in cases where the estimated undiscounted expected future cash flows are less than net book value an impairment loss is recognized equal to the amount by which the net book value exceeds the estimated fair value of assets which is based on discounted cash flows at the lowest level determinable the estimated cash flows reflect our assumptions about selling prices volumes costs and market conditions over a reasonable period of time 

we perform an annual impairment test of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets in the third quarter of each year or more frequently whenever an event or change in circumstances occurs that would require reassessment of the recoverability of those assets in performing our evaluation we assess qualitative factors such as overall financial performance of our reporting units 

anticipated changes in industry and market structure competitive environments planned capacity and cost factors such as raw material prices based on our assessment for 2018  we determined that no goodwill impairment charge to our continuing operations was required the majority of the brands intangible asset relates to our proprietary brand portfolio for which the fair value was substantially in excess of the carrying value during the third quarter of 2018 we recorded an impairment charge of approximately 2 million  in our generic brand portfolio which is part of the fmc agricultural solutions segment the carrying value of the generic portfolio subsequent to the charge is approximately 3 million  

see note 8 to our consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k for charges associated with longlived asset disposal costs and the activity associated with the restructuring reserves 

pension and other postretirement benefits 

we provide qualified and nonqualified defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans as well as postretirement health care and life insurance benefit plans to our employees and retirees the costs benefits and obligations related to these benefits reflect key assumptions related to general economic conditions including interest discount rates healthcare cost trend rates expected rates of return on plan assets and the rates of compensation increase for employees the costs benefits and obligations for these benefit programs are also affected by other assumptions such as average retirement age mortality employee turnover and plan participation to the extent our plans’ actual experience as influenced by changing economic and financial market conditions or by changes to our own plans’ demographics differs from these assumptions the costs and obligations for providing these benefits as well as the plans’ funding requirements could increase or decrease when actual results differ from our assumptions the difference is typically recognized over future periods in addition the unrealized gains and losses related to our pension and postretirement benefit obligations may also affect periodic benefit costs benefits in future periods 

we use several assumptions and statistical methods to determine the asset values used to calculate both the expected rate of return on assets component of pension cost and to calculate our plans’ funding requirements the expected rate of return on plan assets is based on a marketrelated value of assets that recognizes investment gains and losses over a fiveyear period we use an actuarial value of assets to determine our plans’ funding requirements the actuarial value of assets must be within a certain range high or low of the actual market value of assets and is adjusted accordingly 

we select the discount rate used to calculate pension and other postretirement obligations based on a review of available yields on highquality corporate bonds as of the measurement date in selecting a discount rate as of december 31 2018  we placed particular emphasis on a discount rate yieldcurve provided by our actuary this yieldcurve when populated with projected cash flows that represent the expected timing and amount of our plans benefit payments produced an effective discount rate of 435 percent  for our us qualified plan 397 percent  for our us nonqualified and 408 percent  for our us other postretirement benefit plans 

the discount rates used at our december 31 2018  and 2017  measurement dates for the us qualified plan were 435 percent  and 368 percent  respectively the effect of the change in the discount rate from 368 percent  to 435 percent  at december 31 2018  resulted in a 913 million   decrease  to our us qualified pension benefit obligations the effect of the change in the discount rate from 422 percent  at december 31 2016  to 368 percent  at december 31 2017  resulted in a 01 million   increase  to the 2018  us qualified pension expense 

the change in discount rate from 368 percent  at december 31 2017  to 435 percent  at december 31 2018  was attributable to an increase in yields on high quality corporate bonds with cash flows matching the timing and amount of our expected future benefit payments between the 2017  and 2018  measurement dates using the december 31 2018  and 2017  yield curves our us qualified plan cash flows produced a single weightedaverage discount rate of approximately 435 percent  and 368 percent  respectively 

in developing the assumption for the longterm rate of return on assets for our us plan we take into consideration the technical analysis performed by our outside actuaries including historical market returns information on the assumption for longterm real returns by asset class inflation assumptions and expectations for standard deviation related to these best estimates we also consider the historical performance of our own plan’s trust which has earned a compound annual rate of return of approximately 69 percent  over the last 20 years which is in excess of comparable market indices for the same period as well as other factors which are discussed in note 14 to our consolidated financial statements in this form 10k our longterm rate of return for the fiscal year ended december 31 2018  2017  and 2016  was 500 percent  650 percent  and 700 percent  respectively 

for the sensitivity of our pension costs to incremental changes in assumptions see our discussion below 

sensitivity analysis related to key pension and postretirement benefit assumptions 

a onehalf percent increase in the assumed discount rate would have decreased pension and other postretirement benefit obligations by 624 million  and 736 million  at december 31 2018  and 2017  respectively and decreased pension and other postretirement benefit costs by 04 million  04 million  and 52 million  for 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively a onehalf percent decrease in the assumed discount rate would have increased pension and other postretirement benefit obligations by 683 million  and 813 million  at december 31 2018  and 2017  respectively and increased pension and other postretirement benefit cost by 01 million  04 million  and 57 million  for 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively 

a onehalf percent increase in the assumed expected longterm rate of return on plan assets would have decreased pension costs by 64 million  60 million  and 60 million  for 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively a onehalf percent decrease in the assumed longterm rate of return on plan assets would have increased pension costs by 64 million  60 million  and 60 million  for 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively 

further details on our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and net periodic benefit costs benefits are found in note 14 to our consolidated financial statements in this form 10k 

income taxes 

we have recorded a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets in certain jurisdictions to the amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized in assessing the need for this allowance we have considered a number of factors including future taxable income the jurisdictions in which such income is earned and our ongoing tax planning strategies in the event that we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period such determination was made similarly should we conclude that we would be able to realize certain deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase income in the period such determination was made 

additionally we file income tax returns in the us federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions certain income tax returns for fmc entities taxable in the us and significant foreign jurisdictions are open for examination and adjustment we assess our income tax positions and record a liability for all years open to examination based upon our evaluation of the facts circumstances and information available at the reporting date for those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained we have recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information we adjust these liabilities if necessary upon the completion of tax audits or changes in tax law 

on december 22 2017 the act was enacted in the united states the act reduced the us federal corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent required companies to pay a onetime transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred and created new taxes on certain foreign sourced earnings at december 31 2018 the company had completed its accounting for the impacts of the enactment of the act

 item 7a 

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend our earnings cash flows and financial position are exposed to market risks relating to fluctuations in commodity prices interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates our policy is to minimize exposure to our cash flow over time caused by changes in commodity interest and currency exchange rates to accomplish this we have implemented a controlled program of risk management consisting of appropriate derivative contracts entered into with major financial institutions 

the analysis below presents the sensitivity of the market value of our financial instruments to selected changes in market rates and prices the range of changes chosen reflects our view of changes that are reasonably possible over a oneyear period market value estimates are based on the present value of projected future cash flows considering the market rates and prices chosen 

at december 31 2018  our net financial instrument position was a net asset  of 102 million  compared to a net asset  of 44 million  at december 31 2017  the change in the net financial instrument position was primarily due to exchange rate fluctuations in our foreign exchange portfolio 

since our risk management programs are generally highly effective the potential loss in value for each risk management portfolio described below would be largely offset by changes in the value of the underlying exposure 

commodity price risk 

energy costs are diversified among coal electricity and natural gas we attempt to mitigate our exposure to increasing energy costs by hedging the cost of future deliveries of natural gas and by entering into fixedprice contracts for the purchase of coal and fuel oil to analyze the effect of changing energy prices we perform a sensitivity analysis in which we assume an instantaneous 10 percent change in energy market prices from their levels at december 31 2018  and 2017  with all other variables including interest rates held constant note as of december 31 2018  and december 31 2017  we had no open commodity contracts as a result there was no sensitivity analysis performed over commodity price risk for the periods presented 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

the primary currencies for which we have exchange rate exposure are the us dollar versus the euro the chinese yuan the brazilian real and the argentine peso foreign currency debt and foreign exchange forward contracts are used in countries where we do business thereby reducing our net asset exposure foreign exchange forward contracts are also used to hedge firm and highly anticipated foreign currency cash flows 

to analyze the effects of changing foreign currency rates we have performed a sensitivity analysis in which we assume an instantaneous 10 percent change in the foreign currency exchange rates from their levels at december 31 2018  and 2017  with all other variables including interest rates held constant 



interest rate risk 

one of the strategies that we can use to manage interest rate exposure is to enter into interest rate swap agreements in these agreements we agree to exchange at specified intervals the difference between fixed and variable interest amounts calculated on an agreedupon notional principal amount in the quarter ended december 31 2018  we had outstanding contracts in place to swap portions of our variablerate debt to fixedrate debt with an aggregate notional value of 2000 million  there were no interest rate swap agreements as of december 31 2017 

to analyze the effects of changing interest rates we have performed a sensitivity analysis in which we assume an instantaneous one percent change in the interest rates from their levels at december 31 2018  with all other variables held constant 



our debt portfolio at december 31 2018  is composed of 52 percent  fixedrate debt and 48 percent  variablerate debt the variablerate component of our debt portfolio principally consists of borrowings under our 2017 term loan facility commercial paper 

program credit facility variablerate industrial and pollution control revenue bonds and amounts outstanding under foreign subsidiary credit lines changes in interest rates affect different portions of our variablerate debt portfolio in different ways 

based on the variablerate debt in our debt portfolio at december 31 2018  a one percentage point increase in interest rates would have increased gross interest expense by 132 million  and a one percentage point decrease in interest rates would have decreased gross interest expense by 132 million  for the year ended december 31 2018

business 

tableend general 

we are a diversified chemical company serving agricultural consumer and industrial markets globally with innovative solutions applications and marketleading products we operate in two distinct business segments fmc agricultural solutions and fmc lithium our fmc agricultural solutions segment develops markets and sells all three major classes of crop protection chemicals insecticides herbicides and fungicides these products are used in agriculture to enhance crop yield and quality by controlling a broad spectrum of insects weeds and disease as well as in nonagricultural markets for pest control our fmc lithium segment manufactures lithium for use in a wide range of lithium products which are used primarily in energy storage specialty polymers and chemical synthesis application 

dupont crop protection business 

on march 31 2017 we entered into a definitive transaction agreement the “transaction agreement” with e i du pont de nemours and company “dupont on november 1 2017 pursuant to the terms and conditions set forth in the transaction agreement we completed the acquisition of certain assets relating to duponts crop protection business and research and development organization dupont crop protection business collectively the dupont crop protection business acquisition in connection with this transaction we sold to dupont our fmc health and nutrition segment and paid dupont 12 billion in cash our fmc health and nutrition business and its results have been presented as a discontinued operation for all periods presented throughout this document 

cheminova as 

on april 21 2015 pursuant to the terms and conditions set forth in the purchase agreement we completed the acquisition of 100 percent of the outstanding equity of cheminova as a denmark aktieselskab cheminova from auriga industries as a denmark aktieselskab for an aggregate purchase price of 12 billion  excluding assumed net debt and hedgedrelated costs of approximately 06 billion  the “acquisition” 

at december 31 2016 we had substantially completed the integration of cheminova into our fmc agricultural solutions segment 

fmc strategy 

fmc has streamlined its portfolio over the past seven years to focus on technologydriven end markets with attractive longterm demand trends the actions we have taken over the past year have better positioned each of our businesses to capitalize on future growth opportunities 

2017 was a pivotal year for fmc agricultural solutions as we acquired a significant portion of the dupont crop protection business to transform fmc into a tierone leader and the fifth largest global provider in the agricultural chemicals market the acquisition included dupont’s industryleading insecticides and herbicides the majority of which are patented technologies exceptional discovery research capabilities and a global manufacturing network fmc’s legacy business also had a strong year as it reaped the benefits of proactive measures taken in 2015 and 2016 to outperform the market in another challenging year for crop chemical providers fmc will begin launching its legacy technology pipeline of eight new active ingredients starting with our bixafen fungicide launch in north america targeted for early 2019 we also launched about 50 new legacy product formulations in 2017 which is key to life cycle management of our products the dupont crop protection business acquisition added 15 discovery leads to our pipeline and as a result of the acquisition we expect to spend approximately 8 percent of fmc agricultural solutions sales on research and development annually fmc acquired 14 manufacturing plants from dupont and with 26 total plants today we have the scale to operate this business with greater resources and global reach to address changing market conditions 

fmc is one of the leading global producers of specialty lithium products and 2017 was a year of significant growth for fmc lithium in march we announced our intention to separate fmc lithium into a publicly traded company during 2018 we took an important step in december when we finalized new operating agreements in argentina the provincial government of 

catamarca formalized these agreements by passing legislation that sets our royalty rates and our commitments to corporate social responsibility programs while also paving the way for us to expand capacity as an independent company fmc lithium will have a focused investor base and strong balance sheet ensuring it has the financial capacity to pursue its growth plans and be a leading force in this critical industry we made several strategic decisions during the last few years to focus fmc lithium on downstream highervalue products we convert most of our lithium carbonate and chloride production into highpurity materials including lithium hydroxide used in electric vehicle ev batteries and butyllithium and lithium metals for specialty applications in 2017 we expanded capacity in multiple locations including a new lithium hydroxide plant in china that can produce 9000 metric tons per year to meet accelerating demand for fmc’s products commercial sales from this facility began in june and we had full commercial production for the final four months of 2017 we remain on track to reach 30000 metric tons of lithium hydroxide manufacturing capacity by the end of 2019 by adding another 12000 metric tons of capacity to feed these downstream products we also announced plans to more than double lithium carbonate production at our argentina site to approximately 40000 metric tons per year by 2022 in addition debottlenecking projects at our major facilities are contributing to shortterm capacity increases we will also continue to invest in other higher growth higher value segments of the lithium market including butyllithium for use in chemical synthesis and high purity lithium metal for aerospace and energy storage applications 

we maintain our commitment to enterprise sustainability including responsible stewardship as we grow we will do so in a responsible way safety and business ethics will remain of utmost importance meeting and exceeding our customers’ expectations will continue to be a primary focus

fmc agricultural solutions 

      

overview 

    

our fmc agricultural solutions segment which represents approximately 88 percent  of our 2017  consolidated revenues operates in the agrochemicals industry this segment develops manufactures and sells a portfolio of crop protection professional pest control and lawn and garden products 

products and markets 

  

fmc agricultural solutions portfolio is comprised of three major pesticide categories insecticides herbicides and fungicides the majority of our product lines consist of insecticides and herbicides and we have a small but fastgrowing portfolio of fungicides mainly used in high value crop segments our insecticides are used to control a wide spectrum of pests while our herbicide portfolio primarily targets a large variety of difficulttocontrol weeds we are also investing substantially in a plant health program that includes biological crop protection products seed treatments and micronutrients 

in the latin american region which includes the large agricultural market of brazil we sell directly to large growers through our own sales and marketing organization and we access the market through independent distributors in north america we access the market through several major national and regional distributors and have our own sales and marketing organization in canada with the 2015 acquisition of cheminova we now access the european markets through our own sales and marketing organizations with the 2017 acquisition of the dupont crop protection business we now access key asian markets through large distributors in addition to either local independent distributors or our own sales and marketing organizations through these and other alliances along with our own targeted marketing efforts access to novel technologies and our innovation initiatives we expect to maintain and enhance our access in key agricultural and noncrop markets and develop new products that will help us continue to compete effectively 

industry overview 

the three principal categories of agricultural and noncrop chemicals are herbicides insecticides and fungicides representing approximately 42 percent 28 percent and 27 percent of global industry revenue respectively 

the agrochemicals industry is relatively consolidated but further consolidation is likely as several of the leading crop protection companies are actively pursuing merger opportunities leading crop protection companies fmc syngenta ag bayer ag monsanto company basf ag dowdupont and adama currently represent approximately 74 percent of the industry’s global sales the next tier of agrochemical producers include sumitomo chemical company ltd nufarm ltd platform specialty products corporation and united phosphorous ltd fmc employs various differentiated strategies and competes with unique technologies focusing on certain crops markets and geographies while also being supported by a lowcost manufacturing model 

growth 

the 2017 acquisition of a significant portion of the dupont crop protection business positions fmc among leading agrochemical producers in the world the acquired insecticides are predominantly based on patentprotected active ingredients and are growing well above market patterns our complementary technologies will lead to improved formulation capabilities and a broader innovation pipeline resulting in new and differentiated products we will take advantage of enhanced market access positions and an expanded portfolio to deliver nearterm growth 

we will continue to grow by obtaining new and approved uses for existing product lines and acquiring accessing developing marketing distributing andor selling complementary chemistries and related technologies in order to strengthen our product portfolio and our capabilities to effectively service our target markets and customers 

our growth efforts focus on developing environmentally compatible and sustainable solutions that can effectively increase farmers’ yields and provide costeffective alternatives to chemistries which may be prone to resistance we are committed to providing unique differentiated products to our customers by acquiring and further developing technologies as well as investing in innovation to extend product life cycles our external growth efforts include product acquisitions inlicensing of chemistries and technologies and alliances that bolster our market access complement our existing product portfolio or provide entry into adjacent spaces we have entered into a range of development and distribution agreements with other companies that provide access to new technologies and products which we can subsequently commercialize 

fmc lithium 

  

  

overview 

our fmc lithium segment represents 12 percent  of our 2017  consolidated revenues 

while lithium is sold into a variety of end markets we have focused our strategy on specialty products that require a high level of manufacturing and technical knowhow to meet customer requirements 

lithium is a critical element in advanced batteries for use in hybrid electric plugin hybrids and allelectric vehicles the electrochemical properties of lithium make it an ideal material for portable energy storage including evs smart phones tablets laptop computers military devices and other energy storage technologies 

organolithium products are highly valued in the polymer market as initiators in the production of synthetic rubbers and elastomers organolithiums are also sold to fine chemical and pharmaceutical customers who use lithiums unique chemical properties to synthesize high valueadded products 

industry overview 

    

fmc lithium serves a diverse group of markets our product offerings are primarily inorganic and generally have few costeffective substitutes a major growth driver for lithium in the future will be the rate of adoption of electric vehicles 

most markets for lithium chemicals are global with significant growth occurring both in asia and north america primarily driven by the development and manufacture of lithium ion batteries there are three key producers of lithium compounds fmc albemarle corporation previously rockwood holdings inc and sociedad química y minera de chile sa in addition to these producers orocobre is ramping up production from its brine source in argentina and several chinese producers convert lithium containing hard rock concentrates sourced from australia into lithium compounds we expect additional capacity to be added by new and existing producers for the next several years fmc and albemarle corporation are the primary producers of specialty lithium products 

source and availability of raw materials 

raw materials used by fmc agricultural solutions primarily processed chemicals are obtained from a variety of suppliers worldwide we extract ores used in fmc lithium’s manufacturing processes from lithium brines in argentina 

patents 

we own and license a significant number of us and foreign patents trademarks trade secrets and other intellectual property that are cumulatively important to our business the fmc intellectual property estate provides us with an important competitive advantage our patents cover many of our products processes and product uses as well as many aspects of our research and development activities patents are granted by individual jurisdictions and the duration of our patents depends on their respective jurisdictions we also own many trademarks that are well recognized by customers or product endusers unlike patents ownership rights in trademarks do not expire so long as the trademarks are continued in use and properly protected  we actively monitor and manage our trademarks to maintain such protection we believe that the invalidity or loss of any particularly significant patent trademark or license would be a remote possibility andor would not likely have a material adverse effect on the overall business of fmc 

we own a number of us and foreign patents trademarks and licenses that are cumulatively important to our business we do not believe that the loss of any individual or combination of related patents trademarks or licenses would have a material adverse effect on the overall business of fmc the duration of our patents depends on their respective jurisdictions 

seasonality 

the seasonal nature of the crop protection market and the geographic spread of the fmc agricultural solutions business can result in significant variations in quarterly earnings among geographic locations fmc agricultural solutions products sold in the northern hemisphere north america europe and parts of asia serve seasonal agricultural markets from march through september generally resulting in earnings in the first second and third quarters markets in the southern hemisphere latin america and parts of the asia pacific region including australia are served from july through february generally resulting in earnings in the third fourth and first quarters the remainder of our business is generally not subject to significant seasonal fluctuations 

competition 

we encounter substantial competition in each of our two business segments we market our products through our own sales organization and through alliance partners independent distributors and sales representatives the number of our principal competitors varies from segment to segment in general we compete by providing advanced technology high product quality reliability quality customer and technical service and by operating in a costefficient manner 

our fmc agricultural solutions segment competes primarily in the global chemical crop protection market for insecticides herbicides and fungicides industry products include crop protection chemicals and for certain major competitors genetically engineered crop biotechnology products competition from generic agrochemical producers is significant as a number of key product patents held industrywide have expired in the last decade in general we compete as an innovator by focusing on product development including novel formulations proprietary mixes and advanced delivery systems and by acquiring or licensing mostly proprietary chemistries or technologies that complement our product and geographic focus we also differentiate ourselves by our global costcompetitiveness through our manufacturing strategies establishing effective product stewardship programs and developing strategic alliances that strengthen market access in key countries and regions 

our fmc lithium segment sells lithiumbased products worldwide we and our two most significant competitors in lithium extract the element from naturally occurring lithiumrich brines located in the andes mountains of argentina and chile which are believed to be the world’s most significant and lowest cost sources of lithium 

research and development expense 

we perform research and development in all of our segments with the majority of our efforts focused in the fmc agricultural solutions segment the development efforts in the fmc agricultural solutions segment focus on developing environmentally 

sound solutions and new product formulations that costeffectively increase farmers’ yields and provide alternatives to existing and new chemistries our research and development expenses in the last three years are set forth below

legal proceedings 

tableend 

like hundreds of other industrial companies we have been named as one of many defendants in asbestosrelated personal injury litigation most of these cases allege personal injury or death resulting from exposure to asbestos in premises of fmc or to asbestoscontaining components installed in machinery or equipment manufactured or sold by discontinued operations the machinery and equipment businesses we owned or operated did not fabricate the asbestoscontaining component parts at issue in the litigation and to this day neither the us occupational safety and health administration nor the environmental protection agency has banned the use of these components further the asbestoscontaining parts for this machinery and equipment were accessible only at the time of infrequent repair and maintenance a few jurisdictions have permitted claims to proceed against equipment manufacturers relating to insulation installed by other companies on such machinery and equipment we believe that overall the claims against fmc are without merit 

as of december 31 2017  there were approximately 9000 premises and product asbestos claims pending against fmc in several jurisdictions since the 1980s approximately 114000 asbestos claims against fmc have been discharged the overwhelming majority of which have been dismissed without any payment to the claimant since the 1980s settlements with claimants have totaled approximately 89 million 

we intend to continue managing these asbestosrelated cases in accordance with our historical experience we have established a reserve for this litigation within our discontinued operations and believe that any exposure of a loss in excess of the established reserve cannot be reasonably estimated our experience has been that the overall trends in asbestos litigation have changed over time over the last several years we have seen changes in the jurisdictions where claims against fmc are being filed and changes in the mix of products named in the various claims because these claim trends have yet to form a predictable pattern we are presently unable to reasonably estimate our asbestos liability with respect to claims that may be filed in the future

overview 

we are a diversified chemical company serving agricultural consumer and industrial markets globally with innovative solutions applications and marketleading products we operate in two distinct business segments fmc agricultural solutions and fmc lithium our fmc agricultural solutions segment develops markets and sells all three major classes of crop protection chemicals insecticides herbicides and fungicides these products are used in agriculture to enhance crop yield and quality by controlling a broad spectrum of insects weeds and disease as well as in nonagricultural markets for pest control our fmc lithium segment manufactures lithium for use in a wide range of lithium products which are used primarily in energy storage specialty polymers and chemical synthesis application 

2017  highlights 

the following are the more significant developments in our businesses during the year ended december 31 2017  

 other 2017  highlights 

in fmc lithium we are seeing the benefits of our strategy to grow our business in the technologydriven specialty end markets where demand continues to accelerate and pricing trends across our portfolio remain favorable in march we announced our intention to separate fmc lithium into a publicly traded company during 2018 in june we started commercial sales from our new lithium hydroxide facility in china we expanded production of lithium carbonate at our argentina site through debottlenecking projects and we also announced plans to more than double lithium carbonate production at that same site to at least 40000 metric tons by 2022 

  

on august 1 2017 we completed the sale of the omega3 business to pelagia as for 38 million 

in may 2017 we entered into a new 15 billion term loan facility to fund the transaction agreement with dupontwe also entered into an amended and restated 15 billion revolving credit facility and amended the existing term loan facility at that time among other things the amendments temporarily increased the maximum leverage ratio financial covenant in order to permit the debt incurred under the contemplated new term loan facility along with certain other changes to permit the expected transaction 

2018  outlook 

we believe the crop protection chemical market will be flat to up low single digits and we believe that the lithium market will continue to see significant demand growth in 2018 we believe that our 2018 plan is very achievable as it relies on things we control rather than on expectations of positive external events 

we expect to deliver segment revenue and earnings growth in each business in fmc agricultural solutions we will focus on the integration of the dupont crop protection business and on creating a stronger combined business to capitalize on the products and expertise of these two former organizations we expect to outperform the crop protection market in 2018 owing to our recently acquired products and to our proactive competitive positioning of our legacy business we believe that fmc lithium will increase earnings significantly through volume and price increases in 2018 

on a longterm basis we are a technologydriven company with lowcost operations a world class research and development organization that balances shortand midterm developments with longterm innovations and global scale with strong regional expertise to support local customers 

please see segment discussions under the section entitled “results of operations” for 2018  outlook for each segment 

results of operations— 2017  2016  and 2015   

overview 

the following presents a reconciliation of our segment operating profit to the net income attributable to fmc stockholders as seen through the eyes of our management for management purposes we report the operating performance of each of our business segments based on earnings before interest and income taxes excluding corporate expenses other income expense net and corporate special income charges 



 

 

   



 

 

  

adjusted earnings reconciliation 

the following chart which is provided to assist the readers of our financial statements depicts certain aftertax charges gains these items are excluded from the measures we use to evaluate business performance and determine certain performancebased compensation these aftertax items are discussed in detail within the “other results of operations” section that follows additionally the chart below discloses our nongaap financial measure “adjusted aftertax earnings from continuing operations attributable to fmc stockholders” reconciled from the gaap financial measure “net income loss attributable to fmc stockholders” we believe that this measure provides useful information about our operating results to investors we also believe that excluding the effect of restructuring and other income and charges nonoperating pension and postretirement charges certain nongaap tax adjustments from operating results and discontinued operations allows management and investors to compare more easily the financial performance of our underlying businesses from period to period this measure should not be considered as a substitute for net income loss or other measures of performance or liquidity reported in accordance with gaap 



 

 

in the discussion below please refer to our chart titled segment results reconciliation  within the results of operations section all comparisons are between the periods unless otherwise noted 

segment results 

for management purposes segment operating profit is defined as segment revenue less segment operating expenses segment operating expenses consist of costs of sales and services selling general and administrative expenses sga and research and development expenses rd we have excluded the following items from segment operating profit corporate staff expense interest income and expense associated with corporate debt facilities and investments income taxes gains or losses on divestitures of businesses restructuring and other charges income nonoperating pension and postretirement charges investment gains and losses loss on extinguishment of debt asset impairments lastin firstout “lifo” inventory adjustments acquisitiondivestiture related charges business separation costs and other income and expense items 

information about how each of these items relates to our businesses at the segment level and results by segment are discussed below and in note 19 to our consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k 

beginning in 2018 we will present earnings before interest taxes and depreciation and amortization ebitda by operating segment which is a nongaap financial measure we define segment ebitda as segment operating profit excluding depreciation and amortization expense we believe that this nongaap financial measure provides a useful metric for management and investors to better assess operating performance and enables transparency to investors and analysts for periodtoperiod comparability of financial performance due to the recent dupont crop protection business acquisition we acquired a large number of intangible assets and property plant and equipment the depreciation and amortization on the intangible assets is expected to significantly increase our depreciation and amortization expense 

fmc agricultural solutions 



2017  vs 2016 

revenue of 25312 million   increased  approximately 11 percent  versus the prior year period higher  volumes contributed 12 percent  to the increase while favorable foreign currency had an impact of 1 percent  the acquired dupont crop protection business contributed 8 percent to these higher volumes or approximately 193 million these increases were partially offset by lower  pricing which impacted revenue by 2 percent  

operating profit of 4856 million   increased  approximately 21 percent  compared to the yearago period the higher  volumes discussed above impacted the change in operating profit by 43 percent  and favorable foreign currency impacted the change in operating profit by 5 percent  the acquired business represented a majority of these higher volumes offsetting these increases were lower pricing which had an unfavorable  impact of 11 percent  as well as higher  costs which unfavorably impacted the segment by 16 percent  to the increase the higher costs were also due to the recently acquired business 

for 2018  fullyear segment revenue is expected to be approximately 395 billion  to 415 billion  and fullyear segment ebitda is expected to be approximately 105 billion to 115 billion fullyear depreciation and amortization is expected to be approximately 145 million we anticipate legacy fmc agricultural solutions revenue will grow 2 to 4 percent while the acquired business is expected to grow by 6 to 10 percent

revenue of 22748 million  decreased approximately 13 percent versus pro forma combined revenue the prior year period volumes contributed to 14 percent of the decline and unfavorable foreign currency contributed another one percent to the decline these declines were partially offset by favorable pricing which contributed a 2 percent increase the lower volumes were partially due to actions we took to eliminate certain product sales in latin america refer to the chart below for discussion on revenue by region these actions reduced revenue by approximately 175 million compared to the pro forma revenue for 2015 

operating profit of 3999 million  increased approximately 4 percent compared to the pro forma combined operating profit for the prior period improved pricing and mix impacted pro forma operating profit by 10 percent which was predominantly experienced in both brazil and north america and favorable foreign currency impacted pro forma results by 4 percent lower costs primarily selling general and administrative in nature also favorably impacted results by 10 percent the lower volumes noted above had a negative impact on pro forma operating profit of 20 percent

segment operating profit of 1267 million   increased  approximately 57 million  versus the year ago period the improved  pricing and mix noted above impacted operating profit by approximately 60 million  while volume contributed to the change by 11 million  these increases were offset by higher  raw material prices and energy prices as well as expansion related costs by approximately 13 million  foreign currency had a negative impact of less than 1 million on the change in operating profit 

full year segment revenue is expected to be approximately 420 million  to 460 million  for 2018 and fullyear segment ebitda is expected to be approximately 180 million to 200 million fullyear depreciation and amortization is expected to be approximately 20 million 

2016  vs 2015 

revenue of 2641 million increased by approximately 11 percent versus the prioryear period driven by favorable pricing of carbonate chloride and hydroxide which accounted for 14 percent of the change this was offset by lower volumes due to increased demand from downstream products which impacted revenues by 3 percent 

segment operating profit of 702 million increased approximately 47 million versus the year ago period the favorable pricing noted above impacted operating profit by approximately 33 million while volume had a negative impact on operating profit of 3 million favorable foreign currency impacts increased operating profit by approximately 3 million additionally lower raw material prices lower energy prices and increased manufacturing efficiencies improved operating profit by approximately 14 million 

corporate and other 

corporate expenses are included as a component of the line item “selling general and administrative expenses” except for last in firstout lifo related charges that are included as a component of cost of sales and other services on our consolidated statements of income loss 

2017  vs 2016   

corporate and other expenses of 1024 million   increased  by 178 million  from 846 million  in 2016  the increase was driven by approximately 6 million of corporate incentives due to higher business results and sharebased compensation additionally the prior period included approximately 7 million of lifo income that did not recur in 2017 the remaining increase was due to other corporate items including corporate facility costs foreign exchange losses and other shared corporate costs 

2016  vs 2015   

corporate and other expenses of 846 million  increased by 216 million  from 630 million  in the same period in 2015  approximately 10 million of the increase is driven by the higher incentive compensation due to improved business performance as well as costs associated with the relocation of our corporate headquarters which totaled approximately 2 million the remaining 9 million increase was primarily the result of other project initiatives 

interest expense net 

2017  vs 2016   

interest expense net of 791 million   increased  by approximately 26 percent  compared to 629 million  in 2016  the increase  was driven by the impacts of higher foreign debt balances of approximately 6 million the addition of the 2017 term loan facility of 6 million and increases in interest rates of approximately 4 million 

2016  vs 2015 

interest expense net of 629 million  increased by 3 percent  as compared to 609 million  in 2015  the slight increase was due to higher foreign debt balances partially offset by lower term balance and other minor factors 

corporate special charges income 

restructuring and other charges income 

our restructuring and other charges income are comprised of restructuring assets disposals and other charges income as described below 



 

1 see note 7 within the consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k for more information 

2017   

restructuring and asset disposal charges in 2017  were primarily associated with charges in our fmc lithium segment of 78 million related to miscellaneous restructuring there were also impairment charges of intangible assets within fmc agricultural solutions of 22 million in corporate there were asset writedowns of approximately 55 million amounts also include miscellaneous restructuring charges of 08 million 

other charges income net in 2017  consisted of a 421 million  impairment on certain indefinitelived intangible assets from the acquired dupont crop protection business acquisition as a result of a triggering event due to the act other charges income also includes 166 million  for continuing environmental sites treated as corporate charges additionally we incurred exit costs of 48 million resulting from the termination and deconsolidation of our interest in a variable interest entity that was previously consolidated and was part of our fmc agricultural solutions segment we had other miscellaneous charges net of approximately 16 million 

2016   

restructuring and asset disposal charges in 2016  totaled 434 million  included in this were final charges totaling 423 million  associated with the integration of cheminova into our existing fmc agricultural solutions segment this amount included final adjustments to severances long lived asset write offs contract termination costs and other miscellaneous items there were miscellaneous restructuring charges of 11 million 

other charges income net in 2016  consisted of 368 million  for continuing environmental sites treated as corporate charges 132 million  associated with a license agreement to obtain certain technology and intellectual property rights for new compounds still under development and 42 million  as a result of the argentina governments action to devalue its currency these charges were offset by other miscellaneous income of 26 million 

2015   

restructuring and asset disposal charges in 2015 totaled 1240 million  included in this were significant charges totaling 1183 million associated with charges as part of the integration of cheminova into our existing fmc agricultural solutions segment the cheminova charges included those associated with the sale of consagro which amounted to 645 million there were other miscellaneous restructuring charges in both fmc agricultural solutions and corporate of 57 million 

other charges income net in 2015 consisted of environmental charges of 217 million the impacts of the argentina currency devaluation in december of 2015 of 107 million and 205 million of expenses associated with acquired inprocess research and development activity partially offsetting these amounts was a gain of 266 million related to the sale of our remaining ownership interest in a belgianbased pesticide distribution company belchim crop protection nv belchim 

nonoperating pension and postretirement charges income 

nonoperating pension and postretirement charges income are included in “selling general and administrative expenses” on our consolidated statements of income loss 

2017  vs 2016 

the charge for 2017  was 182 million  compared to 234 million  in 2016  the decrease was the result of 228 million  lower amortization of net actuarial losses as a result of a change in estimate in fiscal 2017 to amortize the gains and losses over the expected life time of the inactive population rather than the average remaining service period of the active participants which was partially offset by an increase of 154 million  for recognized losses due to plan settlements see note 13 for more information 

2016  vs 2015 

the charge for 2016 was 234 million  compared to 298 million  in 2015 the decrease in charges was in part due to the estimation method used in 2016 to calculate the interest cost components of our net periodic benefit cost as described in the critical accounting policies section of item 7 within this form 10k the decrease was also the result of 151 million  lower amortization of net actuarial losses these decreases were partially offset by an increase of 177 million  for recognized losses due to plan settlements see note 13 for more information 

acquisitionrelated charges 

a detailed description of the acquisition related charges is included in note 19 to the consolidated financial statements included within this form 10k and in the segment results reconciliation above within the  results of operations  section of the managements discussion and analysis 

provision for income taxes 

a significant amount of our earnings is generated by our foreign subsidiaries eg denmark singapore and hong kong which tax earnings at lower rates than the united states federal statutory rate our future effective tax rates may be materially impacted by numerous items including a future change in the composition of earnings from foreign and domestic tax jurisdictions as earnings in foreign jurisdictions are typically taxed at more favorable rates than the united states federal statutory rate accounting for uncertain tax positions business combinations expiration of statute of limitations or settlement of tax audits changes in valuation allowance changes in tax law and the potential decision to repatriate certain future foreign earnings on which united states or foreign withholding taxes have not been previously accrued as a result of the act we currently estimate our effect tax rate for 2018 will increase by low single digits as a result of a minimum tax on overseas income combined with a restriction on the use of foreign tax credits to offset this additional tax in foreign jurisdictions with a tax rate outside the us of less than around 13 percent we will have an additional us tax bill under the gilti provisions of the act 

provision for income taxes for 2017 was expense of 2641 million  resulting in an effective tax rate of 1461 percent  primarily attributable to the 3159 million  of provisional tax expense associated with the act provision for income taxes for 2016 was 

expense of 501 million  resulting in an effective tax rate of 277 percent  and provision for income taxes for 2015 was 52 million  resulting in an effective tax rate of negative 25 percent  during 2015 our fmc agricultural solutions business in brazil experienced significant current and cumulative losses driven by unfavorable market conditions as of december 31 2016 sufficient positive evidence to realize the net deferred tax assets in brazil was not available and a full valuation allowance against those assets remains established note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k includes more details on the drivers of the gaap effective rate and yearoveryear changes we believe showing the reconciliation below of our gaap to nongaap effective tax rate provides investors with useful supplemental information about our tax rate on the core underlying business 



    

 

the primary drivers for the decrease in the yeartodate effective tax rate for 2017 compared to 2016 are shown in the table above the remaining change was due to reduced domestic earnings in our fmc agricultural solutions business and the impact of the full integration of cheminova into our global supply chain 

discontinued operations net of income taxes 

our discontinued operations in periods up to its sale represent our discontinued fmc health and nutrition and fmc alkali chemicals business results as well as adjustments to retained liabilities from other previously discontinued operations the primary liabilities retained include environmental liabilities other postretirement benefit liabilities selfinsurance longterm obligations related to legal proceedings and historical restructuring activities see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for additional details on our discontinued operations 

2017  vs 2016   

discontinued operations net of income taxes represented income  of 6217 million  in 2017  compared to income  of 810 million  in 2016  the increase was primarily driven by the divestiture of fmc health and nutrition to dupont which resulted in an aftertax gain of approximately 727 million  amount also includes the impairment charge of approximately 148 million  net of tax to write down our omega3 business to its sales price 

2016  vs 2015   

discontinued operations net of income taxes represented income  of 810 million  in 2016  compared to income  of 7111 million  in 2015  the change was driven by the divestiture of our discontinued fmc alkali chemicals division which resulted in an aftertax gain of 7021 million in 2015 

net income attributable to fmc stockholders 

2017  vs 2016   

net income attributable to fmc stockholders increased  to 5358 million  from 2091 million  the increase  was primarily due to the gain on sale recorded in discontinued operations net of income taxes as discussed above offset by the impacts of us tax reform and increases in acquisitionrelated charges refer to note 11 to these consolidated financial statements 

2016  vs 2015   

net income attributable to fmc stockholders decreased  to 2091 million  from 4890 million  the decrease  was primarily due to the gain from the sale of our discontinued fmc alkali chemicals division in 2015 which was partially offset by lower acquisitionrelated costs in 2016 

liquidity and capital resources 

cash and cash equivalents at december 31 2017  and 2016  were 2830 million  and 642 million  respectively of the cash and cash equivalents balance at december 31 2017  972 million  was held by our foreign subsidiaries as a result of the act we recognized a onetime transition tax on the deemed repatriation of foreign earnings and the remeasurement of the company’s us net deferred tax asset see note 11 to these consolidated financial statements for more information the cash held by foreign subsidiaries for permanent reinvestment is generally used to finance the subsidiaries’ operating activities and future foreign investments we have not provided additional income taxes for any additional outside basis differences inherent in our investments in subsidiaries because the investments are essentially permanent in duration or we have concluded that no additional tax liability will arise upon disposal determining the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability related to any remaining undistributed foreign earnings not subject to the transition tax and additional outside basis difference in these entities ie basis difference in excess of that subject to the onetime transition tax is not practicable or in process and not yet complete we are still in the process of analyzing the impact of the act on our indefinite reinvestment assertion 

at december 31 2017  we had total debt of 31856 million  as compared to 18930 million  at december 31 2016  total debt included 29930 million  and 17988 million  of longterm debt excluding current portions of 1012 million  and 24 million  at december 31 2017  and 2016  respectively as of december 31 2017  we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants see note 12 in the consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k for further details following the dupont crop protection business acquisition the maximum leverage ratio temporarily stepped up to 475 from 35 and will step down to 45  in accordance with the provisions of the credit facility and the 2014 and 2017 term loan facilities in the third quarter of 2018 we will take a variety of steps if necessary to ensure compliance with the maximum leverage ratio at the applicable measurement dates 

on november 1 2017 we borrowed 15 billion under our previously announced senior unsecured term loan facility to finance the dupont crop protection business acquisition 12 billion was used to fund a cash payment to dupont the remaining 300 million will be used to pay various obligations related to the transaction including taxes payable on the gain from the sale of fmc health and nutrition see note 12 in the consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k for further details 

the increase  in longterm debt was due to the drawing down of funds under the 2017 term loan facility and increased foreign debt balances which were partially offset by prepayments of the 2014 term loan facility at december 31 2017  4500 million  and 15000 million  remained outstanding under the 2014 and 2017 term loan facilities respectively the scheduled maturities of the 2014 and 2017 term loan facilities are on april 21 2020 and november 1 2022 respectively the borrowings under the 2014 and 2017 term loan facilities will bear interest at a floating rate which will be a base rate or a eurocurrency rate equal to the london interbank offered rate for the relevant interest period plus in each case an applicable margin as determined in accordance with the provisions of the 2014 and 2017 term loan facilities 

our shortterm debt which consists of foreign borrowings and our commercial paper program foreign borrowings increased  from 855 million  at december 31 2016  to 914 million  at december 31 2017  while outstanding commercial paper decreased   63 million  

our commercial paper program allows us to borrow at rates generally more favorable than those available under our credit facility at december 31 2017  we had no borrowings under the commercial paper program

the change in cash required by financing activities in 2016 primarily related to repayments of borrowings under our term loan and redemption of certain outstanding industrial revenue bonds 

2018  outlook 

in 2018  we expect a continued improvement in cash generation in aggregate we expect cash basis operating income to increase driven by significantly higher earnings within each segment including a full year of results from the dupont crop protection business acquisition partially offset by higher working capital requirements in 2018  

other potential liquidity needs 

our cash needs for 2018  include operating cash requirements capital expenditures scheduled mandatory payments of longterm debt dividend payments share repurchases contributions to our pension plans environmental and asset retirement obligation spending and costs associated with acquisitionrelated charges as well as costs to integrate the dupont crop protection business into fmc agricultural solutions we plan to meet our liquidity needs through available cash cash generated from operations commercial paper issuances and borrowings under our committed revolving credit facility at december 31 2017  our remaining borrowing capacity under our credit facility was 13540 million  

projected 2018  capital expenditures and expenditures related to contract manufacturers are expected to increase to approximately 250 million primarily driven by the lithium expansion as well as expenditures from the recently acquired dupont crop protection business additionally we will incur corporate level spending associated with the two year implementation of a new sap system 

projected 2018  spending includes approximately 60 to 65 million of net environmental remediation spending this spending does not include expected spending on capital projects relating to environmental control facilities or expected spending for environmental compliance costs which we will include as a component of costs of sales and services in our consolidated statements of income loss since these amounts are not covered by established reserves capital spending to expand maintain or replace equipment at our production facilities may trigger requirements for upgrading our environmental controls which may increase our spending for environmental controls over the foregoing projections 

as a result of the act we will have to pay a transition tax of 2027 million  which is payable over the next eight years 

our us pension plan assets decreased slightly from  12033 million  at december 31 2016  to  13349 million  at december 31 2017  our us pension plan assets comprise approximately all of our total plan assets with the difference representing plan assets related to foreign pension plans see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements included within this form 10k for details on how we develop our longterm rate of return assumptions we made contributions of  440 million  and  350 million  in 2017  and 2016  respectively and intend to contribute 30 million  in 2018  our contributions in 2016  2017  and our intended contribution in 2018  are all in excess of the minimum requirements our contributions in excess of minimums are done with the objective of avoiding variable rate pension benefit guaranty corporation pbgc premiums as well as potentially reducing future funding volatility in 2017 we changed our us qualified pension plan’s investment strategy to a liability hedging approach with an objective of minimizing funded status volatility as a result we expect lower contributions in future periods while we do not believe that the contribution in 2018 will have a material impact on our current and future liquidity needs the volatility of interest rates and equity returns may require greater contributions in the future 

during the year ended december 31 2017  no shares were repurchased under the publicly announced repurchase program at december 31 2017  2388 million  remained unused under our boardauthorized repurchase program this repurchase program does not include a specific timetable or price targets and may be suspended or terminated at any time shares may be purchased through open market or privately negotiated transactions at the discretion of management based on its evaluation of market conditions and other factors we also reacquire shares from time to time from employees in connections with vesting exercise and forfeiture of awards under our equity compensation plans 

dividends 

on january 18 2018  we paid dividends aggregating 223 million  to our shareholders of record as of december 31 2017  this amount is included in “accrued and other liabilities” on the consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2017  for the years ended december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  we paid 888 million  886 million  and 864 million  in dividends respectively 

commitments 

we provide guarantees to financial institutions on behalf of certain fmc agricultural solutions customers principally brazilian customers for their seasonal borrowing the total of these guarantees was 584 million  at december 31 2017  these guarantees arise during the ordinary course of business from relationships with customers and nonconsolidated affiliates nonperformance by the guaranteed party triggers the obligation requiring us to make payments to the beneficiary of the guarantee based on our experience these types of guarantees have not had a material effect on our consolidated financial position or on our liquidity our expectation is that future payment or performance related to the nonperformance of others is considered unlikely 

shortterm debt consisted of foreign credit lines at december 31 2017  and foreign credit lines and commercial paper december 31 2016  we provide parentcompany guarantees to lending institutions providing credit to our foreign subsidiaries 

in connection with our property and asset sales and divestitures we have agreed to indemnify the buyer for certain liabilities including environmental contamination and taxes that occurred prior to the date of sale our indemnification obligations with respect to these liabilities may be indefinite as to duration and may or may not be subject to a deductible minimum claim amount or cap in cases where it is not possible for us to predict the likelihood that a claim will be made or to make a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential loss or range of loss no specific liability has been recorded if triggered we may be able to recover certain of the indemnity payments from third parties in cases where it is possible we have recorded a specific liability within our reserve for discontinued operations refer to note 9 for further details 

our total significant committed contracts that we believe will affect cash over the next four years and beyond are as follows 



  

 contingencies 

see note 18 to our consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k 

climate change 

as a global corporate citizen we are concerned about the consequences of climate change and will take prudent and cost effective actions that reduce green house gas ghg emissions to the atmosphere 

fmc is committed to doing its part to address climate change and its impacts we have set 2025 goals that we will reduce both energy intensity and ghg intensity for our operations by 15 percent from our 2013 baseline year to date our fmc agricultural solutions and fmc lithium segments have reduced energy use by 13 percent and 16 percent and ghg intensity by 4 percent and 19 percent respectively fmc has been reporting its ghg emissions and mitigation strategy to cdp formerly carbon disclosure project since 2016 fmc detailed the business risks and opportunities we have due to climate change and its impacts in our cdp climate change reports 

even as we take action to control the release of ghgs additional warming is anticipated longterm higher average global temperatures could result in induced changes in natural resources growing seasons precipitation patterns weather patterns species distributions water availability sea levels and biodiversity these impacts could cause changes in supplies of raw materials used to maintain fmc’s production capacity and could lead to possible increased sourcing costs depending on how pervasive the climate impacts are in the different geographic locations experiencing changes in natural resources fmc’s customers could be impacted demand for fmc’s products could increase if our products meet our customers’ needs to adapt to climate change impacts or decrease if our products do not meet their needs within our own operations we continually assess our manufacturing sites worldwide for risks and opportunities to increase our preparedness for climate change we are continuing to evaluate sea level rise and storm surge at our plants located within 4 meters of sea level to understand timing of potential impacts and response actions that may need to be taken to lessen fmc’s overall environmental footprint we have taken actions to increase the energy efficiency in our manufacturing sites we have also committed to 2025 goals to reduce our water use in highrisk areas by 20 

percent and our waste intensities by 15 percent to date fmc agricultural solutions and fmc lithium have reduced our water use in high risk areas by 21 percent and 13 percent and our waste disposal intensity by 20 percent and 20 percent respectively 

in our product portfolio we see market opportunities for our products to address climate change and its impacts for example fmc agricultural solutions’ products can help customers increase yield energy and water efficiency and decrease greenhouse gas emissions our products can also help growers adapt to more unpredictable growing conditions and the effects these types of threats have on crops fmc lithium’s products can be used in energy storage applications fuelefficient and electric vehicles lighterweight aluminum in the aircraft and aerospace industries 

we are improving existing products and developing new platforms and technologies that help mitigate impacts of climate change agricultural solutions is developing products with a lighter environmental footprint in its biologicals products fmc lithium is researching new applications of our lithium products in a range of industries these business opportunities could lead to new products and services for our existing and potential customers beyond our products and operations fmc recognizes that energy consumption throughout our supply chain can impact climate change and product costs therefore we will actively work with our entire value chain  suppliers contractors and customers  to improve their energy efficiencies and to reduce their ghg emissions 

we continue to follow legislative and regulatory developments regarding climate change because the regulation of greenhouse gases depending on their nature and scope could subject some of our manufacturing operations to additional costs or limits on operations in december 2015 195 countries at the united nations climate change conference in paris reached an agreement to reduce ghgs it remains to be seen how and when each of these countries will implement this agreement the united states is a signatory to the paris agreement but on june 1 2017 president trump announced that the united states would withdraw from the paris agreement and on august 4 2017 the united states delivered notice of its intention to withdraw to united nations on october 16 2017 the united states environmental protection agency epa filed notice of a rulemaking to repeal the lean power plan epa followed this action with the issuance of an advance notice of proposed rulemaking seeking comment on the proper roles of the state and federal government in regulating emissions from electric power plants and also seeking information on technologies and strategies for reducing emissions from existing plants 

notwithstanding the united states’ withdrawal from the paris agreement will actively manage climate risks and incorporate them in our decision making as indicated in our responses to the cdp climate change module fmc remains deeply committed to reducing our ghg emissions and energy consumption at all of our facilities around the world 

some of our foreign operations are subject to national or local energy management or climate change regulation such as our plant in denmark that is subject to the eu emissions trading scheme at present that plant’s emissions are below its designated cap 

during 2018 we will be assessing the ghg impact of our facilities acquired from dupont and will adjust our disclosures and targets accordingly 

future ghg regulatory requirements may result in increased costs of energy additional capital costs for emissions control or new equipment andor costs associated with cap and trade or carbon taxes we are currently monitoring regulatory developments the costs of complying with possible future climate change requirements are difficult to estimate at this time

critical accounting policies 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles us gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses we have described our accounting policies in note 1 principal accounting policies and related financial information to our consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k we have reviewed these accounting policies identifying those that we believe to be critical to the preparation and understanding of our consolidated financial statements we have reviewed these critical accounting policies with the audit committee of the board of directors critical accounting policies are central to our presentation of results of operations and financial condition in accordance with us gaap and require management to make estimates and judgments on certain matters we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience current conditions and other reasonable factors 

revenue recognition and trade receivables 

we recognize revenue when the earnings process is complete which is generally upon transfer of title this transfer typically occurs either upon shipment to the customer or upon receipt by the customer in all cases we apply the following criteria in recognizing revenue persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred the selling price is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured rebates due to customers are accrued as a reduction of revenue in the same period that the related sales are recorded based on the contract terms 

we periodically enter into prepayment arrangements with customers primarily in our fmc agricultural solutions segment and receive advance payments for product to be delivered in future periods these advance payments are recorded as deferred revenue and classified as “advance payments from customers” on the consolidated balance sheet revenue associated with advance payments is recognized as shipments are made and title ownership and risk of loss pass to the customer 

we record amounts billed for shipping and handling fees as revenue costs incurred for shipping and handling are recorded as costs of sales and services amounts billed for sales and use taxes valueadded taxes and certain excise and other specific transactional taxes imposed on revenueproducing transactions are presented on a net basis and excluded from sales in the consolidated income statements we record a liability until remitted to the respective taxing authority 

trade receivables consist of amounts owed from customer sales and are recorded when revenue is recognized the allowance for trade receivables represents our best estimate of the probable losses associated with potential customer defaults in developing our allowance for trade receivables we use a two stage process which includes calculating a general formula to develop an allowance to appropriately address the uncertainty surrounding collection risk of our entire portfolio and specific allowances for customers where the risk of collection has been reasonably identified either due to liquidity constraints or disputes over contractual terms and conditions 

our method of calculating the general formula consists of estimating the recoverability of trade receivables based on historical experience current collection trends and external business factors such as economic factors including regional bankruptcy rates and political factors our analysis of trade receivable collection risk is performed quarterly and the allowance is adjusted accordingly 

we also hold longterm receivables that represent longterm customer receivable balances related to pastdue accounts which are not expected to be collected within the current year our policy for the review of the allowance for these receivables is consistent with the discussion in the preceding paragraph above on trade receivables therefore on an ongoing basis we continue to evaluate the credit quality of our longterm receivables utilizing aging of receivables collection experience and writeoffs as well as existing economic conditions to determine if an additional allowance is necessary 

on january 1 2018 accounting standards update 201409 revenue from contracts with customers became effective see note 2 to these consolidated financial statements for more information 

environmental obligations and related recoveries 

we provide for environmentalrelated obligations when they are probable and amounts can be reasonably estimated where the available information is sufficient to estimate the amount of liability that estimate has been used where the information is only sufficient to establish a range of probable liability and no point within the range is more likely than any other the lower end of the range has been used 

estimated obligations to remediate sites that involve oversight by the united states environmental protection agency “epa” or similar government agencies are generally accrued no later than when a record of decision “rod” or equivalent is issued or upon completion of a remedial investigationfeasibility study “rifs” or equivalent that is submitted by us to the appropriate 

government agency or agencies estimates are reviewed quarterly by our environmental remediation management as well as by financial and legal management and if necessary adjusted as additional information becomes available the estimates can change substantially as additional information becomes available regarding the nature or extent of site contamination required remediation methods and other actions by or against governmental agencies or private parties 

our environmental liabilities for continuing and discontinued operations are principally for costs associated with the remediation andor study of sites at which we are alleged to have released hazardous substances into the environment such costs principally include among other items rifs site remediation costs of operation and maintenance of the remediation plan management costs fees to outside law firms and consultants for work related to the environmental effort and future monitoring costs estimated site liabilities are determined based upon existing remediation laws and technologies specific site consultants’ engineering studies or by extrapolating experience with environmental issues at comparable sites 

included in our environmental liabilities are costs for the operation maintenance and monitoring of site remediation plans omm such reserves are based on our best estimates for these omm plans over time we may incur omm costs in excess of these reserves however we are unable to reasonably estimate an amount in excess of our recorded reserves because we cannot reasonably estimate the period for which such omm plans will need to be in place or the future annual cost of such remediation as conditions at these environmental sites change over time such additional omm costs could be significant in total but would be incurred over an extended period of years 

included in the environmental reserve balance other assets balance and disclosure of reasonably possible loss contingencies are amounts from third party insurance policies which we believe are probable of recovery 

provisions for environmental costs are reflected in income net of probable and estimable recoveries from named potentially responsible parties “prps” or other third parties such provisions incorporate inflation and are not discounted to their present values 

in calculating and evaluating the adequacy of our environmental reserves we have taken into account the joint and several liability imposed by comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act “cercla” and the analogous state laws on all prps and have considered the identity and financial condition of the other prps at each site to the extent possible we have also considered the identity and financial condition of other third parties from whom recovery is anticipated as well as the status of our claims against such parties although we are unable to forecast the ultimate contributions of prps and other third parties with absolute certainty the degree of uncertainty with respect to each party is taken into account when determining the environmental reserve by adjusting the reserve to reflect the facts and circumstances on a sitebysite basis our liability includes our best estimate of the costs expected to be paid before the consideration of any potential recoveries from third parties we believe that any recorded recoveries related to prps are realizable in all material respects recoveries are recorded as either an offset in “environmental liabilities continuing and discontinued” or as “other assets” in our consolidated balance sheets in accordance with us accounting literature 

see note 10 to our consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k for changes in estimates associated with our environmental obligations 

impairments and valuation of longlived and indefinitelived assets 

our longlived assets primarily include property plant and equipment goodwill and intangible assets the assets and liabilities of acquired businesses are measured at their estimated fair values at the dates of acquisition the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired including identified intangibles is recorded as goodwill the determination and allocation of fair value to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is based on various assumptions and valuation methodologies requiring considerable management judgment including estimates based on historical information current market data and future expectations the principal assumptions utilized in our valuation methodologies include revenue growth rates operating margin estimates and discount rates although the estimates were deemed reasonable by management based on information available at the dates of acquisition those estimates are inherently uncertain 

we test for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the net book value of our property plant and equipment may not be recoverable from the estimated undiscounted expected future cash flows expected to result from their use and eventual disposition in cases where the estimated undiscounted expected future cash flows are less than net book value an impairment loss is recognized equal to the amount by which the net book value exceeds the estimated fair value of assets which is based on discounted cash flows at the lowest level determinable the estimated cash flows reflect our assumptions about selling prices volumes costs and market conditions over a reasonable period of time 

we perform an annual impairment test of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets in the third quarter of each year or more frequently whenever an event or change in circumstances occurs that would require reassessment of the recoverability of those 

assets in performing our evaluation we assess qualitative factors such as overall financial performance of our reporting units anticipated changes in industry and market structure competitive environments planned capacity and cost factors such as raw material prices based on our assessment for 2017  we determined that no goodwill impairment charge to our continuing operations was required the majority of the brands intangible asset relates to our proprietary brand portfolio for which the fair value was substantially in excess of the carrying value during the third quarter of 2017 we recorded a 1 million  impairment charge in our generic brand portfolio which is part of the fmc agricultural solutions segment the carrying value of the generic portfolio subsequent to the charge is approximately 4 million  separately as a result of the act we performed an impairment assessment on the recently acquired brand portfolio and recorded an impairment charge of approximately 42 million solely due to the new tax legislation see note 11 for more details 

see note 7 to our consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k for charges associated with longlived asset disposal costs and the activity associated with the restructuring reserves 

pension and other postretirement benefits 

we provide qualified and nonqualified defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans as well as postretirement health care and life insurance benefit plans to our employees and retirees the costs benefits and obligations related to these benefits reflect key assumptions related to general economic conditions including interest discount rates healthcare cost trend rates expected rates of return on plan assets and the rates of compensation increase for employees the costs benefits and obligations for these benefit programs are also affected by other assumptions such as average retirement age mortality employee turnover and plan participation to the extent our plans’ actual experience as influenced by changing economic and financial market conditions or by changes to our own plans’ demographics differs from these assumptions the costs and obligations for providing these benefits as well as the plans’ funding requirements could increase or decrease when actual results differ from our assumptions the difference is typically recognized over future periods in addition the unrealized gains and losses related to our pension and postretirement benefit obligations may also affect periodic benefit costs benefits in future periods 

historically we have amortized unrecognized gains and losses using the corridor method over the average remaining service period of active participants of approximately eight years as of january 1 2017 approximately 95  of the participants in our us qualified plan and approximately 93  of the participants in our us postretirement life plan were inactive therefore for fiscal 2017 we amortized gains and losses over the average remaining life expectancy of the inactive population for these two plans the gainloss amortization period for the us qualified pension plan increased from about eight years to about nineteen years as a result of this change we consider this a change in estimate and accordingly have accounted for it prospectively beginning in 2017 for fiscal 2017 the change in estimate from amortizing gains and losses over the expected lifetime of the inactive population rather than the average remaining service period of active participants reduced us pension and postretirement net periodic benefit cost by approximately 20 million  when compared to the prior estimate 

we use several assumptions and statistical methods to determine the asset values used to calculate both the expected rate of return on assets component of pension cost and to calculate our plans’ funding requirements the expected rate of return on plan assets is based on a marketrelated value of assets that recognizes investment gains and losses over a fiveyear period we use an actuarial value of assets to determine our plans’ funding requirements the actuarial value of assets must be within a certain range high or low of the actual market value of assets and is adjusted accordingly 

we select the discount rate used to calculate pension and other postretirement obligations based on a review of available yields on highquality corporate bonds as of the measurement date in selecting a discount rate as of december 31 2017  we placed particular emphasis on a discount rate yieldcurve provided by our actuary this yieldcurve when populated with projected cash flows that represent the expected timing and amount of our plans benefit payments produced an effective discount rate of 368 percent  for our us qualified plan 329 percent  for our us nonqualified and 341 percent  for our us other postretirement benefit plans 

the discount rates used at our december 31 2017  and 2016  measurement dates for the us qualified plan were 368 percent  and 422 percent  respectively the effect of the change in the discount rate from 422 percent  to 368 percent  at december 31 2017  resulted in a 775 million   increase  to our us qualified pension benefit obligations the effect of the change in the discount rate from 450 percent  at december 31 2015  to 422 percent  at december 31 2016  resulted in a 03 million   increase  to the 2017  us qualified pension expense 

the change in discount rate from 422 percent  at december 31 2016  to 368 percent  at december 31 2017  was attributable to a decrease in yields on high quality corporate bonds with cash flows matching the timing and amount of our expected future benefit payments between the 2016  and 2017  measurement dates using the december 31 2017  and 2016  yield curves our us qualified plan cash flows produced a single weightedaverage discount rate of approximately 368 percent  and 422 percent  respectively 

in developing the assumption for the longterm rate of return on assets for our us plan we take into consideration the technical analysis performed by our outside actuaries including historical market returns information on the assumption for longterm real returns by asset class inflation assumptions and expectations for standard deviation related to these best estimates we also consider the historical performance of our own plan’s trust which has earned a compound annual rate of return of approximately 79 percent  over the last 20 years which is in excess of comparable market indices for the same period as well as other factors which are discussed in note 13 to our consolidated financial statements in this form 10k our longterm rate of return for the fiscal year ended december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  was 650 percent  700 percent  and 725 percent  respectively 

on december 31 2015 we changed the method we used to estimate the service cost and interest cost components of our net periodic benefit cost for our us defined benefit pension plans we use a full yield curve approach in the estimate of these components of benefit cost by applying specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows as we believe this provides a better estimate of service and interest costs 

for the sensitivity of our pension costs to incremental changes in assumptions see our discussion below 

sensitivity analysis related to key pension and postretirement benefit assumptions 

a onehalf percent increase in the assumed discount rate would have decreased pension and other postretirement benefit obligations by 736 million  and 703 million  at december 31 2017  and 2016  respectively and decreased pension and other postretirement benefit costs by 04 million  52 million  and 64 million  for 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively a onehalf percent decrease in the assumed discount rate would have increased pension and other postretirement benefit obligations by 813 million  and 785 million  at december 31 2017  and 2016  respectively and increased pension and other postretirement benefit cost by 04 million  57 million  and 65 million  for 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively 

a onehalf percent increase in the assumed expected longterm rate of return on plan assets would have decreased pension costs by 60 million  60 million  and 58 million  for 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively a onehalf percent decrease in the assumed longterm rate of return on plan assets would have increased pension costs by 60 million  60 million  and 58 million  for 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively 

further details on our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and net periodic benefit costs benefits are found in note 13 to our consolidated financial statements in this form 10k 

income taxes 

we have recorded a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets in certain jurisdictions to the amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized in assessing the need for this allowance we have considered a number of factors including future taxable income the jurisdictions in which such income is earned and our ongoing tax planning strategies in the event that we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period such determination was made similarly should we conclude that we would be able to realize certain deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase income in the period such determination was made 

additionally we file income tax returns in the us federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions certain income tax returns for fmc entities taxable in the us and significant foreign jurisdictions are open for examination and adjustment we assess our income tax positions and record a liability for all years open to examination based upon our evaluation of the facts circumstances and information available at the reporting date for those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained we have recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information we adjust these liabilities if necessary upon the completion of tax audits or changes in tax law 

on december 22 2017 the act was enacted in the united states the act reduces the us federal corporate tax rate from 35 to 21 requires companies to pay a onetime transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred and creates new taxes on certain foreign sourced earnings 

as of december 31 2017 we had not completed our accounting for the tax effects of enactment of the act however as described further in note 11 we have made a reasonable estimate of the effects on our existing deferred tax balances and the onetime transition tax 

see note 11 to our consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k for additional discussion surrounding income taxes

 item 7a 

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend our earnings cash flows and financial position are exposed to market risks relating to fluctuations in commodity prices interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates our policy is to minimize exposure to our cash flow over time caused by changes in commodity interest and currency exchange rates to accomplish this we have implemented a controlled program of risk management consisting of appropriate derivative contracts entered into with major financial institutions 

the analysis below presents the sensitivity of the market value of our financial instruments to selected changes in market rates and prices the range of changes chosen reflects our view of changes that are reasonably possible over a oneyear period market value estimates are based on the present value of projected future cash flows considering the market rates and prices chosen 

at december 31 2017  our net financial instrument position was a net asset  of 44 million  compared to a net liability  of 25 million  at december 31 2016  the change in the net financial instrument position was primarily due to exchange rate fluctuations in our foreign exchange portfolio 

since our risk management programs are generally highly effective the potential loss in value for each risk management portfolio described below would be largely offset by changes in the value of the underlying exposure 

commodity price risk 

energy costs are diversified among coal electricity and natural gas we attempt to mitigate our exposure to increasing energy costs by hedging the cost of future deliveries of natural gas and by entering into fixedprice contracts for the purchase of coal and fuel oil to analyze the effect of changing energy prices we have performed a sensitivity analysis in which we assume an instantaneous 10 percent change in energy market prices from their levels at december 31 2017  and 2016  with all other variables including interest rates held constant 



foreign currency exchange rate risk 

the primary currencies for which we have exchange rate exposure are the us dollar versus the euro the chinese yuan the brazilian real and the argentine peso foreign currency debt and foreign exchange forward contracts are used in countries where we do business thereby reducing our net asset exposure foreign exchange forward contracts are also used to hedge firm and highly anticipated foreign currency cash flows 

to analyze the effects of changing foreign currency rates we have performed a sensitivity analysis in which we assume an instantaneous 10 percent change in the foreign currency exchange rates from their levels at december 31 2017  and 2016  with all other variables including interest rates held constant 



interest rate risk 

one of the strategies that we can use to manage interest rate exposure is to enter into interest rate swap agreements in these agreements we agree to exchange at specified intervals the difference between fixed and variable interest amounts calculated on an agreedupon notional principal amount as of december 31 2017  and 2016  we had no interest rate swap agreements 

our debt portfolio at december 31 2017  is composed of 38 percent  fixedrate debt and 62 percent  variablerate debt the variablerate component of our debt portfolio principally consists of borrowings under our 2014 and 2017 term loan facilities commercial paper program credit facility variablerate industrial and pollution control revenue bonds and amounts outstanding under foreign subsidiary credit lines changes in interest rates affect different portions of our variablerate debt portfolio in different ways 

based on the variablerate debt in our debt portfolio at december 31 2017  a one percentage point increase in interest rates would have increased gross interest expense by 197 million  and a one percentage point decrease in interest rates would have decreased gross interest expense by 197 million  for the year ended december 31 2017

cheminova as 

on april 21 2015 pursuant to the terms and conditions set forth in the purchase agreement we completed the acquisition of 100 percent of the outstanding equity of cheminova as a denmark aktieselskab cheminova from auriga industries as a denmark aktieselskab for an aggregate purchase price of 12 billion  excluding assumed net debt and hedgedrelated costs of approximately 06 billion  the “acquisition” 

at december 31 2016  we had substantially completed the integration of cheminova into our fmc agricultural solutions segment 

fmc strategy 

fmc has streamlined its portfolio over the past six years to focus on technologydriven end markets with attractive longterm demand trends the actions we have taken over the past year have better positioned each of our businesses to capitalize on future growth opportunities 

2016 was a critical year for agricultural solutions as we took proactive steps during a challenging year in agriculture markets to better position the company for an eventual recovery of that market we facilitated channel destocking and continued our product rationalization removing approximately 175 million in sales of lowmargin products around the world this has allowed us to sell proprietary products at better prices and terms even in a challenging year for crop chemicals we continue to benefit from the greater regional balance and direct market access in key markets that came with our 2015 acquisition of cheminova fmc’s technology pipeline of nine new active ingredients is wellfunded and set to begin major product launches starting in 2018 we began the registration process in north america for the first one our bixafen fungicide we also launched about 60 new product formulations which is key to life cycle management of our products fmc has the scale to operate with greater resources and global reach to address changing market conditions 

in health and nutrition we have a portfolio of naturallyderived functional ingredients that serve health nutrition and nutraceutical end markets we provide innovative solutions to our customers by leveraging our application knowhow as well as differentiating the manufacture and delivery of our market leading products through best in class quality service reliability qsr we continue to optimize our organizational and manufacturing footprints to increase our competitive positioning as a technologyfocused company we continue to pursue process technology improvements and develop innovative application solutions to drive the highest value for customers 

in lithium fmc remains one of the leading global producers of specialty lithium products and in may 2016 we announced plans to triple our manufacturing capacity for lithium hydroxide by 2019 the first phase of this modular expansion is set to begin selling product in mid2017 to serve the rapidly expanding market for lithium batteries in electric vehicles we will continue to invest in lithium hydroxide and similar higher growth higher value segments of the market including butyllithium for use in chemical synthesis and high purity lithium metal for aerospace applications 

we maintain our commitment to enterprise sustainability including responsible stewardship as we grow we will do so in a responsible way safety and business ethics will remain of utmost importance meeting and exceeding our customers’ expectations will continue to be a primary focus 

financial information about our business segments 

 financial information in millions 

see note 19 segment information to our consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k also see below for selected financial information related to our segments 

the following table shows the principal products produced by our three business segments their raw materials and uses 

  



with a worldwide manufacturing and distribution infrastructure we are better able to respond rapidly to global customer needs offset downward economic trends in one region with positive trends in another and match local revenues to local costs to reduce the impact of currency volatility the charts below detail our sales and longlived assets by major geographic region 

fmc agricultural solutions 

    

overview 

our fmc agricultural solutions segment which represents approximately 69 percent  of our 2016  consolidated revenues operates in the agrochemicals industry this segment develops manufactures and sells a portfolio of crop protection professional pest control and lawn and garden products 

products and markets 

  

fmc agricultural solutions portfolio is comprised of three major pesticide categories insecticides herbicides and fungicides the majority of our product lines consist of insecticides and herbicides and we have a small but fastgrowing portfolio of fungicides mainly used in high value crop segments our insecticides are used to control a wide spectrum of pests while our herbicide portfolio primarily targets a large variety of difficulttocontrol weeds we are also investing substantially in a plant health program that includes biological crop protection products seed treatments and micronutrients 

in the latin american region which includes the large agricultural market of brazil we sell directly to large growers through our own sales and marketing organization and we access the market through independent distributors in north america we access the market through several major national and regional distributors and have our own sales and marketing organization in canada with the cheminova acquisition we now access a majority of the european markets through our own sales and marketing organizations we access key asian markets either through local independent distributors or our own sales and marketing organizations through these and other alliances along with our own targeted marketing efforts access to novel technologies and 

our innovation initiatives we expect to maintain and enhance our access in key agricultural and noncrop markets and develop new products that will help us continue to compete effectively 

industry overview 

the three principal categories of agricultural and noncrop chemicals are herbicides insecticides and fungicides representing approximately 42 percent 28 percent and 27 percent of global industry revenue respectively 

the agrochemicals industry is relatively consolidated but further consolidation is likely as several of the leading crop protection companies are actively pursuing merger opportunities leading crop protection companies fmc syngenta ag bayer ag monsanto company basf ag the dow chemical company e i du pont de nemours and company dupont and adama currently represent approximately 74 percent of the industry’s global sales the next tier of agrochemical producers include sumitomo chemical company ltd nufarm ltd platform specialty products corporation and united phosphorous ltd fmc employs various differentiated strategies and competes with unique technologies focusing on certain crops markets and geographies while also being supported by a lowcost manufacturing model 

growth 

the acquisition of cheminova positions fmc among leading agrochemical producers in the world our complementary technologies will lead to improved formulation capabilities and a broader innovation pipeline resulting in new and differentiated products we will take advantage of enhanced market access positions and an expanded portfolio to deliver nearterm growth 

we will continue to grow by obtaining new and approved uses for existing product lines and acquiring accessing developing marketing distributing andor selling complementary chemistries and related technologies in order to strengthen our product portfolio and our capabilities to effectively service our target markets and customers 

our growth efforts focus on developing environmentally compatible and sustainable solutions that can effectively increase farmers’ yields and provide costeffective alternatives to chemistries which may be prone to resistance we are committed to providing unique differentiated products to our customers by acquiring and further developing technologies as well as investing in innovation to extend product life cycles our external growth efforts include product acquisitions inlicensing of chemistries and technologies and alliances that bolster our market access complement our existing product portfolio or provide entry into adjacent spaces we have entered into a range of development and distribution agreements with other companies that provide access to new technologies and products which we can subsequently commercialize 

fmc health and nutrition 

  

overview 

our fmc health and nutrition segment which represents 23 percent  of our 2016  consolidated revenues is focused on highperformance food ingredients pharmaceutical excipients and omega3 oils the majority of fmc health and nutrition sales are to customers in noncyclical end markets we believe our future growth in this segment will continue to be based on the valueadded performance of these products and our research and development capabilities as well as on the alliances and close working relationships we have developed with key global customers 

products and markets   

    

our product offerings into nutrition markets principally provide texture structure and physical stability tsps solutions to thicken and stabilize certain food products our formulation ingredients serve the health excipient industry functioning as binders disintegrants suspending agents and controlrelease compounds for the production of both solid and liquid pharmaceutical products the majority of our functional ingredient product offerings are high purity omega3 products as well as certain alginate products which are considered to be active pharmaceutical ingredients 

fmc health and nutrition is a supplier of microcrystalline cellulose mcc carrageenan alginates natural colorants and omega3 all naturally derived ingredients that have high valueadded applications in the production of processed and convenience foods oral dose form pharmaceuticals and nutraceuticals mcc processed from specialty grades of renewable hardwood and softwood pulp provides binding and disintegrant properties for dry tablets and capsules and has unique functionality that improves the texture and stability of many nutrition products carrageenan and alginates both processed from natural seaweeds are used in a wide variety of food pharmaceutical and oral care applications natural colorants are utilized in specialty products used in the food beverage personal care nutrition and health excipient markets omega3 is sourced from fish oils and used in other pharmaceutical and nutraceutical applications 

industry overview 

nutritional ingredients 

the industry is dispersed geographically with sales predominantly in europe north america and asia the nutritional ingredients market is comprised of a large number of suppliers due to the broad spectrum of chemistries employed segment leadership global position and investment in technology are key factors to sustaining profitability the top suppliers of tsps ingredients include fmc dupont jm huber corporation kerry group plc and cargill incorporated 

health excipients and functional health ingredients 

competitors tend to be grouped by chemistry our principal mcc competitors include j rettenmaier  sôhne gmbh ming tai chemical co ltd asahi kasei corporation and blanver farmoquimica ltda while pricing pressure from lowcost producers is a common competitive dynamic companies look to offset that pressure by providing the most reliable and broadest range of products and services our customers are pharmaceutical firms who depend upon reliable therapeutic performance of their drug products in omega3 our competitors include dsm basf croda and other smaller producers competition has intensified in this market over the past several years as many smaller producers attempt to enter in what is considered by many as an attractive growth market differentiation among higher end producers such as fmc is achieved through knowhow to produce high concentration oils at high levels of purity 

fmc lithium 

    

overview 

our fmc lithium segment represents eight percent  of our 2016  consolidated revenues 

while lithium is sold into a variety of end markets we have focused our strategy on specialty products that require a high level of manufacturing and technical knowhow to meet customer requirements 

the electrochemical properties of lithium make it an ideal material for portable energy storage including smart phones tablets laptop computers military devices and other energy storage technologies lithium is a critical element in advanced batteries for use in hybrid electric plugin hybrids and allelectric vehicles 

organolithium products are highly valued in the polymer market as initiators in the production of synthetic rubbers and elastomers organolithiums are also sold to fine chemical and pharmaceutical customers who use lithiums unique chemical properties to synthesize high valueadded products 

industry overview 

    

fmc lithium serves a diverse group of markets our product offerings are primarily inorganic and generally have few costeffective substitutes a major growth driver for lithium in the future will be the rate of adoption of electric vehicles 

most markets for lithium chemicals are global with significant growth occurring both in asia and north america primarily driven by the development and manufacture of lithium ion batteries there are three key producers of lithium compounds fmc albemarle corporation previously rockwood holdings inc and sociedad química y minera de chile sa in addition to these producers orocobre is ramping up production from its brine source in argentina and several chinese producers convert lithium containing hard rock concentrates sourced from australia into lithium compounds we expect additional capacity to be added by new and existing producers within the next 24 months fmc and albemarle corporation are the primary producers of specialty lithium products 

source and availability of raw materials 

raw materials used by fmc agricultural solutions primarily processed chemicals are obtained from a variety of suppliers worldwide raw materials used by fmc health and nutrition include various types of seaweed specialty pulps natural colorant raw materials and fish oils that are all sourced on a global basis and purchased from selected global producerssuppliers we extract ores used in fmc lithium’s manufacturing processes from lithium brines in argentina 

patents 

we own a number of us and foreign patents trademarks and licenses that are cumulatively important to our business we do not believe that the loss of any individual or combination of related patents trademarks or licenses would have a material adverse effect on the overall business of fmc the duration of our patents depends on their respective jurisdictions 

seasonality 

the seasonal nature of the crop protection market and the geographic spread of the fmc agricultural solutions business can result in significant variations in quarterly earnings among geographic locations fmc agricultural solutions products sold in the northern hemisphere north america europe and parts of asia serve seasonal agricultural markets from march through september generally resulting in earnings in the first second and third quarters markets in the southern hemisphere latin america and parts of the asia pacific region including australia are served from july through february generally resulting in earnings in the third fourth and first quarters the remainder of our business is generally not subject to significant seasonal fluctuations 

competition 

we encounter substantial competition in each of our three business segments we market our products through our own sales organization and through alliance partners independent distributors and sales representatives the number of our principal competitors varies from segment to segment in general we compete by providing advanced technology high product quality reliability quality customer and technical service and by operating in a costefficient manner 

our fmc agricultural solutions segment competes primarily in the global chemical crop protection market for insecticides herbicides and fungicides industry products include crop protection chemicals and for certain major competitors genetically engineered crop biotechnology products competition from generic agrochemical producers is significant as a number of key product patents held industrywide have expired in the last decade in general we compete as an innovator by focusing on product development including novel formulations proprietary mixes and advanced delivery systems and by acquiring or licensing mostly proprietary chemistries or technologies that complement our product and geographic focus we also differentiate ourselves by our global costcompetitiveness through our manufacturing strategies establishing effective product stewardship programs and developing strategic alliances that strengthen market access in key countries and regions 

our fmc health and nutrition segment has significant positions in markets that include alginate carrageenan and microcrystalline cellulose we compete with both direct suppliers of cellulose and seaweed extract as well as suppliers of other hydrocolloids which may provide similar functionality in specific applications in microcrystalline cellulose competitors are typically smaller than fmc while in seaweed extracts carrageenan and alginates and omega3 fish oils we compete with other broadbased chemical companies 

fmc lithium segment sells lithiumbased products worldwide we and our two most significant competitors in lithium extract the element from naturally occurring lithiumrich brines located in the andes mountains of argentina and chile which are believed to be the world’s most significant and lowest cost sources of lithium 

research and development expense 

we perform research and development in all of our segments with the majority of our efforts focused in the fmc agricultural solutions segment the development efforts in the fmc agricultural solutions segment focus on developing environmentally sound solutions and new product formulations that costeffectively increase farmers’ yields and provide alternatives to existing and new chemistries our research and development expenses in the last three years are set forth below

risk factors 

tableend below lists our risk factors updated for these events 

among the factors that could have an impact on our ability to achieve operating results and meet our other goals are 

industry risks 

pricing and volumes in our markets are sensitive to a number of industry specific and global issues and events including 



or weed growth requiring growers to purchase and use more pesticides adverse weather conditions can impact our ability to extract lithium efficiently from our lithium reserves in argentina natural disasters can impact production at our facilities in various parts of the world the nature of these events makes them difficult to predict 



price volatility supply disruptions or loss of property in argentina continued inflation and tightening of foreign exchange controls along with deteriorating economic and financial conditions could adversely affect our business 

operational risks 



face liability arising out of the normal course of business including alleged personal injury or property damage due to exposure to chemicals or other hazardous substances at our current or former facilities or chemicals that we manufacture handle or own we take our environmental responsibilities very seriously but there is a risk of environmental impact inherent in our manufacturing operations and transportation of chemicals any substantial liability for environmental damage could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows

legal proceedings 

tableend 

like hundreds of other industrial companies we have been named as one of many defendants in asbestosrelated personal injury litigation most of these cases allege personal injury or death resulting from exposure to asbestos in premises of fmc or to asbestoscontaining components installed in machinery or equipment manufactured or sold by discontinued operations the machinery and equipment businesses we owned or operated did not fabricate the asbestoscontaining component parts at issue in the litigation and to this day neither the us occupational safety and health administration nor the environmental protection agency has banned the use of these components further the asbestoscontaining parts for this machinery and equipment were accessible only at the time of infrequent repair and maintenance a few jurisdictions have permitted claims to proceed against equipment manufacturers relating to insulation installed by other companies on such machinery and equipment we believe that overall the claims against fmc are without merit 

as of december 31 2016  there were approximately 8000 premises and product asbestos claims pending against fmc in several jurisdictions since the 1980s approximately 113000 asbestos claims against fmc have been discharged the overwhelming majority of which have been dismissed without any payment to the claimant since the 1980s settlements with claimants have totaled approximately 80 million 

we intend to continue managing these asbestosrelated cases in accordance with our historical experience we have established a reserve for this litigation within our discontinued operations and believe that any exposure of a loss in excess of the established reserve cannot be reasonably estimated our experience has been that the overall trends in asbestos litigation have changed over time over the last several years we have seen changes in the jurisdictions where claims against fmc are being filed and changes in the mix of products named in the various claims because these claim trends have yet to form a predictable pattern we are presently unable to reasonably estimate our asbestos liability with respect to claims that may be filed in the future

overview 

we are a diversified chemical company serving agricultural consumer and industrial markets globally with innovative solutions applications and marketleading products we operate in three distinct business segments fmc agricultural solutions fmc health and nutrition and fmc lithium our fmc agricultural solutions segment develops markets and sells all three major classes of crop protection chemicals insecticides herbicides and fungicides these products are used in agriculture to enhance crop yield and quality by controlling a broad spectrum of insects weeds and disease as well as in nonagricultural markets for pest control the fmc health and nutrition segment focuses on nutritional ingredients health excipients and functional health ingredients nutritional ingredients are used to enhance texture color structure and physical stability health excipients are used for binding encapsulation and disintegrant applications functional health ingredients are used as active ingredients in nutraceutical and pharmaceutical markets our fmc lithium segment manufactures lithium for use in a wide range of lithium products which are used primarily in energy storage specialty polymers and chemical synthesis application 

2016  highlights 

the following are the more significant developments in our businesses during the year ended december 31 2016  

 other 2016  highlights 

in our fmc agricultural solutions business we continue to see the benefits of the cheminova acquisition which brought greater scale and regional balance to our business improved our market access and expanded our product portfolio and technology pipeline challenging market conditions specifically in the global crop protection market persisted throughout the year during the quarter as discussed above our fmc agricultural solutions business had significantly improved operating results primarily due to improved performance in brazil which last year was significantly impacted by unfavorable foreign currency 

in fmc health and nutrition global demand for our naturallyderived ingredient product lines continues to be strong and we remain focused on protecting the business’s high margins through the implementation of manufacturing excellence programs process technology improvements and product differentiation however the omega3 business is having challenges due to the overcapacity in the industry in the fourth quarter of 2016 we commissioned our new mcc production facility in rayong thailand which will facilitate our ability to serve a growing nutrition market in asia 

in fmc lithium we are seeing the benefits of our strategy to grow our business in the technologydriven specialty end markets where demand continues to accelerate and pricing trends across our portfolio remain favorable in may we announced plans to triple our production capacity of lithium hydroxide to 30000 metric tons by 2019 in order to meet growing demand from our key customers in late october we announced a supply agreement that will source 8000 metric tons per year of lithium carbonate beginning in mid2018 this agreement will help to support our hydroxide expansion 

2017  outlook 

despite continued challenging agricultural market conditions we believe that our 2017 plan is very achievable it relies on things we control rather than on expectations of positive external events 

we expect to deliver segment earnings growth in each business and a reduction in income tax expense in 2017 as a result of the integration of cheminova the strategy of each business is aligned with its respective market conditions therefore we expect revenue and earnings growth in our lithium and health and nutrition businesses and we will continue a very disciplined approach in ag solutions to ensure earnings growth while positioning the business strongly for the eventual upturn in that market 

on a long term basis we continue to remain a technologydriven company with lowcost asset light operations a unique business research and development model that balances shortand midterm developments with longterm innovations and global scale with strong regional expertise to support local customers 

please see segment discussions under the section entitled “results of operations” for 2017  outlook for each segment 

results of operations— 2016  2015  and 2014   

overview 

the following presents a reconciliation of our segment operating profit to the net income attributable to fmc stockholders as seen through the eyes of our management for management purposes we report the operating performance of each of our business segments based on earnings before interest and income taxes excluding corporate expenses other income expense net and corporate special income charges 



 

 

2 our nonoperating pension and postretirement costs are defined as those costs related to interest expected return on plan assets 

amortized actuarial gains and losses and the impacts of any plan curtailments or settlements these costs are primarily related 

to changes in pension plan assets and liabilities which are tied to financial market performance and we consider these costs to be outside our operational performance we exclude these nonoperating pension and postretirement costs from our segments as we believe that removing them provides a better understanding of the underlying profitability of our businesses provides increased transparency and clarity in the performance of our retirement plans and enhances periodoverperiod comparability we continue to include the service cost and amortization of prior service cost in our operating segments noted above we believe these elements reflect the current year operating costs to our businesses for the employment benefits provided to active employees these expenses are included as a component of the line item selling general and administrative expenses on the consolidated statements of income loss 

3 charges are associated with the previously planned separation of our fmc corporation into two independent public companies on 

september 8 2014 we announced that we would no longer proceed with the planned separation at that time we announced the acquisition of cheminova see note 3 within these consolidated financial statements included within this form 10k for more information these charges are included within business separation costs on our consolidated income statement these costs were primarily related to professional fees associated with separation activities within the finance and legal functions through september 8 2014 

4 charges related to the expensing of the inventory fair value stepup resulting from the application of acquisition purchase accounting 

legal and professional fees and gains or losses on hedging purchase price associated with the planned or completed acquisitions see note 3 for details amounts represent the following 



                               

   

adjusted earnings reconciliation 

the following chart which is provided to assist the readers of our financial statements depicts certain aftertax charges gains these items are excluded from the measures we use to evaluate business performance and determine certain performancebased compensation these aftertax items are discussed in detail within the “other results of operations” section that follows additionally the chart below discloses our nongaap financial measure “adjusted aftertax earnings from continuing operations attributable to fmc stockholders” reconciled from the gaap financial measure “net income loss attributable to fmc stockholders” we believe that this measure provides useful information about our operating results to investors we also believe that excluding the effect of restructuring and other income and charges nonoperating pension and postretirement charges certain nongaap tax adjustments from operating results and discontinued operations allows management and investors to compare more easily the financial performance of our underlying businesses from period to period this measure should not be considered as a substitute for net income loss or other measures of performance or liquidity reported in accordance with gaap 



 



adjustments associated with fluctuations in foreign currency remeasurement of certain foreign operations certain changes in estimates of tax matters related to prior fiscal years certain changes in the realizability of deferred tax assets and changes in tax law management believes excluding these discrete tax items assists investors and securities analysts in understanding the tax provision and the effective tax rate related to ongoing operations thereby providing investors with useful supplemental information about fmcs operational performance

for 2017  fullyear segment revenue is expected to be approximately 22 billion  to 24 billion  and fullyear segment earnings are expected to be in the range of 410 million  to 450 million  in europe we expect our key markets to have increased demand compared to last year which could be somewhat unfavorably impacted by foreign currency in north america we expect challenging market conditions will continue in 2017 given elevated channel inventory levels lower commodity prices and cautious purchasing decisions by the growers as a result we expect the market in north america to be down in 2017 across asia we expect market demand to increase slightly in 2017 assuming more normal weather conditions in latin america market conditions across the region are expected to be favorable resulting in somewhat higher demand than 2016 however foreign exchange headwinds could impact the region negatively 

2015  vs 2014   

revenue of 22529 million increased approximately four percent versus the prior year period due to revenue from the cheminova acquisition on april 20 2015 

operating profit of 3639 million decreased approximately 27 percent compared to the yearago period this decline was primarily driven by market conditions and currency movements in brazil 

fmc agricultural solutions pro forma financial results with cheminova 

in the second quarter of 2015 we began to present pro forma combined results for the fmc agricultural solutions segment we believe that reviewing our operating results by combining actual and pro forma results for the fmc 

agricultural solutions segment for 2015 is more useful in identifying trends in or reaching conclusions regarding the overall operating performance of this segment our pro forma segment information includes adjustments as if the cheminova transaction had occurred on january 1 2014 our pro forma data have also been adjusted for the effects of acquisition accounting but do not include adjustments for costs related to integration activities cost savings or synergies that might have been achieved by the combined businesses pro forma amounts presented are not necessarily indicative of what our results would have been had we operated cheminova since january 1 2014 nor our future results we believe that reviewing our operating results by combining actual and pro forma results for the fmc agricultural solutions segment for the periods set forth below is more useful in identifying trends in or reaching conclusions regarding the overall operating performance of the segment 



 

 



 

 

actual results for 2016  vs pro forma combined results for 2015   

revenue of 22748 million   decreased  approximately 13  percent versus pro forma combined revenue the prior year period volumes contributed to 14  percent of the decline and unfavorable  foreign currency contributed another one  percent to the decline  these declines were partially offset by favorable  pricing which contributed a two  percent increase the lower  volumes were partially due to actions we took to eliminate certain product sales as previously described these actions reduced revenue by approximately 175 million compared to the pro forma revenue for 2015 see chart above for discussion on revenue by region 

operating profit of 3999 million   increased  approximately four  percent compared to the pro forma combined operating profit for the prior period improved pricing and mix impacted pro forma operating profit by ten percent  which was predominantly experienced in both brazil and north america and favorable  foreign currency impacted pro forma results by four  percent lower  costs primarily selling general and administrative in nature also favorably impacted results by 10 percent  the lower volumes noted above had a negative impact on pro forma operating profit of 20 percent  

pro forma combined results  2015 vs 2014 

pro forma combined revenue of 26149 million decreased approximately 23 percent versus the prior year period favorable pricing impacted revenue by five percent in 2015 compared to the same period in 2014 however the price increases only partially offset the unfavorable impact of foreign currency movements and lower volumes unfavorable currency negatively impacted revenue by 11 percent while volumes impacted revenue by 16 percent most of this decline was experienced in latin america primarily brazil lower volume was also a result of the deliberate action to reduce third party resales also in brazil these reduced third party sales were partially the result of the sale of our consagro business 

pro forma combined operating profit of 3838 million decreased approximately 28 percent compared to the yearago period the significant movement in foreign currency rates compared to the prior year particularly the real was the main driver of the decline in operating profit as price increases in local currencies were not enough to offset the impact of foreign currency during 2015 the brazilian real depreciated significantly versus the us dollar as a result foreign currency contributed 55 percent to the decline in year over year pro forma combined operating profit while to a lesser extent lower volumes contributed to a 16 percent impact higher pricing and mix partially offset these declines by 23 percent while lower costs primarily selling general and administrative combined with lower research and development costs improved profits year over year by 19 percent these lower costs were driven by cost savings driven by synergies associated with the cheminova acquisition as well as reduced spending primarily in brazil to address with nearterm market conditions 

in 2015 we announced several targeted measures to reduce operating costs and reorganize our operations in brazil to align the business with nearterm market conditions these measures included 



fmc health and nutrition 



2016  vs 2015   

revenue was 7435 million  a decrease  of approximately five  percent versus the prioryear period lower  volume was the main driver of the decrease  contributing four  percent primarily due to omega3 unfavorable  foreign currency impacts and unfavorable  price and mix decreased  revenue by approximately one  percent total 

segment operating profit of 1913 million   decreased  approximately two  percent versus the year ago period driven by lower revenue partially offset by lower  manufacturing costs the lower  volumes discussed in the preceding paragraph drove the lower earnings 

segment revenue for the full year of 2017  is anticipated to be approximately  750 million  to  790 million  while fullyear segment earnings are expected to be between  190 million  and  200 million  the anticipated revenue increase is driven by increased volumes of mccbased products associated with our new mcc plant in thailand the relatively flat earnings will be impacted by costs of bringing the new plant online which are expected to offset by the benefits of other operational improvements across the business 

2015  vs 2014   

revenue was 7855 million a decrease of approximately five percent versus the prioryear period unfavorable foreign currency impacts primarily a weaker euro decreased revenue by approximately five percent with volume price and mix flat in the aggregate compared to prior year volume was slightly positive as lower volume in carrageenan and alginates were offset by growth in the mcc family of products in both pharmaceuticals and food end markets pricing for 2015 as compared to 2014 was slightly positive and mix was slightly negative 

segment operating profit of 1947 million increased approximately four percent versus the year ago period driven by the higher volumes discussed in the preceding paragraph the operating profit impact of improved price and mix and lower manufacturing costs as well as lower selling general and administrative costs partially offset by unfavorable currency volumes and price mix improved operating profit by three percent and two percent respectively while lower manufacturing costs and lower selling general and administrative costs improved profits by two percent and three percent respectively the reduction in these costs was driven by various manufacturing initiatives to improve profitability as well as the benefits of restructuring activities and cost control initiatives finally unfavorable currency negatively impacted results by six percent year over year 

fmc lithium 



2016  vs 2015   

revenue of 2641 million   increased  by approximately 11  percent versus the prioryear period driven by favorable  pricing of carbonate chloride and hydroxide which accounted for 14 percent  of the change this was offset by lower  volumes due to increased demand from downstream products which impacted revenues by three  percent 

segment operating profit of 702 million   increased  approximately 47 million  versus the year ago period the favorable  pricing noted above impacted operating profit by approximately 33 million  while volume had a negative  impact on operating profit of 3 million  favorable  foreign currency impacts increased  operating profit by approximately 3 million  additionally lower  raw material prices lower energy prices and increased manufacturing efficiencies improved  operating profit by approximately 14 million  

demand for lithium remains strong and pricing trends continue to be favorable in 2016 we announced plans to triple our production capacity of lithium hydroxide to 30000 metric tons by 2019 in order to meet growing demand from our key customers this hydroxide expansion will result in increased volumes in the second half of 2017 full year segment revenue is expected to be approximately  315 million  to  355 million  while segment operating profit is expected to be between  90 million  and  110 million  for the full year of 2017  an increase of approximately 42 percent  over 2016  at the midpoint of the range 

2015  vs 2014   

revenue of 2381 million decreased by approximately seven percent versus the prioryear period driven by lower volumes of upstream products and weaker foreign currencies these impacted revenues by seven percent and three percent respectively this was partially offset by favorable pricing which impacted revenue by three percent 

segment operating profit of 230 million decreased approximately 15 percent versus the year ago period pricing impacted operating profit favorably by approximately 7 million while volume had about an equal negative impact on operating profit foreign currency primarily the argentine peso and the euro impacted operating profit by approximately 9 million this was partially offset by manufacturing cost savings and other miscellaneous items 

corporate and other 

corporate expenses are included as a component of the line item “selling general and administrative expenses” except for last in firstout lifo related charges that are included as a component of cost of sales and other services on our consolidated statements of income 

2016  vs 2015   

corporate and other expenses of 836 million   increased  by 212 million  from 624 million  in 2015  approximately 10 million of the increase  is driven by the higher incentive compensation due to improved business performance as well as costs associated with the relocation of our corporate headquarters which totaled approximately 22 million the remaining 9 million increase was primarily the result of other project initiatives 

2015  vs 2014   

corporate and other expenses of 624 million decreased by 90 million from 714 million in the same period in 2014 the decrease was driven primarily by reduced lifo inventory expense of approximately 70 million the reduced lifo expense was driven by lower inflation rates applied to the inventory subject to lifo calculations excluding the lifo reductions corporate staff expenses and incentive payments were flat year over year 

interest expense net 

2016  vs 2015   

interest expense net of 827 million   increased  by approximately three  percent compared to 801 million  in 2015  the slight increase  was primarily due to higher foreign debt balances partially offset by lower term balance and other minor factors 

2015  vs 2014 

interest expense net of 801 million increased approximately 56 percent as compared to 512 million in 2014 the increase was primarily due to our borrowings under our senior unsecured term loan facility the proceeds of these borrowings were used to finance the acquisition of cheminova as well as to pay costs fees and expenses incurred in connection with the acquisition and the term loan facility see note 12 to our consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k for more information

nonoperating pension and postretirement charges income 

nonoperating pension and postretirement charges income are included in “selling general and administrative expenses” on our consolidated statements of income loss 

2016  vs 2015 

the charge for 2016  was 251 million  compared to 353 million  in 2015  the decrease  in charges was in part due to the estimation method used in 2016 to calculate the interest cost components of our net periodic benefit cost as described in the critical accounting policies section of item 7 within this form 10k the decrease was also the result of 133 million of 

lower amortization of net actuarial losses these decreases were partially offset by an increase of 121 million for recognized losses due to plan settlements see note 13 for more information 

2015  vs 2014 

the charge for 2015 was 353 million compared to 105 million for 2014 the increase in charges was primarily the result of 241 million of higher amortization of net actuarial losses see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k for more information

acquisitionrelated charges 

a detailed description of the acquisition related charges is included in note 19 to the consolidated financial statements included within this form 10k and in the segment results reconciliation above within the  results of operations  section of the managements discussion and analysis 

provision for income taxes 

a significant amount of our earnings is generated by our foreign subsidiaries eg denmark ireland and hong kong which tax earnings at lower rates than the united states federal statutory rate our future effective tax rates may be materially impacted by numerous items including a future change in the composition of earnings from foreign and domestic tax jurisdictions as earnings in foreign jurisdictions are typically taxed at more favorable rates than the united states federal statutory rate accounting for uncertain tax positions business combinations expiration of statute of limitations or settlement of tax audits changes in valuation allowance changes in tax law and the potential decision to repatriate certain future foreign earnings on which united states taxes have not been previously accrued 



    

 the primary drivers for the fluctuations in the effective tax rate from 2016 to 2015 and 2015 to 2014 are provided in the table above excluding the items in the table above the changes in the effective tax rate were primarily due to shifts in earnings mix as it relates to domestic versus foreign income foreign profits are generally taxed at lower rates compared to domestic income see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for additional details related to the provisions for income taxes on continuing operations as well as items that significantly impact our effective tax rate 

discontinued operations net of income taxes

2016  vs 2015   

discontinued operations net of income taxes represented a loss  of 337 million  in 2016  compared to a gain of 6764 million  in 2015  the change was driven by the divestiture of our discontinued fmc alkali chemicals division which resulted in an after tax gain of  7021 million  in 2015  

2015  vs 2014   

discontinued operations net of income taxes represented a gain of 6764 in 2015 compared to a gain of 145 million in 2014 the change was driven by the divestiture of our discontinued fmc alkali chemicals division which resulted in an after tax gain of 7021 million in 2015 

net income attributable to fmc stockholders 

2016  vs 2015   

net income attributable to fmc stockholders decreased to 2091 million  from 4890 million  the decrease was primarily due to the gain from the sale of our discontinued fmc alkali chemicals division in 2015 which was partially offset by lower acquisitionrelated costs in 2016 

2015  vs 2014   

net income attributable to fmc stockholders increased to 4890 million from 3075 million the increase was primarily 

due to the gain from the sale of our discontinued fmc alkali chemicals division offset by reduced agricultural solutions results as well as higher interest expense from higher debt levels needed to fund the cheminova acquisition also significantly impacting results was a higher tax rate in 2015 primarily due to the increases in certain foreign valuation allowances against deferred tax assets 

liquidity and capital resources 

cash and cash equivalents at december 31 2016  and 2015  were 642 million  and 786 million  respectively of the cash and cash equivalents balance at december 31 2016  641 million  was held by our foreign subsidiaries our intent is to reinvest indefinitely the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries and therefore we have not recorded taxes that would be payable if we repatriated these earnings

the decrease  in longterm debt was due to the repayments of borrowing under our term loan and redemption of certain outstanding industrial revenue bonds at december 31 2016  7500 million  remained outstanding under the term loan facility the scheduled maturity of the term loan facility is on april 21 2020 the borrowings under the term loan agreement will bear interest at a floating rate which will be a base rate or a eurocurrency rate equal to the london interbank offered rate for the relevant interest period plus in each case an applicable margin as determined in accordance with the provisions of the term loan agreement 

our shortterm debt consists of foreign borrowings and our commercial paper program foreign borrowings decreased  from 872 million  at december 31 2015  to 855 million  at december 31 2016  while outstanding commercial paper also decreased  from 239 million  to 63 million  at december 31 2015  and 2016  respectively

statement of cash flows 

cash provided required by operating activities was 5373 million  2771 million  and 2849 million  for 2016  2015  and 2014  respectively 

the table below presents the components of net cash provided by operating activities 



 



environmental obligations for continuing operations primarily represent obligations at shut down or abandoned facilities within businesses that do not meet the criteria for presentation as discontinued operations 

 

cash provided required by operating activities of discontinued operations was 395 million  806 million  and 888 million  for 2016  2015  and 2014  respectively 

cash required by operating activities of discontinued operation is directly related to environmental other postretirement benefit liabilities selfinsurance longterm obligations related to legal proceedings and historical restructuring activities amounts in 2015 included divestiture costs associated with the sale of our fmc alkali chemicals business as well as related operating activities 

the increase of cash required by operating activities of discontinued operations in 2015 is due primarily to divestiture costs associated with the sale of our discontinued fmc alkali chemicals business on april 1 2015 additionally 2014 includes a full year of positive cash flows associated with fmc alkali while 2015 only includes one quarter’s worth due to sale date timing 

cash required by investing activities of continuing operations was 1392 million  12855 million  and 1902 million  for 2016  2015  and 2014  respectively 

the decrease of cash required by investing activities in 2016  is due primarily due to the cheminova acquisition on april 21 2015 for an aggregate purchase price of 12 billion excluding assumed net debt and hedgedrelated costs totaling 06 billion 

cash provided by investing activities of discontinued operations was 40 million  16343 million  and 1549 million  for 2016  2015  and 2014  respectively

cash provided by investing activities of discontinued operations in 2015 is directly associated with the sale of our discontinued fmc alkali chemicals business cash provided by investing activities of discontinued operations in 2014 is directly associated with the sale of our discontinued fmc peroxygens business which was completed on february 28 2014 the proceeds from this sale were approximately 200 million also included in these investing activities was capital expenditures of these same discontinued operations for historical periods up to the point of sale the decrease in these capital expenditures in 2015 was due to only one quarter’s worth of alkali capital expenditures in 2015 compared to a full year’s in 2014 

cash required by financing activities was 3770 million  167 million  and 3499 million  in 2016  2015  and 2014  respectively 

2016  vs 2015   

the change period over period in financing activities is primarily due to the repayments of borrowings under our term loan and redemption of certain outstanding industrial revenue bonds 

2015  vs 2014   

the change period over period in financing activities is primarily due to the 165 billion we borrowed under our previously announced senior unsecured term loan facility the proceeds of the borrowing were used to finance the acquisition of cheminova as well as to pay costs fees and expenses incurred in connection with the acquisition and the term loan facility offsetting this borrowing in 2015 was repayments of longterm debt totaling 11 billion primarily due to repayments associated with acquired cheminova long term debt additionally short term debt decreased 547 million in 2015 as compared to 140 million in 2014 additionally in 2014 we paid 987 million to noncontrolling interests primarily to acquire the remaining ownership of our discontinued fmc alkali chemicals division as compared to zero such payments in 2015 

2017  outlook 

in 2017  we expect a continued improvement in cash generation in aggregate we expect cash basis operating income to increase driven by higher earnings within each segment partially offset by higher working capital requirements in 2017 we also expect lower restructuring spending and a reduction in spending from completing substantially all acquisitionrelated integration activities in 2016 we anticipate lower cash taxes in 2017 as compared to 2016 

other potential liquidity needs 

our cash needs for 2017  include operating cash requirements capital expenditures scheduled mandatory payments of longterm debt dividend payments share repurchases contributions to our pension plans environmental and asset retirement obligation spending and restructuring we plan to meet our liquidity needs through available cash cash generated from operations commercial paper issuances and borrowings under our committed revolving credit facility at december 31 2016  our remaining borrowing capacity under our credit facility was 13761 million  

projected 2017  capital expenditures and expenditures related to contract manufacturers are expected to approximate 2016 levels 

projected 2017  spending includes approximately 50 to 55 million of net environmental remediation spending this spending does not include expected spending on capital projects relating to environmental control facilities or expected spending for environmental compliance costs which we will include as a component of costs of sales and services in our consolidated statements of income since these amounts are not covered by established reserves capital spending to expand maintain or replace equipment at our production facilities may trigger requirements for upgrading our environmental controls which may increase our spending for environmental controls over the foregoing projections 

our us pension plan assets decreased slightly from  12046 million  at december 31 2015  to  12033 million  at december 31 2016  our us pension plan assets comprise approximately 95 percent  of our total plan assets with the difference representing plan assets related to foreign pension plans see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements included within this form 10k for details on how we develop our longterm rate of return assumptions we made contributions of  350 million  and  650 million  in 2016  and 2015  respectively and intend to contribute 40 million  in 2017  our contributions in 2015  2016  and our intended contribution in 2017  are all in excess of the minimum requirements our contributions in excess of minimums are done with the objective of avoiding variable rate pension benefit guaranty corporation pbgc premiums as well as potentially reducing future funding volatility we do not believe that the additional contribution in 2017  will have a material impact on our current and future liquidity needs however volatility of interest rates and equity returns may require greater contributions in the future 

during the year ended december 31 2016  210000  shares were repurchased under the publicly announced repurchase program at december 31 2016  2388 million  remained unused under our boardauthorized repurchase program this repurchase program does not include a specific timetable or price targets and may be suspended or terminated at any time shares may be purchased through open market or privately negotiated transactions at the discretion of management based on its evaluation of market conditions and other factors we also reacquire shares from time to time from employees in connections with vesting exercise and forfeiture of awards under our equity compensation plans 

dividends 

on january 19 2017  we paid dividends aggregating 221 million  to our shareholders of record as of december 31 2016  this amount is included in “accrued and other liabilities” on the consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2016  for the years ended december 31 2016  2015  and 2014  we paid 886 million  864 million  and 781 million  in dividends respectively 

commitments 

we provide guarantees to financial institutions on behalf of certain fmc agricultural solutions customers principally brazilian customers for their seasonal borrowing the total of these guarantees was 1087 million  at december 31 2016  these guarantees arise during the ordinary course of business from relationships with customers and nonconsolidated affiliates nonperformance by the guaranteed party triggers the obligation requiring us to make payments to the beneficiary of the guarantee based on our experience these types of guarantees have not had a material effect on our consolidated financial position or on our liquidity our expectation is that future payment or performance related to the nonperformance of others is considered unlikely 

shortterm debt consisted of foreign credit lines and commercial paper at december 31 2016  and 2015  we provide parentcompany guarantees to lending institutions providing credit to our foreign subsidiaries 

we continually evaluate our options for divesting real estate holdings and property plant and equipment that are no longer integral to our operating businesses in connection with our property and asset sales and divestitures we have agreed to indemnify the buyer for certain liabilities including environmental contamination and taxes that occurred prior to the date of sale our indemnification obligations with respect to these liabilities may be indefinite as to duration and may or may not be subject to a deductible minimum claim amount or cap as such it is not possible for us to predict the likelihood that a claim will be made or 

to make a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential loss or range of loss if triggered we may be able to recover certain of the indemnity payments from third parties we have not recorded any specific liabilities for these guarantees 

our total significant committed contracts that we believe will affect cash over the next four years and beyond are as follows

climate change 

as a global corporate citizen we are concerned about the consequences of climate change and will take prudent and cost effective actions that reduce greenhouse gas emissions to the atmosphere 

fmc is committed to doing its part to address climate change and its impacts we have set 2025 goals that we will reduce both energy intensity and green house gas ghg intensity for our operations by 15 from our 2013 baseline year in 2016 fmcs actions to implement best practices in environmental stewardship and climate change action were recognized by cdp formerly carbon disclosure project cdp is widely recognized as one of the top environmental data reporting organizations in the world and over 8500 companies responded to cdp in 2016 fmc submitted its firstever response to cdps climate change program and received an a score which places fmc in cdps leadership scoring category 

fmc detailed the business risks and opportunities we have due to climate change and its impacts in our 2016 cdp climate change report 

even as we take action to control the release of ghgs additional warming is anticipated longterm higher average global temperatures could result in induced charges in natural resources growing seasons precipitation patterns weather patterns species distributions water availability sea levels and biodiversity these impacts could cause changes in supplies of raw materials used to maintain fmc’s production capacity and could lead to possible increased sourcing costs depending on how pervasive the climate impacts are in the different geographic locations experiencing changes in natural resources fmc’s customers could be impacted demand for fmc’s products could increase if our products meet our customers’ needs to adapt to climate change impacts or decrease if our products do not meet their needs within our own operations we continually assess our manufacturing sites worldwide for risks and opportunities to increase our preparedness for climate change we are evaluating sea level rise and storm surge at three of our plants located within 4 meters of sea level to understand timing of potential impacts and response actions that 

may need to be taken to lessen fmc’s overall environmental footprint we have taken actions to increase the energy efficiency in our manufacturing sites we have also committed to 2025 goals to reduce our water use in highrisk areas by 20 and our waste intensities by 15 

in our product portfolio we see market opportunities for our products to address climate change and its impacts for example fmc agricultural solutions’ products can help customers increase yield energy and water efficiency and decrease greenhouse gas emissions our products can also help growers adapt to more unpredictable growing conditions and the effects these types of threats have on crops fmc health and nutrition addresses consumers’ changing preferences and increased environmental concerns with natural products and differentiated food and health ingredients for healthier lifestyles fmc lithium’s products can be used in energy storage applications fuelefficient and electric vehicles lighterweight aluminum in the aircraft and aerospace industries 

we are improving existing products and developing new platforms and technologies that help mitigate impacts of climate change agricultural solutions is developing products with a lighter environmental footprint in its biologicals products fmc lithium is researching new applications of our lithium products in a range of industries these business opportunities could lead to new products and services for our existing and potential customers beyond our products and operations fmc recognizes that energy consumption throughout our supply chain can impact climate change and product costs therefore we will actively work with our entire value chain  suppliers contractors and customers  to improve their energy efficiencies and to reduce their ghg emissions 

we continue to follow legislative and regulatory developments regarding climate change because the regulation of greenhouse gases depending on their nature and scope could subject some of our manufacturing operations to additional costs or limits on operations in december 2015 195 countries at the united nations climate change conference in paris reached an agreement to reduce ghgs it remains to be seen how and when each of these countries will implement this agreement the united states environmental protection agency’s clean power plan plan is the us’s centerpiece for meeting its paris commitment implementation of the plan has been stayed by the us supreme court pending appeals and the legal challenges to the plan have yet to be resolved in the us federal court of appeals the plan gives states flexibility to craft their own programs so the impact to fmc of the plan if implemented is not estimable at this time at this point our us facilities are not subject to any state or regional greenhouse gas regulation that limits ghg emissions some of our foreign operations are subject to national or local energy management or climate change regulation such as our plant in denmark that is subject to the eu emissions trading scheme at present that plant’s emissions are below its designated cap 

future ghg regulatory requirements may result in increased costs of energy additional capital costs for emissions control or new equipment andor costs associated with cap and trade or carbon taxes we are currently monitoring regulatory developments the costs of complying with possible future climate change requirements are difficult to estimate at this time

critical accounting policies 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles us gaap  the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses we have described our accounting policies in note 1 principal accounting policies and related financial information to our consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k we have reviewed these accounting policies identifying those that we believe to be critical to the preparation and understanding of our consolidated financial statements we have reviewed these critical accounting policies with the audit committee of the board of directors critical accounting policies are central to our presentation of results of operations and financial condition in accordance with us gaap and require management to make estimates and judgments on certain matters we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience current conditions and other reasonable factors 

revenue recognition and trade receivables 

we recognize revenue when the earnings process is complete which is generally upon transfer of title this transfer typically occurs either upon shipment to the customer or upon receipt by the customer in all cases we apply the following criteria in recognizing revenue persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred the selling price is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured rebates due to customers are accrued as a reduction of revenue in the same period that the related sales are recorded based on the contract terms 

we periodically enter into prepayment arrangements with customers primarily in our fmc agricultural solutions segment and receive advance payments for product to be delivered in future periods these advance payments are recorded as deferred revenue and classified as “advance payments from customers” on the consolidated balance sheet revenue associated with advance payments is recognized as shipments are made and title ownership and risk of loss pass to the customer 

we record amounts billed for shipping and handling fees as revenue costs incurred for shipping and handling are recorded as costs of sales and services amounts billed for sales and use taxes valueadded taxes and certain excise and other specific transactional taxes imposed on revenueproducing transactions are presented on a net basis and excluded from sales in the consolidated income statements we record a liability until remitted to the respective taxing authority 

trade receivables consist of amounts owed from customer sales and are recorded when revenue is recognized the allowance for trade receivables represents our best estimate of the probable losses associated with potential customer defaults in developing our allowance for trade receivables we use a two stage process which includes calculating a general formula to develop an allowance to appropriately address the uncertainty surrounding collection risk of our entire portfolio and specific allowances for customers where the risk of collection has been reasonably identified either due to liquidity constraints or disputes over contractual terms and conditions 

our method of calculating the general formula consists of estimating the recoverability of trade receivables based on historical experience current collection trends and external business factors such as economic factors including regional bankruptcy rates and political factors our analysis of trade receivable collection risk is performed quarterly and the allowance is adjusted accordingly 

we also hold longterm receivables that represent longterm customer receivable balances related to pastdue accounts which are not expected to be collected within the current year our policy for the review of the allowance for these receivables is consistent with the discussion in the preceding paragraph above on trade receivables therefore on an ongoing basis we continue to evaluate the credit quality of our longterm receivables utilizing aging of receivables collection experience and writeoffs as well as existing economic conditions to determine if an additional allowance is necessary 

environmental obligations and related recoveries 

we provide for environmentalrelated obligations when they are probable and amounts can be reasonably estimated where the available information is sufficient to estimate the amount of liability that estimate has been used where the information is only sufficient to establish a range of probable liability and no point within the range is more likely than any other the lower end of the range has been used 

estimated obligations to remediate sites that involve oversight by the united states environmental protection agency “epa” or similar government agencies are generally accrued no later than when a record of decision “rod” or equivalent is issued or upon completion of a remedial investigationfeasibility study “rifs” or equivalent that is submitted by us to the appropriate government agency or agencies estimates are reviewed quarterly by our environmental remediation management as well as by financial and legal management and if necessary adjusted as additional information becomes available the estimates can change substantially as additional information becomes available regarding the nature or extent of site contamination required remediation methods and other actions by or against governmental agencies or private parties 

our environmental liabilities for continuing and discontinued operations are principally for costs associated with the remediation andor study of sites at which we are alleged to have released hazardous substances into the environment such costs principally include among other items rifs site remediation costs of operation and maintenance of the remediation plan management costs fees to outside law firms and consultants for work related to the environmental effort and future monitoring costs estimated site liabilities are determined based upon existing remediation laws and technologies specific site consultants’ engineering studies or by extrapolating experience with environmental issues at comparable sites 

included in our environmental liabilities are costs for the operation maintenance and monitoring of site remediation plans omm such reserves are based on our best estimates for these omm plans over time we may incur omm costs in excess of these reserves however we are unable to reasonably estimate an amount in excess of our recorded reserves because we cannot reasonably 

estimate the period for which such omm plans will need to be in place or the future annual cost of such remediation as conditions at these environmental sites change over time such additional omm costs could be significant in total but would be incurred over an extended period of years 

included in the environmental reserve balance other assets balance and disclosure of reasonably possible loss contingencies are amounts from third party insurance policies which we believe are probable of recovery 

provisions for environmental costs are reflected in income net of probable and estimable recoveries from named potentially responsible parties “prps” or other third parties such provisions incorporate inflation and are not discounted to their present values 

in calculating and evaluating the adequacy of our environmental reserves we have taken into account the joint and several liability imposed by comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act “cercla” and the analogous state laws on all prps and have considered the identity and financial condition of the other prps at each site to the extent possible we have also considered the identity and financial condition of other third parties from whom recovery is anticipated as well as the status of our claims against such parties although we are unable to forecast the ultimate contributions of prps and other third parties with absolute certainty the degree of uncertainty with respect to each party is taken into account when determining the environmental reserve by adjusting the reserve to reflect the facts and circumstances on a sitebysite basis our liability includes our best estimate of the costs expected to be paid before the consideration of any potential recoveries from third parties we believe that any recorded recoveries related to prps are realizable in all material respects recoveries are recorded as either an offset in “environmental liabilities continuing and discontinued” or as “other assets” in our consolidated balance sheets in accordance with us accounting literature 

see note 10 to our consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k for changes in estimates associated with our environmental obligations 

impairments and valuation of longlived and indefinitelived assets 

our longlived assets primarily include property plant and equipment goodwill and intangible assets the assets and liabilities of acquired businesses are measured at their estimated fair values at the dates of acquisition the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired including identified intangibles is recorded as goodwill the determination and allocation of fair value to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is based on various assumptions and valuation methodologies requiring considerable management judgment including estimates based on historical information current market data and future expectations the principal assumptions utilized in our valuation methodologies include revenue growth rates operating margin estimates and discount rates although the estimates were deemed reasonable by management based on information available at the dates of acquisition those estimates are inherently uncertain 

we test for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the net book value of our property plant and equipment may not be recoverable from the estimated undiscounted expected future cash flows expected to result from their use and eventual disposition in cases where the estimated undiscounted expected future cash flows are less than net book value an impairment loss is recognized equal to the amount by which the net book value exceeds the estimated fair value of assets which is based on discounted cash flows at the lowest level determinable the estimated cash flows reflect our assumptions about selling prices volumes costs and market conditions over a reasonable period of time 

we perform an annual impairment test of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets in the third quarter of each year or more frequently whenever an event or change in circumstances occurs that would require reassessment of the recoverability of those assets in performing our evaluation we assess qualitative factors such as overall financial performance of our reporting units anticipated changes in industry and market structure competitive environments planned capacity and cost factors such as raw material prices based on our assessment for 2016  we determined that no goodwill impairment charge to our continuing operations was required the majority of the brands intangible asset relates to our proprietary brand portfolio for which the fair value was substantially in excess of the carrying value during the 3rd quarter of 2016 we recorded a 1 million  impairment charge in our generic brand portfolio which is part of the fmc agricultural solutions segment the carrying value of the generic portfolio subsequent to the charge is approximately 6 million  

see note 7 to our consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k for charges associated with longlived asset disposal costs and the activity associated with the restructuring reserves 

pension and other postretirement benefits 

we provide qualified and nonqualified defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans as well as postretirement health care and life insurance benefit plans to our employees and retirees the costs benefits and obligations related to these benefits reflect key assumptions related to general economic conditions including interest discount rates healthcare cost trend rates expected rates of return on plan assets and the rates of compensation increase for employees the costs benefits and obligations for these benefit programs are also affected by other assumptions such as average retirement age mortality employee turnover and plan participation to the extent our plans’ actual experience as influenced by changing economic and financial market conditions or by changes to our own plans’ demographics differs from these assumptions the costs and obligations for providing these benefits as well as the plans’ funding requirements could increase or decrease when actual results differ from our assumptions the difference is typically recognized over future periods in addition the unrealized gains and losses related to our pension and postretirement benefit obligations may also affect periodic benefit costs benefits in future periods 

historically we have amortized unrecognized gains and losses using the corridor method over the average remaining service period of active participants of approximately eight years as of december 31 2016 approximately 95 of the participants in our us qualified plan and approximately 93 of the participants in our us postretirement life plan were inactive therefore for fiscal 2017 we will amortize gains and losses over the average remaining life expectancy of the inactive population for these two plans the gainloss amortization period for the us qualified pension plan will increase from about eight years to about nineteen years as a result of this change we consider this a change in estimate and accordingly will account for it prospectively in 2017 for fiscal 2017 the change in estimate from amortizing gains and losses over the expected lifetime of the inactive population rather than the average remaining service period of active participants is expected to reduce us pension and postretirement net periodic benefit cost by approximately 18 to 22 million when compared to the prior estimate 

in 2016 the society of actuaries released an updated mortality table projection scale for measurement of retirement program obligations we adopted this update in measuring the december 31 2016  us defined benefit and post retirement obligations adoption of this new projection scale has decreased the benefit obligations at december 31 2016  by approximately 177 million  the effect of this adoption will be amortized into net periodic benefit cost beginning in 2017 

we use several assumptions and statistical methods to determine the asset values used to calculate both the expected rate of return on assets component of pension cost and to calculate our plans’ funding requirements the expected rate of return on plan assets is based on a marketrelated value of assets that recognizes investment gains and losses over a fiveyear period we use an actuarial value of assets to determine our plans’ funding requirements the actuarial value of assets must be within a certain range high or low of the actual market value of assets and is adjusted accordingly 

we select the discount rate used to calculate pension and other postretirement obligations based on a review of available yields on highquality corporate bonds as of the measurement date in selecting a discount rate as of december 31 2016  we placed particular emphasis on a discount rate yieldcurve provided by our actuary this yieldcurve when populated with projected cash flows that represent the expected timing and amount of our plans benefit payments produced an effective discount rate of 422 percent  for our us qualified plan 355 percent  for our us nonqualified and 377 percent  for our us other postretirement benefit plans 

the discount rates used at our december 31 2016  and 2015  measurement dates for the us qualified plan were 422 percent  and 450 percent  respectively the effect of the change in the discount rate from 450 percent  to 422 percent  at december 31 2016  resulted in a 391 million  increase to our us qualified pension benefit obligations the effect of the change in the discount rate from 415 percent  at december 31 2014  to 450 percent  at december 31 2015  resulted in a 54 million  decrease to the 2016  us qualified pension expense 

the change in discount rate from 450 percent  at december 31 2015  to 422 percent  at december 31 2016  was attributable to a decrease in yields on high quality corporate bonds with cash flows matching the timing and amount of our expected future benefit payments between the 2015  and 2016  measurement dates using the december 31 2016  and 2015  yield curves our us qualified plan cash flows produced a single weightedaverage discount rate of approximately 422 percent  and 450 percent  respectively 

on december 31 2015 we changed the method we used to estimate the service cost and interest cost components of our net periodic benefit cost for our us defined benefit pension plans we use a full yield curve approach in the estimate of these components of benefit cost by applying specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows as we believe this provides a better estimate of service and interest costs for fiscal 2016 the change in estimate from a single weighted average discount rate to a spot rate approach reduced us pension and postretirement net periodic benefit cost by 12 million 

in developing the assumption for the longterm rate of return on assets for our us plan we take into consideration the technical analysis performed by our outside actuaries including historical market returns information on the assumption for 

longterm real returns by asset class inflation assumptions and expectations for standard deviation related to these best estimates we also consider the historical performance of our own plan’s trust which has earned a compound annual rate of return of approximately 84 percent  over the last 20 years which is in excess of comparable market indices for the same period as well as other factors which are discussed in note 13 to our consolidated financial statements in this form 10k our longterm rate of return for the fiscal year ended december 31 2016  2015  and 2014  was 700 percent  725 percent  and 775 percent  respectively 

for the sensitivity of our pension costs to incremental changes in assumptions see our discussion below 

sensitivity analysis related to key pension and postretirement benefit assumptions 

a onehalf percent increase in the assumed discount rate would have decreased pension and other postretirement benefit obligations by  703 million  and  768 million  at december 31 2016  and 2015  respectively and decreased pension and other postretirement benefit costs by  52 million   64 million  and  69 million  for 2016  2015  and 2014  respectively a onehalf percent decrease in the assumed discount rate would have increased pension and other postretirement benefit obligations by  785 million  and  853 million  at december 31 2016  and 2015  respectively and increased pension and other postretirement benefit cost by  57 million   65 million  and  75 million  for 2016  2015  and 2014  respectively 

a onehalf percent increase in the assumed expected longterm rate of return on plan assets would have decreased pension costs by  60 million   58 million  and  52 million  for 2016  2015  and 2014  respectively a onehalf percent decrease in the assumed longterm rate of return on plan assets would have increased pension costs by  60 million   58 million  and  52 million  for 2016  2015  and 2014  respectively 

further details on our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and net periodic benefit costs benefits are found in note 13 to our consolidated financial statements in this form 10k 

income taxes 

we have recorded a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets in certain jurisdictions to the amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized in assessing the need for this allowance we have considered a number of factors including future taxable income the jurisdictions in which such income is earned and our ongoing tax planning strategies in the event that we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period such determination was made similarly should we conclude that we would be able to realize certain deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase income in the period such determination was made 

additionally we file income tax returns in the us federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions certain income tax returns for fmc entities taxable in the us and significant foreign jurisdictions are open for examination and adjustment we assess our income tax positions and record a liability for all years open to examination based upon our evaluation of the facts circumstances and information available at the reporting date for those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained we have recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information we adjust these liabilities if necessary upon the completion of tax audits or changes in tax law

 item 7a 

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend our earnings cash flows and financial position are exposed to market risks relating to fluctuations in commodity prices interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates our policy is to minimize exposure to our cash flow over time caused by changes in commodity interest and currency exchange rates to accomplish this we have implemented a controlled program of risk management consisting of appropriate derivative contracts entered into with major financial institutions 

the analysis below presents the sensitivity of the market value of our financial instruments to selected changes in market rates and prices the range of changes chosen reflects our view of changes that are reasonably possible over a oneyear period market value estimates are based on the present value of projected future cash flows considering the market rates and prices chosen 

at december 31 2016  our net financial instrument position was a net liability of 25 million  compared to a net liability of 134 million  at december 31 2015  the change in the net financial instrument position was primarily due to lower unrealized losses in our commodity and foreign exchange portfolios 

since our risk management programs are generally highly effective the potential loss in value for each risk management portfolio described below would be largely offset by changes in the value of the underlying exposure 

commodity price risk 

energy costs are diversified among coal electricity and natural gas we attempt to mitigate our exposure to increasing energy costs by hedging the cost of future deliveries of natural gas and by entering into fixedprice contracts for the purchase of coal and fuel oil to analyze the effect of changing energy prices we have performed a sensitivity analysis in which we assume an instantaneous 10 percent change in energy market prices from their levels at december 31 2016  and 2015  with all other variables including interest rates held constant 



foreign currency exchange rate risk 

the primary currencies for which we have exchange rate exposure are the us dollar versus the euro the chinese yuan the brazilian real and the argentine peso foreign currency debt and foreign exchange forward contracts are used in countries where we do business thereby reducing our net asset exposure foreign exchange forward contracts are also used to hedge firm and highly anticipated foreign currency cash flows 

to analyze the effects of changing foreign currency rates we have performed a sensitivity analysis in which we assume an instantaneous 10 percent change in the foreign currency exchange rates from their levels at december 31 2016  and 2015  with all other variables including interest rates held constant 



interest rate risk 

one of the strategies that we can use to manage interest rate exposure is to enter into interest rate swap agreements in these agreements we agree to exchange at specified intervals the difference between fixed and variable interest amounts calculated on an agreedupon notional principal amount as of december 31 2016  and 2015  we had no interest rate swap agreements 

our debt portfolio at december 31 2016  is composed of 589  percent fixedrate debt and 411  percent variablerate debt the variablerate component of our debt portfolio principally consists of borrowings under our term loan facility commercial paper program credit facility variablerate industrial and pollution control revenue bonds and amounts outstanding under foreign subsidiary credit lines changes in interest rates affect different portions of our variablerate debt portfolio in different ways 

based on the variablerate debt in our debt portfolio at december 31 2016  a one percentage point increase in interest rates would have increased gross interest expense by 78 million  and a one percentage point decrease in interest rates would have decreased gross interest expense by 61 million  for the year ended december 31 2016

fmc health and nutrition 

  

overview 

our fmc health and nutrition segment which represents 24 percent  of our 2015  consolidated revenues is focused on highperformance food ingredients pharmaceutical excipients and omega3 oils the majority of fmc health and nutrition sales are to customers in noncyclical end markets we believe our future growth in this segment will continue to be based on the valueadded performance of these products and our research and development capabilities as well as on the alliances and close working relationships we have developed with key global customers 

products and markets 

            

  

our product offerings into nutrition markets principally provide texture structure and physical stability tsps solutions to thicken and stabilize certain food products our formulation ingredients serve the health excipient industry functioning as binders disintegrants suspending agents and controlrelease compounds for the production of both solid and liquid pharmaceutical products the majority of our functional ingredient product offerings are high purity omega3 products as well as certain alginate products which are considered to be active pharmaceutical ingredients 

fmc health and nutrition is a supplier of microcrystalline cellulose mcc carrageenan alginates natural colorants and omega3 all naturally derived ingredients that have high valueadded applications in the production of processed and convenience foods oral dose form pharmaceuticals and nutraceuticals mcc processed from specialty grades of renewable hardwood and 

softwood pulp provides binding and disintegrant properties for dry tablets and capsules and has unique functionality that improves the texture and stability of many nutrition products carrageenan and alginates both processed from natural seaweeds are used in a wide variety of food pharmaceutical and oral care applications natural colorants are utilized in specialty products used in the food beverage personal care nutrition and health excipient markets omega3 is sourced from fish oils and use in other pharmaceutical and nutraceutical applications 

industry overview 

nutritional ingredients 

the industry is dispersed geographically with sales in europe north america and asia the nutritional ingredients market is comprised of a large number of suppliers due to the broad spectrum of chemistries employed segment leadership global position and investment in technology are key factors to sustaining profitability the top suppliers of tsps ingredients include fmc dupont jm huber corporation kerry group plc and cargill incorporated 

health excipients and functional health ingredients 

competitors tend to be grouped by chemistry our principal mcc competitors include j rettenmaier  sôhne gmbh ming tai chemical co ltd asahi kasei corporation and blanver farmoquimica ltda while pricing pressure from lowcost producers is a common competitive dynamic companies look to offset that pressure by providing the most reliable and broadest range of products and services our customers are pharmaceutical firms who depend upon reliable therapeutic performance of their drug products in omega3 our competitors include dsm basf croda and other smaller producers competition has intensified in this market over the past several years as many smaller producers attempt to enter in what is considered by many as an attractive growth market differentiation among higher end producers such as fmc is achieved through knowhow to produce high concentration oils at high levels of purity 

fmc lithium 

            

                  

overview 

our fmc lithium segment represents seven percent  of our 2015  consolidated revenues 

while lithium is sold into a variety of end markets we have focused our strategy on specialty products that require a high level of manufacturing and technical knowhow to meet customer requirements 

the electrochemical properties of lithium make it an ideal material for portable energy storage in high performance applications including smart phones tablets laptop computers military devices and other nextgeneration energy storage technologies lithium is a critical element in advanced batteries for use in hybrid electric plugin hybrids and allelectric vehicles 

organolithium products are highly valued in the polymer market as initiators in the production of synthetic rubbers and elastomers organolithiums are also sold to fine chemical and pharmaceutical customers who use lithiums unique chemical properties to synthesize high valueadded products 

industry overview 

our fmc lithium serves a diverse group of markets our product offerings are primarily inorganic and generally have few costeffective substitutes a major growth driver for lithium in the future will be the rate of adoption of electric and hybrid electric batteries in automobiles 

most markets for lithium chemicals are global with significant growth occurring both in asia and north america primarily driven by the development and manufacture of lithium ion batteries there are three key producers of lithium compounds fmc albemarle corporation previously rockwood holdings inc and sociedad química y minera de chile sa spodumene ore is also converted to lithium compounds by a large number of chinese producers we expect a few new producers to add capacity within the next 24 months fmc and albemarle corporation are the primary producers of lithium specialty products 

source and availability of raw materials 

raw materials used by fmc agricultural solutions primarily processed chemicals are obtained from a variety of suppliers worldwide raw materials used by fmc health and nutrition include various types of seaweed specialty pulps natural colorant raw materials and fish oils that are all sourced on a global basis and purchased from selected global producerssuppliers we extract ores used in fmc lithium’s manufacturing processes from lithium brines in argentina 

patents 

we own a number of us and foreign patents trademarks and licenses that are cumulatively important to our business we do not believe that the loss of any individual or combination of related patents trademarks or licenses would have a material adverse effect on the overall business of fmc the duration of our patents depends on their respective jurisdictions 

seasonality 

the seasonal nature of the crop protection market and the geographic spread of the fmc agricultural solutions business can result in significant variations in quarterly earnings among geographic locations fmc agricultural solutions products sold in the northern hemisphere north america europe and parts of asia serve seasonal agricultural markets from march through september generally resulting in earnings in the first second and third quarters markets in the southern hemisphere latin america and parts of the asia pacific region including australia are served from july through february generally resulting in earnings in the third fourth and first quarters the remainder of our business is generally not subject to significant seasonal fluctuations 

competition 

we encounter substantial competition in each of our three business segments we market our products through our own sales organization and through alliance partners independent distributors and sales representatives the number of our principal competitors varies from segment to segment in general we compete by providing advanced technology high product quality reliability quality customer and technical service and by operating in a costefficient manner 

our fmc agricultural solutions segment competes primarily in the global chemical crop protection market for insecticides herbicides and fungicides industry products include crop protection chemicals and for certain major competitors genetically engineered crop biotechnology products competition from generic agrochemical producers is significant as a number of key product patents held industrywide have expired in the last decade in general we compete as an innovator by focusing on product development including novel formulations proprietary mixes and advanced delivery systems and by acquiring or licensing mostly proprietary chemistries or technologies that complement our product and geographic focus we also differentiate ourselves by our global costcompetitiveness through our manufacturing strategies establishing effective product stewardship programs and developing strategic alliances that strengthen market access in key countries and regions 

our fmc health and nutrition segment has significant positions in markets that include alginate carrageenan and microcrystalline cellulose we compete with both direct suppliers of cellulose and seaweed extract as well as suppliers of other hydrocolloids which may provide similar functionality in specific applications in microcrystalline cellulose competitors are typically smaller than fmc while in seaweed extracts carrageenan and alginates and omega3 fish oils we compete with other broadbased chemical companies 

fmc lithium segment sells lithiumbased products worldwide we and our two most significant competitors in lithium extract the element from naturally occurring lithiumrich brines located in the andes mountains of argentina and chile which are believed to be the world’s most significant and lowest cost sources of lithium 

research and development expense 

we perform research and development in all of our segments with the majority of our efforts focused in the fmc agricultural solutions segment the development efforts in the fmc agricultural solutions segment focus on developing environmentally sound solutions and new product formulations that costeffectively increase farmers’ yields and provide alternatives to existing and new chemistries our research and development expenses in the last three years are set forth below

risk factors 

tableend below lists our risk factors updated for these events 

among the factors that could have an impact on our ability to achieve operating results and meet our other goals are 

industry risks 

pricing and volumes in our markets are sensitive to a number of industry specific and global issues and events including 

 12 

chemical markets has been driven by the number of significant product patents and product data protections that have expired in the last decade and this trend is expected to continue 

 13 

expropriation of property undeveloped property rights and legal systems or political instability other governmental actions and other external factors over which we have no control economic and political conditions within foreign jurisdictions or strained relations between countries can cause fluctuations in demand price volatility supply disruptions or loss of property in argentina continued inflation and tightening of foreign exchange controls along with deteriorating economic and financial conditions could adversely affect our business in brazil which makes up a larger portion of our agricultural solutions business in latin america since our acquisition of cheminova in the second quarter of 2015 continued high inflation and economic recession could continue to adversely affect our business 

operational risks   

 14 

 

technology risks 

 

portfolio management risks 

 in particular an inability to successfully integrate and develop cheminova as planned could result in our inability to achieve the synergies we have projected and could thereby cause our future results of operations to be materially and adversely worse than expected we expect to generate synergies as a result of i improving cheminova operating costefficiencies ii changing the mix of cheminova’s sales from generic lower margin products to more differentiated and higher margin products and iii rationalizing of the distribution channels used by fmc and cheminova in overlapping european markets however there can be no assurances that we will be successful in achieving these planned synergies

legal proceedings 

tableend 

like hundreds of other industrial companies we have been named as one of many defendants in asbestosrelated personal injury litigation most of these cases allege personal injury or death resulting from exposure to asbestos in premises of fmc or to asbestoscontaining components installed in machinery or equipment manufactured or sold by discontinued operations the machinery and equipment businesses we owned or operated did not fabricate the asbestoscontaining component parts at issue in the litigation and to this day neither the us occupational safety and health administration nor the environmental protection agency has banned the use of these components further the asbestoscontaining parts for this machinery and equipment were accessible only at the time of infrequent repair and maintenance a few jurisdictions have permitted claims to proceed against equipment manufacturers relating to insulation installed by other companies on such machinery and equipment we believe that overall the claims against fmc are without merit 

as of december 31 2015  there were approximately 8000 premises and product asbestos claims pending against fmc in several jurisdictions since the 1980s approximately 111000 asbestos claims against fmc have been discharged the overwhelming majority of which have been dismissed without any payment to the claimant since the 1980s settlements with claimants have totaled approximately 731 million 

we intend to continue managing these asbestosrelated cases in accordance with our historical experience we have established a reserve for this litigation within our discontinued operations and believe that any exposure of a loss in excess of the established reserve cannot be reasonably estimated our experience has been that the overall trends in asbestos litigation have changed over time over the last several years we have seen changes in the jurisdictions where claims against fmc are being filed and changes in the mix of products named in the various claims because these claim trends have yet to form a predictable pattern we are presently unable to reasonably estimate our asbestos liability with respect to claims that may be filed in the future

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

tableend 

overview 

we are a diversified chemical company serving agricultural consumer and industrial markets globally with innovative solutions applications and marketleading products we operate in three distinct business segments fmc agricultural solutions fmc health and nutrition and fmc lithium our fmc agricultural solutions segment develops markets and sells all three major classes of crop protection chemicals – insecticides herbicides and fungicides these products are used in agriculture to enhance crop yield and quality by controlling a broad spectrum of insects weeds and disease as well as in nonagricultural markets for pest control the fmc health and nutrition segment focuses on nutritional ingredients health excipients and functional health ingredients nutritional ingredients are used to enhance texture color structure and physical stability health excipients are used for binding encapsulation and disintegrant applications functional health ingredients are used as active ingredients in nutraceutical and pharmaceutical markets our fmc lithium segment manufactures lithium for use in a wide range of lithium products which are used primarily in energy storage specialty polymers and chemical synthesis application 

2015 highlights 

the following are the more significant developments in our businesses during the year ended december 31 2015  

 other 2015 highlights 

during 2015 we closed on two significant transactions  the divestiture of our alkali chemicals division and the acquisition of cheminova this marked the completion of our transformation to a technologydriven specialty company with leading market positions across agriculture nutrition pharmaceutical and specialty lithium applications 

in agricultural solutions the acquisition of cheminova strengthened our technology pipeline brought greater regional balance broadened our market access and expanded our portfolio the acquisition and integration of cheminova combined with the actions we have taken to restructure our agricultural solutions operations in brazil have positioned fmc to better address current market conditions 

in health and nutrition we focused on driving higher margins by capturing highvalue commercial opportunities across our existing portfolio and by the implementation of manufacturing excellence programs and process technology improvements and in lithium we continued to execute on our strategy of growing our differentiated downstream specialty business to take advantage of favorable end market demand 

finally 2015 was also a year marked by significant foreign exchange volatility which impacted our results negatively as well as difficult conditions across the global agriculture market to address this we took decisive actions throughout the year to address these challenges which included accelerating the integration of cheminova restructuring our agricultural solutions business in brazil exercising discipline on pricing and aggressively controlling costs across the company 

2016 outlook 

we expect to deliver earnings growth in all businesses in 2016 and will continue to position fmc firmly on the path of growth by leveraging the company’s unique business model that has defined our success we remain a technologydriven company with lowcost asset light operations a unique business research and development model that balances shortand midterm development with longterm innovation and global scale with strong regional expertise to support local customers 

please see segment discussions under the section entitled “results of operations” for 2016 outlook for each segment on a consolidated basis we expect our 2016 adjusted earnings per share to be between 250 and 280 

results of operations— 2015  2014  and 2013   

overview 

the following presents a reconciliation of our segment operating profit to the net income attributable to fmc stockholders as seen through the eyes of our management for management purposes we report the operating performance of each of our business segments based on earnings before interest and income taxes excluding corporate expenses other income expense net and corporate special incomecharges 



 

 

2 our nonoperating pension and postretirement costs are defined as those costs related to interest expected return on plan assets 

amortized actuarial gains and losses and the impacts of any plan curtailments or settlements these costs are primarily related 

to changes in pension plan assets and liabilities which are tied to financial market performance and we consider these costs to be outside our operational performance we exclude these nonoperating pension and postretirement costs from our segments as we believe that removing them provides a better understanding of the underlying profitability of our businesses provides increased transparency and clarity in the performance of our retirement plans and enhances periodoverperiod comparability we continue to include the service cost and amortization of prior service cost in our operating segments noted above we believe these elements reflect the current year operating costs to our businesses for the employment benefits provided to active employees 

3 charges are associated with the previously planned separation of our fmc corporation into two independent public companies on 

september 8 2014 we announced that we would no longer proceed with the planned separation at that time we announced the acquisition of cheminova see note 3 within these consolidated financial statements included within this form 10k for more information these charges are included within business separation costs on our consolidated income statement these costs were primarily related to professional fees associated with separation activities within the finance and legal functions through september 8 2014

fmc agricultural solutions 

  



2015  vs 2014   

revenue of 22529 million  increased approximately four percent versus the prior year period due to revenue from the cheminova acquisition on april 20 2015 

operating profit of 3639 million  decreased approximately 27 percent compared to the yearago period this decline was primarily driven by market conditions and currency movements in brazil 

refer to the fmc agricultural solutions pro forma financial results with cheminova  section below for further discussion 

for 2016 fullyear segment revenue is expected to be approximately 23 billion to 25 billion and fullyear segment earnings are expected to be in the range of 380 million to 420 million in europe we expect our key markets to be broadly flat compared to last year although we expect to see higher growth across eastern europe in north america we expect the challenging market conditions will continue in 2016 given elevated channel inventory levels and projected lower farm incomes as a result we expect the market in north america to be down in 2016 across asia we expect the market to be mixed depending on the country however overall we expect the region to be up slightly in 2016 assuming more normal pest pressures and weather conditions finally turning to latin america market conditions in argentina mexico and columbia are expected to remain favorable with growth in weed resistant acres and increasing acreage of niche crops we expect the market in brazil to be down again in 2016 channel inventory levels are expected to remain elevated in 2016 however we expect to see an improvement in market fundamentals for sugarcane and cotton 

2014  vs 2013   

revenue of 21738 million  increased approximately one percent versus the prior year period due to higher sales in north america asia and emea offset by a decline in sales in latin america 

sales in latin america of 11207 million decreased five percent due to weak demand conditions in brazil particularly in sugarcane and cotton segments as drought and lower planted area reduced herbicide and insecticide demand this was partially offset by growth in other latin american countries such as argentina and mexico as fmc gained market share sales in north america of 5602 million increased 11 percent primarily driven by strong demand for preemergent herbicides into soybeans and growth from new product introductions into various crop segments revenue in asia of 3436 million increased nine percent reflecting sales growth in australia pakistan korea and china sales in europe middle east and africa emea increased seven percent to 1493 million primarily due to higher herbicide volumes 

fmc agricultural solutions operating profit of 4978 million  decreased approximately eight percent compared to the yearago period reflecting relatively flat sales unfavorable currency impacts increases to sga as well as additional planned rd investments and changes in product mix sga costs were approximately 2 million higher and rd costs were approximately 12 million higher than the prior year period with spending on marketing sales and technology investments 

fmc agricultural solutions pro forma financial results with cheminova 

in the second quarter of 2015 we began to present pro forma combined results for the fmc agricultural solutions segment for 2015 and 2014 we believe that reviewing our operating results by combining actual and pro forma results for the fmc agricultural solutions segment for 2015 and 2014 is more useful in identifying trends in or reaching conclusions regarding the overall operating performance of this segment our pro forma segment information will include adjustments as if the cheminova transaction had occurred on january 1 2014 our pro forma data will also be adjusted for the effects of acquisition accounting but will not include adjustments for costs related to integration activities cost savings or synergies that might be achieved by the combined businesses pro forma amounts to be presented will not necessarily be indicative of what our results would have been had we operated cheminova since january 1 2014 nor our future results we believe that reviewing our operating results by combining actual and pro forma results for the fmc agricultural solutions segment for these interim periods is more useful in identifying trends in or reaching conclusions regarding the overall operating performance of the segment 



 

 



 

 

pro forma combined results  2015 vs 2014 

pro forma combined revenue of 26149 million  decreased approximately 23 percent versus the prior year period favorable pricing impacted revenue by five percent in 2015 compared to the same period in 2014 however the price increases only partially offset the unfavorable impact of foreign currency movements and lower volumes unfavorable currency negatively impacted revenue by 11 percent while volumes impacted revenue by 16 percent most of this decline was experienced in latin america primarily brazil lower volume was also a result of of the deliberate action to reduce third party resales also in brazil these reduced third party sales were partially the result of the sale of our consagro business 

 pro forma combined operating profit of 3838 million  decreased approximately 28 percent compared to the yearago period the significant movement in foreign currency rates compared to last year particularly the real was the main driver of the decline in operating profit as price increases in local currencies were not enough to offset the impact of foreign currency during 2015 the brazilian real depreciated significantly versus the us dollar as a result foreign currency contributed 55 to the decline in year over year pro forma combined operating profit while to a lesser extent lower volumes contributed to a 16 percent impact higher pricing and mix partially offset these declines by 23 percent while lower costs primarily selling general and administrative combined with lower research and development costs improved profits year over year by 19 percent these lower costs were driven by cost savings driven by synergies associated with the cheminova acquisition as well as reduced spending primarily in brazil to address with nearterm market conditions 

during the year we announced several targeted measures to reduce operating costs and reorganize our operations in brazil to align the business with nearterm market conditions these measures included 

 

certain regulatory issues 

in late december 2015 the brazilian national health surveillance agency anvisa issued a technical note recommending banning of carbofuran as a registered pesticide in brazil we disagree with anvisa’s assessment of carbofuran and its regulatory recommendation under the brazilian regulatory process fmc and other interested persons may submit in response to the technical note comments and data for consideration by anvisa as well as the brazilian ministries of agriculture and environment any final decision regarding the continued registration of carbofuran will require concurrence of all three government agencies before the regulatory action is effective we are preparing and will submit information in support of carbofuran for consideration by the government agencies the agencies will issue their decision after consideration of all submitted information we do not expect any material sales impact due to this regulatory review in brazil during 2016 

we intend to defend vigorously all our products in the us eu and other countries as our pesticide products are reviewed in the ordinary course of regulatory programs during 2016 as part of the ongoing cycle of reregistration of our pesticide products around the world 

fmc health and nutrition 



2015  vs 2014 

revenue was 7855 million  a decrease of approximately five percent versus the prioryear period unfavorable foreign currency impacts primarily a weaker euro decreased revenue by approximately five percent with volume price and mix flat in the aggregate compared to prior year volume was slightly positive as lower volume in carrageenan and alginates 

were offset by growth in the mcc family of products in both pharmaceuticals and food end markets pricing for 2015 as compared to 2014 was slightly positive and mix was slightly negative 

segment operating profit of 1947 million  increased approximately four percent versus the year ago period driven by the higher volumes discussed in the preceding paragraph the operating profit impact of improved price and mix and lower manufacturing costs as well as lower selling general and administrative costs partially offset by unfavorable currency volumes and price mix improved operating profit by three percent and two percent respectively while lower manufacturing costs and lower selling general and administrative costs improved profits by two percent and three percent respectively the reduction in these costs was driven by various manufacturing initiatives to improve profitability as well as the benefits of restructuring activities and cost control initiatives finally unfavorable currency negatively impacted results by six percent year over year 

segment revenue for the full year of 2016 is anticipated to be approximately 775 million to 825 million while fullyear segment earnings are expected to be between 198 million and 208 million earnings growth in 2016 is expected to be driven primarily by the benefits of operational improvements along with continued growth in demand for excipients and nutritional products across emerging markets 

2014  vs 2013 

revenue was 8282 million  an increase of approximately nine percent versus the prioryear period revenue from higher volumes in health markets including acquisitions completed in 2013 and higher volumes in overall nutrition markets increased sales by approximately six percent and two percent respectively favorable pricing and mix primarily in nutritionrelated products increased sales by one percent 

segment operating profit of 1879 million  increased by 11 percent versus the prioryear period driven by higher demand for pharmaceutical excipients and texture and stability products in north america these were slightly offset by increased raw material costs particularly seaweed and reduced demand for nutrition products into the chinese beverage market 

fmc lithium 



2015  vs 2014 

revenue of 2381 million  decreased by approximately seven percent versus the prioryear period driven by lower volumes of upstream products and weaker foreign currencies these impacted revenues by seven percent and three percent respectively this was partially offset by favorable pricing which impacted revenue by three percent 

segment operating profit of 230 million  decreased approximately 15 percent versus the year ago period pricing impacted operating profit favorably by approximately 7 million while volume had about an equal negative impact on operating profit foreign currency primarily the argentine peso and the euro impacted operating profit by approximately 9 million this was partially offset by manufacturing cost savings and other miscellaneous items 

demand for lithium remains strong and pricing trends continue to be favorable full year segment revenue is expected to be approximately 240 to 260 million while segment operating profit is expected to be between 33 and 43 million for the full year of 2016 an increase of 65 percent over 2015 at the midpoint of the range 

2014  vs 2013 

lithium revenues of 2567 million  increased 15 percent compared to the prior year higher production volume that allowed for additional sales particularly for energy storage applications contributed a 19 percent increase in revenue this was partially offset by lower pricing which negatively impacted revenues by four percent 

segment operating profit of 272 million  increased approximately 103 percent versus the prior year operating profit was driven by higher volumes the increase was partially offset by unfavorable currency and operating costs associated with our argentine operations 

corporate and other 

corporate expenses are included as a component of the line item “selling general and administrative expenses” except for last in firstout lifo related charges that are included as a component of cost of sales and other services on our consolidated statements of income 

2015  vs 2014 

corporate and other expenses of 624 million  decreased by 90 million from 714 million  in the same period in 2014  the decrease is driven primarily by reduced lifo inventory expense of approximately 7 million the reduced lifo expense was driven by lower inflation rates applied to the inventory subject to lifo calculations excluding the lifo reductions corporate staff expenses and incentive payments were flat year over year 

2014  vs 2013 

corporate and other expenses of 714 million  decreased by 110 million from 824 million  in the same period in 2013 the decrease period over period is primarily due to a decrease of 51 million in employees incentive accruals and a decrease of 46 million in pension service charges reduced pension service charges are primarily driven by the higher discount rate used to calculate the 2014 expense 

interest expense net 

2015  vs 2014 

interest expense net of 801 million  increased by approximately 56 percent compared to 512 million  in 2014 the increase was primarily due to our borrowings under our senior unsecured term loan facility the proceeds of these borrowings were used to finance the acquisition of cheminova as well as to pay costs fees and expenses incurred in connection with the acquisition and the term loan facility see note 12 to our consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k for more information 

2014  vs 2013 

interest expense net for 2014 of 512 million  increased approximately 41 percent as compared to 2013 of 363 million  the increase is primarily driven by the issuance of 400 million in senior notes in november 2013 the 400 million debt issuance with an interest rate of 410 percent was use to fund the acquisition of epax and working capital requirements of our businesses 

corporate special charges income 

restructuring and other charges income 

our restructuring and other charges income are comprised of restructuring assets disposals and other charges income as described below 



2015   

restructuring and asset disposal charges in 2015  totaled 2440 million  included in this were significant charges totaling 1183 million associated with the cheminova restructuring that was implemented as part of the integration of cheminova into our existing fmc agricultural solutions segment the cheminova charges included those associated with the sale of consagro which amounted to 645 million restructuring and asset disposal charges also include charges associated with various activities in health and nutrition of 936 million the majority of these charges are from the loss on sale of our pectin business of 12 million as well as asset write downs associated with the mothballing of our seal sands plant equaling 705 million the seal sands plant in the uk was mothballed in 2015 due to a lack of demand for the omega3 pharmaceuticals products that were manufactured at that facility 

other charges income net in 2015 consisted of environmental charges of 217 million the impacts of the argentina currency devaluation in december of 2015 of 107 million and 205 million of expenses associated with acquired inprocess research and development activity partially offsetting these amounts was a gain of 266 million related to the sale of our remaining ownership interest in a belgianbased pesticide distribution company belchim crop protection nv belchim see note 7 within the consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k for more information 

2014   

restructuring and asset disposal charges in 2014 of 172 million  were primarily associated with our health and nutrition restructuring as well as other miscellaneous exit costs other charges income net in 2014 of 392 million  were primarily related to corporate environmental charges of 437 million and charges of 221 million associated with our fmc agricultural solutions segment which entered into collaboration and license agreements with various thirdparty companies for the purpose of obtaining certain technology and intellectual property rights relating to new compounds still under development offsetting these charges is income from the sale of a portion of our ownership interest in a pesticide distribution company which resulted in a gain on the sale of approximately 266 million 

2013   

restructuring and asset disposal charges in 2013 of 122 million were primarily associated with the announced lithium restructuring other charges income net in 2013 of 383 million primarily related to charges associated with collaboration and license agreements entered into by our fmc agricultural solutions segment for the purpose of obtaining certain technology and intellectual property rights relating to new compounds still under development the rights and technology obtained is referred to as inprocess research and development and in accordance with gaap the amounts paid were expensed as incurred since they were acquired outside of a business combination 

nonoperating pension and postretirement charges income 

nonoperating pension and postretirement charges income are included in “selling general and administrative expenses” on our consolidated statements of income loss 

2015  vs 2014 

the charge for 2015 was 353 million  compared to 105 million  for 2014 the increase in charges was primarily the result of 241 million of higher amortization of net actuarial losses see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k for more information 

2014  vs 2013 

the charge for 2014 was 105 million  compared to 381 million  for 2013 the decrease in charges was primarily attributable to lower amortization of net actuarial losses of 211 million compared to 2013 

business separation costs 

on september 8 2014 we announced that we would no longer proceed with the planned separation as a result of the planned acquisition of cheminova and divestiture of fmc alkali chemicals division as a result there were no business separation charges in 2015 business separation cost for the twelve months ended december 31 2014 represent charges associated with the planned separation activities through december 31 2015 

acquisitionrelated charges 

a detailed description of the acquisition related charges is included in note 19 to the consolidated financial statements included within this form 10k and in the segment results reconciliation above within the  results of operations  section of the managements discussion and analysis 

provision for income taxes 

a significant amount of our earnings is generated by our foreign subsidiaries eg denmark ireland and hong kong which tax earnings at lower rates than the united states federal statutory rate our future effective tax rates may be materially impacted by numerous items including a future change in the composition of earnings from foreign and domestic tax jurisdictions as earnings in foreign jurisdictions are typically taxed at more favorable rates than the united states federal statutory rate accounting for uncertain tax positions business combinations closure of statute of limitations or settlement of tax audits changes in valuation allowance changes in tax law and the potential decision to repatriate certain future foreign earnings on which united states taxes have not been previously accrued 



    

1 tax adjustments in 2015 were primarily associated with valuation allowance adjustments taken in our brazil subsidiaries tax 

adjustments in 2014 were primarily associated with revisions to our tax liabilities associated with prior year tax matters tax adjustments in 2013 were primarily associated with adjustments to us state deferred tax balances established prior to 2013 driven by a change in enacted tax rates and other state related items 

the primary drivers for the fluctuations in the effective tax rate from 2013 to 2015 are provided in the table above excluding the items in the table above the change in the effective tax rates from 2013 to 2015 was primarily due to a shift in earnings mix as it relates to domestic versus foreign income foreign profits are generally taxed at lower rates compared to domestic income see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for additional details related to the provisions for income taxes on continuing operations as well as items that significantly impact our effective tax rate 

discontinued operations net of income taxes 

our discontinued operations represent our discontinued fmc alkali chemicals and fmc peroxygens divisions results as well as adjustments to retained liabilities from other previously discontinued operations the primary liabilities retained include environmental liabilities other postretirement benefit liabilities selfinsurance longterm obligations related to legal proceedings and historical restructuring activities 

2015  vs 2014 

discontinued operations net of income taxes represented a gain of 6764 million  in 2015 compared to a gain of 145 million  in 2014 the change was driven by the divestiture of our discontinued fmc alkali chemicals division which resulted in an after tax gain of  7021 million  in 2015 

2014  vs 2013 

discontinued operations net of income taxes represented a gain of 145 million  for december 31 2014  compared to a loss of 636 million  for 2013 the change is primarily the result of a charges of 1567 million 1221 million aftertax in 2013 associated with our discontinued fmc peroxygens segment a large portion of the 2013 charge was associated with a writedown of the peroxygen assets held for sale to fair value see note 9 within our consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k for more information 

net income attributable to fmc stockholders 

2015  vs 2014 

net income attributable to fmc stockholders increased to 4890 million  from 3075 million  the increase was primarily 

due to the gain from the sale of our discontinued fmc alkali chemicals division offset by reduced agricultural solutions results as well as higher interest expense from higher debt levels needed to fund the cheminova acquisition also significantly impacting results was a higher tax rate in 2015 primarily due to the increases in certain foreign valuation allowances against deferred tax assets 

2014  vs 2013 

net income attributable to fmc stockholders increased to 3075 million  in 2014 from 2939 million  in 2014 the increase was driven by improvements in fmc health and nutrition and fmc lithium segment operating profits lower effective tax rate lower nonoperating pension and postretirement charges and reduced charges associated with discontinued operations mostly offsetting these improvements were costs associated with our previously planned business separation the acquisition of cheminova the divestiture of our fmc alkali chemicals division lower fmc agricultural solutions segment earnings and higher interest expense 

liquidity and capital resources 

cash and cash equivalents at december 31 2015  and 2014  were 786 million  and 1095 million  respectively of the cash and cash equivalents balance at december 31 2015  716 million were held by our foreign subsidiaries our intent is to reinvest permanently the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries and therefore we have not recorded taxes that would be payable if we repatriated these earnings 

at december 31 2015  we had total debt of 21489 million  as compared to 16641 million  at december 31 2014  total debt included 20363 million  and 11389 million  of longterm debt excluding current portions of 15 million  and 20 million  at december 31 2015  and 2014  respectively as of december 31 2015  we are in compliance with all of our debt covenants during 2016 the maximum leverage ratio will step down in accordance with the provisions of the credit facility and the term loan facility additionally we will take a variety of steps if necessary to ensure compliance with the maximum leverage ratio at the applicable measurement dates see note 12 in the consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k for further details 

the increase in longterm debt was due to borrowings of 165 billion  under our senior unsecured term loan facility the proceeds of the borrowing were used to finance the acquisition of cheminova as well as to pay costs fees and expenses incurred in connection with the acquisition and the term loan facility at december 31 2015  9000 million  remained outstanding under the term loan facility as a portion of the net proceeds from the sale of our fmc alkali chemicals division see note 9 in the consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k for further details was used to pay down the initial borrowings the scheduled maturity of the term loan facility is on april 21 2020 the borrowings under the term loan agreement will bear interest at a floating rate which will be a base rate or a eurocurrency rate equal to the london interbank offered rate for the relevant interest period plus in each case an applicable margin as determined in accordance with the provisions of the term loan agreement see note 12 in the consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k for further details 

our shortterm debt consists of foreign borrowings and our commercial paper program foreign borrowings increased from 366 million  at december 31 2014  to 872 million  at december 31 2015  while outstanding commercial paper decreased from 4866 million  to 239 million  at december 31 2014  and 2015  respectively 

our commercial paper program allows us to borrow at rates generally more favorable than those available under our credit facility at december 31 2015  the average effective interest rate on these borrowings was 070 percent  

statement of cash flows 

cash provided required by operating activities was 2771 million  2849 million  and 2583 million  for 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively 

the table below presents the components of net cash provided by operating activities 



 

 34 

 

cash provided required by operating activities of discontinued operations was 806 million  888 million  and 704 million  for 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively 

the increase of cash required by operating activities of discontinued operations in 2015 is due primarily to divestiture costs associated with the sale of our discontinued fmc alkali chemicals business on april 1 2015 additionally 2014 and 2013 include a full year of positive cash flows associated with fmc alkali while 2015 only includes one quarter’s worth due to sale date timing 

the increase in cash provided by operating activities of discontinued operations in 2014 is due to reduced net spending associated with discontinued environmental remediation sites this reduced spending was slightly offset by increased spending associated with our other discontinued reserve which primarily includes retained legal obligations 

cash required by investing activities was 12855 million  1902 million  and 5653 million  for 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively 

the increase in spending during the twelve  months ended december 31 2015  as compared to the same period in 2014  was due to the cheminova acquisition on april 21 2015 for an aggregate purchase price of 12 billion  excluding assumed net debt and hedgedrelated costs totaling 06 billion   

the decrease in spending in 2014 as compared to 2013 was primarily due to the epax acquisition that was completed in the third quarter of 2013 

cash provided required by investing activities of discontinued operations was 16343 million  1549 million  and 879 million  for 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively 

cash provided by investing activities of discontinued operations in 2015 is directly associated with the sale of our discontinued fmc alkali chemicals business these proceeds totaled 164 billion cash provided by investing activities of discontinued operations in 2014 is directly associated with the sale of our discontinued fmc peroxygens business which was completed on february 28 2014 the proceeds from this sale was approximately 200 million also included in these investing activities was capital expenditures of these same discontinued operations for historical periods up to the point of sale the decrease in these capital expenditures in 2015 was due to only one quarter’s worth of alkali capital expenditures in 2015 compared to a full year’s in 2014 the 2013 period included a full year of capital expenditures for both alkali and fmc peroxygens 

cash provided required by financing activities was 167 million  3499 million  and 3712 million  in 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively 

2015  vs 2014   

the change period over period in financing activities is primarily due to the 165 billion  we borrowed under our previously announced senior unsecured term loan facility the proceeds of the borrowing were used to finance the acquisition of cheminova as well as to pay costs fees and expenses incurred in connection with the acquisition and the term loan facility offsetting this borrowing in 2015 was repayments of longterm debt totaling 11 billion primarily due to repayments associated with acquired cheminova long term debt additionally short term debt decreased 547 million in 2015 as compared to 140 million in 2014 additionally in 2014 we paid 987 million to noncontrolling interests primarily to acquire the remaining ownership of our discontinued fmc alkali chemicals division as compared to zero such payments in 2015 

2014  vs 2013   

the change period over period in financing activities is primarily due to significantly lower shortterm borrowings in 2014 compared to borrowings in 2013 in 2013 increased borrowings were approximately 889 million compared to repayments in 2014 of 171 million additionally during the year ended 2013 we paid approximately 367 million in share repurchases and 90 million to noncontrolling interests primarily to acquire additional ownership of our discontinued fmc alkali chemicals division compared to approximately 103 million in combined payments in 2014 

2016 outlook 

in 2016 we expect a continued improvement in cash generation in aggregate we expect cash basis operating income to increase driven by higher earnings and continued working capital improvements we also expect lower restructuring and acquisition related integration spending compared to 2015 in 2015 the majority of our tax payments were associated with the taxes associated with the alkali sale excluding these tax payments we expect higher cash taxes in 2016 as compared to 2015 

other potential liquidity needs 

our cash needs for 2016 outside of the cheminova related integration expenses include operating cash requirements capital expenditures scheduled mandatory payments of longterm debt dividend payments contributions to our pension plans environmental and asset retirement obligation spending and restructuring we plan to meet our liquidity needs through available cash cash generated from operations commercial paper issuances and borrowings under our committed revolving credit facility at december 31 2015  our remaining borrowing capacity under our credit facility was 14224 million  which reflects borrowings under our commercial paper program 

projected 2016 capital expenditures and expenditures related to contract manufacturers are expected to approximate 2015 levels 

projected 2016 spending includes approximately 53 million of net environmental remediation spending this spending does not include expected spending on capital projects relating to environmental control facilities or expected spending for environmental compliance costs which we will include as a component of costs of sales and services in our consolidated statements of income since these amounts are not covered by established reserves capital spending to expand maintain or replace equipment at our production facilities may trigger requirements for upgrading our environmental controls which may increase our spending for environmental controls over the foregoing projections 

our us pension plan assets decreased from 12551 million at december 31 2014  to 12046 million at december 31 2015  due primarily to additional contributions were more than offset by a decline in stock market performance our us pension plan assets comprise approximately 95 percent of our total plan assets with the difference representing plan assets related to foreign pension plans see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements included within this form 10k for details on how we develop our longterm rate of return assumptions we made contributions of 65 million and 50 million in 2015  and 2014  respectively and intend to contribute 35 million in 2016 our contributions in 2014  2015 and our intended contribution in 2016 are all in excess of the minimum requirements our contributions in excess of the minimum requirement are done with the objective of reducing future funding volatility we do not believe that the additional contribution in 2016 will have a material impact on our current and future liquidity needs however volatility of interest rates and equity returns may require greater contributions in the future 

during the year ended december 31 2015  no shares were repurchased under the publicly announced repurchase program at december 31 2015  250 million remained unused under our boardauthorized repurchase program this repurchase program does not include a specific timetable or price targets and may be suspended or terminated at any time shares may be purchased through open market or privately negotiated transactions at the discretion of management based on its evaluation of market conditions and other factors we also reacquire shares from time to time from employees in connections with vesting exercise and forfeiture of awards under our equity compensation plans 

dividends 

on january 21 2016  we paid dividends aggregating 221 million  to our shareholders of record as of december 31 2015  this amount is included in “accrued and other liabilities” on the consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2015  for the years ended december 31 2015  2014  and 2013  we paid 864 million  781 million  and 736 million  in dividends respectively 

commitments 

we provide guarantees to financial institutions on behalf of certain fmc agricultural solutions customers principally brazilian customers for their seasonal borrowing the total of these guarantees was 1142 million  at december 31 2015  these guarantees arise during the ordinary course of business from relationships with customers and nonconsolidated affiliates nonperformance by the guaranteed party triggers the obligation requiring us to make payments to the beneficiary of the guarantee based on our experience these types of guarantees have not had a material effect on our consolidated financial position or on our liquidity our expectation is that future payment or performance related to the nonperformance of others is considered unlikely 

shortterm debt consisted of foreign credit lines and commercial paper at december 31 2015  and 2014  we provide parentcompany guarantees to lending institutions providing credit to our foreign subsidiaries 

we continually evaluate our options for divesting real estate holdings and property plant and equipment that are no longer integral to our operating businesses in connection with our property and asset sales and divestitures we have agreed to indemnify the buyer for certain liabilities including environmental contamination and taxes that occurred prior to the date of sale our indemnification obligations with respect to these liabilities may be indefinite as to duration and may or may not be subject to a 

deductible minimum claim amount or cap as such it is not possible for us to predict the likelihood that a claim will be made or to make a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential loss or range of loss if triggered we may be able to recover certain of the indemnity payments from third parties we have not recorded any specific liabilities for these guarantees 

our total significant committed contracts that we believe will affect cash over the next four years and beyond are as follows 



  

 contingencies 

see note 18 to our consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k 

climate change 

as a global corporate citizen we are concerned about the consequences of climate change and will take prudent and cost effective actions that reduce greenhouse gas emissions to the atmosphere 

fmc is committed to doing its part to address climate change we have set 2025 goals that we will reduce both energy intensity and green house gas ghg intensity for our operations by 15 from the 2013 baseline year in 2015 we divested our alkali chemical business which previously accounted for the majority of fmc’s global ghg emissions the alkali business is not included in the baseline or reduction targets for the 2025 goals 

but even as we take action to control the release of ghgs additional warming is anticipated with effects on agricultural production water availability rising sea levels increasingly severe weather events and a lack of biodiversity we continually assess our manufacturing sites worldwide for these risks and for opportunities to increase energy efficiency we are assessing sea level rise and storm surge at three of our plants that are within 4 meters of sea level to understand timing of potential impacts and response actions that may need to be taken 

in our product portfolio we are improving existing products and developing new platforms and technologies that help reduce impacts of climate change beyond our products fmc recognizes that energy consumption throughout our supply chain can impact climate change and product costs therefore we will actively work with our entire value chain suppliers contractors and customers  to improve their energy efficiencies and to reduce their ghg emissions 

we continue to follow legislative and regulatory developments regarding climate change because the regulation of greenhouse gases depending on their nature and scope could subject some of our manufacturing operations to additional costs or limits on operations in december 2015 195 countries at the united nations climate change conference in paris reached an agreement 

to reduce ghgs it still remains to be seen how and when each of these countries will implement this agreement the united states environmental protection agency’s clean power plan plan is the us’s centerpiece for meeting its paris commitment implementation of the plan recently has been stayed by the united states supreme court pending appeals the plan gives states flexibility to craft their own programs so the impact to fmc of the plan if implemented is not estimable at this time at this point our us facilities are not subject to any state or regional greenhouse gas regulation that limits ghg emissions some of our foreign operations are subject to national or local energy management or climate change regulation such as our plant in denmark that is subject to the eu emissions trading scheme at present that plant’s emissions are below its designated cap 

future ghg regulatory requirements may result in increased costs of energy additional capital costs for emissions control or new equipment andor costs associated with cap and trade or carbon taxes the costs of complying with possible future climate change requirements are difficult to estimate at this time

critical accounting policies 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles us gaap  the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses we have described our accounting policies in note 1 principal accounting policies and related financial information to our consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k we have reviewed these accounting policies identifying those that we believe to be critical to the preparation and understanding of our consolidated financial statements we have reviewed these critical accounting policies with the audit committee of the board of directors critical accounting policies are central to our presentation of results of operations and financial condition in accordance with us gaap and require management to make estimates and judgments on certain matters we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience current conditions and other reasonable factors 

revenue recognition and trade receivables 

we recognize revenue when the earnings process is complete which is generally upon transfer of title this transfer typically occurs either upon shipment to the customer or upon receipt by the customer in all cases we apply the following criteria in recognizing revenue persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred the selling price is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured rebates due to customers are accrued as a reduction of revenue in the same period that the related sales are recorded based on the contract terms 

we periodically enter into prepayment arrangements with customers primarily in our fmc agricultural solutions segment and receive advance payments for product to be delivered in future periods these advance payments are recorded as deferred revenue and classified as “advance payments from customers” on the consolidated balance sheet revenue associated with advance payments is recognized as shipments are made and title ownership and risk of loss pass to the customer 

we record amounts billed for shipping and handling fees as revenue costs incurred for shipping and handling are recorded as costs of sales and services amounts billed for sales and use taxes valueadded taxes and certain excise and other specific transactional taxes imposed on revenueproducing transactions are presented on a net basis and excluded from sales in the consolidated income statements we record a liability until remitted to the respective taxing authority 

trade receivables consist of amounts owed from customer sales and are recorded when revenue is recognized the allowance for trade receivables represents our best estimate of the probable losses associated with potential customer defaults in developing our allowance for trade receivables we use a two stage process which includes calculating a general formula to develop an 

allowance to appropriately address the uncertainty surrounding collection risk of our entire portfolio and specific allowances for customers where the risk of collection has been reasonably identified either due to liquidity constraints or disputes over contractual terms and conditions 

our method of calculating the general formula consists of estimating the recoverability of trade receivables based on historical experience current collection trends and external business factors such as economic factors including regional bankruptcy rates and political factors our analysis of trade receivable collection risk is performed quarterly and the allowance is adjusted accordingly 

we also hold financing receivables that represent longterm customer receivable balances related to pastdue accounts which are not expected to be collected within the current year our policy for the review of the allowance for these receivables is consistent with the discussion in the preceding paragraph above on trade receivables therefore on an ongoing basis we continue to evaluate the credit quality of our financing receivables utilizing aging of receivables collection experience and writeoffs as well as existing economic conditions to determine if an additional allowance is necessary 

environmental obligations and related recoveries 

we provide for environmentalrelated obligations when they are probable and amounts can be reasonably estimated where the available information is sufficient to estimate the amount of liability that estimate has been used where the information is only sufficient to establish a range of probable liability and no point within the range is more likely than any other the lower end of the range has been used 

estimated obligations to remediate sites that involve oversight by the united states environmental protection agency “epa” or similar government agencies are generally accrued no later than when a record of decision “rod” or equivalent is issued or upon completion of a remedial investigationfeasibility study “rifs” or equivalent that is submitted by us to the appropriate government agency or agencies estimates are reviewed quarterly by our environmental remediation management as well as by financial and legal management and if necessary adjusted as additional information becomes available the estimates can change substantially as additional information becomes available regarding the nature or extent of site contamination required remediation methods and other actions by or against governmental agencies or private parties 

our environmental liabilities for continuing and discontinued operations are principally for costs associated with the remediation andor study of sites at which we are alleged to have released hazardous substances into the environment such costs principally include among other items rifs site remediation costs of operation and maintenance of the remediation plan management costs fees to outside law firms and consultants for work related to the environmental effort and future monitoring costs estimated site liabilities are determined based upon existing remediation laws and technologies specific site consultants’ engineering studies or by extrapolating experience with environmental issues at comparable sites 

included in our environmental liabilities are costs for the operation maintenance and monitoring of site remediation plans omm such reserves are based on our best estimates for these omm plans over time we may incur omm costs in excess of these reserves however we are unable to reasonably estimate an amount in excess of our recorded reserves because we cannot reasonably estimate the period for which such omm plans will need to be in place or the future annual cost of such remediation as conditions at these environmental sites change over time such additional omm costs could be significant in total but would be incurred over an extended period of years 

included in the environmental reserve balance other assets balance and disclosure of reasonably possible loss contingencies are amounts from third party insurance policies which we believe are probable of recovery 

provisions for environmental costs are reflected in income net of probable and estimable recoveries from named potentially responsible parties “prps” or other third parties such provisions incorporate inflation and are not discounted to their present values 

in calculating and evaluating the adequacy of our environmental reserves we have taken into account the joint and several liability imposed by comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act “cercla” and the analogous state laws on all prps and have considered the identity and financial condition of the other prps at each site to the extent possible we have also considered the identity and financial condition of other third parties from whom recovery is anticipated as well as the status of our claims against such parties although we are unable to forecast the ultimate contributions of prps and other third parties with absolute certainty the degree of uncertainty with respect to each party is taken into account when determining the environmental reserve by adjusting the reserve to reflect the facts and circumstances on a sitebysite basis our liability includes our best estimate of the costs expected to be paid before the consideration of any potential recoveries from third parties we believe that any recorded recoveries related to prps are realizable in all material respects recoveries are recorded as either an offset in “environmental 

liabilities continuing and discontinued” or as “other assets” in our consolidated balance sheets in accordance with us accounting literature 

see note 10 to our consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k for changes in estimates associated with our environmental obligations 

impairments and valuation of longlived assets 

our longlived assets primarily include property plant and equipment goodwill and intangible assets the assets and liabilities of acquired businesses are measured at their estimated fair values at the dates of acquisition the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired including identified intangibles is recorded as goodwill the determination and allocation of fair value to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is based on various assumptions and valuation methodologies requiring considerable management judgment including estimates based on historical information current market data and future expectations the principal assumptions utilized in our valuation methodologies include revenue growth rates operating margin estimates and discount rates although the estimates were deemed reasonable by management based on information available at the dates of acquisition those estimates are inherently uncertain 

we test for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the net book value of our property plant and equipment may not be recoverable from the estimated undiscounted expected future cash flows expected to result from their use and eventual disposition in cases where the estimated undiscounted expected future cash flows are less than net book value an impairment loss is recognized equal to the amount by which the net book value exceeds the estimated fair value of assets which is based on discounted cash flows at the lowest level determinable the estimated cash flows reflect our assumptions about selling prices volumes costs and market conditions over a reasonable period of time 

we perform an annual impairment test of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets in the third quarter of each year or more frequently whenever an event or change in circumstances occurs that would require reassessment of the recoverability of those assets in performing our evaluation we assess qualitative factors such as overall financial performance of our reporting units anticipated changes in industry and market structure competitive environments planned capacity and cost factors such as raw material prices based on our assessment for 2015  we determined that no impairment charge to our continuing operations was required 

see note 7 to our consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k for charges associated with longlived asset disposal costs and the activity associated with the restructuring reserves 

pension and other postretirement benefits 

we provide qualified and nonqualified defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans as well as postretirement health care and life insurance benefit plans to our employees and retirees the costs benefits and obligations related to these benefits reflect key assumptions related to general economic conditions including interest discount rates healthcare cost trend rates expected rates of return on plan assets and the rates of compensation increase for employees the costs benefits and obligations for these benefit programs are also affected by other assumptions such as average retirement age mortality employee turnover and plan participation to the extent our plans’ actual experience as influenced by changing economic and financial market conditions or by changes to our own plans’ demographics differs from these assumptions the costs and obligations for providing these benefits as well as the plans’ funding requirements could increase or decrease when actual results differ from our assumptions the difference is typically recognized over future periods in addition the unrealized gains and losses related to our pension and postretirement benefit obligations may also affect periodic benefit costs benefits in future periods 

in 2015 the society of actuaries released an updated mortality table projection scale for measurement of retirement program obligations we adopted this updates in measuring the december 31 2015  us defined benefit and post retirement obligations adoption of this new projection scale has decreased the benefit obligations at december 31 2015  by approximately 24 million the effect of this adoption will be amortized into net periodic benefit cost beginning in 2016 

we use several assumptions and statistical methods to determine the asset values used to calculate both the expected rate of return on assets component of pension cost and to calculate our plans’ funding requirements the expected rate of return on plan assets is based on a marketrelated value of assets that recognizes investment gains and losses over a fiveyear period we use an actuarial value of assets to determine our plans’ funding requirements the actuarial value of assets must be within a certain range high or low of the actual market value of assets and is adjusted accordingly 

we select the discount rate used to calculate pension and other postretirement obligations based on a review of available yields on highquality corporate bonds as of the measurement date in selecting a discount rate as of december 31 2015  we placed particular emphasis on a discount rate yieldcurve provided by our actuary this yieldcurve when populated with projected cash flows that represent the expected timing and amount of our plans benefit payments produced an effective discount rate of 450 

percent for our us qualified plan 372 percent for our us nonqualified and 397 percent for our us other postretirement benefit plans 

the discount rates used at our december 31 2015  and 2014  measurement dates for the us qualified plan were 450 percent  and 415 percent  respectively the effect of the change in the discount rate from 415 percent  to 450 percent  at december 31 2015  resulted in a 568 million   decrease to our us qualified pension benefit obligations the effect of the change in the discount rate from 495 percent  at december 31 2013 to 415 percent  at december 31 2014 resulted in a 111 million  increase to the 2015  us qualified pension expense 

the change in discount rate from 415 percent at december 31 2014 to 450 percent at december 31 2015 was attributable to an increase in yields on high quality corporate bonds with cash flows matching the timing and amount of our expected future benefit payments between the 2014 and 2015 measurement dates using the december 31 2014 yield curve our us qualified plan cash flows produced a single weightedaverage discount rate of approximately 415 percent matching our us qualified plan cash flows to a similarly constructed curve reflecting highyielding bonds available as of december 31 2015 resulted in a single weightedaverage discount rate of approximately 450 percent 

historically we estimated the service cost and interest cost components of expense using a single weightedaverage discount rate derived from the yield curve used to measure the benefit obligation at the beginning of the period on december 31 2015 we changed the method we used to estimate the service cost and interest cost components of our net periodic benefit cost for our us defined benefit pension plans we have elected to use a full yield curve approach in the estimation of these components of benefit cost by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows we have made this change to improve the correlation between projected benefit cash flows and the corresponding yield curve spot rates and to provide a more precise measurement of service cost and interest cost the change does not affect the measurement of our total benefit obligations we have accounted for this change as a change in estimate prospectively starting in 2016 

in developing the assumption for the longterm rate of return on assets for our us plan we take into consideration the technical analysis performed by our outside actuaries including historical market returns information on the assumption for longterm real returns by asset class inflation assumptions and expectations for standard deviation related to these best estimates we also consider the historical performance of our own plan’s trust which has earned a compound annual rate of return of approximately 87 percent  over the last 20 years which is in excess of comparable market indices for the same period as well as other factors which are discussed in note 13 to our consolidated financial statements in this form 10k our longterm rate of return for the fiscal year ended december 31 2015  was 725 percent  and for years ending december 31 2014 and 2013 was 775 percent  

for the sensitivity of our pension costs to incremental changes in assumptions see our discussion below 

sensitivity analysis related to key pension and postretirement benefit assumptions 

a onehalf percent increase in the assumed discount rate would have decreased pension and other postretirement benefit obligations by 768 million and 896 million at december 31 2015  and 2014  respectively and decreased pension and other postretirement benefit costs by 64 million 69 million and 58 million for 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively a onehalf percent decrease in the assumed discount rate would have increased pension and other postretirement benefit obligations by 853 million and 994 million at december 31 2015  and 2014  respectively and increased pension and other postretirement benefit cost by 65 million 75 million and 62 million for 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively 

a onehalf percent increase in the assumed expected longterm rate of return on plan assets would have decreased pension costs by 58 million 52 million and 48 million for 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively a onehalf percent decrease in the assumed longterm rate of return on plan assets would have increased pension costs by 58 million 52 million and 48 million for 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively 

further details on our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and net periodic benefit costs benefits are found in note 13 to our consolidated financial statements in this form 10k 

income taxes 

we have recorded a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets in certain foreign jurisdictions to the amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized in assessing the need for this allowance we have considered a number of factors including future taxable income the jurisdictions in which such income is earned and our ongoing tax planning strategies in the event that we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period such determination was made similarly should we conclude that we would be able to realize certain deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase income in the period such determination was made 

additionally we file income tax returns in the us federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions the income tax returns for fmc entities taxable in the us and significant foreign jurisdictions are open for examination and adjustment we assess our income tax positions and record a liability for all years open to examination based upon our evaluation of the facts circumstances and information available at the reporting date for those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained we have recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information we adjust these liabilities if necessary upon the completion of tax audits or changes in tax law

 item 7a 

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend our earnings cash flows and financial position are exposed to market risks relating to fluctuations in commodity prices interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates our policy is to minimize exposure to our cash flow over time caused by changes in commodity interest and currency exchange rates to accomplish this we have implemented a controlled program of risk management consisting of appropriate derivative contracts entered into with major financial institutions 

the analysis below presents the sensitivity of the market value of our financial instruments to selected changes in market rates and prices the range of changes chosen reflects our view of changes that are reasonably possible over a oneyear period market value estimates are based on the present value of projected future cash flows considering the market rates and prices chosen 

at december 31 2015  our net financial instrument position was a net liability of 134 million  compared to a net liability of 925 million  at december 31 2014  the change in the net financial instrument position was primarily due to lower unrealized losses in our commodity and foreign exchange portfolios 

since our risk management programs are generally highly effective the potential loss in value for each risk management portfolio described below would be largely offset by changes in the value of the underlying exposure 

commodity price risk 

energy costs are diversified among coal electricity and natural gas we attempt to mitigate our exposure to increasing energy costs by hedging the cost of future deliveries of natural gas and by entering into fixedprice contracts for the purchase of coal and fuel oil to analyze the effect of changing energy prices we have performed a sensitivity analysis in which we assume an instantaneous 10 percent change in energy market prices from their levels at december 31 2015  and 2014  with all other variables including interest rates held constant 



our fmc agricultural solutions segment enters into contracts with certain customers in brazil to exchange our products for future physical delivery of soybeans to mitigate the price risk associated with these barter contracts we enter into offsetting derivatives to hedge our exposure as of december 31 2015  and 2014  our net financial instrument position was immaterial 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

the primary currencies for which we have exchange rate exposure are the us dollar versus the euro the chinese yuan the brazilian real and the argentine peso foreign currency debt and foreign exchange forward contracts are used in countries where we do business thereby reducing our net asset exposure foreign exchange forward contracts are also used to hedge firm and highly anticipated foreign currency cash flows 

to analyze the effects of changing foreign currency rates we have performed a sensitivity analysis in which we assume an instantaneous 10 percent change in the foreign currency exchange rates from their levels at december 31 2015  and 2014  with all other variables including interest rates held constant 



 

 hedge costs in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k 

interest rate risk 

one of the strategies that we can use to manage interest rate exposure is to enter into interest rate swap agreements in these agreements we agree to exchange at specified intervals the difference between fixed and variable interest amounts calculated on an agreedupon notional principal amount as of december 31 2015  and 2014  we had no interest rate swap agreements 

our debt portfolio at december 31 2015  is composed of 56 percent fixedrate debt and 44 percent variablerate debt the variablerate component of our debt portfolio principally consists of borrowings under our term loan facility commercial paper program credit facility variablerate industrial and pollution control revenue bonds and amounts outstanding under foreign subsidiary credit lines changes in interest rates affect different portions of our variablerate debt portfolio in different ways 

based on the variablerate debt in our debt portfolio at december 31 2015  a one percentage point increase in interest rates would have increased gross interest expense by 96 million and a one percentage point decrease in interest rates would have decreased gross interest expense by 33 million for the year ended december 31 2015

discontinued operations presentation  fmc alkali chemicals 

in september 2014 we announced our decision to pursue the sale of our fmc alkali chemicals division “acd” on february 3 2015 we signed a definitive agreement to sell acd to a wholly owned subsidiary of tronox limited and we expect the sale to be completed in early 2015 subject to customary regulatory approvals and closing conditions 

we have concluded as a result of the signing of the definitive agreement that acd has met the criteria to be an asset held for sale and therefore will be presented as a discontinued operation in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap in future reporting periods in accordance with gaap the reclassification of acd from a continuing operation to a discontinued operation occurs in the period for which the discontinued operation criteria has been met therefore as of december 31 2014 acd is accounted for as a continuing operation of fmc and throughout this form 10k acd is included in the results of continuing operations 

beginning with the first quarter 2015 reporting on form 10q the results of operations of acd will be reclassified to reflect the business as a discontinued operation for all periods presented and the assets and liabilities of the business will be reclassified as held for sale our fmc minerals segment which previously included our fmc alkali chemicals and fmc lithium divisions will be renamed fmc lithium

fmc minerals  to be renamed fmc lithium 

                  

overview 

our fmc minerals segment which in 2014 included the results of our fmc alkali chemicals division represents 26 percent  of our 2014  consolidated revenues and during fy2014 participated in the alkali chemicals and lithium products markets 

products and markets 

  

effective february 2015 our fmc minerals segment has been renamed fmc lithium as the fmc alkali chemicals division has been classified as a discontinued operation as fmc alkali chemicals is under contract to be sold and the sale is expected to be completed in early 2015 the following discussion pertains only to the fmc lithium business 

    lithium 

lithium is a business based on both inorganic and organic lithium chemistries while lithium is sold into a variety of end markets we have focused our strategy on the energy storage polymer and pharmaceutical markets and other industrial markets 

the electrochemical properties of lithium make it an ideal material for portable energy storage in high performance applications including smart phones tablets laptop computers military devices and aerospace and other nextgeneration energy storage technologies lithium is a critical element in advanced batteries for use in hybrid electric plugin hybrids and allelectric vehicles 

organolithium products are highly valued in the polymer market as initiators in the production of synthetic rubbers and elastomers organolithiums are also sold to fine chemical and pharmaceutical customers who use lithiums unique chemical properties to synthesize high valueadded products 

industry overview 

fmc lithium serves a diverse group of markets from economically sensitive industrial sectors to technologyintensive specialty markets our product offerings are primarily inorganic and generally have few costeffective substitutes a major growth driver for lithium in the future will be the rate of adoption of electric and hybrid electric batteries in automobiles 

the markets for lithium chemicals are global with significant growth occurring outside the us in japan china and south korea driven by the development and manufacture of lithium ion batteries there are three key producers of lithium compounds fmc albemarle corporation previously rockwood holdings inc and sociedad química y minera de chile sa spodumene ore is also converted to lithium compounds by a large number of chinese producers we expect a few new producers may add primary inorganics capacity to the global lithium supply in the future fmc and albemarle corporation are the primary producers of lithium specialties 

source and availability of raw materials 

our raw material requirements vary by business segment and primarily include processed chemicals seaweed specialty wood pulps mineralrelated natural resources lithium brines and energy sources such as gas coal oil and electricity during 2014 we encountered no significant difficulties in obtaining adequate supplies of our raw materials 

raw materials used by fmc agricultural solutions primarily processed chemicals are obtained from a variety of suppliers worldwide raw materials used by fmc health and nutrition include various types of seaweed specialty pulps natural colorant raw materials and fish oils that are all sourced on a global basis and purchased from selected global producerssuppliers we extract ores used in fmc lithium’s manufacturing processes from lithium brines in argentina 

patents 

we own a number of us and foreign patents trademarks and licenses that are cumulatively important to our business we do not believe that the loss of any individual or combination of related patents trademarks or licenses would have a material adverse effect on the overall business of fmc the duration of our patents depends on their respective jurisdictions 

seasonality 

the seasonal nature of the crop protection market and the geographic spread of the fmc agricultural solutions business can result in significant variations in quarterly earnings among geographic locations fmc agricultural solutions products sold into the northern hemisphere north america europe and parts of asia serve seasonal agricultural markets from march through september generally resulting in earnings in the first second and third quarters markets in the southern hemisphere latin america and parts of the asia pacific region including australia are served from july through february generally resulting in earnings in the third fourth and first quarters the remainder of our business is generally not subject to significant seasonal fluctuations

we encounter substantial competition in each of our three business segments we market our products through our own sales organization and through alliance partners independent distributors and sales representatives the number of our principal competitors varies from segment to segment in general we compete by providing advanced technology high product quality and reliability and quality customer and technical service and by operating in a costefficient manner 

our fmc agricultural solutions segment competes primarily in the global chemical crop protection market for insecticides herbicides and fungicides industry products include crop protection chemicals and for certain major competitors genetically engineered crop biotechnology products competition from generic agrochemical producers is significant as a number of key product patents held industrywide have expired in the last decade in general we compete as an innovator by focusing on product development including novel formulations proprietary mixes and advanced delivery systems and by acquiring or licensing mostly proprietary chemistries or technologies that complement our product and geographic focus we also differentiate ourselves by our global costcompetitiveness via our manufacturing strategies establishing effective product stewardship programs and developing strategic alliances that strengthen market access in key countries and regions 

our fmc health and nutrition segment has significant positions in markets that include alginate carrageenan and microcrystalline cellulose we compete with both direct suppliers of cellulose and seaweed extract as well as suppliers of other hydrocolloids which may provide similar functionality in specific applications in microcrystalline cellulose competitors are typically smaller than we are while in seaweed extracts carrageenan and alginates and omega3 fish oils we compete with other broadbased chemical companies 

the toberenamed fmc lithium segment sells lithiumbased products worldwide we and our two most significant competitors in lithium extract the element from naturally occurring lithiumrich brines located in the andes mountains of argentina and chile which are believed to be the world’s most significant and lowest cost sources of lithium 

research and development expense 

we perform research and development in all of our segments with the majority of our efforts focused in the fmc agricultural solutions segment the development efforts in the fmc agricultural solutions segment focus on developing environmentally sound solutions and new product formulations that costeffectively increase farmers’ yields and provide alternatives to existing and new chemistries our research and development expenses in the last three years are set forth below

among the factors that could have an impact on our ability to achieve operating results and meet our other goals are 

industry risks 

pricing and volumes in our markets are sensitive to a number of industry specific and global issues and events including 

 12 

pesticides increased generic presence in agricultural chemical markets has been driven by the number of significant product patents and product data protections that have expired in the last decade and this trend is expected to continue 

 13 

economic embargoes imposed by the united states or any of the foreign countries in which we do business changes in laws taxation and regulations and the interpretation and application of these laws taxes and regulations restrictions imposed by foreign governments through exchange controls or taxation policy nationalization or expropriation of property undeveloped property rights and legal systems or political instability other governmental actions and other external factors over which we have no control economic and political conditions within foreign jurisdictions or strained relations between countries can cause fluctuations in demand price volatility supply disruptions or loss of property in argentina continued inflation and tightening of foreign exchange controls along with deteriorating economic and financial conditions could adversely affect our business

legal proceedings 

tableend 

like hundreds of other industrial companies we have been named as one of many defendants in asbestosrelated personal injury litigation most of these cases allege personal injury or death resulting from exposure to asbestos in premises of fmc or to asbestoscontaining components installed in machinery or equipment manufactured or sold by discontinued operations the machinery and equipment businesses we owned or operated did not fabricate the asbestoscontaining component parts at issue in the litigation 

and to this day neither the us occupational safety and health administration nor the environmental protection agency has banned the use of these components further the asbestoscontaining parts for this machinery and equipment were accessible only at the time of infrequent repair and maintenance a few jurisdictions have permitted claims to proceed against equipment manufacturers relating to insulation installed by other companies on such machinery and equipment we believe that overall the claims against fmc are without merit 

as of december 31 2014 there were approximately 11000 premises and product asbestos claims pending against fmc in several jurisdictions since the 1980s approximately 106000 asbestos claims against fmc have been discharged the overwhelming majority of which have been dismissed without any payment to the claimant since the 1980s settlements by us with claimants have totaled approximately 636 million 

we intend to continue managing these asbestosrelated cases in accordance with our historical experience we have established a reserve for this litigation within our discontinued operations and believe that any exposure of a loss in excess of the established reserve cannot be reasonably estimated our experience has been that the overall trends in terms of the rate of filing of asbestosrelated claims with respect to all potential defendants has changed over time and that filing rates as to us in particular have varied significantly over the last several years we are a peripheral defendant  that is we have never manufactured asbestos or asbestoscontaining components as a result claim filing rates against us have yet to form a predictable pattern and we are unable to project a reasonably accurate future filing rate and thus we are presently unable to reasonably estimate our asbestos liability with respect to claims that may be filed in the future

information about how each of these items relates to our businesses at the segment level and results by segment are discussed below and in note 19 to our consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k 

fmc agricultural solutions 

  



2014 vs 2013 

revenue of 21738 million  increased approximately one percent versus the prior year period due to higher sales in north america asia and emea offset by a decline in sales in latin america 

sales in latin america of 11207 million decreased five percent due to weak demand conditions in brazil particularly in sugarcane and cotton segments as drought and lower planted area reduced herbicide and insecticide demand this was partially offset by growth in other latin american countries such as argentina and mexico as fmc gained market share sales in north america of 5602 million increased 11 percent primarily driven by strong demand for preemergent herbicides into soybeans and growth from new product introductions into various crop segments revenue in asia of 3436 million increased nine percent reflecting sales growth in australia pakistan korea and china sales in europe middle east and africa emea increased seven percent to 1493 million primarily due to higher herbicide volumes 

fmc agricultural solutions operating profit of 4978 million  decreased approximately eight percent compared to the yearago period reflecting relatively flat sales unfavorable currency impacts increases to sga as well as additional planned rd investments and changes in product mix sga costs were approximately 2 million higher and rd costs were approximately 12 million higher than the prior year period with spending on marketing sales and technology investments 

in 2015 we expect that earnings contributions from the cheminova acquisition the continued spread of weed resistance in north and latin america and market share gains in asia and emea will drive fullyear segment earnings 15 to 30 percent higher than 2014 

2013 vs 2012 

revenue of 21457 million  increased approximately 22 percent versus the prior year period due to sales growth in north america latin america and asia partially offset by declines in emea 

sales in latin america of 11847 million increased 23 percent driven by brazil volume growth in herbicide and insecticide sales for soybeans including growth from new and recently launched products sales in north america of 5061 million increased 37 percent driven by strong demand for preemergent herbicides and atplant insecticides as well as growth from new product introductions revenue in asia of 3154 million increased 14 percent reflecting sales growth in china indonesia australia and a number of other key countries emea declined 12 percent to 1395 million primarily due to unfavorable weather conditions and lower insecticide sales 

fmc agricultural solutions operating profit of 5390 million  increased approximately 19 percent compared to the yearago period reflecting the sales growth described in the preceding paragraph a favorable geographic mix and selected price increases selling general and administrative costs were approximately 9 million or three percent higher compared to the prior year due to increased spending on growth initiatives and higher peoplerelated costs to support the higher sales research and development costs also increased period over period by approximately 5 million due to increased spending associated with various innovation projects 

certain regulatory issues 

we intend to defend vigorously all our products in the us eu and other countries as our pesticide products are reviewed in the ordinary course of regulatory programs during 2015 as part of the ongoing cycle of reregistration of our pesticide products around the world 

fmc health and nutrition 



2014 vs 2013 

revenue was 8282 million  an increase of approximately nine percent versus the prioryear period revenue from higher volumes in health markets including acquisitions completed in 2013 and higher volumes in overall nutrition markets increased sales by approximately six percent and two percent respectively favorable pricing and mix primarily in nutritionrelated products increased sales by one percent 

segment operating profit of 1879 million  increased by 11 percent versus the prioryear period driven by higher demand for pharmaceutical excipients and texture and stability products in north america these were slightly offset by increased raw material costs particularly seaweed and reduced demand for nutrition products into the chinese beverage market 

for 2015 fullyear segment earnings are expected to increase by midsingle digit percent earnings growth is expected to come from moderate demand recovery in the chinese beverage market continued demand for pharmaceutical products particularly excipients and benefits from operational improvements 

2013 vs 2012 

revenue was 7620 million  an increase of approximately 12 percent versus the prioryear period this increase was due to volume increases of three percent in core product lines revenue from acquisitions which increased sales by six percent favorable pricing and foreign currency impacts which increased sales by two and one percent respectively 

segment operating profit of 1695 million  increased by five percent versus the prior year period as revenue growth was partially offset by acquisition integration costs higher raw material costs and costs associated with our manufacturing excellence program selling general and administrative costs also increased approximately 6 million compared to the prior year due to the addition of the epax business within the segment 

fmc minerals 



2014 vs 2013 

revenue of 10357 million  increased by seven percent over the prior year volume gains in alkali and lithium along with improvements in soda ash pricing contributed to the higher revenue 

alkali revenues of 7790 million  increased four percent  over the prior year higher average prices and volume increases each contributed a 2 percent increase in revenue respectively the most notable price increases were realized in asian export markets 

lithium revenues of 2567 million  increased 15 percent  compared to the prior year higher production volume that allowed for additional sales particularly for energy storage applications contributed a 19 percent increase in revenue partially offset by lower pricing which negatively impacted revenues by four percent 

segment operating profit of 1667 million  increased approximately 30 percent versus the prior year operating profit was driven by higher volumes improved pricing and lower operating costs in alkali as well as higher volumes in lithium  these increases were partially offset by unfavorable currency and operating costs associated with lithium’s argentine operations and higher energy costs in alkali 

for 2015 reported segment earnings which will include only our fmc lithium business are expected to be within the range of 15 to 25 million we anticipate higher prices for both lithium hydroxide and carbonate driven by increased 

demand for energy storage applications will be offset by reduced sourcing of lithium carbonate from third parties and higher operating costs in argentina 

2013 vs 2012 

revenue of 9700 million  was essentially flat period over period volume gains of three percent driven by alkali sales were offset by unfavorable pricing year over year unfavorable pricing was primarily driven by alkali slightly offset by favorable pricing in lithium 

alkali revenues of 7470 million  increased two percent over the prior year due to volume gains of six percent which were partially offset by reduced pricing of four percent 

lithium revenues of 2230 million  decreased four percent compared to the prior year due to unfavorable sales mix production and sales volumes on a lithium carbonate equivalent basis were relatively flat year over year as lower production in argentina due to operational issues was offset by higher third party product purchases 

segment operating profit of 1283 million  decreased approximately 25 percent versus the prior year the decrease was primarily due to lower average export pricing in soda ash additionally production factors such as poor geological conditions at the alkali mine as well as poor weather at the lithium mine and unfavorable currency in lithium impacted the results 

corporate and other 

corporate expenses are included as a component of the line item “selling general and administrative expenses” except for last in firstout lifo related charges that are included as a component of cost of sales and other services on our consolidated statements of income 

2014 vs 2013 

corporate and other expenses of 723 million  decreased by 104 million from 827 million  in the same period in 2013 the decrease period over period is primarily due to a decrease of 51 million in employees incentive accruals and a decrease of 46 million in pension service charges reduced pension service charges are primarily driven by the higher discount rate utilized to calculate the 2014 expense 

2013 vs 2012 

corporate and other expenses of 827 million  increased by 41 million from 786 million  in the same period in 2012 the increase period over period is due to increased costs of approximately 4 million primarily representing costs associated with the transformation of our finance organization this transformation is similar to past initiatives to improve our organization 

interest expense net 

2014 vs 2013 

interest expense net for 2014 of 595 million  increased approximately 41 percent as compared to 2013 of 422 million  the increase is primarily driven by the issuance of 400 million in senior notes in november 2013 the 400 million debt issuance with an interest rate of 410 percent was utilized to fund the acquisition of epax and to fund working capital requirements of our businesses 

2013 vs 2012 

interest expense net for 2013 of 422 million  increased approximately four percent compared to 2012 of 407 million  the increase was primarily due to higher overall debt levels driven by funding requirements for the acquisition of epax and our share repurchases during 2013 

corporate special charges income 

restructuring and other charges income 

our restructuring and other charges income are comprised of restructuring assets disposals and other charges income as described below 



restructuring and asset disposal charges in 2014 of 173 million  were primarily associated with our health and nutrition restructuring as well as other miscellaneous exit costs other charges income net in 2014 of 392 million  were primarily related to corporate environmental charges of 437 million and charges of 221 million associated with our fmc agricultural solutions segment which entered into collaboration and license agreements with various thirdparty companies for the purpose of obtaining certain technology and intellectual property rights relating to new compounds still under development offsetting these charges is income from the sale of a portion of our ownership interest in a pesticide distribution company which resulted in a gain on the sale of approximately 266 million  

restructuring and asset disposal charges in 2013 of 96 million were primarily associated with the announced lithium restructuring other charges income net in 2013 of 383 million primarily related to charges associated with collaboration and license agreements entered into by our fmc agricultural solutions segment for the purpose of obtaining certain technology and intellectual property rights relating to new compounds still under development the rights and technology obtained is referred to as inprocess research and development and in accordance with gaap the amounts paid were expensed as incurred since they were acquired outside of a business combination 

restructuring and asset disposal charges in 2012 primarily included charges of 133 million associated with the lithium restructuring other charges income net in 2012 were primarily due to charges of 58 million for environmental remediation at operating sites and a 44 million charge related to our fmc agricultural solutions segment for the purpose of acquiring certain rights to a fungicide still under development 

the activity of the restructuring charges listed above are also included within note 7 to our consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k we believe the restructuring plans implemented are on schedule and the benefits and savings either have been or will be achieved 

nonoperating pension and postretirement charges income 

nonoperating pension and postretirement charges income are included in “selling general and administrative expenses” on our consolidated statements of income 

2014 vs 2013 

the charge for 2014 was 105 million  compared to 381 million  for 2013 the decrease in charges was primarily attributable to lower amortization of net actuarial losses of 211 million compared to 2013 

2013 vs 2012 

the charge for 2013 was 381 million  compared to 349 million  for 2012 the increase in charges were primarily the result of a settlement charge of 74 million partially offset by lower interest costs of 37 million the settlement charge was associated with the acceleration of previously deferred actuarial losses triggered by the lumpsum payout to former executives in 2013 

business separation costs 

on september 8 2014 we announced that we would no longer proceed with the planned separation of fmc into two distinct public entities at that time we announced the acquisition of cheminova and divestiture of our fmc alkali chemicals division 

acquisitionrelated charges 

a detailed description of the acquisitiondivestiture related charges is included in note 19 to the consolidated financial statements included within this form 10k under the segment results reconciliation above within the results of operations  section of the managements discussion and analysis 

provision for income taxes 



    

1 tax adjustments in 2014 were primarily associated with revisions to our tax liabilities associated with prior year tax matters tax 

adjustments in 2013 were primarily associated with adjustments to us state deferred tax balances 

established prior to 2013 driven by a change in enacted tax rates and other state related items tax adjustments in 2012 

were primarily driven by a reduction in our valuation allowance related to state net operating losses expected to be recoverable in future years 

the primary drivers for the fluctuations in the effective effective tax rate from 2012 to 2014 are provided in the table above excluding the items in the table above the decrease in the effective tax rates from 2012 to 2014 was primarily due to a shift in earnings mix as it relates to domestic versus foreign income foreign profits are generally taxed at lower rates compared to domestic income see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for additional details related to the provisions for income taxes on continuing operations as well as items that significantly impact our effective tax rate 

discontinued operations net of income taxes 

our discontinued operations represent our discontinued fmc peroxygens segment results as well as adjustments to retained liabilities from previous discontinued operations the primary liabilities retained include environmental liabilities other postretirement benefit liabilities selfinsurance longterm obligations related to legal proceedings and historical restructuring activities 

2014 vs 2013 

discontinued operations net of income taxes represented a loss of 894 million  for december 31 2014 compared to a loss of 1593 million  for 2013 the loss in 2014 was driven by provisions for environmental liabilities of 367 million  and legal reserves of 143 million  and the final divestiture charge on the sale of our fmc peroxygens business of 344 million  the loss in 2014 was less than the loss in 2013 due to the charge of 1567 million 1221 million aftertax in 2013 associated with our discontinued fmc peroxygens segment a large portion of the 2013 charge was associated with a write down of the fmc peroxygens segment assets held for sale to fair value see note 9 within our consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k for more information 

2013 vs 2012 

discontinued operations net of income taxes totaled a charge of 1593 million  for 2013 compared to a charge of 275 million  2013 the increase was a result of a charge of 1567 million 1221 million aftertax associated with our discontinued fmc peroxygens segment the charge was primarily associated with a write down of the fmc peroxygens segment assets held for sale to fair value 

net income attributable to fmc stockholders 

2014 vs 2013 

net income attributable to fmc stockholders increased to 3075 million  in 2014 from 2939 million  in 2013 the increase was driven by improvements in fmc health and nutrition and fmc minerals segment operating profits lower effective tax rate lower nonoperating pension and postretirement charges and reduced charges associated with discontinued operations mostly offsetting these improvements were costs associated with our previously planned 

business separation the acquisition of cheminova the divestiture of our fmc alkali chemicals division lower fmc agricultural solutions segment earnings and higher interest expense 

2013 vs 2012 

net income attributable to fmc stockholders decreased to 2939 million  in 2013 from 4162 million  in 2012 this fluctuation year over year is described in more detail above however the primary driver is the 1221 million aftertax charge associated with our discontinued fmc peroxygens business 

liquidity and capital resources 

cash and cash equivalents at december 31 2014  and 2013  were 1095 million  and 1232 million  respectively of the cash and cash equivalents balance at december 31 2014  848 million were held by our foreign subsidiaries our intent is to reinvest permanently the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries and therefore we have not recorded taxes that would be payable if we repatriated these earnings

revolving loans under the revolving credit facility will bear interest at a floating rate which will be a base rate or a eurocurrency rate equal to the london interbank offered rate for the relevant interest period plus in each case an applicable margin as determined in accordance with the provisions of the revolving credit agreement the base rate will be the highest of the rate of interest announced publicly by citibank na in new york new york from time to time as its “base rate” the federal funds effective rate plus 12 of 1 percent and the eurocurrency rate for a onemonth period plus 1 percent we are also required to pay a facility fee on the average daily amount whether used or unused at a rate per annum equal to an applicable percentage in effect from time to time for the facility fee as determined in accordance with the provisions of the revolving credit agreement the initial facility fee is 0125 percent per annum the applicable margin and the facility fee are subject to adjustment as provided in the revolving credit agreement 

the revolving credit agreement contains customary financial and other covenants including a maximum leverage ratio and minimum interest coverage ratio the financial covenant levels have been amended in order to permit the debt incurred under the contemplated term loan facility discussed above along with certain other changes to permit the acquisition and the divestiture of our fmc alkali chemicals division 

at december 31 2014  we had total debt of 16786 million  as compared to 18519 million  at december 31 2013  this included 11534 million  and 11541 million  of longterm debt excluding current portions of 20 million  and 347 million  at december 31 2014  and 2013  respectively our shortterm debt consists of foreign borrowings and our commercial paper program foreign borrowings increased from 71 million  at december 31 2013  to 366 million  at december 31 2014  while outstanding commercial paper decreased from 6560 million  to 4866 million  at december 31 2013  and 2014 respectively our commercial paper program allows us to borrow at rates generally more favorable than those available under our credit facility at december 31 2014 the average effective interest rate on these borrowings was 048  

statement of cash flows 

cash provided by operating activities was 4189 million  3788 million  and 4223 million  for 2014  2013  and 2012  respectively 

the table below presents the components of net cash provided by operating activities 



 

 33 

 

cash required by operating activities of discontinued operations was 452 million  501 million  and 626 million  for 2014  2013  and 2012  respectively 

the decrease in cash required by operating activities of discontinued operations in 2014 is due to reduced net spending associated with discontinued environmental remediation sites this reduced spending was slightly offset by increased spending associated with our other discontinued reserve which primarily includes retained legal obligations 

the decrease from 2012 to 2013 is primarily due to reduced spending associated with our discontinued restructuring activities 

cash required by investing activities was 2337 million  6285 million  and 3636 million  for 2014  2013  and 2012  respectively 

the decrease in spending in 2014 as compared to 2013 was primarily due to the epax acquisition that was completed in third quarter 2013 

the increase in spending during the year ended december 31 2013 as compared to the same period in 2012 was primarily due to the epax acquisition completed in the third quarter of 2013 and higher spending on capital expenditures compared to 2012 

cash provided required by investing activities of discontinued operations was 1985 million  247 million   and 300 million  for 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively 

cash provided by investing activities of discontinued operations in 2014 is directly associated with the sale of our fmc peroxygens business which was completed on february 28 2014 cash required by investing activities of discontinued operations in 2013 and 2012 represents capital expenditures for our discontinued fmc peroxygens business for more information see note 9 in our consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k 

cash provided required by financing activities was 3500 million  3712 million  and 482 million  in 2014  2013  and 2012  respectively 

2014 vs 2013 

the change period over period in financing activities is primarily due to significantly less shortterm borrowings in 2014 compared to borrowings in 2013 in 2013 increased borrowings were approximately 889 million compared to repayments in 2014 of 171 million additionally during the year ended 2013 we paid approximately 367 million in share repurchases and 90 million to noncontrolling interests primarily to acquire additional ownership in our fmc alkali chemicals division compared to approximately 103 million in combined payments in 2014 

2013 vs 2012 

the change in financing activities is primarily due to borrowings under our commercial paper cp program which was implemented during the second quarter of 2013 and the issuance of 400 million in senior notes in the fourth quarter of 2013 these borrowings were partially offset by repayments of borrowings under our committed credit facility the acquisition of an additional 625 ownership interest in our consolidated entity fmc wyoming and higher dividends paid and share repurchases compared to 2012 

other potential liquidity needs 

see the preceding liquidity and capital resources  section for the discussion of the financing facilities associated with the cheminova acquisition along with the signed definitive agreement to sell the fmc alkali chemicals division for 164 billion 

our cash needs for 2015 outside of the cheminova acquisition and related integration expenses include operating cash requirements capital expenditures scheduled mandatory payments of longterm debt dividend payments share repurchases contributions to our pension plans environmental and asset retirement obligation spending and restructuring we plan to meet our liquidity needs through available cash cash generated from operations commercial paper issuances and borrowings under our committed revolving credit facility at december 31 2014  our remaining borrowing capacity under our credit facility was 9240 million  which reflects borrowings under our commercial paper program 

projected 2015 capital expenditures as well as expenditures related to contract manufacturers are expected to be lower than 2014 levels this excludes spending on the fmc alkali chemicals division and includes expected spending for cheminova subsequent to the acquisition 

projected 2015 spending includes approximately 65 million of net environmental remediation spending this spending does not include expected spending on capital projects relating to environmental control facilities or expected spending for environmental compliance costs which we will include as a component of costs of sales and services in our consolidated statements of income since these amounts are not covered by established reserves capital spending to expand maintain or replace equipment at our production facilities may trigger requirements for upgrading our environmental controls which may increase our spending for environmental controls over the foregoing projections 

our us pension plan assets increased from 11929 million at december 31 2013 to 12551 million at december 31 2014  due primarily to additional contributions in 2014 as well as stock market performance our us pension plan assets comprise approximately 93 percent of our total plan assets with the difference representing plan assets related to foreign pension plans see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements included within this form 10k for details on how we develop our longterm rate of return assumptions we made contributions of 50 million and 40 million in 2014 and 2013 respectively and intend to contribute 65 million in 2015 our contributions in 2013 2014 and our intended contribution in 2015 are all in excess of the minimum requirements our contributions in excess of the minimum requirement are done with the objective of reducing future funding volatility we do not believe that the additional contribution in 2015 will have a material impact on our current and future liquidity needs however volatility of interest rates and equity returns may require greater contributions in the future 

during the year ended december 31 2014 we did not repurchase any shares under the publicly announced repurchase program at december 31 2014 250 million remained unused under our boardauthorized repurchase program this repurchase program does not include a specific timetable or price targets and may be suspended or terminated at any time shares may be purchased through open market or privately negotiated transactions at the discretion of management based on its evaluation of market conditions and other factors we also reacquire shares from time to time from employees in connections with vesting exercise and forfeiture of awards under our equity compensation plans 

dividends 

on january 15 2015  we paid dividends aggregating 201 million  to our shareholders of record as of december 31 2014  this amount is included in “accrued and other liabilities” on the consolidated balance sheets as of december 31 2014  for the years ended december 31 2014  2013  and 2012  we paid 781 million  736 million  and 478 million  in dividends respectively 

commitments 

we provide guarantees to financial institutions on behalf of certain fmc agricultural solutions customers principally brazilian customers for their seasonal borrowing the total of these guarantees was 1184 million  at december 31 2014  these guarantees arise during the ordinary course of business from relationships with customers and nonconsolidated affiliates nonperformance by the guaranteed party triggers the obligation requiring us to make payments to the beneficiary of the guarantee based on our experience these types guarantees have not had a material effect on our consolidated financial position or on our liquidity our expectation is that future payment or performance related to the nonperformance of others is considered unlikely 

shortterm debt consisted of foreign credit lines and commercial paper at december 31 2014  and 2013  we provide parentcompany guarantees to lending institutions providing credit to our foreign subsidiaries 

we continually evaluate our options for divesting real estate holdings and property plant and equipment that are no longer integral to our operating businesses in connection with our property and asset sales and divestitures we have agreed to indemnify the buyer for certain liabilities including environmental contamination and taxes that occurred prior to the date of sale our indemnification obligations with respect to these liabilities may be indefinite as to duration and may or may not be subject to a deductible minimum claim amount or cap as such it is not possible for us to predict the likelihood that a claim will be made or 

to make a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential loss or range of loss if triggered we may be able to recover certain of the indemnity payments from third parties we have not recorded any specific liabilities for these guarantees 

our total significant committed contracts that we believe will affect cash over the next four years and beyond are as follows

climate change 

we continue to follow legislative and regulatory developments regarding climate change because the regulation of greenhouse gases depending on their nature and scope could subject some of our manufacturing operations to additional costs or limits on operations our fmc alkali chemicals division which we expect to sell in early 2015 mines and refines trona ore into soda ash and related products at our westvaco and granger facilities near green river wyoming this activity constitutes most of fmcs greenhouse gas emissions globally in 2014 we reported approximately 24 million metric tons of direct emissions from the green river operations for 2013 as part of the epa greenhouse gas reporting program also in 2014 our fmc alkali chemicals division received a permit to increase the amount of greenhouse gases emitted from its facility near granger 

a significant source of greenhouse gas emissions at the green river operations are emissions from the beneficiation of trona ore that is a significant portion of the greenhouse gases released during the mining and refining of soda ash occurs naturally in the trona ore feedstock unlike the situation with energy efficiency where efficiencies may result in a reduction of greenhouse gases the amount of greenhouse gases present in the trona ore cannot be reduced all of the companies producing natural soda ash have such refining emissions yet the lower energy intensity of natural soda ash provides a favorable carbon intensity compared with synthetic soda ash produced throughout the rest of the world soda ash is an essential raw material in the production of glass of all kinds climate change energy intensity and alternative forms of energy will drive increased production of new forms of glass lower emissivity glass solar panel glass etc and will increase the need for this essential raw material from fmc the soda ash industry has an interest in assuring that climate change legislation or regulation recognizes the benefits of soda ash particularly natural soda ash and the challenges facing this industry in controlling its greenhouse gas emissions 

because of the many variables it is premature to make any estimate of the costs of complying with possible future federal climate change legislation in the united states however we are aware of the potential impacts that could result from emissions regulations 

in the us that are more stringent than those experienced by our global competitors these could make it more difficult for us to competitively produce natural soda ash at green river a reduction in natural soda ash production as a result of more stringent regulations in the us would lead to more greenhouse gas emissions globally because the lost supply of natural soda ash would be replaced by the more costly and more greenhouse gas intensive synthetic soda ash 

in 2014 two us plants in our fmc health  nutrition business also reported emissions above the epas reporting threshold but each plants emissions are substantially less than at our green river operations in total less than 01 million metric tons 

at this point our other us facilities are not subject to any state or regional greenhouse gas regulation that limits or imposes fees on current emissions and while some of our foreign operations may be subject to national or local energy management or climate change regulation the cost to these facilities has not been and is not expected to be material to fmc 

we have considered the potential physical risks to fmc facilities and operations and the indirect consequences of regulation or business trends as a result of potential future climate change we routinely assess our facilities for potential natural hazard exposures and do not expect material impacts based on currently available information

critical accounting policies 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles us gaap  the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses we have described our accounting policies in note 1 principal accounting policies and related financial information to our consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k we have reviewed these accounting policies identifying those that we believe to be critical to the preparation and understanding of our consolidated financial statements we have reviewed these critical accounting policies with the audit committee of the board of directors critical accounting policies are central to our presentation of results of operations and financial condition in accordance with us gaap and require management to make estimates and judgments on certain matters we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience current conditions and other reasonable factors 

environmental obligations and related recoveries 

we provide for environmentalrelated obligations when they are probable and amounts can be reasonably estimated where the available information is sufficient to estimate the amount of liability that estimate has been used where the information is only sufficient to establish a range of probable liability and no point within the range is more likely than any other the lower end of the range has been used 

estimated obligations to remediate sites that involve oversight by the united states environmental protection agency “epa” or similar government agencies are generally accrued no later than when a record of decision “rod” or equivalent is issued or upon completion of a remedial investigationfeasibility study “rifs” or equivalent that is submitted by us to the appropriate government agency or agencies estimates are reviewed quarterly by our environmental remediation management as well as by financial and legal management and if necessary adjusted as additional information becomes available the estimates can change substantially as additional information becomes available regarding the nature or extent of site contamination required remediation methods and other actions by or against governmental agencies or private parties 

our environmental liabilities for continuing and discontinued operations are principally for costs associated with the remediation andor study of sites at which we are alleged to have released hazardous substances into the environment such costs principally include among other items rifs site remediation costs of operation and maintenance of the remediation plan management 

costs fees to outside law firms and consultants for work related to the environmental effort and future monitoring costs estimated site liabilities are determined based upon existing remediation laws and technologies specific site consultants’ engineering studies or by extrapolating experience with environmental issues at comparable sites 

included in our environmental liabilities are costs for the operation maintenance and monitoring of site remediation plans omm such reserves are based on our best estimates for these omm plans over time we may incur omm costs in excess of these reserves however we are unable to reasonably estimate an amount in excess of our recorded reserves because we cannot reasonably estimate the period for which such omm plans will need to be in place or the future annual cost of such remediation as conditions at these environmental sites change over time such additional omm costs could be significant in total but would be incurred over an extended period of years 

included in the environmental reserve balance other assets balance and disclosure of reasonably possible loss contingencies are amounts from third party insurance policies which we believe are probable of recovery 

provisions for environmental costs are reflected in income net of probable and estimable recoveries from named potentially responsible parties “prps” or other third parties such provisions incorporate inflation and are not discounted to their present values 

in calculating and evaluating the adequacy of our environmental reserves we have taken into account the joint and several liability imposed by comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act “cercla” and the analogous state laws on all prps and have considered the identity and financial condition of the other prps at each site to the extent possible we have also considered the identity and financial condition of other third parties from whom recovery is anticipated as well as the status of our claims against such parties although we are unable to forecast the ultimate contributions of prps and other third parties with absolute certainty the degree of uncertainty with respect to each party is taken into account when determining the environmental reserve by adjusting the reserve to reflect the facts and circumstances on a sitebysite basis our liability includes our best estimate of the costs expected to be paid before the consideration of any potential recoveries from third parties we believe that any recorded recoveries related to prps are realizable in all material respects recoveries are recorded as either an offset in “environmental liabilities continuing and discontinued” or as “other assets” in our consolidated balance sheets in accordance with us accounting literature 

see note 10 to our consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k for changes in estimates associated with our environmental obligations 

impairments and valuation of longlived assets 

our longlived assets primarily include property plant and equipment goodwill and intangible assets the assets and liabilities of acquired businesses are measured at their estimated fair values at the dates of acquisition the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired including identified intangibles is recorded as goodwill the determination and allocation of fair value to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is based on various assumptions and valuation methodologies requiring considerable management judgment including estimates based on historical information current market data and future expectations the principal assumptions utilized in our valuation methodologies include revenue growth rates operating margin estimates and discount rates although the estimates were deemed reasonable by management based on information available at the dates of acquisition those estimates are inherently uncertain 

we test for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the net book value of our property plant and equipment may not be recoverable from the estimated undiscounted expected future cash flows expected to result from their use and eventual disposition in cases where the estimated undiscounted expected future cash flows are less than net book value an impairment loss is recognized equal to the amount by which the net book value exceeds the estimated fair value of assets which is based on discounted cash flows at the lowest level determinable the estimated cash flows reflect our assumptions about selling prices volumes costs and market conditions over a reasonable period of time 

we perform an annual impairment test of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets in the third quarter of each year or more frequently whenever an event or change in circumstances occur that would require reassessment of the recoverability of those assets in performing our evaluation we assess qualitative factors such as overall financial performance of our reporting units anticipated changes in industry and market structure competitive environments planned capacity and cost factors such as raw material prices based on our assessment for 2014 we determined that no impairment charge to our continuing operations was required 

see note 7 to our consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k for charges associated with longlived asset disposal costs and the activity associated with the restructuring reserves 

pension and other postretirement benefits 

we provide qualified and nonqualified defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans as well as postretirement health care and life insurance benefit plans to our employees and retirees the costs benefits and obligations related to these benefits reflect key assumptions related to general economic conditions including interest discount rates healthcare cost trend rates expected rates of return on plan assets and the rates of compensation increase for employees the costs benefits and obligations for these benefit programs are also affected by other assumptions such as average retirement age mortality employee turnover and plan participation to the extent our plans’ actual experience as influenced by changing economic and financial market conditions or by changes to our own plans’ demographics differs from these assumptions the costs and obligations for providing these benefits as well as the plans’ funding requirements could increase or decrease when actual results differ from our assumptions the difference is typically recognized over future periods in addition the unrealized gains and losses related to our pension and postretirement benefit obligations may also affect periodic benefit costs benefits in future periods 

in 2014 the society of actuaries released new mortality tables and a mortality improvement scale for measurement of retirement program obligations we adopted these new tables in measuring the december 31 2014 us defined benefit and post retirement obligations this adoption has increased the benefit obligations at december 31 2014 by approximately 95 million the effect of this adoption will be amortized into net periodic benefit cost beginning in 2015 

we use several assumptions and statistical methods to determine the asset values used to calculate both the expected rate of return on assets component of pension cost and to calculate our plans’ funding requirements the expected rate of return on plan assets is based on a marketrelated value of assets that recognizes investment gains and losses over a fiveyear period we use an actuarial value of assets to determine our plans’ funding requirements the actuarial value of assets must be within a certain range high or low of the actual market value of assets and is adjusted accordingly 

we select the discount rate used to calculate pension and other postretirement obligations based on a review of available yields on highquality corporate bonds as of the measurement date in selecting a discount rate as of december 31 2014  we placed particular emphasis on a discount rate yieldcurve provided by our actuary this yieldcurve when populated with projected cash flows that represented the expected timing and amount of our plans benefit payments produced a single effective interest discount rate of 415 percent  which was used to measure the plans liabilities 

the discount rates used at our december 31 2014  and 2013  measurement dates were 415 percent  and 495 percent  respectively the effect of the change in the discount rate from 495 percent  to 415 percent  at december 31 2014  resulted in a 1432 million increase to our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations the effect of the change in the discount rate from 415 percent at december 31 2012 to 495 percent at december 31 2013 resulted in a 88 million decrease to 2014  pension and other postretirement benefit expense 

the change in discount rate from 495 percent  at december 31 2013  to 415 percent  at december 31 2014  was attributable to a decrease in yields on high quality corporate bonds with cash flows matching the timing and amount of our expected future benefit payments between the 2013  and 2014  measurement dates using the december 31 2013  yield curve our plan cash flows produced a single weightedaverage discount rate of approximately 495 percent  matching our plan cash flows to a similarly constructed curve reflecting highyielding bonds available as of december 31 2014  resulted in a single weightedaverage discount rate of approximately 415 percent  

in developing the assumption for the longterm rate of return on assets for our us plan we take into consideration the technical analysis performed by our outside actuaries including historical market returns information on the assumption for longterm real returns by asset class inflation assumptions and expectations for standard deviation related to these best estimates we also consider the historical performance of our own plan’s trust which has earned a compound annual rate of return of approximately 103 percent  over the last 20 years which is in excess of comparable market indices for the same period as well as other factors which are discussed in note 13 to our consolidated financial statements in this form 10k our longterm rate of return for the years ended december 31 2014 2013 and 2012 was 775 percent  

for the sensitivity of our pension costs to incremental changes in assumptions see our discussion below 

sensitivity analysis related to key pension and postretirement benefit assumptions 

a onehalf percent increase in the assumed discount rate would have decreased pension and other postretirement benefit obligations by 896 million and 672 million at december 31 2014  and 2013  respectively and decreased pension and other postretirement benefit costs by 69 million 58 million and 82 million for 2014  2013  and 2012  respectively a onehalf percent decrease in the assumed discount rate would have increased pension and other postretirement benefit obligations by 994 million 739 million at december 31 2014  and 2013  respectively and increased pension and other postretirement benefit net periodic benefit cost by 75 million 62 million and 84 million for 2014  2013  and 2012  respectively 

a onehalf percent increase in the assumed expected longterm rate of return on plan assets would have decreased pension costs by 52 million 48 million and 47 million for 2014  2013  and 2012  respectively a onehalf percent decrease in the assumed longterm rate of return on plan assets would have increased pension costs by 52 million 48 million and 47 million for 2014  2013  and 2012  respectively 

further details on our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and net periodic benefit costs benefits are found in note 13 to our consolidated financial statements in this form 10k 

income taxes 

we have recorded a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized in assessing the need for this allowance we have considered a number of factors including future taxable income the jurisdictions in which such income is earned and our ongoing tax planning strategies in the event that we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period such determination was made similarly should we conclude that we would be able to realize certain deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase income in the period such determination was made 

additionally we file income tax returns in the us federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions the income tax returns for fmc entities taxable in the us and significant foreign jurisdictions are open for examination and adjustment we assess our income tax positions and record a liability for all years open to examination based upon our evaluation of the facts circumstances and information available at the reporting date for those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained we have recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information we adjust these liabilities if necessary upon the completion of tax audits or changes in tax law

 item 7a 

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend our earnings cash flows and financial position are exposed to market risks relating to fluctuations in commodity prices interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates our policy is to minimize exposure to our cash flow over time caused by changes in commodity interest and currency exchange rates to accomplish this we have implemented a controlled program of risk management consisting of appropriate derivative contracts entered into with major financial institutions 

the analysis below presents the sensitivity of the market value of our financial instruments to selected changes in market rates and prices the range of changes chosen reflects our view of changes that are reasonably possible over a oneyear period marketvalue estimates are based on the present value of projected future cash flows considering the market rates and prices chosen 

at december 31 2014  our net financial instrument position was a net liability of 925 million  compared to a net liability of 64 million  at december 31 2013  the change in the net financial instrument position was primarily due to higher unrealized losses in our commodity and foreign exchange portfolios 

since our risk management programs are generally highly effective the potential loss in value for each risk management portfolio described below would be largely offset by changes in the value of the underlying exposure 

commodity price risk 

energy costs are diversified among coal electricity and natural gas we attempt to mitigate our exposure to increasing energy costs by hedging the cost of future deliveries of natural gas and by entering into fixedprice contracts for the purchase of coal and fuel oil to analyze the effect of changing energy prices we have performed a sensitivity analysis in which we assume an instantaneous 10 percent change in energy market prices from their levels at december 31 2014  and 2013  with all other variables including interest rates held constant 



our fmc agricultural solutions segment enters into contracts with certain customers in brazil to exchange our products for future physical delivery of soybeans to mitigate the price risk associated with these barter contracts we enter into offsetting derivatives to hedge our exposure as of december 31 2014  and 2013  our net financial instrument position was immaterial 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

the primary currencies for which we have exchange rate exposure are the us dollar versus the euro the chinese yuan the brazilian real and the argentine peso foreign currency debt and foreign exchange forward contracts are used in countries where we do business thereby reducing our net asset exposure foreign exchange forward contracts are also used to hedge firm and highly anticipated foreign currency cash flows 

to analyze the effects of changing foreign currency rates we have performed a sensitivity analysis in which we assume an instantaneous 10 percent change in the foreign currency exchange rates from their levels at december 31 2014  and 2013  with all other variables including interest rates held constant 



 

 interest rate risk 

one of the strategies that we can use to manage interest rate exposure is to enter into interest rate swap agreements in these agreements we agree to exchange at specified intervals the difference between fixed and variable interest amounts calculated on an agreedupon notional principal amount as of december 31 2014  and 2013  we had no interest rate swap agreements 

our debt portfolio at december 31 2014  is composed of 70 percent fixedrate debt and 30 percent variablerate debt the variablerate component of our debt portfolio principally consists of borrowings under our commercial paper program credit facility variablerate industrial and pollution control revenue bonds and amounts outstanding under foreign subsidiary credit lines changes in interest rates affect different portions of our variablerate debt portfolio in different ways 

based on the variablerate debt in our debt portfolio at december 31 2014  a one percentage point increase in interest rates would have increased gross interest expense by 51 million and a one percentage point decrease in interest rates would have decreased gross interest expense by 25 million for the year ended december 31 2014

with a worldwide manufacturing and distribution infrastructure we are able to respond rapidly to global customer needs offset downward economic trends in one region with positive trends in another and match local revenues to local costs to mitigate the impact of currency volatility the charts below detail our sales and longlived assets by major geographic region 

  

our strategy 

since 2010 we have invested significant resources and managerial time in the development and implementation of a new strategic plan for fmc this corporate strategy which we refer to as vision 2015 is focused on driving sales and earnings growth while sustaining a return on invested capital well above our cost of capital this strategys objective is to achieve a total shareholder return in the top quartile of a broad group of industry peers vision 2015 has five key elements 

growing leadership positions  we intend to continue to build and strengthen our marketleading positions by executing a plan that relies primarily on organic growth complemented by a focused external growth strategy we benefit from a business portfolio that is exposed to fastgrowing end markets and geographic regions fmc agricultural solutions’ organic growth plan focuses on market and product innovations while strengthening market access fmc health and nutrition’s organic focus is primarily on new products and new applications for existing products fmc minerals’ focus is on achieving lowest unit cost production of natural commodities to complement these growth initiatives our external growth strategy employs a focused disciplined approach to company product and technology acquisitions and ventures we believe this strategy reduces risks inherent in external growth in fmc agricultural solutions we are focused on acquiring access to new products and technologies as well as strengthening market access and entering adjacent spaces fmc health and nutrition’s external growth efforts are directed toward product and small company acquisitions that fit or complement existing supply chain competencies and have similar endmarket characteristics as the markets in which we already participate fmc minerals evaluates acquisitions opportunistically across fmc our strategy excludes making largescale complex or transformational acquisitions or adding another business platform to our portfolio through acquisition 

increasing our reach  we intend to bias our growth initiatives toward further strengthening our positions in rapidly developing economies rdes our growth in latin america will be largely driven by leveraging fmc agricultural solutions’ leadership positions in asia our growth initiatives will be more broadbased with targeted investments in human scientific and technological resources across our businesses in the region in central and eastern europe turkey and russia we will focus on establishing strong footholds in key countries 

capturing the value of common ownership  we are moving from a highly decentralized organizational model to one that has both centralized and decentralized qualities we believe this shift will enable us to better leverage the size and scope of our company to realize cost savings and increase efficiencies yet maintain strong accountability in our business units our efforts are focused on such areas as procurement strategic planning mergers and acquisitions communications global supply chain rde infrastructure human resources and finance 

proactively managing our portfolio  we continually assess the performance of all of our business units and will take actions as needed should a unit’s performance change within our businesses we continue to evaluate the performance of specific product lines and have taken action where a product line or business has become noncore or economically unsustainable such as the exit in 2011 of the sodium percarbonate product line of the zeolites product line in 2012 and the fmc peroxygens segment divestiture in 2013 

disciplined cash deployment  under our vision 2015 plan we expect to fund our growth strategies and return a significant amount of cash to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividends 

underlying our ambition to deliver our vision 2015 plan is a continued commitment to enterprise sustainability including responsible stewardship as we grow we will do so in a responsible way safety is and will remain of utmost importance meeting and exceeding our customers’ expectations will continue to be a primary focus we will as always conduct our business in an ethical manner

industry overview 

food ingredients 

the industry is dispersed geographically with the majority of our sales in europe north america and asia the food ingredients market is comprised of a large number of suppliers due to the broad spectrum of chemistries employed segment leadership global position and investment in technology are key factors to sustaining profitability the top suppliers of tsps ingredients include fmc dupont jm huber corporation kerry group plc and cargill incorporated 

pharmaceutical  nutraceutical ingredients 

competitors tend to be grouped by chemistry our principal mcc competitors include j rettenmaier  sôhne gmbh ming tai chemical co ltd asahi kasei corporation and blanver farmoquimica ltda while pricing pressure from lowcost producers is a common competitive dynamic companies look to offset that pressure by providing the most reliable and broadest range of products and services our customers are pharmaceutical firms who depend upon reliable therapeutic performance of their drug products dsm basf ag and croda international plc also produce a variety of omega3 fish oils we have a costeffective production capability that yields very high concentrates and distinguishes fmc products from others 

fmc minerals 

financial information in millions 

  

            

  

overview 

our fmc minerals segment which represents 25 percent  of our 2013  consolidated revenues participates in the alkali chemicals and lithium products markets 

products and markets 

     

alkali 

our alkali chemicals division produces natural soda ash soda ash is used by manufacturers in glass chemical processing and detergent industries we also produce smaller volumes of sodium bicarbonate caustic soda and sodium sesquicarbonate the majority of our alkali sales are manufactured by and sold through fmc wyoming corporation which we manage as an integral part of our alkali business we hold a 9375 percent ownership interest in fmc wyoming corporation which increased 625 percent from 8750 percent in march 2013 as a result of our purchase of nippon sheet glass companys 625 percent ownership interest the remaining shares are held by a third party japanese company 

    lithium 

lithium is a vertically integrated business based on both inorganic and organic lithium chemistries while lithium is sold into a variety of end markets we have focused our strategy on the energy storage polymer and pharmaceutical markets and other industrial markets 

the electrochemical properties of lithium make it an ideal material for portable energy storage in high performance applications including smart phones tablets laptop computers military devices and aerospace and other nextgeneration energy storage technologies lithium is a critical element in advanced batteries for use in hybrid electric plugin hybrids and allelectric vehicles 

organolithium products are highly valued in the polymer market as initiators in the production of synthetic rubbers and elastomers organolithiums are also sold to fine chemical and pharmaceutical customers who use lithiums unique chemical properties to synthesize high valueadded products 

industry overview 

fmc minerals serves a diverse group of markets from economically sensitive industrial sectors to technologyintensive specialty markets our product offerings are primarily inorganic and are generally commodities that in many cases have few costeffective substitutes growth is typically a function of industrial production in developed economies and a function of the rate of industrialization in developing economies though a major growth driver for lithium in the future will be the rate of adoption of electric and hybrid electric batteries in automobiles 

alkali 

natural soda ash is typically produced from trona ore through mining and chemical processing soda ash may also be produced synthetically but requires significantly more energy and produces large quantities of waste byproducts making it much less costeffective than natural soda ash production due to the processing cost advantages of mining trona and the large natural reserves of trona ore in the us particularly in the green river basin of wyoming all us soda ash is naturally produced by contrast due to a lack of trona ore the majority of the soda ash that is manufactured in the rest of the world is produced synthetically other us producers are oci chemical corporation solvay sa tata chemicals soda ash partners and nirma limited 

lithium 

the markets for lithium chemicals are global with significant growth occurring outside the us in japan china and south korea driven by the development and manufacture of lithium ion batteries there are three key producers of lithium compounds fmc rockwood holdings inc and sociedad química y minera de chile sa a fourth producer talison produces spodumene ore that is subsequently converted to lithium compounds by a large number of chinese producers we expect a few new producers may add primary inorganics capacity to the global lithium supply in the future fmc and rockwood are the primary producers of lithium specialties 

source and availability of raw materials 

our raw material requirements vary by business segment and primarily include mineralrelated natural resources trona ore and lithium brines processed chemicals seaweed specialty wood pulps and energy sources such as gas coal oil and electricity during 2013 we encountered no significant difficulties in obtaining adequate supplies of our raw materials 

we extract ores used in fmc minerals’ manufacturing processes from mines eg trona ore in north america and lithium brines in argentina raw materials used by fmc health and nutrition include various types of seaweed specialty pulps natural colorant raw materials and fish oils that are all sourced on a global basis and purchased from selected global producerssuppliers raw materials used by fmc agricultural solutions primarily processed chemicals are obtained from a variety of suppliers worldwide 

patents 

we own a number of us and foreign patents trademarks and licenses that are cumulatively important to our business we do not believe that the loss of any individual or combination of related patents trademarks or licenses would have a material adverse effect on the overall business of fmc the duration of our patents depends on their respective jurisdictions 

seasonality 

the seasonal nature of the crop protection market and the geographic spread of the fmc agricultural solutions business can result in significant variations in quarterly earnings among geographic locations fmc agricultural solutions sold into the northern hemisphere north america europe and parts of asia serve seasonal agricultural markets from march through september generally resulting in earnings in the first second and third quarters markets in the southern hemisphere latin america and parts of the asia pacific region including australia are served from july through february generally resulting in earnings in the third fourth and first quarters the remainder of our business is generally not subject to significant seasonal fluctuations 

competition 

we encounter substantial competition in each of our three business segments we market our products through our own sales organization and through alliance partners independent distributors and sales representatives the number of our principal competitors varies from segment to segment in general we compete by providing advanced technology high product quality and reliability and quality customer and technical service and by operating in a costefficient manner 

our fmc agricultural solutions segment competes primarily in the global chemical crop protection market for insecticides herbicides and fungicides industry products include crop protection chemicals and for certain major competitors genetically engineered crop biotechnology products competition from generic agrochemical producers is significant as a number of key product patents held industrywide have expired in the last decade in general we compete as an innovator by focusing on product development including novel formulations proprietary mixes and advanced delivery systems and by acquiring or licensing mostly proprietary chemistries or technologies that complement our product and geographic focus we also differentiate ourselves by our global costcompetitiveness via our manufacturing strategies establishing effective product stewardship programs and developing strategic alliances that strengthen market access in key countries and regions 

our fmc health and nutrition segment has significant positions in markets that include alginate carrageenan and microcrystalline cellulose we compete with both direct suppliers of cellulose and seaweed extract as well as suppliers of other hydrocolloids which may provide similar functionality in specific applications in microcrystalline cellulose competitors are typically smaller than us while in seaweed extracts carrageenan and alginates and omega3 fish oils we compete with other broadbased chemical companies 

our fmc minerals segment sells soda ash and lithiumbased products worldwide in north america our soda ash business competes with four domestic producers of natural soda ash three of which operate in the vicinity of our mine and processing facilities near green river wyoming outside of the us canada europe and south africa we sell soda ash mainly through the american natural soda ash corporation ansac internationally our natural soda ash competes with synthetic soda ash manufactured by numerous producers ranging from integrated multinational companies to smaller regional companies the 

primary competitive factor affecting the sales of soda ash to commodity markets is price fmc as well as the other north american producers of soda ash benefit from the lowest cost of soda ash production globally especially when compared to the foreign synthetic soda ash manufacturers we and each of our two most significant competitors in lithium extract the element from naturally occurring lithiumrich brines located in the andes mountains of argentina and chile which are believed to be the world’s most significant and lowest cost sources of lithium 

research and development expense 

we perform research and development in all of our segments with the majority of our efforts focused in the fmc agricultural solutions segment the development efforts in the fmc agricultural solutions segment focus on developing environmentally sound solutions and new product formulations that costeffectively increase farmers’ yields and provide alternatives to existing and new chemistries our research and development expenses in the last three years are set forth below

legal proceedings 

tableend 

like hundreds of other industrial companies we have been named as one of many defendants in asbestosrelated personal injury litigation most of these cases allege personal injury or death resulting from exposure to asbestos in premises of fmc or to asbestoscontaining components installed in machinery or equipment manufactured or sold by discontinued operations the machinery and equipment businesses we owned or operated did not fabricate the asbestoscontaining component parts at issue in the litigation and to this day neither the us occupational safety and health administration nor the environmental protection agency has banned the use of these components further the asbestoscontaining parts for this machinery and equipment were accessible only at the time of infrequent repair and maintenance a few jurisdictions have permitted claims to proceed against equipment manufacturers relating to insulation installed by other companies on such machinery and equipment we believe that overall the claims against fmc are without merit 

as of december 31 2013 there were approximately 11100 premises and product asbestos claims pending against fmc in several jurisdictions since the 1980s approximately 104000 asbestos claims against fmc have been discharged the overwhelming majority of which have been dismissed without any payment to the claimant settlements by us with claimants have totaled approximately 53 million 

we intend to continue managing these asbestosrelated cases in accordance with our historical experience we have established a reserve for this litigation within our discontinued operations and believe that any exposure of a loss in excess of the established reserve cannot be reasonably estimated our experience has been that the overall trends in terms of the rate of filing of asbestosrelated claims with respect to all potential defendants has changed over time and that filing rates as to us in particular have varied significantly over the last several years we are a peripheral defendant  that is we have never manufactured asbestos or asbestoscontaining components as a result claim filing rates against us have yet to form a predictable pattern and we are unable to project a reasonably accurate future filing rate and thus we are presently unable to reasonably estimate our asbestos liability with respect to claims that may be filed in the future 

fifra advertising dispute epa region 7 has informed us that certain radio advertising regarding one of our pesticide products did not comply with the federal insecticide fungicide and rodenticide act “fifra” and has calculated a proposed penalty in excess of 100000 we disagree with epa on whether a violation occurred and if a violation did occur the 

appropriate penalty calculation while we are presently unable to reasonably estimate our potential liability for the matter we do not expect that any penalty associated with final resolution would be material

2013 vs 2012 

revenue of 21457 million  increased approximately 22 percent versus the prior year period due to sales growth in north america latin america and asia partially offset by declines in emea 

sales in latin america of 11847 million increased 23 percent driven by brazil volume growth in herbicide and insecticide sales for soybeans including growth from new and recently launched products sales in north america of 5061 million increased 37 percent driven by strong demand for preemergent herbicides and atplant insecticides as well as growth from new product introductions revenue in asia of 3154 million increased 14 percent reflecting sales 

growth in china indonesia australia and a number of other key countries emea declined 12 percent to 1395 million primarily due to unfavorable weather conditions and lower insecticide sales 

fmc agricultural solutions operating profit of 5390 million  increased approximately 19 percent compared to the yearago period reflecting the sales growth described in the preceding paragraph a favorable geographic mix and selected price increases selling general and administrative costs were approximately 9 million or three percent higher compared to the prior year due to increased spending on growth initiatives and higher peoplerelated costs to support the higher sales research and development costs also increased period over period by approximately 5 million due to increased spending associated with various innovation projects 

in 2014 we expect fullyear revenue percentage growth in the midteens reflecting increased volumes due to strong market conditions and growth from new and recently introduced products particularly in latin america north america and asia we expect fullyear segment operating profit to grow in the midteens percentage driven primarily by continued market share gains in latin america and increased demand for resistance management products in north america 

certain regulatory issues 

we intend to defend vigorously all our products in the us eu and other countries as our pesticide products are reviewed in the ordinary course of regulatory programs during 2014 as part of the ongoing cycle of reregistration of our pesticide products around the world 

2012 vs 2011 

revenue of 17638 million increased approximately 20 percent versus the prior year period due to strong sales across all regions the increase in revenue for the year ended december 31 2012 was also attributable to acquisitions that 

closed in the second half of 2011 of approximately 60 million 

sales in north america improved by 30 percent to 3685 million reflecting favorable market conditions strong demand for our proprietary herbicides and insecticides and growth from new or recently introduced products latin america revenue of 9605 million increased 23 percent reflecting strong market conditions in brazil driven by key crops such as sugarcane and soybeans increased planted acres and sales from our new market access joint venture ruralco in argentina revenue in asia of 2757 million increased 12 percent as a result of growth in recently launched and acquired products coupled with growth in china indonesia and the philippines emea revenues of 1591 million increased five percent driven by higher herbicide sales in europe and insecticide volume gains in africa 

fmc agricultural solutions operating profit of 4540 million increased approximately 30 percent compared to the prior year reflecting the broadbased sales growth and targeted price increases this increase was partially offset by a 517 million increase in selling general and administrative costs mainly for focused growth initiatives and increased peoplerelated costs to support the higher sales segment earnings were also impacted by higher research and development costs of 111 million due to increased spending associated with various innovation projects 

fmc health and nutrition 



2013 vs 2012 

revenue was 7620 million  an increase of approximately 12 percent versus the prioryear period this increase was due to volume increases of three percent in core product lines revenue from acquisitions which increased sales by six percent favorable pricing and foreign currency impacts which increased sales by two and one percent respectively 

segment operating profit of 1695 million  increased by five percent versus the prior year period as revenue growth was partially offset by acquisition integration costs higher raw material costs and costs associated with our manufacturing excellence program selling general and administrative costs also increased approximately 6 million compared to the prior year due to the addition of the epax business within the segment 

in 2014 we expect fullyear revenue to be up in the mid to highteens percent driven by higher volumes in texture and stability solutions natural colors and binder product lines and contributions from the omega3 product line fullyear segment operating profit are expected to grow in the midteens percent with benefits from omega3 sales and strong demand in food ingredients 

2012 vs 2011 

revenue of 6808 million increased approximately four percent from the prior year this increase was due to favorable pricing which impacted sales by six percent and revenue from acquisitions which increased sales by two percent these increases were partially offset by decreased volumes of two percent and unfavorable currency impacts of two percent 

segment operating profit of 1616 million increased one percent versus the prior year the higher revenues were negatively impacted by higher raw material costs additionally selling general and administrative expenses also increased by approximately 7 million to support growth initiatives 

fmc minerals 

  



2013 vs 2012 

revenue of 9700 million  was essentially flat period over period volume gains of three percent driven by alkali sales were offset by unfavorable pricing year over year unfavorable pricing was primarily driven by alkali slightly offset by favorable pricing in lithium 

alkali revenues of 7470 million  increased 2 percent  over the prior year due to volume gains of six percent which were partially offset by reduced pricing of four percent 

lithium revenues of 2230 million  decreased 4 percent  compared to the prior year due to unfavorable sales mix production and sales volumes on a lithium carbonate equivalent basis were relatively flat year over year as lower production in argentina due to operational issues was offset by higher third party product purchases 

segment operating profit of 1283 million  decreased approximately 25 percent versus the prior year the decrease was primarily due to lower average export pricing in soda ash additionally production factors such as poor geological conditions at the alkali mine as well as poor weather at the lithium mine and unfavorable currency in lithium impacted the results 

in 2014 we expect fullyear revenue percentage growth up to the mid to highsingle digits percent driven primarily by increased volumes in lithium and soda ash and short and longterm contract price increases in soda ash we expect fullyear segment operating profit to increase in the highteens percent reflecting lithium margin improvements and more favorable contractual soda ash pricing versus 2013 

2012 vs 2011 

revenue in fmc minerals was 9662 million an increase of approximately five percent versus the prior year revenue increased four percent due to higher pricing across the segment and by one percent due to volume increases in alkali 

alkali revenues of 7332 million increased six percent over the prior year due to higher average pricing which impacted sales by four percent in both the domestic and export markets additionally higher export volumes favorably impacted sales by two percent volume growth was partially related to full production at our granger facility which came on line in the middle of last year export volumes were robust especially in asia and latin america 

lithium revenue of 2330 million increased approximately four percent compared to the prior year this increase was due to higher pricing which impacted sales by six percent partially offset by decreased volumes which decreased sales by two percent lithium sales growth was led by higher selling prices in lithium primaries lower volumes also resulted from production downtime in the first quarter of 2012 associated with our capacity expansion in argentina as well as the effect of related operational issues which primarily impacted the first half of 2012 and the extended planned outage in lithiums argentina facility in third quarter 2012 

segment operating profit of 1714 million decreased approximately two percent versus the year ago period higher pricing and volumes experienced in alkali were more than offset by higher royalty and energy costs associated with our 

wyoming alkali operations and increased manufacturing costs within our lithium operations selling general and administrative costs increased seven percent or 27 million primarily for targeted growth initiatives 

other results of operations 

corporate expenses 

corporate expenses are included as a component of the line item “selling general and administrative expenses” on our consolidated statements of income 

2013 vs 2012 

corporate and other expenses of 827 million increased by 41 million from 786 million in the same period in 2012 the increase period over period is due to increased costs of approximately 4 million primarily representing costs associated with the transformation of our finance organization this transformation is similar to past initiatives to improve our organization 

2012 vs 2011 

corporate and other of 786 million in 2012 increased by 33 million from 753 million in 2011 the yearoveryear increase is primarily due to higher lifo inventory charges of 50 million 

interest expense net 

2013 vs 2012 

interest expense net for 2013 of 422 million  increased approximately four percent compared to 2012 of 407 million  the increase was primarily due to higher overall debt levels driven by funding requirements for the acquisition of epax and our share repurchases during 2013 

2012 vs 2011 

interest expense net for 2012 of 407 million  increased approximately 16 percent compared to the same period in 2011 of 350 million the increase was primarily due to higher debt levels associated with the issuance of our 395 senior notes during the 4th quarter of 2011 the interest expense on these notes was approximately 12 million in 2012 the higher interest associated with our senior notes was slightly offset by a decrease in our foreign debt interest expense during 2012 as compared to 2011 of approximately 53 million 

corporate special income charges 

restructuring and other charges income 

our restructuring and other charges income are comprised of restructuring assets disposals and other charges income as described below 



restructuring and asset disposal charges in 2013 of 96 million were primarily associated with the announced lithium restructuring other charges income net in 2013 of 383 million primarily related to charges associated with collaboration and license agreements entered into by our fmc agricultural solutions segment for the purpose of obtaining certain technology and intellectual property rights relating to new compounds still under development the rights and technology obtained is referred to as inprocess research and development and in accordance with gaap the amounts paid were expensed as incurred since they were acquired outside of a business combination 

restructuring and asset disposal charges in 2012 primarily included charges of 133 million associated with the lithium restructuring other charges income net in 2012 were primarily due to charges of 58 million for environmental remediation 

at operating sites and a 44 million charge related to our fmc agricultural solutions segment for the purpose of acquiring certain rights to a fungicide still under development 

restructuring and asset disposal charges in 2011 were primarily associated with continuing charges related to facility restructurings and shutdowns which were announced in years prior to 2011 other charges income net in 2011 were primarily associated with charges of 31 million for environmental remediation at operating sites 

the activity of the restructuring charges listed above are also included within note 7 to our consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k we believe the restructuring plans implemented are on schedule and the benefits and savings either have been or will be achieved 

nonoperating pension and postretirement charges income 

nonoperating pension and postretirement charges income are included in “selling general and administrative expenses” on our consolidated statements of income 

2013 vs 2012 

the charge for 2013 was 381 million  compared to 349 million  for 2012 the increase in charges were primarily the result of a settlement charge of 74 million partially offset by lower interest costs of 37 million the settlement charge was associated with the acceleration of previously deferred actuarial losses triggered by the lumpsum payout to former executives in 2013 

2012 vs 2011 

the charge for 2012 was 349 million  compared to 145 million for 2011 the increased charge was primarily the result of higher amortization impacts of actuarial losses of 149 million 

acquisitionrelated charges 

acquisitionrelated charges associated with inventory fair value stepup are included in “costs of sales and services” and fees associated with concluding the acquisitions are included in selling general and administrative expenses 

2013 vs 2012 

charges related to the expensing of the inventory fair value stepup resulting from the application of purchase accounting for acquisitions and certain professional fees associated with the completion of acquisitions charges in 2013 represent amortization of inventory fair value stepup of 52 million and certain professional fees of 48 million associated with the completion of our epax acquisition within our fmc health and nutrition segment the charges in 2012 represented amortization of inventory fair value stepup relate to a number of acquisitions completed in 2011 and in the second quarter of 2012 

2012 vs 2011 

the charge in 2012 of 72 million related to the expensing of the inventory fair value stepup resulting from the application of purchase accounting associated with acquisitions completed in 2012 and 2011 the charges for year ended december 31 2011 relate to a number of acquisitions completed in late 2011 see note 3 to our consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k for more information on our acquisitions 

provision for income taxes 

2013 vs 2012 

provision for income taxes is 1486 million  for 2013 compared to a provision of 1345 million  for the prior year period resulting in effective tax rates of 241 percent  and 225 percent  respectively excluding the impact of tax adjustments in both periods our effective rate in 2013 was 217 and in 2012 was 255 tax adjustments in 2013 were primarily associated with adjustments to us state deferred tax balances established prior to 2013 driven by a change in enacted tax rates and other state related items tax benefit adjustments in 2012 were primarily driven by a reduction in our valuation allowance related to state net operating losses expected to be recoverable in future years when excluding these impacts the decrease in the effective tax rates was primarily due to a mix shift in domestic versus foreign income foreign profits are generally taxed at lower rates compared to domestic income see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for additional details related to the provisions for income taxes on continuing operations as well as items that significantly impact our effective tax rate 

2012 vs 2011 

provision for income taxes was 1345 million  for 2012 compared to a provision of 1329 million for the prior year period resulting in effective tax rates of 225 percent  and 240 percent respectively excluding the impact of tax 

adjustments in both periods which in 2012 were primarily driven by a reduction in our valuation allowance related to state net operating losses expected to be recoverable in future years our effective rate in 2012 was 255 percent versus 244 percent in 2011 this increase was driven by slightly higher domestic profits in 2012 versus 2011 domestic profits are taxed at higher rates as compared to foreign profits 

discontinued operations net of income taxes 

our discontinued operations represent our discontinued fmc peroxygens segment results as well as adjustments to retained liabilities from previous discontinued operations the primary liabilities retained include environmental liabilities other postretirement benefit liabilities selfinsurance longterm obligations related to legal proceedings and historical restructuring activities 

2013 vs 2012 

discontinued operations net of income taxes totaled a charge of 1593 million  for 2013 compared to a charge of 275 million  2012 the increase was a result of a charge of 1567 million 1221 million aftertax associated with our discontinued fmc peroxygens segment the charge was associated with a write down of the fmc peroxygens segment assets held for sale to fair value for more information on our discontinued operations net of income taxes see note 9 to our consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k 

2012 vs 2011 

discontinued operations net of income taxes totaled a charge of 275 million  for 2012 compared to a charge of 381 million for 2011 the decrease is primarily attributable to lower restructuring charges of approximately 9 million associated with our discontinued fmc peroxygens spanish operations 

net income attributable to fmc stockholders 

2013 vs 2012 

net income attributable to fmc stockholders decreased to 2939 million  in 2013 from 4162 million  in 2012 this fluctuation year over year is described in more detail above however the primary driver is the 1221 million aftertax charge associated with our discontinued fmc peroxygens segment 

2012 vs 2011 

net income attributable to fmc stockholders increased to 4162 million in 2012 from 3659 million in 2011 the increase was primarily due to higher operating profits in our fmc agricultural solutions segment and a lower effective tax rate these items were partially offset by higher nonoperating pension and postretirement charges and slightly reduced fmc minerals results 

liquidity and capital resources 

cash and cash equivalents at december 31 2013  and 2012  were 1232 million  and 771 million  respectively of the cash and cash equivalents balance at december 31 2013  1126 million were held by our foreign subsidiaries our intent is to reinvest permanently the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries and therefore we have not recorded additional taxes that would be payable if we repatriated these earnings however in the third quarter of 2013 we changed our assertion on the portion of our foreign subsidiaries unremitted earnings that we intend to repatriate upon the sale of our discontinued fmc peroxygens segment and have recorded the taxes that would be payable upon such repatriation in the event that additional funds from our foreign subsidiaries are repatriated to the us we would be required to accrue and pay us taxes on those amounts 

in june 2013 we commenced a 15 billion commercial paper program supported by our credit facility this program allows us to borrow at rates generally more favorable than those available under our credit facility we have used proceeds from the commercial paper program for general corporate purposes at december 31 2013  the average effective interest rate on these borrowings was 034 percent  

on august 5 2013 we entered into an amendment and consent no 1 the amendment to our credit agreement dated as of august 5 2011 the amendment among other things extended the termination date of the credit facility to august 5 2017 from august 5 2016 

on november 15 2013 we issued 400 million  aggregate principal amount of 410 percent  senior notes due 2024 the net proceeds from the offering were used for general corporate purposes including repayment of outstanding commercial paper 

at december 31 2013  we had total debt of 18519 million  as compared to 9644 million  at december 31 2012  this included 11541 million  and 9088 million  of longterm debt excluding current portions of 347 million  and 57 million  at december 31 2013  and 2012  respectively other shortterm debt which consists solely of foreign borrowings decreased from 499 million  at december 31 2012  to 71 million  at december 31 2013  

statement of cash flows 

cash provided by operating activities was 3788 million  4223 million  and 5060 million  for 2013  2012  and 2011  respectively 

the table below presents the components of net cash provided by operating activities 



 

 31 

 

cash required by operating activities of discontinued operations was 501 million  626 million  and 1247 million  for 2013  2012  and 2011  respectively 

the decrease from 2012 to 2013 is primarily due to reduced spending associated with our discounted restructuring activities the spending decrease from 2011 to 2012 was directly associated with the exit of our discontinued huevla spain  fmc peroxygens operations in the fourth quarter of 2010 we exited our huelva operations and most of the spending associated with the exit was spent in 2011 additionally in 2011 amounts included the 44 million payment associated with the european union fine 

cash required by investing activities was 6285 million  3636 million  and 3020 million  for 2013  2012  and 2011  respectively 

the increase in spending during the year ended december 31 2013 as compared to the same period in 2012 was primarily due to the epax acquisition completed in the third quarter of 2013 and higher spending on capital expenditures compared to 2012 increased spending from 2011 to 2012 is primarily due to higher capital spending associated with capital expansions primarily in our health and nutrition segment and our alkali and lithium divisions and as well as increased expenditures related to our fmc agricultural solutions segment contract manufacturers see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included within this form 10k for more information on our acquisitions 

cash provided required by financing activities was 3712 million  482 million  and 253 million  in 2013  2012  and 2011  respectively 

the change in financing activities is primarily due to borrowings under our commercial paper cp program which was implemented during the second quarter of 2013 and the issuance of 400 million in senior notes in the fourth quarter of 2013 these borrowings were partially offset by repayments of borrowings under our committed credit facility the acquisition of an additional 625 ownership interest in our consolidated entity fmc wyoming and higher dividends paid and share repurchases compared to 2012 the change in 2012 as compared to 2011 was primarily due to lower proceeds from long term debt borrowings slightly offset by higher borrowings under our credit facility and lower repayments of scheduled long term debt maturities 

other potential liquidity needs 

our cash needs for 2014 include operating cash requirements capital expenditures scheduled mandatory payments of longterm debt dividend payments share repurchases contributions to our pension plans environmental and asset retirement obligation spending and restructuring we plan to meet our liquidity needs through available cash cash generated from operations commercial paper issuances and borrowings under our committed revolving credit facility at december 31 2013  our remaining borrowing capacity under our credit facility was 7708 million  which includes borrowings under our commercial paper program 

in december 2013 we signed a definitive agreement to sell fmc peroxygens for 200 million we expect the sale to be completed in first quarter of 2014 we intend to use the proceeds to pay down our short term debt borrowings 

projected 2014 capital expenditures as well as expenditures related to contract manufacturers are expected to be approximately 15 percent higher than 2013 levels primarily to increase capacity in our fmc health and nutrition segment and our alkali division within our fmc minerals segment 

projected 2014 spending includes approximately 35 million of net environmental remediation spending this spending does not include expected spending of approximately 10 million in 2014 on capital projects relating to environmental control facilities also we expect to spend approximately 30 million in 2014 for environmental compliance costs which we will include as a component of costs of sales and services in our consolidated statements of income since these amounts are not covered by established reserves capital spending to expand maintain or replace equipment at our production facilities may trigger requirements for upgrading our environmental controls which may increase our spending for environmental controls over the foregoing projections 

our us pension plan assets increased significantly from 9840 million at december 31 2012 to 11929 million at december 31 2013  due to stock market performance our us pension plan assets comprise approximately 93 percent of our total plan assets with the difference representing plan assets related to foreign pension plans see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements included within this form 10k for details on how we develop our longterm rate of return assumptions we made contributions of 40 million and 65 million in 2013 and 2012 respectively and intend to contribute 50 million in 2014 our contributions in 2012 2013 and our intended contribution in 2014 are all in excess of the minimum requirements our contributions in excess of the minimum requirement are done with the objective of reducing future funding volatility we do not believe that this additional 

contribution in 2014 will have a material impact on our current and future liquidity needs however volatility of interest rates and equity returns may require greater contributions in the future 

on april 23 2013 our boardauthorized the repurchase of up to 500 million  of our common shares this repurchase program does not include a specific timetable or price targets and may be suspended or terminated at any time shares may be purchased through open market or privately negotiated transactions at the discretion of management based on its evaluation of market conditions and other factors the authorization on april 23 2013 replaced the previous authority under which 1349 million  was unused we also reacquire shares from time to time from employees in connection with the vesting exercise and forfeiture of awards under our equity compensation plans during the year ended december 31 2013 we repurchased 4998843 shares under the publicly announced repurchase program for 3599 million at december 31 2013 250 million remained unused under our boardauthorized repurchase program 

commitments 

we provide guarantees to financial institutions on behalf of certain fmc agricultural solutions customers principally brazilian customers for their seasonal borrowing the total of these guarantees was 279 million  and 314 million  at december 31 2013  and 2012  respectively and are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets for each date as “guarantees of vendor financing” 

shortterm debt consisted of foreign credit lines at december 31 2013  and 2012  we provide parentcompany guarantees to lending institutions providing credit to our foreign subsidiaries 

we continually evaluate our options for divesting real estate holdings and property plant and equipment that are no longer integral to our operating businesses in connection with our property and asset sales and divestitures we have agreed to indemnify the buyer for certain liabilities including environmental contamination and taxes that occurred prior to the date of sale our indemnification obligations with respect to these liabilities may be indefinite as to duration and may or may not be subject to a deductible minimum claim amount or cap as such it is not possible for us to predict the likelihood that a claim will be made or to make a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential loss or range of loss if triggered we may be able to recover certain of the indemnity payments from third parties we have not recorded any specific liabilities for these guarantees 

our total significant committed contracts that we believe will affect cash over the next four years and beyond are as follows

climate change 

we continue to follow legislative and regulatory developments regarding climate change because the regulation of greenhouse gases depending on their nature and scope could subject some of our manufacturing operations to additional costs or limits on operations our alkali chemicals division mines and refines trona ore into soda ash and related products at our westvaco and granger facilities near green river wyoming this activity constitutes most of fmcs greenhouse gas emissions globally in 2013 we reported approximately 22 million metric tons of direct emissions from the green river operations for 2012 as part of the epa greenhouse gas reporting program 

in the absence of federal climate change legislation in the united states epa has moved forward with a finding of “endangerment” and a promulgated “tailoring rule” to apply the prevention of significant deterioration psd provisions of the clean air act to greenhouse gas emissions pursuant to the tailoring rule fmc has submitted a psd application for a proposed project for one of our wyoming facilities and epa has issued a draft permit a significant source of greenhouse gas emissions at the green river operations are emissions from the beneficiation of trona ore that is a significant portion of the greenhouse gases released during the mining and refining of soda ash occurs naturally in the trona ore feedstock unlike the situation with energy efficiency where efficiencies may result in a reduction of greenhouse gases the amount of greenhouse gases present in the trona ore cannot be reduced all of the companies producing natural soda ash have such refining emissions yet the lower energy intensity of natural soda ash provides a favorable carbon intensity compared with synthetic soda ash produced throughout the rest of the world soda ash is an essential raw material in the production of glass of all kinds climate change energy intensity and alternative forms of energy will drive increased production of new forms of glass lower emissivity glass solar panel glass etc and will increase the need for this essential raw material from fmc the soda ash industry has an interest in assuring that climate change legislation or regulation recognizes the benefits of soda ash particularly natural soda ash and the challenges facing this industry in controlling its greenhouse gas emissions 

because of the many variables it is premature to make any estimate of the costs of complying with possible future federal climate change legislation in the united states however we are aware of the potential impacts that could result from emissions regulations in the us that are more stringent than those experienced by our global competitors these could make it more difficult for us to competitively produce natural soda ash at green river a reduction in natural soda ash production as a result of more stringent regulations in the us would lead to more greenhouse gas emissions globally because the lost supply of natural soda ash would be replaced by the more costly and more greenhouse gas intensive synthetic soda ash 

in 2013 two us plants in our health  nutrition business also reported emissions above the epas reporting threshold but each plants emissions are substantially less than at our green river operations in total less than 01 million metric tons 

at this point our us facilities are not subject to any state or regional greenhouse gas regulation that limits or imposes fees on current emissions and while some of our foreign operations may be subject to national or local energy management or climate change regulation the cost to these facilities has not been and is not expected to be material to fmc 

we have considered the potential physical risks to fmc facilities and operations and the indirect consequences of regulation or business trends as a result of potential future climate change we routinely assess our facilities for potential natural hazard exposures and do not expect material impacts based on currently available information 

recently adopted and issued accounting pronouncements and regulatory items 

see note 2 recently issued and adopted accounting pronouncements and regulatory items to our consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k 

critical accounting policies 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles us gaap  the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses we have described our accounting policies in note 1 principal accounting policies and related financial information to our consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k we have reviewed these accounting policies identifying those that we believe to be critical to the preparation and understanding of our consolidated financial statements we have reviewed these critical accounting policies with the audit committee of the board of directors critical accounting policies are central to our presentation of results of operations and financial condition in accordance with us gaap and require management to make estimates and judgments on certain matters we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience current conditions and other reasonable factors 

environmental obligations and related recoveries 

we provide for environmentalrelated obligations when they are probable and amounts can be reasonably estimated where the available information is sufficient to estimate the amount of liability that estimate has been used where the information is only sufficient to establish a range of probable liability and no point within the range is more likely than any other the lower end of the range has been used 

estimated obligations to remediate sites that involve oversight by the united states environmental protection agency “epa” or similar government agencies are generally accrued no later than when a record of decision “rod” or equivalent is issued or upon completion of a remedial investigationfeasibility study “rifs” or equivalent that is submitted by us to the appropriate government agency or agencies estimates are reviewed quarterly by our environmental remediation management as well as by financial and legal management and if necessary adjusted as additional information becomes available the estimates can change substantially as additional information becomes available regarding the nature or extent of site contamination required remediation methods and other actions by or against governmental agencies or private parties 

our environmental liabilities for continuing and discontinued operations are principally for costs associated with the remediation andor study of sites at which we are alleged to have released hazardous substances into the environment such costs principally include among other items rifs site remediation costs of operation and maintenance of the remediation plan management costs fees to outside law firms and consultants for work related to the environmental effort and future monitoring costs estimated site liabilities are determined based upon existing remediation laws and technologies specific site consultants’ engineering studies or by extrapolating experience with environmental issues at comparable sites 

included in our environmental liabilities are costs for the operation maintenance and monitoring of site remediation plans omm such reserves are based on our best estimates for these omm plans over time we may incur omm costs in excess of these reserves however we are unable to reasonably estimate an amount in excess of our recorded reserves because we cannot reasonably estimate the period for which such omm plans will need to be in place or the future annual cost of such remediation as conditions at these environmental sites change over time such additional omm costs could be significant in total but would be incurred over an extended period of years 

included in the environmental reserve balance other assets balance and disclosure of reasonably possible loss contingencies are amounts from third party insurance policies which we believe are probable of recovery 

provisions for environmental costs are reflected in income net of probable and estimable recoveries from named potentially responsible parties “prps” or other third parties such provisions incorporate inflation and are not discounted to their present values 

in calculating and evaluating the adequacy of our environmental reserves we have taken into account the joint and several liability imposed by comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act “cercla” and the analogous state laws on all prps and have considered the identity and financial condition of the other prps at each site to the extent possible we have also considered the identity and financial condition of other third parties from whom recovery is anticipated as well as the status of our claims against such parties although we are unable to forecast the ultimate contributions of prps and other third parties with absolute certainty the degree of uncertainty with respect to each party is taken into account when determining the environmental reserve by adjusting the reserve to reflect the facts and circumstances on a sitebysite basis our liability includes our best estimate of the costs expected to be paid before the consideration of any potential recoveries from third parties we believe that any recorded recoveries related to prps are realizable in all material respects recoveries are recorded as either an offset in “environmental liabilities continuing and discontinued” or as “other assets” in our consolidated balance sheets in accordance with us accounting literature 

see note 10 to our consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k for changes in estimates associated with our environmental obligations 

impairments and valuation of longlived assets 

our longlived assets primarily include property plant and equipment goodwill and intangible assets the assets and liabilities of acquired businesses are measured at their estimated fair values at the dates of acquisition the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired including identified intangibles is recorded as goodwill the determination and allocation of fair value to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is based on various assumptions and valuation methodologies requiring considerable management judgment including estimates based on historical information current market data and future expectations the principal assumptions utilized in our valuation methodologies include revenue growth rates operating margin estimates and discount rates although the estimates were deemed reasonable by management based on information available at the dates of acquisition those estimates are inherently uncertain 

we test for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the net book value of our property plant and equipment may not be recoverable from the estimated undiscounted expected future cash flows expected to result from their use and eventual disposition in cases where the estimated undiscounted expected future cash flows are less than net book value an impairment loss is recognized equal to the amount by which the net book value exceeds the estimated fair value of assets which is based on discounted cash flows at the lowest level determinable the estimated cash flows reflect our assumptions about selling prices volumes costs and market conditions over a reasonable period of time 

we perform an annual impairment test of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets in the third quarter of each year or more frequently whenever an event or change in circumstances occur that would require reassessment of the recoverability of those assets in performing our evaluation we assess qualitative factors such as overall financial performance of our reporting units anticipated changes in industry and market structure competitive environments planned capacity and cost factors such as raw material prices based on our assessment for 2013 we determined that no impairment charge to our continuing operations was required 

see note 7 to our consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k for charges associated with longlived asset disposal costs and the activity associated with the restructuring reserves 

pension and other postretirement benefits 

we provide qualified and nonqualified defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans as well as postretirement health care and life insurance benefit plans to our employees and retirees the costs benefits and obligations related to these benefits reflect key assumptions related to general economic conditions including interest discount rates healthcare cost trend rates expected rates of return on plan assets and the rates of compensation increase for employees the costs benefits and obligations for these benefit programs are also affected by other assumptions such as average retirement age mortality employee turnover and plan participation to the extent our plans’ actual experience as influenced by changing economic and financial market conditions or by changes to our own plans’ demographics differs from these assumptions the costs and obligations for providing these benefits as well as the plans’ funding requirements could increase or decrease when actual results differ from our assumptions the difference is typically recognized over future periods in addition the unrealized gains and losses related to our pension and postretirement benefit obligations may also affect periodic benefit costs benefits in future periods 

we use several assumptions and statistical methods to determine the asset values used to calculate both the expected rate of return on assets component of pension cost and to calculate our plans’ funding requirements the expected rate of return on plan assets is based on a marketrelated value of assets that recognizes investment gains and losses over a fiveyear period we use an actuarial value of assets to determine our plans’ funding requirements the actuarial value of assets must be within a certain range high or low of the actual market value of assets and is adjusted accordingly 

we select the discount rate used to calculate pension and other postretirement obligations based on a review of available yields on highquality corporate bonds as of the measurement date in selecting a discount rate as of december 31 2013 we placed particular emphasis on a discount rate yieldcurve provided by our actuary this yieldcurve when populated with projected cash flows that represented the expected timing and amount of our plans benefit payments produced a single effective interest discount rate of 495 percent  which was used to measure the plans liabilities 

the discount rates used at our december 31 2013  and 2012  measurement dates were 495 percent  and 415 percent  respectively the effect of the change in the discount rate from 415 percent  to 495 percent  at december 31 2013  resulted in a 1213 million decrease to our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations the effect of the change in the discount rate from 495 percent at december 31 2011 to 415 percent at december 31 2012 resulted in a 127 million increase to 2013  pension and other postretirement benefit expense 

the change in discount rate from 415 percent  at december 31 2012  to 495 percent  at december 31 2013  was attributable to a increase in yields on high quality corporate bonds with cash flows matching the timing and amount of our expected future benefit payments between the 2012  and 2013  measurement dates using the december 31 2012  yield curve our plan cash flows produced a single weightedaverage discount rate of approximately 415 percent  matching our plan cash flows to a similarly constructed curve reflecting highyielding bonds available as of december 31 2013  resulted in a single weightedaverage discount rate of approximately 495 percent  

in developing the assumption for the longterm rate of return on assets for our us plan we take into consideration the technical analysis performed by our outside actuaries including historical market returns information on the assumption for longterm real returns by asset class inflation assumptions and expectations for standard deviation related to these best estimates we also consider the historical performance of our own plan’s trust which has earned a compound annual rate of return of approximately 990 percent  over the last 20 years which is in excess of comparable market indices for the same period as well as other factors which are discussed in note 13 to our consolidated financial statements in this form 10k our longterm rate of return for 2013  and 2012  was 775 percent  which we adjusted downward from 850 percent  in 2011  the effect of the change in the longterm rate of return from 85 percent during 2011 to 775 percent during 2012 resulted in a 64 million increase to 2012 pension and other postretirement benefit expense 

for the sensitivity of our pension costs to incremental changes in assumptions see our discussion below 

sensitivity analysis related to key pension and postretirement benefit assumptions 

a onehalf percent increase in the assumed discount rate would have decreased pension and other postretirement benefit obligations by 672 million and 778 million at december 31 2013  and 2012  respectively and decreased pension and other postretirement benefit costs by 58 million 82 million and 65 million for 2013  2012  and 2011  respectively a onehalf percent decrease in the assumed discount rate would have increased pension and other postretirement benefit obligations by 739 million and 857 million at december 31 2013  and 2012  respectively and increased pension and other postretirement benefit net periodic benefit cost by 62 million 84 million and 66 million for 2013  2012  and 2011  respectively 

a onehalf percent increase in the assumed expected longterm rate of return on plan assets would have decreased pension costs by 48 million 47 million and 46 million for 2013  2012  and 2011  respectively a onehalf percent decrease in the assumed longterm rate of return on plan assets would have increased pension costs by 48 million 47 million and 46 million for 2013  2012  and 2011  respectively 

further details on our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and net periodic benefit costs benefits are found in note 13 to our consolidated financial statements in this form 10k 

income taxes 

we have recorded a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized in assessing the need for this allowance we have considered a number of factors including future taxable income the jurisdictions in which such income is earned and our ongoing tax planning strategies in the event that we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period such determination was made similarly should we conclude that we would be able to realize certain deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase income in the period such determination was made 

additionally we file income tax returns in the us federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions the income tax returns for fmc entities taxable in the us and significant foreign jurisdictions are open for examination and adjustment we assess our income tax positions and record a liability for all years open to examination based upon our evaluation of the facts circumstances and information available at the reporting date for those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained we have recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information we adjust these liabilities if necessary upon the completion of tax audits or changes in tax law 

see note 11 to our consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k for additional discussion surrounding income taxes 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we do not have any offbalance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition revenues or expenses results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors 

dividends 

on january 16 2014  we paid dividends aggregating 180 million  to our shareholders of record as of december 31 2013  this amount is included in “accrued and other liabilities” on the consolidated balance sheets as of december 31 2013  for the years ended december 31 2013  2012  and 2011  we paid 736 million  478 million  and 412 million  in dividends respectively

 item 7a 

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend our earnings cash flows and financial position are exposed to market risks relating to fluctuations in commodity prices interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates our policy is to minimize exposure to our cash flow over time caused by changes in commodity interest and currency exchange rates to accomplish this we have implemented a controlled program of risk management consisting of appropriate derivative contracts entered into with major financial institutions 

the analysis below presents the sensitivity of the market value of our financial instruments to selected changes in market rates and prices the range of changes chosen reflects our view of changes that are reasonably possible over a oneyear period marketvalue estimates are based on the present value of projected future cash flows considering the market rates and prices chosen 

at december 31 2013  our net financial instrument position was a net liability of 64 million  compared to a net liability of 22 million  at december 31 2012  the change in the net financial instrument position was primarily due to lower unrealized losses in our commodity and foreign exchange portfolios 

since our risk management programs are generally highly effective the potential loss in value for each risk management portfolio described below would be largely offset by changes in the value of the underlying exposure 

commodity price risk 

energy costs are diversified among coal electricity and natural gas we attempt to mitigate our exposure to increasing energy costs by hedging the cost of future deliveries of natural gas and by entering into fixedprice contracts for the purchase of coal and fuel oil to analyze the effect of changing energy prices we have performed a sensitivity analysis in which we assume an instantaneous 10 percent change in energy market prices from their levels at december 31 2013  and 2012  with all other variables including interest rates held constant 



our fmc agricultural solutions segment enters into contracts with certain customers in brazil to exchange our products for future physical delivery of soybeans to mitigate the price risk associated with these barter contracts we enter into offsetting derivatives to hedge our exposure as of december 31 2013  and 2012  our net financial instrument position was immaterial 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

the primary currencies for which we have exchange rate exposure are the us dollar versus the euro the us dollar versus the chinese yuan the us dollar versus the brazilian real and the us dollar versus the argentine peso foreign currency debt and foreign exchange forward contracts are used in countries where we do business thereby reducing our net asset exposure foreign exchange forward contracts are also used to hedge firm and highly anticipated foreign currency cash flows 

to analyze the effects of changing foreign currency rates we have performed a sensitivity analysis in which we assume an instantaneous 10 percent change in the foreign currency exchange rates from their levels at december 31 2013  and 2012  with all other variables including interest rates held constant 



interest rate risk 

one of the strategies that we can use to manage interest rate exposure is to enter into interest rate swap agreements in these agreements we agree to exchange at specified intervals the difference between fixed and variable interest amounts calculated on an agreedupon notional principal amount as of december 31 2013  and 2012  we had no interest rate swap agreements 

our debt portfolio at december 31 2013  is composed of 63 percent fixedrate debt and 37 percent variablerate debt the variablerate component of our debt portfolio principally consists of borrowings under our commercial paper program credit facility variablerate industrial and pollution control revenue bonds and amounts outstanding under foreign subsidiary credit lines changes in interest rates affect different portions of our variablerate debt portfolio in different ways 

based on the variablerate debt in our debt portfolio at december 31 2013  a one percentage point increase in interest rates would have increased gross interest expense by 68 million and a one percentage point decrease in interest rates would have decreased gross interest expense by 23 million for the year ended december 31 2013

the following table shows the principal products produced by our three business segments and their raw materials and uses 

  



we have operations in many areas around the world with a worldwide manufacturing and distribution infrastructure we are able to respond rapidly to global customer needs offset downward economic trends in one region with positive trends in another and match local revenues to local costs to mitigate the impact of currency volatility the charts below detail our sales and longlived assets by major geographic region 

our strategy 

since 2010 we have invested significant resources and managerial time in the development and implementation of a new strategic plan for the company this corporate strategy which we refer to as vision 2015 is focused on driving sales and earnings growth while sustaining a return on invested capital well above our cost of capital this strategys objective is to achieve a total shareholder return in the top quartile of a broad group of industry peers vision 2015 has five key elements 

growing leadership positions  we intend to continue to build and strengthen our market leading positions by executing a plan that relies primarily on organic growth complemented by a focused external growth strategy we benefit from a business portfolio that is exposed to faster growing end markets and geographic regions agricultural products’ organic growth plan focuses on market and product innovations while strengthening market access specialty chemicals’ organic focus is primarily on new products and new applications for existing products industrial chemicals’ focus is on new applications for existing chemistries to complement these organic growth initiatives our external growth strategy employs a focused disciplined approach to company product and technology acquisitions we believe this strategy reduces the risk normally inherent in external growth agricultural products intends to complement its organic growth initiatives by acquiring new products and technologies as well as making selective acquisitions to strengthen market access and enter adjacent spaces in specialty chemicals the food ingredients market is our top priority for acquisitions that will expand our product line offerings and positions in rapidlydeveloping economies industrial chemicals will evaluate selective acquisitions focused in specialty applications across all businesses our strategy excludes making large scale complex or transformational acquisitions or adding another business platform to our portfolio through acquisition 

increasing our reach  we intend to bias our growth initiatives toward further strengthening our positions in rapidlydeveloping economies rdes our growth in latin america will be largely driven by leveraging agricultural products’ leadership positions in asia our growth initiatives will be more broadbased with targeted investments in human scientific and technological resources across our businesses in the region in central and eastern europe turkey and russia we will focus on establishing strong footholds in key countries 

capturing the value of common ownership  we are moving from a highly decentralized organizational model to one that has both centralized and decentralized qualities we believe this shift will enable us to better leverage the size and scope of our company to realize cost savings and increase efficiencies yet maintain strong accountability in our business units our efforts to date have focused on such areas as procurement strategic planning mergers and acquisitions communications global supply chain and rde infrastructure 

proactively managing our portfolio  we continually assess the performance of all of our business units and will take actions as needed should a unit’s performance change within our businesses we continue to evaluate the performance of specific product lines and have taken action where a product line has become nonstrategic or economically unsustainable such as the exit in 2011 of the sodium percarbonate product line and of the zeolites product line in 2012 

disciplined cash deployment  under our vision 2015 plan we expect to fund our growth strategies and return a significant amount of cash to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividends 

underlying our ambition to deliver our vision 2015 plan is a continued commitment to enterprise sustainability including responsible stewardship as we grow we will do so in a responsible way safety is and will remain of utmost importance meeting and exceeding our customers’ expectations will continue to be a primary focus we will as always conduct our business in an ethical manner in 2012 we published our inaugural sustainability report which provides an overview of our sustainability effects and progress

    overview 

our industrial chemicals segment which represents 29 percent  of our 2012  consolidated revenues primarily participates in the following markets alkali peroxygens and environmental solutions we have lowcost positions in high volume inorganic chemicals including soda ash and hydrogen peroxide complemented by high value niche positions in specialty alkali and specialty peroxygens product lines we process and sell refined inorganic products that are sought by customers for their critical reactivity or specific functionality in markets such as glass detergents chemicals and pulp and paper 

products and markets 

      

alkali 

our alkali chemicals division produces natural soda ash soda ash is used by manufacturers in glass chemical processing and detergent industries to lesser degrees we also produce sodium bicarbonate caustic soda and sodium sesquicarbonate the majority of our alkali sales are manufactured by and sold through fmc wyoming corporation which we manage as an integral part of our alkali business and in which we own shares representing an 875 percent economic interest with the remaining shares held by two japanese companies 

peroxygens 

our primary peroxygen product is hydrogen peroxide which comprises 60 percent of our peroxygen sales hydrogen peroxide is sold into the pulp and paper chemical processing environmental electronics and food industries we also produce specialty peroxygens which include persulfate salts and peracetic acid persulfates are primarily sold to polymer energy recovery printed circuit board hair care and soil remediation markets peracetic acid is predominantly supplied to the food industry for biocidal applications

industry overview 

industrial chemicals serves a diverse group of markets from economicallysensitive industrial sectors to technologyintensive specialty markets our product offerings are primarily inorganic and are generally commodities that in many cases have few costeffective substitutes growth is typically a function of industrial production in developed economies and a function of the rate of industrialization in developing economies 

alkali 

natural soda ash is typically produced from trona ore through mining and chemical processing soda ash may also be produced synthetically but requires significantly more energy and produces large quantities of waste byproducts making it much less costeffective than natural soda ash production due to the processing cost advantages of mining trona and the large natural reserves of trona ore in the us particularly in the green river basin of wyoming all us soda ash is naturally produced by contrast due to a lack of trona ore the majority of the soda ash that is manufactured in the rest of the world is produced synthetically other us producers are oci chemical corporation church  dwight solvay sa the general chemical group inc in which a majority stake is owned by tata chemicals limited and nirma limited 

peroxygens 

the pulp and paper industry represents approximately 60 percent of demand for hydrogen peroxide in north america and europe in these markets hydrogen peroxide is used as an environmentally friendly bleaching agent to brighten chemical mechanical and recycled pulps as well as to treat a wide range of mill pollutants in the waste stream the north american and european paper markets are mature and new investment in pulp and paper capacity is largely focused in asia and south america the other north american and european hydrogen peroxide producers are eka a wholly owned subsidiary of akzo nobel nv arkema inc evonik industries ag kemira ovj and solvay sa 

environmental solutions 

this industry serves the growing pollution prevention and remediation market we are focused on a 3 billion market space that is growing driven by regulations technology substitutions and rapidly developing economies 

source and availability of raw materials 

our raw material requirements vary by business segment and primarily include mineralrelated natural resources trona ore and lithium brines processed chemicals seaweed specialty wood pulps and energy sources such as gas coal oil and electricity during 2012 no individual raw material represented more than five percent of our total raw material purchases additionally during 2012 no significant difficulties were encountered in obtaining adequate supplies of our raw materials 

we extract ores used in industrial chemicals’ manufacturing processes from mines eg trona ore in north america raw materials used by specialty chemicals include lithium brines various types of seaweed and natural colorant raw materials that are sourced on a global basis and specialty pulps which are purchased from selected global producers raw materials used by agricultural products primarily processed chemicals are obtained from a variety of suppliers worldwide 

patents 

we own a number of us and foreign patents trademarks and licenses that are cumulatively important to our business we do not believe that the loss of any individual or combination of related patents trademarks or licenses would have a material adverse effect on the overall business of fmc the duration of our patents depends on their respective jurisdictions their expiration dates range through 2032 

seasonality 

the seasonal nature of the crop protection market and the geographic spread of the agricultural products business can result in significant variations in quarterly earnings among geographic locations agricultural products sold into the northern hemisphere north america europe and parts of asia serve seasonal agricultural markets from march through september generally resulting in earnings in the first second and third quarters markets in the southern hemisphere latin america and parts of the asia pacific region including australia are served from july through february generally resulting in earnings in the third fourth and first quarters the remainder of our business is generally not subject to significant seasonal fluctuations 

competition 

we have a number one or number two market position in many of our product lines based on revenue either globally or in north america largely as a result of our product offerings proprietary technologies and our position as a lowcost producer the following product lines accounted for the majority of our 2012  consolidated revenue market positions are based on the most recently available revenue data 

  



we encounter substantial competition in each of our three business segments we market our products through our own sales organization and through alliance partners independent distributors and sales representatives the number of our principal competitors varies from segment to segment in general we compete by operating in a costefficient manner and by leveraging our industry experience to provide advanced technology high product quality and reliability and quality customer and technical service 

our agricultural products segment competes primarily in the global chemical crop protection market for insecticides herbicides and fungicides industry products include crop protection chemicals and for certain major competitors genetically engineered crop biotechnology products competition from generic agrochemical producers is significant as a number of key product patents held industrywide have expired in the last decade in general we compete as an innovator by focusing on product development including novel formulations proprietary mixes and advanced delivery systems and by acquiring or licensing mostly proprietary chemistries or technologies that complement our product and geographic focus we also differentiate ourselves by our global costcompetitiveness via our manufacturing strategies establishing effective product stewardship programs and developing strategic alliances that strengthen market access in key countries and regions 

our specialty chemicals segment has significant positions in markets that include alginate carrageenan microcrystalline cellulose and lithiumbased products we compete on the basis of product differentiation market applications expertise customer service and price biopolymer competes with both direct suppliers of cellulose and seaweed extract as well as suppliers of other hydrocolloids which may provide similar functionality in specific applications in microcrystalline cellulose competitors are typically smaller than us while in seaweed extracts carrageenan and alginates we compete with other broadbased chemical companies we and each of our two most significant competitors in lithium extract the element from naturally occurring lithiumrich brines located in the andes mountains of argentina and chile which are believed to be the world’s most significant and lowest cost sources of lithium 

our industrial chemicals segment serves the soda ash markets worldwide the peroxygens markets predominantly in north america and europe and the site remediation market in the united states in north america our soda ash business competes with four domestic producers of natural soda ash three of which operate in the vicinity of our mine and processing facilities 

near green river wyoming outside of the us canada europe and south africa we sell soda ash mainly through the american natural soda ash corporation ansac internationally our natural soda ash competes with synthetic soda ash manufactured by numerous producers ranging from integrated multinational companies to smaller regional companies we maintain a leading position in the north american market for hydrogen peroxide particularly in specialty segments there are currently four other firms competing in the hydrogen peroxide market in north america but most of them focus primarily on the commodity pulp and paper segment the primary competitive factor affecting the sales of soda ash and hydrogen peroxide to commodity markets is price we seek to maintain our competitive position by employing low cost processing technology we possess strong cost and market positions in our european peroxygens business in each of these markets we face significant competition from a range of multinational and regional chemical producers we are the only producer of persulfates in the americas but face competition from imports from germany japan taiwan and india in the european persulfates market we compete with two domestic firms as well as imports from china taiwan and india in both regions chinese imports are constrained by the presence of antidumping duties 

research and development expense 

we perform research and development in all of our segments with the majority of our efforts focused in the agricultural products segment the development efforts in the agricultural products segment focus on developing environmentally sound solutions and new product formulations that costeffectively increase farmers’ yields and provide alternatives to existing and new chemistries our research and development expenses in the last three years are set forth below

legal proceedings 

tableend 

like hundreds of other industrial companies we have been named as one of many defendants in asbestosrelated personal injury litigation most of these cases allege personal injury or death resulting from exposure to asbestos in premises of fmc or to asbestoscontaining components installed in machinery or equipment manufactured or sold by discontinued operations the machinery and equipment businesses we owned or operated did not fabricate the asbestoscontaining component parts at issue in the litigation and to this day neither the us occupational safety and health administration nor the environmental protection agency has banned the use of these components further the asbestoscontaining parts for this machinery and equipment were accessible only at the time of infrequent repair and maintenance a few jurisdictions have permitted claims to proceed against equipment manufacturers relating to insulation installed by other companies on such machinery and equipment we believe that overall the claims against fmc are without merit 

as of december 31 2012 there were appr oximately 12100 premises and product asbestos claims pending against fmc in several jurisdictions since the 1980s approximately 101000 asbestos claims against fmc have been discharged the overwhelming majority of which have been dismissed without any payment to the claimant settlements by us with claimants have totaled approximately 52 million 

we intend to continue managing these asbestosrelated cases in accordance with our historical experience we have established a reserve for this litigation within our discontinued operations and believe that any exposure of a loss in excess of the established reserve cannot be reasonably estimated our experience has been that the overall trends in terms of the rate of filing of asbestosrelated claims with respect to all potential defendants has changed over time and that filing rates as to us in particular have varied significantly over the last several years we are a peripheral defendant  that is we have never manufactured asbestos or asbestoscontaining components as a result claim filing rates against us have yet to form a predictable pattern and we are unable to project a reasonably accurate future filing rate and thus we are presently unable to reasonably estimate our asbestos liability with respect to claims that may be filed in the future

overview 

we are a diversified chemical company serving agricultural consumer and industrial markets globally with innovative solutions applications and marketleading products we operate in three distinct business segments agricultural products specialty chemicals and industrial chemicals our agricultural products segment develops markets and sells all three major classes of crop protection chemicals – insecticides herbicides and fungicides – with particular strength in insecticides and herbicides these products are used in agriculture to enhance crop yield and quality by controlling a broad spectrum of insects weeds and disease as well as pest control in nonagricultural markets specialty chemicals consists of our biopolymer and lithium businesses this segment focuses on food ingredients that are used to enhance texture color structure and physical stability pharmaceutical additives for binding encapsulation and disintegrant applications ultrapure biopolymers for medical devices and lithium for energy storage specialty polymers and pharmaceutical synthesis our industrial chemicals segment manufactures a wide range of inorganic materials including soda ash hydrogen peroxide specialty peroxygens and silicates this segment serves a diverse group of markets from economicallysensitive industrial sectors to technologyintensive specialty markets the products in this segment are sought by customers for their critical reactivity or specific functionality in markets such as glass detergents chemicals and pulp and paper 

2012 highlights 

the following are the more significant developments in our businesses during the year ended december 31 2012 

 22 

products see the disclosure of our adjusted earnings nongaap financial measurement below under the section titled “results of operations”  

 additionally in january 2013 we implemented a plan to restructure a portion of the operations in lithium the objective of the restructuring was to better align our business and costs to macroeconomic and market realities the restructuring decision will result in workforce reductions at several of our lithium facilities primarily north carolina and argentina we expect to incur charges between 1015 million mostly in the first quarter of 2013 these charges will primarily result in cash spending 

 

2013 outlook 

in 2013 we expect another year of record performance we expect higher revenues in all three of our segments increased volumes in all regions due to strong market conditions growth from new or recently introduced products as well as direct market access initiatives will drive higher revenues in agricultural products higher volumes in biopolymer will drive increased special chemicals revenue and higher prices in soda ash projected in the second half of 2013 are anticipated to drive higher industrial chemicals sales 

we expect an increase in earnings mostly driven by higher sales as discussed above our projected increase in earnings is expected to be partially offset by higher spending on growth initiatives we expect cash flow from our business segments to remain strong

segment results 

for management purposes segment operating profit is defined as segment revenue less segment operating expenses segment operating expenses consist of costs of sales and services selling general and administrative expenses and research and development expenses we have excluded the following items from segment operating profit corporate staff expense interest income and expense associated with corporate debt facilities and investments income taxes gains or losses on divestitures of businesses restructuring and other charges income nonoperating pension and postretirement charges investment gains and losses loss on extinguishment of debt asset impairments lastin firstout “lifo” inventory adjustments acquisition related charges and other income and expense items 

information about how each of these items relates to our businesses at the segment level and results by segment are discussed below and in note 19 to our consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k 

effective in fiscal year 2013 our segment presentations including allocation of certain corporate expenses were updated to reflect how we currently make financial decisions and allocate resources the presentation change is also being made since we believe the changes provide a better understanding of the underlying profitability of each individual business segment the changes were the following 

 

this segment presentation change effective january 1 2013 is not incorporated into the segment results as discussed below however the 2013 outlook discussions for each segment below include revenue growth and operating profit projections which reflect this new segment presentation on a comparable basis 

agricultural products 

  



2012 vs 2011 

revenue of 17638 million  increased approximately 20 percent versus the prior year period due to strong sales across all regions the increase in revenue for the year ended december 31 2012 was also attributable to acquisitions that 

closed in the second half of 2011 of approximately 60 million 

sales in north america improved by 30 percent to 3685 million reflecting favorable market conditions strong demand for our proprietary herbicides and insecticides and growth from new or recently introduced products latin america revenue of 9605 million increased 23 percent reflecting strong market conditions in brazil driven by key crops such as sugarcane and soybeans increased planted acres and sales from our new market access joint venture ruralco in argentina revenue in asia of 2757 million increased 12 percent as a result of growth in recently launched and acquired products coupled with growth in china indonesia and the philippines emea revenues of 1591 million increased five percent driven by higher herbicide sales in europe and insecticide volume gains in africa 

agricultural products operating profit of 4507 million  increased approximately 29 percent compared to the prior year reflecting the broadbased sales growth and targeted price increases this increase was partially offset by a 517 million increase in selling general and administrative costs mainly for focused growth initiatives and increased peoplerelated costs to support the higher sales segment earnings were also impacted by higher research and development costs of 111 million due to increased spending associated with various innovation projects 

in 2013 we expect fullyear revenue growth in the high teens percent reflecting increased volumes in all regions due to strong market conditions and growth from new and recently introduced products including new fungicide products as well as our direct market access initiatives in asia and latin america we expect fullyear segment operating profit growth in the midteens percent driven by the sales gains partially offset by higher spending on targeted growth initiatives 

certain regulatory issues 

in 2009 our bifenthrin product was excluded from the european commissions official list of approved pesticides we submitted for reconsideration of that decision and in 2012 bifenthrin was reapproved for use in the european union fmc is now in the process of resubmitting for registrations in eu member states we can resume selling bifenthrin in the european market once the registrations are approved by the member states with the exception of france we expect that most registrations will be approved over the next 24 months due to the continued inclusion of bifenthrin on the french “grenelle” list of pesticides we cannot predict when we may regain a french registration we believe that the grenelle listing was unwarranted and contrary to french administrative law and we are challenging the decision during 2013 we will not sell any bifenthrin for agricultural use into the eu similar to the prior year and the absence of such sales will not have a material effect on the companys financial condition or results of operations 

we intend to defend vigorously all our products in the us eu and other countries as our pesticide products are reviewed in the ordinary course of regulatory programs during 2013 as part of the ongoing cycle of reregistration of our pesticide products around the world in 2008 the brazilian health surveillance agency informed us that they intend to review carbofuran along with 13 other major pesticides but has yet to issue any required formal announcement that identifies their specific concerns or preliminary position on reregistration we are cooperating and defending our product in this process under the brazilian regulatory process any recommendation would require public notice and comment as well as concurrence from the brazilian environmental and agricultural ministries before any regulatory change is effective thus we do not expect any material sales impact due to regulatory reviews in brazil during 2013 

2011 vs 2010 

revenue of 14645 million  increased approximately 18 percent versus the prior year period due to strong sales in north america latin america and asia slightly offset by the expected decline in europe middle east and africa emea north america revenue of 2844 million increased 12 percent due to increased volumes as a result of strong market demand for our preemergent herbicides partially offset by unfavorable weather conditions experienced in the second quarter of 2011 latin america revenue of 7825 million increased 25 percent driven by favorable market conditions particularly in brazils sugarcane cotton and soybean markets and growth in planted acres for key crops revenue in asia of 2460 million increased 21 percent reflecting continued strong market conditions particularly in australia china indonesia thailand pakistan and india as expected these increases were partially offset by a decline in emea revenues of four percent to 1516 million the decline was primarily driven by the absence of sales of our bifenthrin product in europe due to the product at the time not being included on the european union official list of approved pesticides for sale 

agricultural products operating profit of 3483 million  increased approximately 13 percent compared to prior year reflecting the strong sales growth partially offset by increased raw material costs and a 245 million or 13 percent increase in selling and administrative expenses for focused growth initiatives higher peoplerelated costs and unfavorable exchange impacts 

specialty chemicals 



2012 vs 2011 

revenue in specialty chemicals was 9138 million  an increase of approximately four percent versus the prior year the increase was driven primarily by higher selling prices across the segment particularly in food pharmaceuticals and lithium primaries markets slightly offset by unfavorable currency impacts revenue for the year ended december 31 2012 included approximately 143 million associated with recently completed acquisitions 

biopolymer revenue of 6808 million  increased approximately four percent from the prior year this increase was due to favorable pricing which impacted sales by six percent and revenue from acquisitions which increased sales by two percent these increases were partially offset by decreased volumes of two percent and unfavorable currency impacts of two percent 

lithium revenue of 2330 million  increased approximately four percent compared to the prior year this increase was due to higher pricing which impacted sales by six percent partially offset by decreased volumes which decreased sales by two percent lithium sales growth was led by higher selling prices in lithium primaries lower volumes also resulted from production downtime in the first quarter of 2012 associated with our capacity expansion in argentina as well as the effect of related operational issues which primarily impacted the first half of 2012 and the extended planned outage in lithiums argentina facility in third quarter 2012 

segment operating profit of 1895 million  decreased five percent versus the prior year higher revenues in both biopolymer and lithium were negatively impacted by increased manufacturing costs primarily in lithium and higher raw material costs throughout the segment selling general and administrative expenses also increased by 90 million to support growth initiatives primarily in biopolymer 

in 2013 we expect fullyear revenue growth in the high single digits percent driven by higher volumes in biopolymer fullyear operating profit growth is expected to be in the high single digit percent reflecting sales gains complemented by improving lithium operating performance partially offset by spending on targeted growth initiatives in biopolymer 

2011 vs 2010 

revenue in specialty chemicals was 8791 million  an increase of approximately seven percent versus the prior year the increase was driven primarily by volume increases and higher pricing in biopolymer and favorable pricing in lithium specialties and favorable currency impacts 

biopolymer revenue of 6543 million increased approximately seven percent from the prior year this increase was due to higher volumes which increased revenue by three percent favorable pricing which impacted sales by two percent and the impact of a stronger euro which accounted for the remaining two percent the volume gains and higher pricing were realized in both the food ingredients and pharmaceutical markets 

lithium revenue of 2248 million increased approximately six percent compared to the prior year currency impacts resulted in a one percent increase in revenue while pricing was up four percent and volumes were flat as compared to prior year 

segment operating profit of 1998 million  increased eight percent versus the prior year the increase was primarily driven by the volume gains higher pricing and favorable mix in biopolymer and favorable pricing in lithium offset by adverse weather conditions in argentina which impacted mining operations selling general and administrative expenses increased by 14 percent or 98 million to support growth initiatives 

industrial chemicals 

  



2012 vs 2011 

revenue in industrial chemicals was 10761 million  an increase of approximately four percent versus the prior year revenue increased three percent due to higher pricing across the segment and by one percent due to volume increases in alkali revenue also increased one percent due to the impact of acquisitions completed in the fourth quarter of 2011 these increases were slightly offset by a one percent reduction in revenue due to unfavorable currency impacts 

alkali revenues of 7150 million  increased six percent over the prior year due to higher average pricing in both the domestic and export markets and higher export volumes volume growth was partially related to full production at our granger facility which came on line in the middle of last year export volumes were robust especially in asia and latin america 

peroxygens revenues of 3027 million  decreased three percent over the prior year due primarily to unfavorable currency impacts 

environmental solutions revenues of 481 million  were 45 percent  higher year over year from 332 million  in the prior year driven by higher volumes and the acquisition completed in the fourth quarter of 2011 

segment operating profit of 1654 million  increased approximately seven percent versus the year ago period primarily as a result of higher pricing and volumes experienced in alkali as well as the continued favorable mix shift in peroxygens toward specialty applications partially offsetting the favorable pricing were higher royalty and energy costs associated with our 

wyoming alkali operations additionally segment operating profits were negatively impacted by the poor performance of the zeolites product line which we have exited as of december 31 2012 

in 2013 we expect fullyear revenue increases to be in the midsingle digits percent due to higher selling prices in soda ash in the second half of the year we expect fullyear operating profit to be flat 

2011 vs 2010 

revenue in industrial chemicals was 10385 million a decrease of approximately two percent versus the prior year the decrease is primarily attributable to the exit of our phosphate and sulfur derivative businesses in spain during 2010 the absence of phosphate and sulfur derivatives revenue in 2011 resulted in overall revenue declines in the segment of approximately 12 percent the decline in these revenues were partially offset by higher pricing across the segment particularly in soda ash which impacted revenues by approximately six percent higher freight billing and favorable currency impacts increased revenue by approximately three percent 

alkali revenues of 6775 million increased 10 percent over the prior year due to higher pricing particularly in the export market higher freight billings and slightly higher volumes export demand continues to be robust especially in asia and latin america in our domestic market we experienced higher pricing due to constrained supply while volume growth continues to be in line with the demand recovery being experienced in flat glass detergents and chemicals 

peroxygens revenues of 3118 million increased 10 percent over the prior year driven primarily by higher pricing and favorable currency impacts offset by slightly reduced volumes the increased pricing was primarily in our hydrogen peroxide and specialty persulfates product lines 

environmental solutions revenues of 332 million were 58 percent higher year over year from 210 million in the prior year 

segment operating profit of 1545 million increased approximately 26 percent versus the year ago period primarily as a result of the higher pricing documented above the exited phosphate and sulfur derivative businesses had a loss of 13 million for the year ended december 31 2010 additionally the startup costs associated with our granger soda ash facility were offset by favorable production efficiencies in alkali selling general and administrative costs increased seven percent or 35 million primarily for targeted growth initiatives 

other results of operations 

corporate expenses 

corporate expenses are included as a component of the line item “selling general and administrative expenses” on our consolidated statements of income 

2012 vs 2011 

corporate expenses of 636 million  in 2012 increased slightly by 11 million from 625 million  in 2011 the yearoveryear increase is due to our global growth initiatives 

2011 vs 2010 

we recorded expenses of 625 million  in 2011 compared to 630 million in 2010 the slight decrease was a result of reduced consulting expenses of approximately 3 million during 2011 compared to the same period in 2010 due to the implementation of our global procurement initiative the decrease in consulting expenses were partially offset by increased costs of approximately 2 million to support our global growth initiatives 

other income expense net 

other income expense net is included as a component of the line item “costs of sales and services” on our consolidated statements of income 

2012 vs 2011 

other expense increased to 235 million  in 2012 from 187 million  in 2011 the increase was primarily due to higher lifo inventory charges that exceeded prior year by 50 million 

2011 vs 2010 

other expense increased to 187 million  in 2011 from 54 million in 2010 the increase was primarily due to expense related to an increase in our lifo inventory reserves in 2011 of 26 million versus 2010 where we had a reduction in the lifo reserve of 104 million 

interest expense net 

2012 vs 2011 

interest expense net for 2012 of 453 million  increased approximately 15 percent compared to the same period in 2011 of 394 million  the increase was primarily due to higher debt levels associated with the issuance of our 395 senior notes 

during the 4th quarter of 2011 the interest expense on these notes was approximately 12 million in 2012 the higher interest associated with our senior notes was slightly offset by a decrease in our foreign debt interest expense during 2012 as compared to 2011 of approximately 53 million 

2011 vs 2010 

interest expense net for 2011 of 394 million  was relatively flat compared to the same period in 2010 of 393 million 

corporate special income charges 

restructuring and other charges income 

our restructuring and other charges income are compromised of restructuring assets disposals and other charges income as described below 



restructuring and asset disposal charges in 2012 primarily included charges of 133 million associated with the lithium restructuring and 64 million associated with the zeolites shutdown announced during 2012 other charges income net in 2012 were primarily due to charges of 58 million for environmental remediation at operating sites and a 44 million charge related to our agricultural products segment for the purpose of acquiring certain rights to a fungicide still under development 

restructuring and asset disposal charges in 2011 were primarily associated with the sodium percarbonate phaseout charges of 210 million as well as continuing charges related to facility restructurings and shutdowns which were announced in years prior to 2011 other charges income net in 2011 were primarily associated with charges of 31 million for environmental remediation at operating sites 

restructuring and asset disposal charges in 2010 were primarily associated with the huelva spain facility shutdown charges of 1104 million as well as continuing charges related to facility restructuring and shutdowns which were announced in years prior to 2010 other charges income net in 2010 primarily included charges of 142 million for environmental remediation at operating sites and a 57 million charge related to our agricultural products segment acquiring certain rights to a herbicide still under development 

the activity of the restructuring charges listed above are also included within note 7 to our consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k we believe the restructuring plans implemented are on schedule and the benefits and savings either have been or will be achieved 

nonoperating pension and postretirement charges income 

nonoperating pension and postretirement charges income are included in “selling general and administrative expenses” on our consolidated statements of income 

2012 vs 2011 

the charge for 2012 was 349 million  compared to 145 million  for 2011 the increased charge was primarily the result of higher amortization impacts of actuarial losses of 149 million 

2011 vs 2010 

the charge for 2011 was 145 million  compared to 199 million for 2010 the decrease in charges is primarily the result of a settlement charge of 73 million recorded in 2010 associated with the acceleration of previously deferred pension actuarial losses the acceleration was triggered by a lumpsum payout to our former chairman and ceo in 2010 no such event occurred for the year ended december 31 2011 

acquisitionrelated charges 

acquisitionrelated charges are included in “costs of sales and services” on our consolidated statements of income 

2012 vs 2011 

the charge in 2012 of 72 million related to the expensing of the inventory fair value stepup resulting from the application of purchase accounting associated with acquisitions completed in 2012 and 2011 the charges for year ended december 31 2011 relate to a number of acquisitions completed in late 2011 see note 3 to our consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k for more information on our acquisitions 

2011 vs 2010 

the charge in 2011 of 08 million related to the expensing of the inventory fair value stepup resulting from the application of purchase accounting related to a number of acquisitions completed in late 2011 no such charges occurred for the year ended december 31 2010 

provision for income taxes 

2012 vs 2011 

provision for income taxes is 1467 million  for 2012 compared to a provision of 1365 million  for the prior year period resulting in effective tax rates of 239 percent  and 248 percent  respectively excluding the impact of tax adjustments which were primarily driven by a reduction in our valuation allowance related to state net operating losses expected to be recoverable in future years our effective rate in 2012 was 267 percent versus 250 percent in 2011 this increase was driven by slightly higher domestic profits in 2012 versus 2011 domestic profits are taxed at higher rates as compared to foreign profits 

2011 vs 2010 

provision for income taxes was 1365 million  for 2011 compared to a provision of 1320 million for the prior year period resulting in effective tax rates of 248 percent  and 377 percent respectively the decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily the result of recording a 40 million valuation allowance in 2010 within our spanish legal entity predominantly due to the huelva facility shutdown for tax losses that are not expected to be fully recoverable in future years from the earnings of the remaining businesses in that entity excluding the impact of the tax adjustments principally the 40 million valuation allowance our effective tax rate in 2011 was 250 percent versus 266 percent in 2010 this decrease in the effective tax rate is primarily due to increased foreign income compared to income earned inside the us foreign profits are generally taxed at lower rates as compared to domestic income 

discontinued operations net of income taxes 

our discontinued operations represent adjustments to retained liabilities primarily related to operations discontinued between 1976 and 2001 the primary liabilities retained include environmental liabilities other postretirement benefit liabilities selfinsurance and longterm obligations related to legal proceedings 

2012 vs 2011 

discontinued operations net of income taxes totaled a charge of 302 million  for 2012 compared to a charge of 318 million  2011 the charges for both periods were primarily related to charges for legal reserves and expenses related to discontinued operations and an increase in our reserves for operating and maintenance activities for a number of environmental sites 

2011 vs 2010 

discontinued operations net of income taxes totaled a charge of 318 million  for 2011 compared to a charge of 336 million 2010 the charges for 2011 and 2010 were primarily related to an increase in reserves associated with our front royal site and middleport site respectively the charges for both periods also included an increase in our reserves for operating and maintenance activities for a number of environmental sites and charges for legal reserves and expenses related to discontinued operations 

net income attributable to fmc stockholders 

2012 vs 2011 

net income attributable to fmc stockholders increased to 4162 million  in 2012 from 3659 million  in 2011 the increase was primarily due to higher operating profits in our agricultural products segment and a lower effective tax rate these items were partially offset by higher nonoperating pension and postretirement charges and slightly reduced specialty chemicals results 

2011 vs 2010 

net income attributable to fmc stockholders increased to 3659 million for 2011 from 1725 million for 2010 the increase was primarily due to higher operating profits in all three of our segments a lower effective tax rate and significantly lower restructuring and other charges income these items were partially offset by the increase in lifo inventory adjustments 

liquidity and capital resources 

cash and cash equivalents at december 31 2012  and 2011  were 771 million  and 1589 million  respectively of the cash and cash equivalents balance at december 31 2012  695 million were held by our foreign subsidiaries our intent is to reinvest permanently the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries and therefore we have not recorded additional taxes that would be 

payable if we repatriated these earnings in the event that funds from our foreign subsidiaries are repatriated to the us we would be required to accrue and pay us taxes on those amounts 

at december 31 2012  we had total debt of 9651 million  as compared to 8256 million  at december 31 2011  this included 9088 million  and 7791 million  of longterm debt excluding current portions of 57 million  and 195 million  at december 31 2012  and 2011  respectively other shortterm debt which consists solely of foreign borrowings increased to 506 million  at december 31 2012  compared to 270 million  at december 31 2011  

statement of cash flows 

cash provided by operating activities was 4099 million  4256 million  and 3997 million  for 2012  2011  and 2010  respectively 

the table below presents the components of net cash provided by operating activities 



 

 32 

 

cash required by operating activities of discontinued operations was 502 million  443 million  and 452 million  for 2012  2011  and 2010  respectively 

the increase from 2011 to 2012 is a result of increased spending against reserves for legal proceedings associated with discontinued operations discontinued environmental spending was 233 million in 2012 compared to 211 million in 2011 and 171 million in 2010 

cash required by investing activities was 3936 million  3580 million  and 1540 million  for 2012  2011  and 2010  respectively 

increased spending from 2011 to 2012 is primarily due to higher capital spending associated with capital expansions primarily in our alkali biopolmer and lithium divisions and as well as increased expenditures related to our agricultural products segment contract manufacturers the change from 2010 to 2011 was primarily due to the acquisitions completed during 2011 and higher capital spending associated with capacity expansions as compared to 2010 see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included within this form 10k for more information on the 2012 and 2011 acquisitions 

cash required by financing activities was 482 million  253 million  and 1166 million  in 2012  2011  and 2010  respectively 

the use of cash in 2012 as compared to 2011 was primarily due to lower proceeds from long term debt borrowings slightly offset by higher borrowings under our credit facility and lower repayments of scheduled long term debt maturities the change in 2011 compared to 2010 was primarily due to the issuance of our senior debt notes during 2011 which resulted in a cash inflow of approximately 300 million this inflow was partially offset by repayments of other long term debt during the year and increased capital stock repurchases as compared to 2010 

other potential liquidity needs 

our cash needs for 2013 include operating cash requirements capital expenditures scheduled mandatory payments of longterm debt dividend payments share repurchases contributions to our pension plans environmental and asset retirement obligation spending and restructuring we plan to meet our liquidity needs through available cash cash generated from operations and borrowings under our committed revolving credit facility 

projected 2013 capital expenditures as well as expenditures related to contract manufacturers are expected to be approximately 30 percent higher than 2012 levels primarily to increase capacity in biopolymer lithium and soda ash 

projected 2013 spending includes approximately 40 million of net environmental remediation spending this spending does not include expected spending of approximately 10 million in 2013 on capital projects relating to environmental control facilities also we expect to spend approximately 30 million in 2013 for environmental compliance costs which we will include as a component of costs of sales and services in our consolidated statements of income since these amounts are not covered by established reserves capital spending to expand maintain or replace equipment at our production facilities may trigger requirements for upgrading our environmental controls which may increase our spending for environmental controls over the foregoing projections 

our us pension plan assets increased slightly from 8539 million at december 31 2011 to 9840 million at december 31 2012 our us pension plan assets comprise approximately 93 percent of our total plan assets with the difference representing plan assets related to foreign pension plans see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements included within this form 10k for details on how we develop our longterm rate of return assumptions we made contributions of 65 million and 55 million in 2012 and 2011 respectively and intend to contribute 40 million in 2013 our contributions in 2011 2012 and our intended contribution in 2013 are all in excess of the minimum requirements our contributions in excess of the minimum requirement are done with the objective of reducing future funding volatility we do not believe that this additional contribution in 2013 will have a material impact on our current and future liquidity needs however a continuation of the volatility of interest rates and negative equity returns under current market conditions may require greater contributions to the plan in the future 

on february 17 2012 the board authorized the repurchase of up to an additional 250 million of our common stock at december 31 2012  2448 million  remained unused under the boardauthorized repurchase program the repurchase program does not include a specific timetable or price targets and may be suspended or terminated at any time shares may be purchased through open market or privately negotiated transactions at the discretion of management based on its evaluation of market conditions and other factors during the year ended december 31 2012  3072540  shares were repurchased under the publicly announced repurchase program for 1449 million  

the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act the doddfrank act was signed into law and title vii of the act contains significant changes in the ways derivatives are regulated several us government regulatory agencies and departments are charged with developing the many regulations required under the new law while the exact effects on fmc cannot be known until final regulations are promulgated we believe they will not adversely affect our liquidity in a material way 

commitments 

we provide guarantees to financial institutions on behalf of certain agricultural products customers principally brazilian customers for their seasonal borrowing the total of these guarantees was 314 million  and 185 million  at december 31 2012  and 2011  respectively and are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets for each date as “guarantees of vendor financing” 

shortterm debt consisted of foreign credit lines at december 31 2012  and 2011  we provide parentcompany guarantees to lending institutions providing credit to our foreign subsidiaries 

we continually evaluate our options for divesting real estate holdings and property plant and equipment that are no longer integral to our operating businesses in connection with our property and asset sales and divestitures we have agreed to indemnify the buyer for certain liabilities including environmental contamination and taxes that occurred prior to the date of sale our indemnification obligations with respect to these liabilities may be indefinite as to duration and may or may not be subject to a deductible minimum claim amount or cap as such it is not possible for us to predict the likelihood that a claim will be made or to make a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential loss or range of loss if triggered we may be able to recover certain of the indemnity payments from third parties we have not recorded any specific liabilities for these guarantees 

our total significant committed contracts that we believe will affect cash over the next four years and beyond are as follows

climate change 

we have been following legislative and regulatory developments regarding climate change because the regulation of greenhouse gases depending on their nature and scope could subject some of our manufacturing operations to additional costs or limits on operations our alkali chemicals division mines and refines trona ore into soda ash and related products at our westvaco and granger facilities near green river wyoming this activity constitutes most of fmcs greenhouse gas emissions globally in 2012 we reported approximately 20 million metric tons of direct emissions from the green river operations for 2011 

in the absence of federal climate change legislation in the united states epa has moved forward with a finding of “endangerment” and a promulgated “tailoring rule” to apply the prevention of significant deterioration psd provisions of the clean air act to greenhouse gas emissions we have previously announced engineering of a major process optimization involving secondary recovery solution mining to return granger to nameplate capacity the innovative project will reduce our energy and carbon intensity fmc has submitted to epa a psd permit application for greenhouse gas emissions associated with the granger optimization project we have incorporated the scheduling impact of this psd permitting into our project time line 

a significant source of greenhouse gas emissions at the green river operations are emissions from the beneficiation of trona ore that is a significant portion of the greenhouse gases released during the mining and refining of soda ash occurs naturally in the trona ore feedstock unlike the situation with energy efficiency where efficiencies may result in a reduction of greenhouse gases the amount of greenhouse gases present in the trona ore cannot be reduced all of the companies producing natural soda ash have such refining emissions yet the lower energy intensity of natural soda ash provides a favorable carbon intensity compared with synthetic soda ash produced throughout the rest of the world even with the additional emissions from the operation of the granger facility our carbon emission intensity is expected to remain favorable compared to our synthetic soda ash competition 

soda ash is an essential raw material in the production of glass of all kinds climate change energy intensity and alternative forms of energy will drive increased production of new forms of glass lower emissivity glass solar panel glass etc and will increase the need for this essential raw material from fmc the soda ash industry has an interest in assuring that climate change legislation or regulation recognizes the benefits of soda ash particularly natural soda ash and the challenges facing this industry in controlling its greenhouse gas emissions 

because of the many variables it is premature to make any estimate of the costs of complying with possible future federal climate change legislation in the united states however we are aware of the potential impacts that could result from emissions regulations in the us that are more stringent than those experienced by our global competitors these could make it more difficult for us to competitively produce natural soda ash at green river a reduction in natural soda ash production as a result of more stringent regulations in the us would lead to more greenhouse gas emissions globally because the lost supply of natural soda ash would be replaced by the more costly and more greenhouse gas intensive synthetic soda ash 

in 2012 two us plants in our biopolymer business also reported emissions above the epas reporting threshold but each plants emissions are substantially less than at our green river operations in total less than 01 million metric tons 

at this point our us facilities are not subject to any state or regional greenhouse gas regulation that limits or imposes fees on current emissions and our foreign operations outside of europe and canada are not subject to national or local greenhouse gas regulation although some of our european and canadian operations may be subject to greenhouse gas regulation the cost to these facilities has not been and is not expected to be material to fmc 

we have considered the potential physical risks to fmc facilities and operations and the indirect consequences of regulation or business trends as a result of potential future climate change because of the many variables with respect to the nature and effect of future global climate change regulation it is impossible to predict in any meaningful way what type of property damage or disruptions to our operations or indirect consequences might result from future climate change 

recently adopted and issued accounting pronouncements and regulatory items 

see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k 

critical accounting policies 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles us gaap  the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses we have described our accounting policies in note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k we have reviewed these accounting policies identifying those that we believe to be critical to the preparation and understanding of our consolidated financial statements we have reviewed these critical accounting policies with the audit committee of the board of directors critical accounting policies are central to our presentation of results of operations and financial condition in accordance with us gaap and require management to make estimates and judgments on certain matters we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience current conditions and other reasonable factors 

environmental obligations and related recoveries 

we provide for environmentalrelated obligations when they are probable and amounts can be reasonably estimated where the available information is sufficient to estimate the amount of liability that estimate has been used where the information is only sufficient to establish a range of probable liability and no point within the range is more likely than any other the lower end of the range has been used 

estimated obligations to remediate sites that involve oversight by the united states environmental protection agency “epa” or similar government agencies are generally accrued no later than when a record of decision “rod” or equivalent is issued or upon completion of a remedial investigationfeasibility study “rifs” or equivalent that is submitted by us to the appropriate government agency or agencies estimates are reviewed quarterly by our environmental remediation management as well as by financial and legal management and if necessary adjusted as additional information becomes available the estimates can change substantially as additional information becomes available regarding the nature or extent of site contamination required remediation methods and other actions by or against governmental agencies or private parties 

our environmental liabilities for continuing and discontinued operations are principally for costs associated with the remediation andor study of sites at which we are alleged to have released hazardous substances into the environment such costs principally include among other items rifs site remediation costs of operation and maintenance of the remediation plan management costs fees to outside law firms and consultants for work related to the environmental effort and future monitoring costs estimated site liabilities are determined based upon existing remediation laws and technologies specific site consultants’ engineering studies or by extrapolating experience with environmental issues at comparable sites 

included in our environmental liabilities are costs for the operation maintenance and monitoring of site remediation plans omm such reserves are based on our best estimates for these omm plans over time we may incur omm costs in excess of these reserves however we are unable to reasonably estimate an amount in excess of our recorded reserves because we cannot reasonably estimate the period for which such omm plans will need to be in place or the future annual cost of such remediation as conditions at these environmental sites change over time such additional omm costs could be significant in total but would be incurred over an extended period of years 

included in the environmental reserve balance other assets balance and disclosure of reasonably possible loss contingencies are amounts from third party insurance policies which we believe are probable of recovery 

provisions for environmental costs are reflected in income net of probable and estimable recoveries from named potentially responsible parties “prps” or other third parties such provisions incorporate inflation and are not discounted to their present values 

in calculating and evaluating the adequacy of our environmental reserves we have taken into account the joint and several liability imposed by comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act “cercla” and the analogous state laws on all prps and have considered the identity and financial condition of the other prps at each site to the extent possible we have also considered the identity and financial condition of other third parties from whom recovery is anticipated as well as the status of our claims against such parties although we are unable to forecast the ultimate contributions of prps and other third parties with absolute certainty the degree of uncertainty with respect to each party is taken into account when determining the environmental reserve by adjusting the reserve to reflect the facts and circumstances on a sitebysite basis our liability includes our best estimate of the costs expected to be paid before the consideration of any potential recoveries from third parties we believe that any recorded recoveries related to prps are realizable in all material respects recoveries are recorded as either an offset in “environmental liabilities continuing and discontinued” or as “other assets” in our consolidated balance sheets in accordance with us accounting literature 

see note 10 to our consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k for changes in estimates associated with our environmental obligations 

impairments and valuation of longlived assets 

our longlived assets primarily include property plant and equipment goodwill and intangible assets the assets and liabilities of acquired businesses are measured at their estimated fair values at the dates of acquisition the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired including identified intangibles is recorded as goodwill the determination and allocation of fair value to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is based on various assumptions and valuation methodologies requiring considerable management judgment including estimates based on historical information current market data and future expectations the principal assumptions utilized in our valuation methodologies include revenue growth rates operating margin estimates and discount rates although the estimates were deemed reasonable by management based on information available at the dates of acquisition those estimates are inherently uncertain 

we test for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the net book value of our property plant and equipment may not be recoverable from the estimated undiscounted expected future cash flows expected to result from their use and eventual disposition in cases where the estimated undiscounted expected future cash flows are less than net book value an impairment loss is recognized equal to the amount by which the net book value exceeds the estimated fair value of assets which is based on discounted cash flows at the lowest level determinable the estimated cash flows reflect our assumptions about selling prices volumes costs and market conditions over a reasonable period of time 

we perform an annual impairment test of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets in the third quarter of each year or more frequently whenever an event or change in circumstances occur that would require reassessment of the recoverability of those assets in 2012 we adopted new accounting guidance issued by the financial accounting standards board related to the testing of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment this new guidance allows us the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount if after assessing qualitative factors it is determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount we would need to perform a more detailed impairment test the more detailed impairment test is used to identify potential goodwill and indefinitelived intangible asset impairments and to measure the amount of impairment losses to be recognized if any 

we performed this test utilizing the new guidance in 2012 we assessed qualitative factors such as overall financial performance of our reporting units anticipated changes in industry and market structure competitive environments planned capacity and cost factors such as raw material prices based on our assessment we determined that no impairment charge was required see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k for accounting guidance adopted in 2012 associated with the annual impairment test 

see note 7 to our consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k for charges associated with longlived asset disposal costs and the activity associated with the restructuring reserves 

pension and other postretirement benefits 

we provide qualified and nonqualified defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans as well as postretirement health care and life insurance benefit plans to our employees and retirees the costs benefits and obligations related to these benefits reflect key assumptions related to general economic conditions including interest discount rates healthcare cost trend rates expected rates of return on plan assets and the rates of compensation increase for employees the costs benefits and obligations for these benefit programs are also affected by other assumptions such as average retirement age mortality employee turnover and plan participation to the extent our plans’ actual experience as influenced by changing economic and financial market conditions or by changes to our own plans’ demographics differs from these assumptions the costs and 

obligations for providing these benefits as well as the plans’ funding requirements could increase or decrease when actual results differ from our assumptions the difference is typically recognized over future periods in addition the unrealized gains and losses related to our pension and postretirement benefit obligations may also affect periodic benefit costs benefits in future periods 

we use several assumptions and statistical methods to determine the asset values used to calculate both the expected rate of return on assets component of pension cost and to calculate our plans’ funding requirements the expected rate of return on plan assets is based on a marketrelated value of assets that recognizes investment gains and losses over a fiveyear period we use an actuarial value of assets to determine our plans’ funding requirements the actuarial value of assets must be within a certain range high or low of the actual market value of assets and is adjusted accordingly 

we select the discount rate used to calculate pension and other postretirement obligations based on a review of available yields on highquality corporate bonds as of the measurement date in selecting a discount rate as of december 31 2012 we placed particular emphasis on a discount rate yieldcurve provided by our actuary this yieldcurve when populated with projected cash flows that represented the expected timing and amount of our plans benefit payments produced a single effective interest discount rate of 415 percent which was used to measure the plans liabilities 

the discount rates used at our december 31 2012 and 2011 measurement dates were 415 percent and 495 percent respectively the effect of the change in the discount rate from 495 percent to 415 percent at december 31 2012 resulted in a 1213 million increase to our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations the effect of the change in the discount rate from 540 percent at december 31 2010 to 495 percent at december 31 2011 resulted in a 67 million increase to 2012 pension and other postretirement benefit expense 

the change in discount rate from 495 percent at december 31 2011 to 415 percent at december 31 2012 was attributable to a decrease in yields on high quality corporate bonds with cash flows matching the timing and amount of our expected future benefit payments between the 2011 and 2012 measurement dates using the december 31 2011 yield curve our plan cash flows produced a single weightedaverage discount rate of approximately 495 percent matching our plan cash flows to a similarly constructed curve reflecting highyielding bonds available as of december 31 2012 resulted in a single weightedaverage discount rate of approximately 415 percent 

in developing the assumption for the longterm rate of return on assets for our us plan we take into consideration the technical analysis performed by our outside actuaries including historical market returns information on the assumption for longterm real returns by asset class inflation assumptions and expectations for standard deviation related to these best estimates we also consider the historical performance of our own plan’s trust which has earned a compound annual rate of return of approximately 96 percent over the last 20 years which is in excess of comparable market indices for the same period as well as other factors which are discussed in note 13 to our consolidated financial statements in this form 10k our longterm rate of return for 2011 and 2010 was 85 percent which we adjusted downward to 775 percent for 2012 the effect of the change in the longterm rate of return from 85 percent during 2011 to 775 percent during 2012 resulted in a 64 million increase to 2012 pension and other postretirement benefit expense 

for the sensitivity of our pension costs to incremental changes in assumptions see our discussion below 

sensitivity analysis related to key pension and postretirement benefit assumptions 

a onehalf percent increase in the assumed discount rate would have decreased pension and other postretirement benefit obligations by 778 million and 669 million at december 31 2012 and 2011 respectively and decreased pension and other postretirement benefit costs by 82 million 65 million and 64 million for 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively a onehalf percent decrease in the assumed discount rate would have increased pension and other postretirement benefit 

obligations by 857 million and 737 million at december 31 2012 and 2011 respectively and increased pension and other postretirement benefit net periodic benefit cost by 84 million 66 million and 65 million for 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively 

a onehalf percent increase in the assumed expected longterm rate of return on plan assets would have decreased pension costs by 47 million 46 million and 45 million for 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively a onehalf percent decrease in the assumed longterm rate of return on plan assets would have increased pension costs by 47 million 46 million and 45 million for 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively 

further details on our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and net periodic benefit costs benefits are found in note 13 to our consolidated financial statements in this form 10k 

income taxes 

we have recorded a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized in assessing the need for this allowance we have considered a number of factors including future taxable income the jurisdictions in which such income is earned and our ongoing tax planning strategies in the event that we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period such determination was made similarly should we conclude that we would be able to realize certain deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase income in the period such determination was made 

additionally we file income tax returns in the us federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions the income tax returns for fmc entities taxable in the us and significant foreign jurisdictions are open for examination and adjustment we assess our income tax positions and record a liability for all years open to examination based upon our evaluation of the facts circumstances and information available at the reporting date for those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained we have recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information we adjust these liabilities if necessary upon the completion of tax audits or changes in tax law 

see note 11 to our consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k for additional discussion surrounding income taxes 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we do not have any offbalance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition revenues or expenses results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors 

dividends 

on january 17 2013  we paid dividends aggregating 187 million  to our shareholders of record as of december 31 2012  this amount is included in “accrued and other liabilities” on the consolidated balance sheets as of december 31 2012  for the years ended december 31 2012  2011  and 2010  we paid 478 million  412 million  and 364 million  in dividends respectively

 item 7a 

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend our earnings cash flows and financial position are exposed to market risks relating to fluctuations in commodity prices interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates our policy is to minimize exposure to our cash flow over time caused by changes in commodity interest and currency exchange rates to accomplish this we have implemented a controlled program of risk management consisting of appropriate derivative contracts entered into with major financial institutions 

the analysis below presents the sensitivity of the market value of our financial instruments to selected changes in market rates and prices the range of changes chosen reflects our view of changes that are reasonably possible over a oneyear period marketvalue estimates are based on the present value of projected future cash flows considering the market rates and prices chosen 

at december 31 2012  our net financial instrument position was a net liability of 22 million  compared to a net liability of 59 million  at december 31 2011  the change in the net financial instrument position was primarily due to lower unrealized losses in our commodity and foreign exchange portfolios 

since our risk management programs are generally highly effective the potential loss in value for each risk management portfolio described below would be largely offset by changes in the value of the underlying exposure 

commodity price risk 

energy costs are approximately seven percent of our cost of sales and services and are diversified among coal electricity and natural gas we attempt to mitigate our exposure to increasing energy costs by hedging the cost of future deliveries of natural gas and by entering into fixedprice contracts for the purchase of coal and fuel oil to analyze the effect of changing energy prices we have performed a sensitivity analysis in which we assume an instantaneous 10 percent change in energy market prices from their levels at december 31 2012  and 2011  with all other variables including interest rates held constant a 10 

percent increase in energy market prices would result in a decrease in the net liability position of 46 million at december 31 2012  compared to a 25 million decrease of the net liability position at december 31 2011  as a result at december 31 2012 the net liability position would have become a net asset a 10 percent decrease in energy market prices would result in an increase of 41 million in the net liability position at december 31 2012  compared to an increase of 25 million of the net liability position at december 31 2011  

our agricultural products segment enters into contracts with certain customers in brazil to exchange our products for future physical delivery of soybeans to mitigate the price risk associated with these barter contracts we enter into offsetting derivatives to hedge our exposure as of december 31 2012  and 2011  our net financial instrument position was immaterial 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

the primary currencies for which we have exchange rate exposure are the us dollar versus the euro the us dollar versus the chinese yuan and the us dollar versus the brazilian real foreign currency debt and foreign exchange forward contracts are used in countries where we do business thereby reducing our net asset exposure foreign exchange forward contracts are also used to hedge firm and highly anticipated foreign currency cash flows 

to analyze the effects of changing foreign currency rates we have performed a sensitivity analysis in which we assume an instantaneous 10 percent change in the foreign currency exchange rates from their levels at december 31 2012  and 2011  with all other variables including interest rates held constant a 10 percent strengthening of hedged currencies versus our functional currencies would have resulted in a decrease of 55 million in the net liability position at december 31 2012 compared to an increase of 24 million in the net asset position at december 31 2011  as a result at december 31 2012 the net liability position would have become a net asset a 10 percent weakening of hedged currencies versus our functional currencies would have resulted in an increase of 43 million in the net liability position at december 31 2012  compared to a decrease of 21 million in the net asset position at december 31 2011  

interest rate risk 

one of the strategies that we can use to manage interest rate exposure is to enter into interest rate swap agreements in these agreements we agree to exchange at specified intervals the difference between fixed and variable interest amounts calculated on an agreedupon notional principal amount as of december 31 2012  and 2011  we had no interest rate swap agreements 

our debt portfolio at december 31 2012  is composed of 83 percent fixedrate debt and 17 percent variablerate debt the variablerate component of our debt portfolio principally consists of borrowings under our 2011 credit agreement variablerate industrial and pollution control revenue bonds and amounts outstanding under foreign subsidiary credit lines changes in interest rates affect different portions of our variablerate debt portfolio in different ways 

based on the variablerate debt in our debt portfolio at december 31 2012  a one percentage point increase in interest rates would have increased gross interest expense by 16 million and a one percentage point decrease in interest rates would have decreased gross interest expense by 15 million for the year ended december 31 2012

the following table shows the principal products produced by our three business segments and their raw materials and uses 

  



   

 

we have operations in many areas around the world with a worldwide manufacturing and distribution infrastructure we are able to respond rapidly to global customer needs offset downward economic trends in one region with positive trends in another and better match revenues to local costs to mitigate the impact of currency volatility the charts below detail our sales and longlived assets by major geographic region 

  



     

our strategy 

in 2010 we invested significant resources and managerial time in the development of a new strategic plan for the company this corporate strategy which we refer to as vision 2015 is focused on driving sales and earnings growth while sustaining a return on invested capital well above our cost of capital this strategys objective is to achieve a total shareholder return in the top quartile of a broad group of industry peers vision 2015 has five key elements 

growing leadership positions  we intend to continue to build and strengthen our market leading positions by executing a plan that relies primarily on organic growth complemented by a focused external growth strategy we benefit from a business portfolio that is exposed to faster growing end markets and geographic regions agricultural products’ organic growth plan focuses on market and product innovations while strengthening market access specialty chemicals’ organic focus is primarily on new products and new applications for existing products industrial chemicals’ focus is on new applications for existing chemistries to complement these organic growth initiatives our external growth strategy employs a focused disciplined approach to company product and technology acquisitions we believe this strategy reduces the risk normally inherent in external growth agricultural products intends to complement its organic growth initiatives by acquiring new products and technologies as well as making selective acquisitions to strengthen market access and enter adjacent spaces in specialty chemicals the food ingredients market is our top priority for acquisitions that will expand our product line offerings and positions in rapidlydeveloping economies industrial chemicals will evaluate selective acquisitions focused in specialty applications across all businesses our strategy does not include making large scale complex or transformational acquisitions or adding another business platform to our portfolio through acquisition 

increasing our reach  we intend to bias our growth initiatives toward further strengthening our positions in rapidlydeveloping economies rdes our growth in latin america will be largely driven by leveraging agricultural products’ leadership positions in asia our growth initiatives will be more broadbased with targeted investments in human scientific and technological resources across our businesses in the region in central and eastern europe turkey and russia we will focus on establishing strong footholds in key countries 

capturing the value of common ownership  we are moving from a highly decentralized organizational model to one that has both centralized and decentralized qualities we believe this shift will enable us to better leverage the size and scope of our company to realize cost savings and increase efficiencies yet maintain strong accountability in our business units our efforts to date have focused on such areas as procurement strategic planning mergers and acquisitions communications global supply chain and rde infrastructure 

proactively managing our portfolio  in the fourth quarter of 2010 we ceased operations at our phosphates facility in huelva spain due to increasing environmental constraints and poor financial performance following this resolution all current businesses are well positioned for sustained growth and delivering returns above cost of capital we will continue to assess the performance of all of our business units and will take actions as needed should a unit’s performance change within our businesses we continue to evaluate the performance of specific product lines and have taken action where a product line 

has become nonstrategic or economically unsustainable such as the exit in 2011 of the sodium percarbonate business 

disciplined cash deployment  under our vision 2015 plan we expect that we can fund our growth strategies and return a significant amount of cash to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividends 

underlying our ambition to deliver our vision 2015 plan is a continued commitment to enterprise sustainability including responsible stewardship as we grow we will do so in a responsible way safety remains of utmost importance meeting and exceeding our customers’ needs will continue to be a primary focus and we will as always conduct our business in an ethical manner in the first half of 2012 we will be publishing our inaugural sustainability report this report will provide an overview of our progress

overview 

our agricultural products segment which represents approximately 43 percent  of our 2011 consolidated revenues develops manufactures and sells a portfolio of crop protection professional pest control and lawn and garden products our growth efforts focus on developing environmentally compatible solutions that can effectively increase farmers’ yields provide costeffective alternatives to older chemistries to which insects weeds or disease may have developed resistance and strengthen our customer relevancy in focus markets we are committed to providing unique differentiated products to our customers by acquiring and further developing technologies as well as by making selective investments in innovation to extend product life cycles our external growth efforts include product acquisitions inlicensing of chemistries and technologies and alliances to strengthen our market access or complement our existing product portfolio in 2010 we successfully acquired the proprietary herbicide fluthiacetmethyl which has an excellent fit in our focus market segments and is particularly effective on many toughtocontrol weeds that have developed resistance to glyphosate in 2011 we entered into a joint venture in argentina to accelerate growth and strengthen our market access in the second largest crop protection market in latin america also in 2011 we acquired rovral iprodione and sportak prochloraz fungicides for agricultural use outside of europe 

we differentiate ourselves by focusing on specific crops and markets and by our lowcost manufacturing strategy we are continually working to gain access to proprietary chemistries and technologies which are complementary to our existing products and market focus we are encouraged by our progress in licensing and partnering to create proprietary products developing technicallyadvanced delivery systems and commercializing unique product premixes and combinations we are optimistic that these efforts will continue to result in sales and profit growth over the foreseeable future 

products and markets 

  



      

agricultural products provides a wide range of proprietary branded products—based on both patented and offpatented technologies product branding is a prevalent industry practice used to help maintain and grow market share by promoting enduser recognition and product and supplier reputation agricultural products enjoys relatively strong niche positions in crop and noncrop market segments in the americas europe and other parts of the world and derived approximately 80 percent of its revenue from outside north america in 2011 

insecticides represent the largest product line in the agricultural products segment which include our pyrethroid and carbamate chemistries in which we maintain leading market positions based on revenues our proprietary herbicides have grown significantly over the last several years due to organic growth new product launches product acquisitions and the inlicensing of new chemistries our herbicide portfolio primarily targets niche uses and controls a wide variety of difficulttocontrol weeds over the last several years we have strengthened our market position in fungicides so that we can broaden our portfolio across the three major pesticide categories ie insecticides herbicides and fungicides in 2009 we successfully acquired the proprietary fungicide benalaxyl which has an excellent fit in several regions and crops in 2011 we acquired iprodione and prochloraz fungicides for all agricultural uses outside of europe these are highly effective resistance management technologies that are used in more than 50 countries primarily in the tree fruit and vegetable markets 

the following table summarizes the principal product chemistries in agricultural products and the principal uses of each chemistry   



we have entered into a number of agreements with thirdparty pesticide producers under which we work together to develop market andor distribute existing and new pesticide chemistries in various markets these proprietary chemistries and technologies are complementary to our existing products and market strategies the chemistries include flonicamid a unique insecticide for controlling sucking pests cyazofamid a novel fungicide for crop and noncrop uses in the americas pyroxasulfone a proprietary herbicide for controlling glyphosateresistant weeds and acetamiprid for pest control markets in north america we also have numerous supply and access agreements with thirdparty producers for other pesticide products including the commercialization of proprietary premixes and combinations 

we access key western european markets through a belgianbased pesticide distribution company belchim crop protection nv in which we have an ownership interest we also have joint venture arrangements with nufarm limited in three countries in eastern europe which allow us to capitalize on growth in this part of europe in north america we access the market through several major national and regional distributors we access key asian markets either through local independent distributors or our own sales and marketing organization in the large agricultural market of brazil we access the market in part through independent distributors and in part we sell directly to large growers through our own skilled sales and marketing organization through these and other alliances along with our own targeted marketing efforts access to novel technologies and our innovation initiatives we expect to maintain and enhance our access in key agricultural and noncrop markets and develop new products that will help us continue to compete effectively 

we maintain competitive manufacturing cost positions through our strategy of sourcing raw materials intermediates and finished products from third parties in lowercost manufacturing countries such as china india and mexico this strategy has resulted in significant cost savings and lower capital spending and has reduced the fixed capital intensity of the business 

growth 

we plan to grow by obtaining new and approved uses for existing product lines and acquiring accessing developing marketing distributing andor selling complementary chemistries and related technologies in order to enhance and expand our product portfolio and our capabilities to effectively service our target markets and customers our growth will depend on our ability to deliver unique innovative solutions to our customers over the next several years growth is anticipated from our proprietary insecticides herbicides and fungicides as well as recently accessed third party chemistries and technologies for our insecticides we will launch a number of new products expand labels and introduce unique formulations that will deliver valueadding solutions to our customers the continued spread of herbicideresistant weeds and shifts in weed populations coupled with several recently launched product formulations expanded labels premixes and new chemistries provide growth opportunities for our herbicide product line the strengthening of our fungicide portfolio will increase our relevancy in critical market segments across the globe finally the successful development and commercialization of our productivityenhancing technologies should also contribute to growth over the next five years 

industry overview 

the three principal categories of agricultural and noncrop chemicals are herbicides representing approximately half of global industry revenue insecticides representing approximately a quarter of global industry revenue and fungicides representing most of the remaining portion of global industry revenue 

herbicides prevent or inhibit weed growth thereby reducing or eliminating the need for manual or mechanical weeding herbicides can be selective controlling only specific unwanted vegetation or nonselective controlling all vegetation and are also segmented by their time of application preplanting preemergent and postemergent 

insecticides are used to control a wide range of insects including chewing pests such as caterpillars and sucking pests such as aphids insecticides are applied as sprays dusts or granules and are used on a wide variety of crops such as fruits vegetables cotton soybean corn and cereals there are several major classes of insecticide chemistries including organophosphates carbamates pyrethroids and neonicotinoids 

fungicides prevent or inhibit the spread of plant disease which can adversely impact crop yields and quality in general fungicides are either preventative applied before disease is present or curative applied after disease is present and are also segmented as being contact translaminar or systemic depending on the extent to which the product is taken up by the crop plant fungicides are used on a wide variety of crops such as fruits vegetables soybean cereals and rice 

the agrochemicals industry is relatively consolidated leading crop protection companies syngenta ag bayer ag monsanto company basf ag the dow chemical company and e i du pont de nemours and company dupont currently represent approximately 75 percent of the industry’s global sales significant drivers for this consolidation have been the growth and grower acceptance of biotechnology employed in row crops and the escalation of research and development and marketing costs 

the next tier of agrochemical producers including fmc makhteshimagan industries ltd sumitomo chemical company limited nufarm limited arysta lifescience corporation united phosphorous limited and cheminova as employ various differentiated strategies and compete by 1 unique technologies 2 focusing on certain crops markets and geographies andor 3 competitive pricing based on lowcost manufacturing positions some of these producers are generic competitors with little or no investment in innovation there is a growing trend among these producers to partner with one another to gain economies of scale and competitive market access more comparable to larger competitors additionally a number of these companies have grown rapidly through acquisitions of other companies andor product divestitures from the leading crop protection companies

industry overview 

food ingredients 

our biopolymer business principally serves the texture structure and physical stability “tsps” food ingredients market tsps ingredients impart physical properties to thicken and stabilize foods there are many types of tsps ingredients and a wide range of food groups served including bakery meats dairy and convenience products the industry is dispersed geographically with the majority of our sales in europe north america and asia 

trends driving market growth include increasing consumer interest in healthier foods greater convenience and growth in per capita consumption of processed foods in emerging markets the trend toward health and convenience drives the need for more functional ingredients to impart desired food tastes and textures we believe carrageenan and mcc which address this need are growing faster than the overall tsps market the global customer base for tsps is relatively fragmented and includes large and small food processors consolidation among these customers has been a significant trend over the past several years as a result tsps ingredient suppliers such as us have focused on establishing alliances with market leaders with the goal of reducing costs leveraging technology and expanding product offerings with key accounts 

within the entire food ingredients market there are a relatively large number of suppliers due principally to the broad spectrum of chemistries employed segment leadership global position and investment in technology are key factors to sustaining profitability in addition compared to our business larger suppliers may often provide a broader product line and a range of services to food companies including functional systems or blends the top suppliers of tsps ingredients include fmc dupont jm huber corporation kerry group plc and cargill incorporated 

with the acquisition of south pole biogroup ltda our biopolymer business now participates in the natural colorant food ingredients market biogroups proprietary knowhow is used to formulate unique natural color blends used in food and personal care applications natural colors are a 700 million a year market with annual growth of approximately 20 in the last 2 years driven by consumer demand from synthetic to natural colors by 2015 the natural colors market is expected to reach 1 billion or more as consumer preference for natural colors and ingredients and overall health and nutrition continues to increase in mature and emerging markets 

pharmaceutical ingredients 

our biopolymer business sells formulation ingredients to the pharmaceutical industry our raw materials function as binders disintegrants suspending agents and control release compounds in the production of both solid and liquid pharmaceutical products 

competitors tend to be grouped by chemistry our principal mcc competitors include j rettenmaier  sôhne gmbh ming tai chemical co ltd asahi kasei corporation and blanver farmoquimica ltda while pricing pressure from low cost producers is a common competitive dynamic companies like us offset that pressure by providing the most reliable and broadest range of products and services our customers are pharmaceutical firms who depend upon reliable therapeutic performance of their drug products 

we also supply alginates mcc and carrageenan into oral care cosmetics and health care markets highly refined extracts from selected seaweeds provide a broad range of alginate functionality including uses in antireflux dental impressions control release of drugs and wound dressings special grades of carrageenan extracts are used in liquid cough medicines toothpaste and a variety of skin care products

there are only three key producers of lithium compounds fmc rockwood holdings inc and sociedad química y minera de chile sa all of which produce lithium carbonate fmc and rockwood are the primary producers in downstream lithium specialties 

industrial chemicals 

financial information in millions 



     

overview 

our industrial chemicals segment which represents 31 percent  of our 2011 consolidated revenues has lowcost positions in high volume inorganic chemicals including soda ash and hydrogen peroxide complemented by high value niche positions in specialty alkali and specialty peroxygens product lines our strategic intent for the industrial chemicals group is to create a portfolio of high performing businesses exhibiting greater top and bottom line growth with significantly higher margins and reduced volatility than in the past we will achieve this by enhancing our leadership position in natural soda ash and continuing to shift our peroxygens portfolio toward highvalue specialties we expect steady organic growth in our soda ash business due to capacity expansions serving consistent growth in global demand we anticipate significant organic growth in environmental applications over the next five years and we see opportunities to expand our environmental technology platform through targeted acquisitions of complementary technologies in addition to solid revenue growth we expect improved profit mix stemming from increased specialty market participation and the benefits of restructuring actions 

products and markets 

  



     

industrial chemicals serves a diverse group of markets from economicallysensitive industrial sectors to technologyintensive specialty markets we process and sell refined inorganic products that are sought by customers for their critical reactivity or specific functionality in markets such as glass detergents chemicals and pulp and paper in addition we produce purify and market higher value downstream derivatives into specialized and customerspecific applications these applications include electronics iodides and animal nutrition 

alkali 

our alkali chemicals division produces natural soda ash soda ash is used by manufacturers in glass chemical processing and detergent industries to lesser degrees we also produce sodium bicarbonate caustic soda and sodium sesquicarbonate the majority of our alkali sales are manufactured by and sold through fmc wyoming corporation which we manage as an integral part of our alkali business and in which we own shares representing an 875 percent economic interest with the remaining shares held by two japanese companies 

we mine and produce natural soda ash using proprietary lowcost mining technologies such as longwall and solution mining which we believe give us globally the lowest cost position our two production sites in green river wyoming have the name plate capacity to produce approximately 485 million short tons of soda ash annually during 2009 with the economic downturn resulting in a drop in soda ash demand we mothballed the granger facility and consolidated all of our soda ash production at the westvaco facility since then export markets have recovered much faster than the us domestic market and in july 2011 we restarted our granger facility to ramp up production to an annual rate of 500000 short tons by the end of 2011 to satisfy export demand we also began evaluating further production increases at granger which could bring granger production to 12 million short tons by 2015 

peroxygens 

we produce peroxygen products at production facilities in the united states canada spain germany and the netherlands we also participate in a joint venture company in thailand we sell hydrogen peroxide into the pulp and paper chemical processing environmental electronics and food industries we are a leading north american producer of hydrogen peroxide due in part to our broad product line geographicallyadvantaged plant locations stateoftheart processing technology and superior customer service hydrogen peroxide represents approximately 65 percent of our peroxygens sales 

our specialty peroxygens business supplies persulfate products primarily to polymer printed circuit board hair care and soil remediation markets peracetic acid is predominantly supplied to the food industry for biocidal applications typically we compete as a specialty player where we believe that we are differentiated by our strong technical expertise unique process technology intellectual property and geographic location 

zeolites and silicates 

we have two manufacturing facilities in spain where we have market position in zeolites and silicates we sell zeolites and silicates products which are used in detergents car tires textile foundry and pulp and paper markets we are exploring new applications for zeolite and silicates including water treatment environmental detergent and agricultural markets 

industry overview 

we primarily participate in the following product areas soda ash peroxygens and zeolites and silicates these products are generally inorganic and are generally commodities that in many cases have few costeffective substitutes growth is typically a function of industrial production in developed economies and a function of the rate of industrialization in developing economies pricing tends to reflect the supply and demand balance as producers add or reduce capacity in response to demand changes 

soda ash 

soda ash is a highly alkaline inorganic chemical essential in the production of glass and widely used in the production of chemicals soaps and detergents and many other products natural soda ash is typically produced from trona a natural form of sodium sesquicarbonate through mining and chemical processing soda ash may also be produced synthetically but this process requires significantly more energy and produces large quantities of waste byproducts making it much less costeffective than natural soda ash production 

because of the processing cost advantages of trona and the large natural reserves of trona in the us particularly in green river wyoming all us soda ash is naturally produced by contrast due to a lack of trona the majority of the soda ash that is manufactured in the rest of the world is produced synthetically other us producers are oci chemical corporation solvay sa the general chemical group inc in which a majority stake is owned by tata chemicals limited and nirma limited 

approximately 50 percent of us soda ash production served export markets in 2011 with approximately 38 percent of us soda ash production exported through the american natural soda ash corporation “ansac” ansac is the foreign sales association of three wyoming us soda ash producers established in 1983 under the webbpomerene act and subsequent legislation since its creation ansac has been successful in coordinating soda ash exports taking advantage of the inherent cost benefits of us produced natural soda ash and leveraging its large scale of operations to the benefit of its member companies consequently us exports of soda ash have increased over fivefold in the last 25 years 

peroxygens 

hydrogen peroxide is typically sold for use as a bleacher or oxidizer while it often competes with other chemicals capable of performing similar functions the extent of substitution is limited our specialty peroxygen derivatives eg persulfates and peracetic acid also functions as bleaching or oxidizing agents in some applications environmental regulations regional cost differences primarily due to transportation costs and technical differences in product performance factor into the decision to use hydrogen peroxide or one of its derivatives rather than another product hydrogen peroxide is sold in aqueous solutions usually 70 percent 50 percent or 35 percent by weight 

the pulp and paper industry represents approximately 65 percent of demand for hydrogen peroxide in north america and europe in these markets hydrogen peroxide is used as an environmentally friendly bleaching agent to brighten chemical mechanical and recycled pulps as well as to treat a wide range of mill pollutants in the waste stream the north american and european paper markets are mature and new investment in pulp and paper capacity is largely focused in asia and south america the other north american and european hydrogen peroxide producers are eka a wholly owned subsidiary of akzo nobel nv arkema inc evonik industries ag kemira ovj and solvay sa 

zeolites and silicates 

zeolite has a network structure which facilitates the exchange of cations enabling it to soften hard water in detergents environmental regulations limiting or banning the use of sodium tripolyphosphate in detergents have facilitated the introduction of zeolite as a component in detergents the properties of zeolites make them very suitable for specific applications such as adsorption separation ion exchange and others in addition the zeolite network structure can be modified to produce specialty zeolite products designed to meet sophisticated market demands we are currently working on applications to meet these demands the main european zeolite producers are pq corporation industrial zeolite birac and fmc 

soluble silicates are very versatile inorganic chemical products they are produced by combining various ratios of sand with alkali to obtain a variety of products used in many industries the applications of silicates include detergents ceramics paper foundry construction rubber agriculture textiles and production of other chemicals due to their relatively low price and high logistic cost the silicate market is very fragmented with mostly local production the main european producers are pq corporation cognis and fmc 

source and availability of raw materials 

our raw material requirements vary by business segment and include mineralrelated natural resources trona ore and lithium brines processed chemicals seaweed specialty wood pulps and energy sources such as gas coal oil and electricity raw materials represented approximately 26 percent of our 2011 costs of sales and services and no one raw material represented more than 12 percent of our total raw material purchases 

we extract ores used in industrial chemicals’ manufacturing processes from mines eg trona in north america raw materials used by specialty chemicals include lithium brines various types of seaweed and natural colorant raw materials that are sourced on a global basis and specialty pulps which are purchased from selected global producers raw materials used by agricultural products primarily processed chemicals are obtained from a variety of suppliers worldwide 

patents 

we own a number of us and foreign patents trademarks and licenses that are cumulatively important to our business we do not believe that the loss of any one or group of related patents trademarks or licenses would have a material adverse effect on the overall business of fmc the duration of our patents depends on their respective jurisdictions their expiration dates range through 2031 

seasonality 

the seasonal nature of the crop protection market and the geographic spread of the agricultural products business can result in significant variations in quarterly earnings among geographic locations agricultural products sold into the northern hemisphere north america europe and parts of asia serve seasonal agricultural markets from march through september generally resulting in earnings in the first second and third quarters markets in the southern hemisphere latin america and parts of the asia pacific region including australia are served from july through february generally resulting in earnings in the third fourth and first quarters the remainder of our business is generally not subject to significant seasonal fluctuations 

competition 

we have a number one or number two market position in many of our product lines based on revenue either globally or in north america largely as a result of our product offerings proprietary technologies and our position as a lowcost producer the following product lines accounted for the majority of our 2011 consolidated revenue market positions are based on the most recently available revenue data 

  



we encounter substantial competition in each of our three business segments this competition is expected to continue in both the united states and markets outside of the united states we market our products through our own sales organization and through alliance partners independent distributors and sales representatives the number of our principal competitors varies from segment to segment in general we compete by operating in a costefficient manner and by leveraging our industry experience to provide advanced technology high product quality and reliability and quality customer and technical service 

our agricultural products segment competes primarily in the global chemical crop protection market for insecticides herbicides and fungicides the industry is characterized by a relatively small number of large competitors and a large number of smaller often regional competitors industry products include crop protection chemicals and for certain major competitors genetically engineered crop biotechnology products competition from generic agrochemical producers has increased as a significant number of product patents held industrywide have expired in the last decade in general we compete as an innovator by focusing on product development including novel formulations proprietary mixes and advanced delivery systems and by acquiring or licensing mostly proprietary chemistries or technologies that complement our product and geographic focus we also differentiate ourselves by our global costcompetitiveness via our manufacturing strategies establishing effective product stewardship programs and developing strategic alliances that strengthen market access in key countries and regions 

with significant positions in markets that include alginate carrageenan microcrystalline cellulose and lithiumbased products our specialty chemicals segment competes on the basis of product differentiation market applications expertise customer service and price biopolymer competes with both direct suppliers of cellulose and seaweed extract as well as suppliers of other hydrocolloids which may provide similar functionality in specific applications in microcrystalline cellulose competitors are typically smaller than us while in seaweed extracts carrageenan and alginates we compete with other broadbased chemical companies we and each of our two most significant competitors in lithium extract the element from naturally occurring lithiumrich brines located in the andes mountains of argentina and chile which are believed to be the world’s most significant and lowest cost sources of lithium 

our industrial chemicals segment serves the soda ash markets worldwide the peroxygens markets predominantly in north america and europe and the zeolite and silicate markets in europe in north america our soda ash business competes with four domestic producers of natural soda ash three of which operate in the vicinity of our mine and processing facilities near green river wyoming outside of the us canada europe and south africa we sell soda ash mainly through ansac internationally our natural soda ash competes with synthetic soda ash manufactured by numerous producers ranging from integrated multinational companies to smaller regional companies we maintain a leading position in the north american market for hydrogen peroxide especially in specialty segments there are currently four other firms competing in the hydrogen peroxide market in north america but most of them focus primarily on the commodity pulp and paper segment the primary competitive factor affecting the sales of soda ash and hydrogen peroxide to commodity markets is price we seek to maintain our competitive position by employing low cost processing technology we possess strong cost and market positions in our european peroxygens business zeolites and silicates in each of these markets we face significant competition from a range of multinational and regional chemical producers we are the only producer of persulfates in the americas but face competition from imports from germany japan taiwan and india in the european persulfates market we compete with two domestic firms as well as imports from china taiwan and india in both regions chinese imports are constrained by the presence of antidumping duties 

research and development expense 

we perform research and development in all of our segments with the majority of our efforts focused in the agricultural products segment the development efforts in the agricultural products segment focus on developing environmentally sound solutions and new product formulations that costeffectively increase farmers’ yields and provide alternatives to existing and new chemistries our research and development expenses in the last three years are set forth below

legal proceedings 

tableend 

like hundreds of other industrial companies we have been named as one of many defendants in asbestosrelated personal injury litigation most of these cases allege personal injury or death resulting from exposure to asbestos in premises of fmc or to asbestoscontaining components installed in machinery or equipment manufactured or sold by discontinued operations the machinery and equipment businesses we owned or operated did not fabricate the asbestoscontaining component parts at issue in the litigation and to this day neither the us occupational safety and health administration nor the environmental protection agency has banned the use of these components further the asbestoscontaining parts for this machinery and equipment were accessible only at the time of infrequent repair and maintenance a few jurisdictions have permitted claims to proceed against equipment manufacturers relating to insulation installed by other companies on such machinery and equipment we believe that overall the claims against fmc are without merit 

as of december 31 2011 there were approximately 12000 premises and product asbestos claims pending against fmc in several jurisdictions since the 1980s we have had discharged approximately 100000 asbestos claims against fmc the overwhelming majority of which have been dismissed without any payment to the plaintiff settlements by us with claimants since that time have totaled approximately 436 million 

we intend to continue managing these cases in accordance with our historical experience we have established a reserve for this litigation within our discontinued operations and believe that any exposure of a loss in excess of the established reserve cannot be reasonably estimated our experience has been that the overall trends in terms of the rate of filing of asbestosrelated claims with respect to all potential defendants has changed over time and that filing rates as to us in particular have varied significantly over the last several years we are a peripheral defendant  that is we have never manufactured asbestos or asbestoscontaining components as a result claim filing rates against us have yet to form a predictable pattern and we are unable to project a reasonably accurate future filing rate and thus we are presently unable to reasonably estimate our asbestos liability with respect to claims that may be filed in the future 

in late june 2004 we were served in a lawsuit captioned “lewis et al v fmc corporation” which was filed in united states district court for the western district of new york the suit was brought by thirteen residents of middleport new york who allege that we violated certain state and federal environmental laws and seeks injunctive relief and monetary damages for personal injuries and property damage in connection with such alleged violations a motion for summary judgment was decided in our favor on march 29 2011 on april 28 2011 the plaintiffs filed an appeal of that decision to the us court of appeals for the second circuit but failed to perfect the appeal and the case was dismissed the plaintiffs filed a new complaint in new york state court in late september 2011 on the state law claims on which the federal district judge did not 

rule in granting the summary judgment motion in the original lawsuit nuisance personal injury and property damage in october 2011 we removed the new lawsuit from the state court to federal court based on diversity of citizenship and filed a motion to dismiss the case on the basis of improper and untimely service of process which remains pending

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

tableend 

overview 

we are a diversified chemical company serving agricultural consumer and industrial markets globally with innovative solutions applications and marketleading products we operate in three distinct business segments agricultural products specialty chemicals and industrial chemicals our agricultural products segment develops markets and sells all three major classes of crop protection chemicals – insecticides herbicides and fungicides – with particular strength in insecticides and herbicides these products are used in agriculture to enhance crop yield and quality by controlling a broad spectrum of insects weeds and disease as well as pest control in nonagricultural markets specialty chemicals consists of our biopolymer and lithium businesses this segment focuses on food ingredients that are used to enhance texture color structure and physical stability pharmaceutical additives for binding encapsulation and disintegrant applications ultrapure biopolymers for medical devices and lithium for energy storage specialty polymers and pharmaceutical synthesis our industrial chemicals segment manufactures a wide range of inorganic materials including soda ash hydrogen peroxide specialty peroxygens zeolites and silicates through december 31 2010 our industrial chemicals segment also held a niche position in phosphorous chemicals products however in november 2010 we made the decision to exit the phosphate business with the shutdown of our huelva facility in spain 

2011 highlights 

our businesses continue to experience positive results primarily from higher volumes and higher pricing results for 2011 reflect increases in both consolidated revenues and earnings in all three of our operating segments driven by solid performance we also made significant progress towards our vision 2015 strategic plan 

the following are the more significant developments in our businesses during the year ended december 31 2011 

 

 2012 outlook 

in 2012 we expect another year of solid performance we expect to have increased revenues driven by higher volumes in our agricultural products segment particularly in latin america north america and asia as a result of strong market conditions and higher selling prices and volumes in both specialty and industrial chemicals 

we expect an increase in earnings mostly driven by higher sales as discussed above our projected earnings increase is expected to be partially offset by higher spending on growth initiatives and higher raw material costs and energy costs we expect cash flow from our business segments to remain strong 

results of operations—2011 2010 and 2009

segment results 

for management purposes segment operating profit is defined as segment revenue less segment operating expenses segment operating expenses consist of costs of sales and services selling general and administrative expenses and research and development expenses we have excluded the following items from segment operating profit corporate staff expense interest income and expense associated with corporate debt facilities and investments income taxes gains or losses on divestitures of businesses restructuring and other charges income nonoperating pension and postretirement charges investment gains and losses loss on extinguishment of debt asset impairments lastin firstout “lifo” inventory adjustments acquisition related charges and other income and expense items 

information about how each of these items relates to our businesses at the segment level and results by segment are discussed below and in note 19 to our consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k 

agricultural products 

  



revenue of 14645 million  increased approximately 18 percent  versus the prior year period due to strong sales in north america latin america and asia slightly offset by the expected decline in europe middle east and africa emea north america revenue of 2844 million increased 12 percent due to increased volumes as a result of strong market demand for our preemergent herbicides partially offset by unfavorable weather conditions experienced in the second quarter of 2011 latin america revenue of 7825 million increased 25 percent driven by favorable market conditions particularly in brazils sugarcane cotton and soybean markets and growth in planted acres for key crops revenue in asia of 2460 million increased 21 percent reflecting continued strong market conditions particularly in australia china indonesia thailand pakistan and 

india as expected these increases were partially offset by a decline in emea revenues of four percent to 1516 million the decline was primarily driven by the absence of sales of our bifenthrin product in europe which is further discussed below under certain regulatory issues 

agricultural products operating profit of 3483 million  increased approximately 13 percent  compared to prior year reflecting the strong sales growth partially offset by increased raw material costs and a 245 million or 13 percent increase in selling and administrative expenses for focused growth initiatives higher peoplerelated costs and unfavorable exchange impacts 

in 2012 we expect fullyear revenue growth of approximately 10 percent reflecting increased volumes in all regions particularly in latin america north america and asia due to anticipated strong market conditions and growth in new and recently introduced products and the sales impact of new fungicide products we expect fullyear segment operating profit growth of approximately 10 percent driven by the sales gains partially offset by higher spending on targeted growth initiatives 

certain regulatory issues 

in the european union eu following an administrative appeals process the european commissions proposal to exclude our bifenthrin product from the european commissions official list of approved pesticides was adopted on november 30 2009 fmc had an additional six months to sell bifenthrin in the eu through may 2010 and subsequently in most eu countries there was up to 612 months for further sale by distributors or dealers and use by farmers on december 30 2010 the french ministry of agriculture issued a notice adding bifenthrin along with eight other pesticidal active ingredients to the “grenelle” list of pesticides while not superseding the remaining sellout and usage period allowed by the eu decision the grenelle listing has had the practical effect of discouraging product use in france during 2011 at the european level we resubmitted for reconsideration the european commission has reviewed the reconsideration dossier and in december 2011 issued its recommendation that bifenthrin be included on the approved product list the commissions recommendation will now be voted on by member states  a decision is expected in the first half of 2012 at the french level we believe that the grenelle listing was unwarranted and contrary to french administrative law and we are challenging the decision through these efforts we are seeking to minimize the interruption in future bifenthrin sales in the european market during 2012 however we are not selling any bifenthrin for agricultural use into the eu and the absence of such sales will not have a material effect on the companys financial condition or results of operations 

we intend to defend vigorously all our products in the us eu and other countries regulatory processes where fmcs pesticide products will be reviewed in the ordinary course of regulatory programs during 2012 as part of the ongoing cycle of reregistration in countries around the world in 2008 the brazilian health surveillance agency informed us that they intend to review carbofuran along with 13 other major pesticides but has yet to issue any required formal announcement that identifies their specific concerns or preliminary position on reregistration we are cooperating and defending our product in this process under the brazilian regulatory process any recommendation would require public notice and comment as well as concurrence from the brazilian environmental and agricultural ministries before any regulatory change is effective thus we do not expect a sales impact in brazil in 2012 

specialty chemicals 

  

revenue in specialty chemicals was 8791 million  an increase of approximately seven percent  versus the prior year the increase was driven primarily by volume increases and higher pricing in biopolymer and favorable pricing in lithium specialties and favorable currency impacts 

biopolymer revenue of 6543 million  increased approximately seven percent from the prior year this increase was due to higher volumes which increased revenue by three percent favorable pricing which impacted sales by two percent and the impact of a stronger euro which accounted for the remaining two percent the volume gains and higher pricing were realized in both the food ingredients and pharmaceutical markets 

lithium revenue of 2248 million  increased approximately six percent compared to the prior year currency impacts resulted in a one percent increase in revenue while pricing was up four percent and volumes were flat as compared to prior year lithium has been impacted by tightening of supply 

segment operating profit of 1998 million  increased eight percent  versus the prior year the increase was primarily driven by the volume gains higher pricing and favorable mix in biopolymer and favorable pricing in lithium offset by adverse weather conditions in argentina which impacted mining operations selling general and administrative expenses increased by 14 percent or 98 million to support growth initiatives 

in 2012 we expect fullyear revenue growth of approximately 10 percent driven by higher selling prices across the segment and higher volumes in biopolymer and lithium primaries fullyear segment operating profit growth is expected to be approximately 10 percent reflecting higher sales partially offset by higher raw material and energy costs 

as we anticipate ongoing growth for microcrystalline cellulose mcc on a global basis especially high in rapidly developing economies in march 2011 we completed the expansion of our mcc plant in cork ireland the expansion now in full production increased our global capacity by approximately 25 percent for food and pharmaceutical grade mcc 

industrial chemicals 

  



revenue in industrial chemicals was 10385 million  a decrease of approximately two percent  versus the prior year the decrease is primarily attributable to the exit of our phosphate and sulfur derivative businesses in spain during 2010 the absence of phosphate and sulfur derivatives revenue in 2011 resulted in overall revenue declines in the segment of approximately 12 percent the decline in these revenues were partially offset by higher pricing across the segment particularly in soda ash which impacted revenues by approximately six percent higher freight billing and favorable currency impacts increased revenue by approximately three percent 

alkali revenues of 6964 million  increased 12 percent  over the prior year due to higher pricing particularly in the export market higher freight billings and slightly higher volumes export demand continues to be robust especially in asia and latin america in our domestic market we experienced higher pricing due to constrained supply while volume growth continues to be in line with the demand recovery being experienced in flat glass detergents and chemicals 

peroxygens revenues of 2974 million  increased 10 percent  over the prior year driven primarily by higher pricing and favorable currency impacts offset by slightly reduced volumes the increased pricing was primarily in our hydrogen peroxide and specialty persulfates product lines 

revenues of 447 million  were 9 percent  higher year over year in zeolites and silicates from 410 million  in the prior year 

segment operating profit of 1545 million  increased approximately 26 percent  versus the year ago period primarily as a result of the higher pricing documented above the exited phosphate and sulfur derivative businesses had a loss of 13 million for the year ended december 31 2010 additionally the startup costs associated with our granger soda ash facility were offset by favorable production efficiencies in alkali selling general and administrative costs increased seven percent or 35 million primarily for targeted growth initiatives 

in 2012 we expect fullyear revenue to be approximately 10 percent due to higher selling prices in soda ash and peroxygens and volume growth in soda ash export markets we expect fullyear operating profit growth of approximately 20 percent driven by higher sales in soda ash and peroxygens and the continued mix shift toward specialty peroxygens 

venezuela investment 

recent events in venezuela such as hyperinflation devaluation of currency government price controls parallel exchange rates and political issues have created significant risks and uncertainties for the venezuelan subsidiaries of multinational corporations we hold a noncontrolling investment in a venezuelan phosphate business tripoliven ca the value of this investment on our consolidated balance sheet at december 31 2011 is approximately 9 million while there has been a lag between the declaration and payment to us of dividends from tripoliven we did receive dividends from tripoliven during 2010 we do not believe there is any impairment of tripoliven at december 31 2011 as tripoliven continues to operate as a profitable business and we expect in the future to recover at least the value of our investment if our investment in tripoliven were to be totally impaired it would have an immaterial impact on our liquidity or consolidated financial position but the impairment charge would have a onetime effect on our results of operations in the period in which it would be recorded 

other results of operations 

corporate expenses 

we recorded expenses of 625 million  in 2011  compared to 630 million  in 2010  the slight decrease was a result of reduced consulting expenses of approximately 3 million during 2011 compared to the same period in 2010 consulting expenses incurred in the latter part of 2010 were associated with our global procurement initiative aimed at reducing the costs of goods and services purchased on a worldwide basis the majority of these consulting expenses were not repeated in 2011 the decrease in consulting expenses were partially offset by increased costs of approximately 2 million to support our global growth initiatives corporate expenses are included as a component of the line item “selling general and administrative expenses” on our consolidated statements of income 

other income expense net 

other expense increased to 187 million  in 2011  from 54 million  in 2010  the increase was primarily due to expense related to an increase in our lifo inventory reserves in 2011 of 26 million versus 2010 where we had a reduction in the lifo reserve of 104 million resulting in a periodtoperiod change of 13 million other income expense net is included as a component of the line item “costs of sales and services” on our consolidated statements of income 

interest expense net 

interest expense net for 2011  of 394 million  was relatively flat compared to the same period in 2010 of 393 million  

corporate special income charges 

restructuring and other charges income 

these charges totaled 324 million  in 2011  compared to 1519 million  in 2010  our restructuring and other charges income are comprised of restructuring asset disposals and other charges income please see the table and further discussion regarding our restructuring and other charges income in note 7 to our consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k restructuring and asset disposal charges in 2011 of 280 million were primarily associated with the sodium percarbonate phaseout charges of 210 million as well as continuing charges related to facility restructurings and shutdowns which were announced in years prior to 2011 other charges income net in 2011 of 44 million was primarily associated with charges of 31 million for environmental remediation at operating sites 

restructuring and asset disposal charges of 1272 million in 2010 were primarily associated with the huelva shutdown charges of 1104 million as well as continuing charges related to facility restructuring and shutdowns which were announced in years prior to 2010 other charges income net in 2010 of 247 million was primarily associated with charges of 142 million for environmental remediation at operating sites and a 57 million charge related to our agricultural products segment acquiring certain rights to a herbicide still under development 

the activity of the restructuring charges listed above are also included within note 7 to our consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k we believe the restructuring plans implemented are on schedule and the benefits and savings either have been or will be achieved 

nonoperating pension and postretirement charges income 

the charge for 2011 was 145 million  compared to 199 million  for 2010 the decrease in charges is primarily the result of a settlement charge of 73 million recorded in 2010 associated with the acceleration of previously deferred pension actuarial losses the acceleration was triggered by a lumpsum payout to our former chairman and ceo in 2010 no such event occurred for the year ended december 31 2011 on the consolidated statements of income these charges are included in “selling general and administrative expenses” 

acquisitionrelated charges 

the charge in 2011 of 08 million related to the expensing of the inventory fair value stepup resulting from the application of purchase accounting the charges for year ended december 31 2011 relate to a number of acquisitions completed in 2011 on the consolidated statements of income these charges for all years presented are included in “costs of sales and services” no such charges occurred for the year ended december 31 2010 see note 3 to our consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k for more information on our acquisitions 

provision for income taxes 

provision for income taxes was 1365 million  for 2011 compared to a provision of 1320 million  for the prior year period resulting in effective tax rates of 248 percent  and 377 percent  respectively the change in the effective tax rate was primarily a result of the change in tax adjustments recorded in 2011 and 2010 as described below 

2011 tax adjustments were favorable in the amount of 09 million primarily related to a reduction of approximately 15 million for our liability for unrecognized tax benefits due to settlements of audits mostly offset by net valuation allowance increases of approximately 13 million the valuation allowance increase was primarily related to foreign operations because of our expectation that the tax losses at these operations are not expected to be fully recoverable in future years from the earnings 

2010 tax adjustments were unfavorable in the amount of 387 million and are primarily a result of recording a 40 million valuation allowance in our spanish legal entity predominantly due to the huelva facility shutdown for tax losses that are not expected to be fully recoverable in future years from the earnings of the remaining businesses in that entity 2010 tax adjustments were also impacted by a 36 million tax charge associated with the tax treatment of the medicare part d subsidy which was enacted as part of the recent us health care reform legislation the unfavorable tax adjustments were partially offset by a reduction in our liability for unrecognized tax benefits due to settlements of audits and expiration of statute of limitation and recognition of various tax credits 

excluding the impact of these tax adjustments our effective tax rate in 2011 was 250 percent versus 266 percent in 2010 this decrease in the effective tax rate is primarily due to changes in the mix of domestic income compared to income earned outside of the us in 2011 a larger portion of our foreign earnings were earned by our operations in hong kong and ireland which have lower tax rates than the us these foreign operations service our global businesses and we anticipate that they will continue to be a larger source of earnings for fmc 

discontinued operations net of income taxes 

our discontinued operations represent adjustments to retained liabilities primarily related to operations discontinued between 1976 and 2001 the primary liabilities retained include environmental liabilities other postretirement benefit liabilities selfinsurance and longterm obligations related to legal proceedings 

discontinued operations net of income taxes totaled a charge of 318 million  for 2011 compared to a charge of 336 million  2010 the charges for 2011 were primarily related to an increase in reserves associated with our front royal site operating and maintenance activities for a number of environmental sites and charges for legal reserves and expenses related to discontinued operations 

the charges for 2010 were primarily related to an increase in the provision for environmental issues at our middleport site as well as operating and maintenance activities for a number of environmental sites and charges for legal reserves and expenses related to discontinued operations 

net income attributable to fmc stockholders 

net income attributable to fmc stockholders increased to 3659 million  for 2011 from 1725 million  for 2010 the increase was primarily due to higher operating profits in all three of our segments a lower effective tax rate and lower restructuring and other charges income these items were partially offset by the increase in lifo inventory adjustments 

year ended december 31 2010 compared to december 31 2009

segment results 

agricultural products 

  

revenue of 12418 million increased 18 percent versus the prior year as higher sales were recognized in north america latin america and asia north america revenue increased 15 percent to 2520 million due to strong demand for our proprietary herbicides growth from new and recently introduced products particularly our newly acquired herbicide fluthiacetmethyl and improving market conditions in some noncrop segments europe middle east and africa revenue of 1587 million were flat year over year latin america revenue of 6289 million increased 24 percent due to improved market conditions particularly in the sugarcane cotton soybeans corn and tobacco segments and growth in new and recently introduced products revenue in asia increased 21 percent to 2021 million reflecting better market conditions the introduction of new products and growth in most countries particularly india indonesia australia and china 

segment operating profit of 3095 million increased seven percent compared to the prior year period reflecting strong sales performance partially offset by higher firsthalf inventory and distribution costs and selling and administrative expenses higher selling and administrative expenses of 337 million or 22 percent increase were primarily due to foreign exchange impacts higher spending on growth initiatives and increased peoplerelated costs 

specialty chemicals 

  



revenue in specialty chemicals was 8245 million an increase of approximately nine percent versus the prioryear period the increase was driven primarily by a robust demand recovery in lithium primaries and strong commercial performance in biopolymer 

biopolymer revenues of 6115 million increased six percent from the prioryear period this increase was primarily due to higher volumes which increased revenue by five percent biopolymer experienced broadbased volume gains across both food and pharmaceutical markets additionally improved pricing and mix increased revenue driven primarily by higher pricing in food ingredients 

lithium revenues of 2130 million increased 22 percent from the prioryear period primarily due to higher volumes driven by improving economic conditions slightly offset by lower pricing higher volumes increased revenue by 29 percent while the lower pricing negatively impacted revenues by seven percent the improving economic conditions in lithium are driven primarily by growth in battery and metals markets in asia 

segment operating profit of 1850 million increased 16 percent versus the year ago period as volume gains in lithium primaries favorable commercial performance in biopolymer and the benefits of productivity initiatives were partially offset by higher raw material costs 

industrial chemicals 

  



revenue in industrial chemicals was 10548 million an increase of approximately three percent versus the prioryear period an increase in volumes across the segment increased revenues by eight percent which was offset by a seven percent decline in pricing soda ash revenues were up due to increased volumes particularly in the export market partially offset by lower prices the segment experienced volume increases in peroxygens and phosphates offset by reduced selling prices for these products the higher volumes in the segment also resulted in increased freight billings which increased revenue by three percent the segment was also negatively impacted by 12 million or one percent decrease due to lower electricity sales due to the divestiture of a spanish cogeneration facility in the third quarter of 2009 in spain we operate electricity cogeneration facilities and sell excess electricity into the spanish electrical grid 

segment operating profit of 1229 million increased approximately 37 percent versus the year ago period driven by the strong demand recovery and lower raw material and energy costs which more than offset lower selling prices across the segment 

other results of operations 

corporate expenses 

we recorded expenses of 630 million in 2010 compared to 441 million in 2009 the increase was primarily due to increased incentive compensation expense of 80 million and consulting expense of 79 million compared to the prior year the increase in consulting services was a result of several new initiatives primarily involving global procurement aimed at reducing the costs of goods and services purchased on a worldwide basis 

other income expense net 

other income expense net is comprised primarily of lifo inventory adjustments other expense was 54 million in 2010 compared to 305 million in 2009 the decrease was due primarily to income related to a 256 million decrease in our lifo inventory reserves 

interest expense net 

the 2010 net interest expense increased to 393 million compared to 270 million in 2009 primarily due to higher interest rates associated with our senior bond offering in the fourth quarter 2009 whose proceeds were used to pay off lower variable rate debt under our committed credit facilities 

corporate special income charges 

restructuring and other charges income   

these charges were 1519 million in 2010 compared to 1328 million in 2009 refer to page 30 for a description of these charges incurred during 2010 during 2009 in response to weaker market conditions we made a number of decisions in that year to realign some of our operating assets we made the decisions to shut down the peroxygens manufacturing facility in santa clara mexico lithium facility in bayport texas operations in barcelona spain and our lithium metal production unit in bromborough uk we incurred restructuring and asset disposal charges in 2009 of 815 million primarily as a result of these decisions other charges income net in 2009 of 513 million were primarily associated with 299 million of legal matters mostly in our industrial chemicals segment as well as charges of 202 million for environmental remediation at operating sites legal matters in our industrial chemicals segment mostly had to do with a charge of 210 million in connection with the resolution of a regulatory matter as well as a 33 million charge related to the settlement of a legal matter 

nonoperating pension and postretirement charges income 

the charge for 2010 was 199 million  compared to income of 30 million  for 2009 the increase in charges is a result of amortization related to pension asset losses incurred in prior periods and a decrease in actual plan discount rates from 2009 to 2010 the charge for 2010 was also impacted by a 73 million settlement charge associated with the acceleration of previously deferred pension actuarial losses the acceleration was triggered by a lumpsum payout to our former chairman and ceo 

acquisitionrelated charges 

the charges in 2009 of 71 million related to the expensing of the inventory fair value stepup resulting from the application of purchase accounting the charges for year ended december 31 2009 relate to a 2008 acquisition in our specialty chemicals segment and a 2009 acquisition in our agricultural products segment additionally the amount in 2009 includes inventory adjustments related to the third quarter 2008 acquisition in our specialty chemicals segment and subsequent alginates business restructuring 

provision for income taxes 

we recorded a provision of 1320 million in 2010 compared with a provision of 530 million in 2009 resulting in effective tax rates of 377 percent and 171 percent respectively the effective tax rate was impacted by tax adjustments recorded in 2010 and 2009 refer to page 31 for a description of these tax adjustments recorded during 2010 the tax adjustments recorded in 2009 are described below 

2009 tax adjustments were favorable in the amount of 437 million and were primarily a result of a reduction in our liability for unrecognized tax benefits due to favorable settlements of tax audits and the expiration of statutes of limitations as well as the reversal of certain domestic related tax valuation allowances these domestic valuation allowances were no longer necessary because of our expectation that the related deferred tax assets were likely to be realized 

excluding the impact of these tax adjustments our effective tax rate in 2010 was 266 percent versus 311 percent in 2009 the fluctuation is primarily the result of the mix of domestic income compared to income we earn domestically as income earned outside of the us is typically taxed at rates lower than income earned inside the us 

discontinued operations net of income tax 

discontinued operations net of income tax totaled a loss of 336 million in 2010 versus a loss of 182 million in 2009 refer to page 31 for a description of our 2010 charges the 2009 loss is primarily related to environmental charges associated with our front royal and middleport sites and operating and maintenance activities for a number of environmental sites partially offset by recoveries related to our front royal site the 2009 loss also includes charges for legal reserves and expenses related to discontinued operations 

net income attributable to fmc stockholders 

net income attributable to fmc stockholders decreased to 1725 million in 2010 compared with 2285 million in 2009 the decrease was primarily due to higher restructuring and other charges income and increased corporate expenses interest expense income taxes and environmental charges partially offsetting these decreases were higher profits across all segments 

liquidity and capital resources 

cash and cash equivalents at december 31 2011 and 2010 were 1589 million  and 1615 million  respectively of the cash and cash equivalents balance at december 31 2011 821 million were held by our foreign subsidiaries our intent is to reinvest permanently the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries and therefore we have not recorded additional taxes that would be payable if we repatriated these earnings in the event that funds from our foreign subsidiaries are repatriated to the us we would be required to accrue and pay us taxes on those amounts 

at december 31 2011 we had total debt of 8256 million  as compared to 6379 million  at december 31 2010 this included 7791 million  and 5030 million  of longterm debt excluding current portions of 195 million  and 1164 million  at december 31 2011 and 2010 respectively other shortterm debt which consists solely of foreign borrowings increased to 270 million  at december 31 2011 compared to 185 million  at december 31 2010 

2011 credit agreement 

on august 5 2011 we executed a new revolving credit facility referred to as the 2011 credit agreement the 2011 credit agreement provides for a 15 billion unsecured revolving credit facility 300 million of which is available for the issuance of letters of credit for the account of the company and certain foreign subsidiaries borrowers and 50 million of which is available for swing line loans to certain borrowers with an expansion feature subject to certain conditions to increase the facility to 225 billion 

there were no borrowings under the 2011 credit agreement at inception and our prior domestic and european credit agreements dated as of august 28 2007 and february 21 2008 respectively were terminated at that time 

loans under the 2011 credit agreement will bear interest at either a floating rate which will be a base rate or a eurocurrency rate equal to the london interbank offered rate for the relevant term plus in each case an applicable margin the applicable fullydrawn margin is 113 percent per year subject to adjustment based on the credit rating assigned to our senior unsecured debt we are required to pay a facility fee on the total amount of the credit facility the initial facility fee is 015 percent per year the applicable margin and the facility fee are subject to adjustment based on the rating assigned to our longterm senior unsecured debt 

among other restrictions the 2011 credit agreement contains financial covenants applicable to fmc and its consolidated subsidiaries related to leverage measured as the ratio of debt to adjusted earnings and interest coverage measured as the ratio of adjusted earnings to interest expense our actual leverage for the four consecutive quarters ended december 31 2011 was 14  which is below the maximum leverage of 35  our actual interest coverage for the four consecutive quarters ended december 31 2011 was 159  which is above the minimum interest coverage of 35  we were in compliance with all covenants at december 31 2011 

2011 senior notes 

on november 22 2011 we issued 300 million aggregate principal amount of 395 percent senior notes due 2022 the net proceeds from the offering were used for general corporate purposes including acquisitions 

statement of cash flows 

cash provided by operating activities was 4256 million  3997 million  and 3435 million  for 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively 

the table below presents the components of net cash provided by operating activities 



 

 35 

 

cash required by operating activities of discontinued operations was 443 million  452 million  and 420 million  for 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively 

the decrease from 2010 to 2011 is a result of reduced spending on legal proceedings partially offset by increased spending on discontinued environment sites the change in 2010 compared to 2009 was due to higher spending on legal proceedings associated with discontinued operations partially offset by lower net environmental spending in 2010 discontinued environmental spending was 211 million in 2011 compared to 171 million in 2010 and 221 million in 2009 the remaining discontinued cash outflows primarily represents spending against reserves for legal proceedings associated with discontinued operations 

cash required by investing activities was 3580 million  1540 million  and 2007 million  for 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively 

the change from 2010 to 2011 was primarily due to the acquisitions completed during 2011 and higher capital spending associated with capacity expansions as compared to 2010 see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included within this form 10k for more information on the 2011 acquisitions the decrease in cash required in 2010 as compared to 2009 was driven primarily by a reduction in acquisitions and capital expenditures 

cash required by financing activities was 253 million  1166 million  and 778 million  in 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively 

the change in 2011 compared to 2010 was primarily due to the issuance of our senior debt notes during 2011 which resulted in a cash inflow of approximately 300 million this inflow was partially offset by repayments of other long term debt during the year and increased capital stock repurchases as compared to 2010 the change from 2009 to 2010 was due primarily to the repurchases of common stock and lower proceeds from borrowings of long term debt partially offset by lower repayments under our committed credit facilities and the inclusion of excess tax benefits from sharebased compensation 

other potential liquidity needs 

our cash needs for 2012 include operating cash requirements capital expenditures scheduled mandatory payments of longterm debt dividend payments share repurchases contributions to our pension plans environmental and asset retirement obligation spending and restructuring we plan to meet our liquidity needs through available cash cash generated from operations and borrowings under our committed revolving credit facility 

projected 2012 capital expenditures are expected to be approximately 30 percent higher than 2011 levels primarily to increase capacity in biopolymer lithium and soda ash 

projected 2012 spending includes approximately 40 million of net environmental remediation spending this spending does not include expected spending of approximately 10 million in 2012 on capital projects relating to environmental control facilities also we expect to spend approximately 30 million in 2012 for environmental compliance costs which we will include as a component of costs of sales and services in our consolidated statements of income since these amounts are not covered by established reserves capital spending to expand maintain or replace equipment at our production facilities may trigger requirements for upgrading our environmental controls which may increase our spending for environmental controls above the foregoing projections 

our us pension plan assets increased slightly from 8424 million at december 31 2010 to 8539 million at december 31 2011 our us pension plan assets comprise approximately 93 percent of our total plan assets with the difference representing plan assets related to foreign pension plans due to lower market return expectations we are reducing our longterm rate of return assumption to 775 percent for 2012 from 85 percent used in 2011 see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements included within this form 10k for details on how we develop our longterm rate of return assumptions in order to reduce future funding volatility we intend to contribute 65 million in 2012 which is in excess of the minimum requirements versus contributions of 55 million in 2011 and 80 million in 2010 we do not believe that the additional contribution will have a 

significant negative impact on our current and future liquidity needs however a continuation of the volatility of interest rates and negative equity returns under current market conditions may require greater contributions to the plan in the future 

on february 18 2011 the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to 2500 million of our common stock at december 31 2011 1398 million remained unused from the authorization on february 17 2012 the board authorized the repurchase of up to an additional 2500 million of our common stock the repurchase program does not include a specific timetable or price targets and may be suspended or terminated at any time shares may be purchased through open market or privately negotiated transactions at the discretion of management based on its evaluation of market conditions and other factors during the year ended december 31 2011 2053478 shares were repurchased under the publicly announced repurchase program for 1651 million from time to time we acquire shares from employees in connection with the vesting exercise and forfeiture of awards under our equity compensation plans 

on july 21 2010 the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act was signed into law title vii of the act contains significant changes in the ways derivatives are regulated several us government regulatory agencies and departments are charged with developing the many regulations required under the new law while the exact effects on fmc cannot be known until final regulations are promulgated we believe our liquidity requirements will be adequately met by the sources available to us 

commitments 

we provide guarantees to financial institutions on behalf of certain agricultural products customers principally in brazil for their seasonal borrowing the total of these guarantees was 185 million  and 241 million  at december 31 2011 and 2010 respectively and are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets for each date as “guarantees of vendor financing” 

shortterm debt consisted of foreign credit lines at december 31 2011 and 2010 we provide parentcompany guarantees to lending institutions providing credit to our foreign subsidiaries 

we continually evaluate our options for divesting real estate holdings and property plant and equipment that are no longer integral to our operating businesses in connection with our property and asset sales and divestitures we have agreed to indemnify the buyer for certain liabilities including environmental contamination and taxes that occurred prior to the date of sale our indemnification obligations with respect to these liabilities may be indefinite as to duration and may or may not be subject to a deductible minimum claim amount or cap as such it is not possible for us to predict the likelihood that a claim will be made or to make a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential loss or range of loss if triggered we may be able to recover certain of the indemnity payments from third parties we have not recorded any specific liabilities for these guarantees 

our total significant committed contracts that we believe will affect cash over the next four years and beyond are as follows 

  

  

 37 

timing of the transaction we have entered into a number of purchase obligations for the sourcing of materials and energy where takeorpay arrangements apply since the majority of the minimum obligations under these contracts are takeorpay commitments over the life of the contract as opposed to a year by year takeorpay the obligations in the table related to these types of contacts are presented in the earliest period in which the minimum obligation could be payable under these types of contracts 

 contingencies 

see note 18 to our consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k 

climate change 

we have been following legislative and regulatory developments regarding climate change because the regulation of greenhouse gases depending on their nature and scope could subject some of our manufacturing operations to additional costs or limits on operations on december 29 2009 epas mandatory reporting of greenhouse gases rule became effective this rule requires fmc to collect information regarding greenhouse gas emissions from our large sources and report them beginning in 2011 our alkali chemicals division mines and processes trona ore into soda ash and related products at our facilities near green river wyoming this activity constitutes most of fmcs greenhouse gas emissions globally in 2011 we reported to the epa under the greenhouse gas reporting rule approximately 16 million metric tons of direct emissions from these operations for 2010 in 2012 we will report approximately 19 million metric tons of direct emissions from these operations for 2011 the reason for the increase in emissions was that during 2011 we recommissioned the first phase of natural soda ash capacity at our green river facility known as granger we expect the total greenhouse gas emissions from our green river wyoming operations to increase further in 2012 reflecting a full year of operations at the granger facility 

in addition two plants in our biopolymer business also reported emissions above the epas reporting threshold but each plants emissions are substantially less than at our green river facilities in total less than 01 million metric tons 

a significant source of greenhouse gas emissions at green river are process emissions that is a significant portion of the greenhouse gases released during the mining and processing of soda ash occurs naturally in the trona ore feedstock unlike the situation with energy efficiency where efficiencies may result in a reduction of greenhouse gases the amount of greenhouse gases present in the trona ore cannot be reduced all of the companies producing natural soda ash have such process emissions yet the lower energy intensity of natural soda ash provides a favorable carbon intensity compared with synthetic soda ash produced throughout the rest of the world even with the additional emissions from the operation of the granger facility our carbon emission intensity is expected to remain favorable compared to our synthetic soda ash competition 

soda ash is an essential raw material in the production of glass of all kinds climate change energy intensity and alternative forms of energy will drive increased production of new forms of glass lower emissivity glass solar panel glass etc and will increase the need for this essential raw material from fmc the soda ash industry has an interest in assuring that climate change legislation or regulation recognizes the benefits of soda ash particularly natural soda ash and the challenges facing this industry in controlling its greenhouse gas emissions 

it is not possible at this time to predict whether or when congress may enact climate change legislation in the united states or what provisions might be included in the final legislation in the absence of federal climate change legislation epa has moved forward with a finding of “endangerment” and a promulgated “tailoring rule” to apply the prevention of significant deterioration psd provisions of the clean air act to greenhouse gas emissions this rule is being challenged in court we have announced engineering of a major process optimization involving solution mining to return granger to nameplate capacity although the innovative process will reduce our energy and carbon intensity if approved by the board of directors this optimization project may require a review for greenhouse gas emissions by epa such a review could impact project schedule or cost 

because of the many variables it is premature to make any estimate of the costs of complying with unenacted federal climate change legislation or as yet unimplemented federal regulations in the united states however we are aware of the potential impacts that could result from emissions regulations in the us that are more stringent than those experienced by our global competitors these could make it more difficult for us to competitively produce natural soda ash at green river a reduction in natural soda ash production as a result of more stringent regulations in the us would lead to more greenhouse gas emissions globally because the lost supply of natural soda ash would be replaced by the more costly and more greenhouse gas intensive synthetic soda ash 

at this point our us facilities are not subject to any state or regional greenhouse gas regulation that limits or imposes fees on current emissions and our foreign operations outside of europe and canada are not subject to national or local greenhouse gas regulation although some of our european and canadian operations may be subject to greenhouse gas regulation the cost to these facilities has not been and is not expected to be material to fmc 

we have considered the potential physical risks to fmc facilities and operations and the indirect consequences of regulation or business trends as a result of potential future climate change because of the many variables not only with respect to the science but also with respect to the nature and effect of future global climate change regulation itself it is impossible to predict in any meaningful way what type of property damage or disruptions to our operations or indirect consequences might result from future climate change 

recently adopted and issued accounting pronouncements and regulatory items 

see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k 

critical accounting policies 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles us gaap  the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses we have described our accounting policies in note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k we have reviewed these accounting policies identifying those that we believe to be critical to the preparation and understanding of our consolidated financial statements we have reviewed these critical accounting policies with the audit committee of the board of directors critical accounting policies are central to our presentation of results of operations and financial condition in accordance with us gaap and require management to make estimates and judgments on certain matters we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience current conditions and other reasonable factors 

environmental obligations and related recoveries 

we provide for environmentalrelated obligations when they are probable and amounts can be reasonably estimated where the available information is sufficient to estimate the amount of liability that estimate has been used where the information is only sufficient to establish a range of probable liability and no point within the range is more likely than any other the lower end of the range has been used 

estimated obligations to remediate sites that involve oversight by the united states environmental protection agency “epa” or similar government agencies are generally accrued no later than when a record of decision “rod” or equivalent is issued or upon completion of a remedial investigationfeasibility study “rifs” or equivalent that is submitted by us to the appropriate government agency or agencies estimates are reviewed quarterly by our environmental remediation management as well as by financial and legal management and if necessary adjusted as additional information becomes available the estimates can change substantially as additional information becomes available regarding the nature or extent of site contamination required remediation methods and other actions by or against governmental agencies or private parties 

our environmental liabilities for continuing and discontinued operations are principally for costs associated with the remediation andor study of sites at which we are alleged to have released hazardous substances into the environment such costs principally include among other items rifs site remediation costs of operation and maintenance of the remediation plan management costs fees to outside law firms and consultants for work related to the environmental effort and future monitoring costs estimated site liabilities are determined based upon existing remediation laws and technologies specific site consultants’ engineering studies or by extrapolating experience with environmental issues at comparable sites 

included in our environmental liabilities are costs for the operation maintenance and monitoring of site remediation plans omm such reserves are based on our best estimates for these omm plans over time we may incur omm costs in excess of these reserves however we are unable to reasonably estimate an amount in excess of our recorded reserves because we cannot reasonably estimate the period for which such omm plans will need to be in place or the future annual cost of such remediation as conditions at these environmental sites change over time such additional omm costs could be significant in total but would be incurred over an extended period of years 

included in the environmental reserve balance other assets balance and disclosure of reasonably possible loss contingencies are amounts from third party insurance policies which we believe are probable of recovery 

provisions for environmental costs are reflected in income net of probable and estimable recoveries from named potentially responsible parties “prps” or other third parties such provisions incorporate inflation and are not discounted to their present values 

in calculating and evaluating the adequacy of our environmental reserves we have taken into account the joint and several liability imposed by comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act “cercla” and the analogous state laws on all prps and have considered the identity and financial condition of the other prps at each site to the extent possible we have also considered the identity and financial condition of other third parties from whom recovery is anticipated as well as the status of our claims against such parties although we are unable to forecast the ultimate contributions of prps and other third parties with absolute certainty the degree of uncertainty with respect to each party is taken into account when determining the environmental reserve by adjusting the reserve to reflect the facts and circumstances on a sitebysite basis our liability includes our best estimate of the costs expected to be paid before the consideration of any potential recoveries from third parties we believe that any recorded recoveries related to prps are realizable in all material respects recoveries are recorded as either an offset in “environmental liabilities continuing and discontinued” or as “other assets” in our consolidated balance sheets in accordance with us accounting literature 

see note 10 to our consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k for changes in estimates associated with our environmental obligations 

impairments and valuation of longlived assets 

our longlived assets include property plant and equipment and longterm investments goodwill and intangible assets we test for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the net book value of these assets may not be recoverable from the estimated undiscounted expected future cash flows expected to result from their use and eventual disposition in cases where the estimated undiscounted expected future cash flows are less than net book value an impairment loss is recognized equal to the amount by which the net book value exceeds the estimated fair value of assets which is based on discounted cash flows at the lowest level determinable the estimated cash flows reflect our assumptions about selling prices volumes costs and market conditions over a reasonable period of time 

we perform an annual impairment test of goodwill in the third quarter the assumptions used to estimate fair value include our best estimate of future growth rates discount rates and market conditions over a reasonable period we performed this test in 2011 and determined that no impairment charge was required see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k for newly issued accounting guidance associated with the annual impairment test requirements 

see note 7 to our consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k for charges associated with longlived asset disposal costs and the activity associated with the restructuring reserves 

pensions and other postretirement benefits 

we provide qualified and nonqualified defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans as well as postretirement health care and life insurance benefit plans to our employees and retirees the costs benefits and obligations related to these benefits reflect key assumptions related to general economic conditions including interest discount rates healthcare cost trend rates expected rates of return on plan assets and the rates of compensation increase for employees the costs benefits and obligations for these benefit programs are also affected by other assumptions such as average retirement age mortality employee turnover and plan participation to the extent our plans’ actual experience as influenced by changing economic and financial market conditions or by changes to our own plans’ demographics differs from these assumptions the costs and obligations for providing these benefits as well as the plans’ funding requirements could increase or decrease when actual results differ from our assumptions the difference is typically recognized over future periods in addition the unrealized gains and losses related to our pension and postretirement benefit obligations may also affect periodic benefit costs benefits in future periods 

we use several assumptions and statistical methods to determine the asset values used to calculate both the expected rate of return on assets component of pension cost and to calculate our plans’ funding requirements the expected rate of return on plan assets is based on a marketrelated value of assets that recognizes investment gains and losses over a fiveyear period we use an actuarial value of assets to determine our plans’ funding requirements the actuarial value of assets must be within a certain range high or low of the actual market value of assets and is adjusted accordingly 

we select the discount rate used to calculate pension and other postretirement obligations based on a review of available yields on highquality corporate bonds as of the measurement date in selecting a discount rate as of december 31 2011 we placed particular emphasis on a discount rate yieldcurve provided by our actuary this yieldcurve when populated with projected cash flows that represented the expected timing and amount of our plans benefit payments produced a single effective interest discount rate of 495 percent which was used to measure the plans liabilities 

the discount rates used at our december 31 2011 and 2010 measurement dates were 495 percent and 540 percent respectively the effect of the change in the discount rate from 540 percent to 495 percent at december 31 2011 resulted in a 606 million increase to our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations the effect of the change in the discount rate from 590 percent at december 31 2009 to 540 percent at december 31 2010 resulted in a 65 million increase to 2011 pension and other postretirement benefit expense 

the change in discount rate from 540 percent at december 31 2010 to 495 percent at december 31 2011 was attributable to a decrease in yields on high quality corporate bonds with cash flows matching the timing and amount of our expected future benefit payments between the 2010 and 2011 measurement dates using the december 31 2010 yield curve our plan cash flows produced a single weightedaverage discount rate of approximately 540 percent matching our plan cash flows to a similarly constructed curve reflecting highyielding bonds available as of december 31 2011 resulted in a single weightedaverage discount rate of approximately 495 percent 

in developing the assumption for the longterm rate of return on assets for our us plan we take into consideration the technical analysis performed by our outside actuaries including historical market returns information on the assumption for longterm real returns by asset class inflation assumptions and expectations for standard deviation related to these best estimates we also consider the historical performance of our own plan’s trust which has earned a compound annual rate of return of approximately 936 percent over the last 20 years which is in excess of comparable market indices for the same period as well as other factors which are discussed in note 13 to our consolidated financial statements in this form 10k additionally see discussion on longterm rate of return under other potential liquidity needs on page 36 

for the sensitivity of our pension costs to incremental changes in assumptions see our discussion below 

sensitivity analysis related to key pension and postretirement benefit assumptions 

a onehalf percent increase in the assumed discount rate would have decreased pension and other postretirement benefit obligations by 669 million and 607 million at december 31 2011 and 2010 respectively and decreased pension and other postretirement benefit costs by 65 million 64 million and 31 million for 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively a onehalf percent decrease in the assumed discount rate would have increased pension and other postretirement benefit 

obligations by 737 million and 666 million at december 31 2011 and 2010 respectively and increased pension and other postretirement benefit net periodic benefit cost by 66 million 65 million and 45 million for 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively 

a onehalf percent increase in the assumed expected longterm rate of return on plan assets would have decreased pension costs by 46 million 45 million and 42 million for 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively a onehalf percent decrease in the assumed longterm rate of return on plan assets would have increased pension costs by 46 million 45 million and 42 million for 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively 

further details on our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and net periodic benefit costs benefits are found in note 13 to our consolidated financial statements in this form 10k 

income taxes 

we have recorded a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized in assessing the need for this allowance we have considered a number of factors including future taxable income the jurisdictions in which such income is earned and our ongoing tax planning strategies in the event that we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period such determination was made similarly should we conclude that we would be able to realize certain deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase income in the period such determination was made 

additionally we file income tax returns in the us federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions the income tax returns for fmc entities taxable in the us and significant foreign jurisdictions are open for examination and adjustment we assess our income tax positions and record a liability for all years open to examination based upon our evaluation of the facts circumstances and information available at the reporting date for those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained we have recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information we adjust these liabilities if necessary upon the completion of tax audits or changes in tax law 

see note 11 to our consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k for additional discussion surrounding income taxes

 item 7a 

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend our earnings cash flows and financial position are exposed to market risks relating to fluctuations in commodity prices interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates our policy is to minimize exposure to our cash flow over time caused by changes in commodity interest and currency exchange rates to accomplish this we have implemented a controlled program of risk management consisting of appropriate derivative contracts entered into with major financial institutions 

the analysis below presents the sensitivity of the market value of our financial instruments to selected changes in market rates and prices the range of changes chosen reflects our view of changes that are reasonably possible over a oneyear period marketvalue estimates are based on the present value of projected future cash flows considering the market rates and prices chosen 

at december 31 2011 our net financial instrument position was a net liability of 59 million  compared to a net liability of 68 million  at december 31 2010 the change in the net financial instrument position was primarily due to lower unrealized losses in our commodity and foreign exchange portfolios 

commodity price risk 

energy costs are approximately nine percent of our cost of sales and services and are diversified among coal electricity and natural gas we attempt to mitigate our exposure to increasing energy costs by hedging the cost of future deliveries of natural gas and by entering into fixedprice contracts for the purchase of coal and fuel oil to analyze the effect of changing energy prices we have performed a sensitivity analysis in which we assume an instantaneous 10 percent change in energy market prices from their levels at december 31 2011 and december 31 2010 with all other variables including interest rates held constant a 10 percent increase in energy market prices would result in a decrease in the net liability position of 25 million at december 31 2011 compared to a 34 million decrease of the net liability position at december 31 2010 a 10 percent decrease in energy market prices would result in an increase of 25 million in the net liability position at december 31 2011 compared to an increase of 34 million of the net liability position at december 31 2010 

our agricultural products segment enters into contracts with certain customers in brazil to exchange our products for future physical delivery of soybeans to mitigate the price risk associated with these barter contracts we enter into offsetting derivatives to hedge our exposure as of december 31 2011 our net financial instrument position was immaterial as of december 31 2010 we had no such contracts in place 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

the primary currencies for which we have exchange rate exposure are the us dollar versus the euro the us dollar versus the chinese yuan and the us dollar versus the brazilian real foreign currency debt and foreign exchange forward contracts are used in countries where we do business thereby reducing our net asset exposure foreign exchange forward contracts are also used to hedge firm and highly anticipated foreign currency cash flows 

to analyze the effects of changing foreign currency rates we have performed a sensitivity analysis in which we assume an instantaneous 10 percent change in the foreign currency exchange rates from their levels at december 31 2011 and december 31 2010 with all other variables including interest rates held constant a 10 percent strengthening of hedged currencies versus our functional currencies would have resulted in an increase of 24 million in the net asset position at december 31 2011 compared to an increase of 333 million in the net liability position at december 31 2010 a 10 percent weakening of hedged currencies versus our functional currencies would have resulted in a decrease of 21 million in the net 

asset position at december 31 2011 compared to a decrease of 311 million in the net liability position at december 31 2010 as a result at december 31 2011 the net asset position would have become a net liability position whereas the net liability position at december 31 2010 would have become a net asset position 

interest rate risk 

one of the strategies that we can use to manage interest rate exposure is to enter into interest rate swap agreements in these agreements we agree to exchange at specified intervals the difference between fixed and variable interest amounts calculated on an agreedupon notional principal amount as of december 31 2011 and december 31 2010 we had no interest rate swap agreements 

our debt portfolio at december 31 2011 is composed of 95 percent fixedrate debt and five percent variablerate debt the variablerate component of our debt portfolio principally consists of borrowings under our 2011 credit agreement variablerate industrial and pollution control revenue bonds and amounts outstanding under foreign subsidiary credit lines changes in interest rates affect different portions of our variablerate debt portfolio in different ways 

based on the variablerate debt in our debt portfolio at december 31 2011 a one percentage point increase in interest rates then in effect would have increased gross interest expense by 04 million and a one percentage point decrease in interest rates then in effect would have decreased gross interest expense by 03 million for the year ended december 31 2011

 item 1 business tableend general 

we are a diversified chemical company serving agricultural consumer and industrial markets globally with innovative solutions applications and marketleading products we operate in three distinct business segments agricultural products specialty chemicals and industrial chemicals our agricultural products segment develops markets and sells all three major classes of crop protection chemicals – insecticides herbicides and fungicides – with particular strength in insecticides and herbicides these products are used in agriculture to enhance crop yield and quality by controlling a broad spectrum of insects weeds and disease as well as pest control in nonagricultural markets specialty chemicals consists of our biopolymer and lithium businesses and focuses on food ingredients that are used to enhance texture structure and physical stability pharmaceutical additives for binding encapsulation and disintegrant applications ultrapure biopolymers for medical devices and lithium for energy storage specialty polymers and pharmaceutical synthesis our industrial chemicals segment manufactures a wide range of inorganic materials including soda ash hydrogen peroxide specialty peroxygens zeolites and silicates through december 31 2010 our industrial chemicals segment also held a niche position in phosphorous chemicals products however in november 2010 we made the decision to exit the phosphate business via the shutdown of our huelva facility in spain 

the following table shows the principal products produced by our three business segments and their raw materials and uses subsequent to the exit of our phosphorous chemicals business 

 

  

   

we have operations in many areas around the world with a worldwide manufacturing and distribution infrastructure we are able to respond rapidly to global customer needs offset downward economic trends in one region with positive trends in another and better match revenues to local costs to mitigate the impact of currency volatility the charts below detail our sales and longlived assets by major geographic region 

 

 our strategy 

throughout 2010 we invested significant resources and managerial time in the development of a new strategic plan for the company this new corporate strategy which we refer to as vision 2015 is focused on driving sales and earnings growth while sustaining a return on invested capital well above our cost of capital and has as its objective of achieving a total shareholder return in the top quartile of a broad group of industry peers vision 2015 has five key elements 

growing leadership positions  we intend to continue to build and strengthen our market leading positions by executing a plan that relies primarily on organic growth complemented by a focused external growth strategy we benefit from a business portfolio that is exposed to faster growing end markets and geographic regions agricultural products’ organic growth plan focuses on market and product innovations while strengthening market access specialty chemicals’ organic focus is primarily on new products and new applications for existing products industrial chemicals’ focus is on new applications for existing chemistries to complement these organic growth initiatives our external growth strategy employs a focused disciplined approach to company product and technology acquisitions we believe this strategy reduces the risk normally inherent in external growth agricultural products intends to complement its organic growth initiatives by acquiring new products and technologies as well as making selective acquisitions principally in adjacent spaces in specialty chemicals the food ingredients market is our top priority for acquisitions that will expand our product line offerings and positions in rapidlydeveloping economies industrial chemicals will evaluate selective acquisitions focused in specialty applications across all businesses our strategy does not include making large scale complex or transformational acquisitions or adding another business platform to our portfolio 

increasing our reach  we intend to bias our growth initiatives toward further strengthening our positions in rapidlydeveloping economies rdes our growth in latin america will be largely driven by leveraging agricultural products’ leadership positions in asia our growth initiatives will be more broadbased with targeted investments in human scientific and technological resources across our businesses in the region in central and eastern europe turkey and russia we will focus on establishing strong footholds in key countries 

capturing the value of common ownership  we are moving from a highly decentralized organizational model to one that has both centralized and decentralized qualities we believe this shift will enable us to better leverage the size and scope of our company to realize cost savings and increase efficiencies yet maintain strong accountability in our business units our initial cost reduction initiatives will focus in such areas as procurement global supply chain and rde infrastructure 

proactively managing our portfolio  in the fourth quarter of 2010 we ceased operations at our phosphates facility in huelva spain due to increasing environmental constraints and poor financial performance following this resolution all 

  

current businesses are well positioned for sustained growth and delivering returns above cost of capital we will continue to assess the performance of all of our businesses and will take actions as needed should a unit’s performance change 

disciplined cash deployment  over the next five years we do not expect that our external growth strategies will consume all cash available for deployment therefore our vision 2015 plan contemplates the return of a significant amount of cash to our shareholders in the form of share repurchases andor increased dividends 

underlying our ambition to deliver our vision 2015 plan is a continued commitment to being safe ethical and responsible stewards as we grow we will do so in a responsible way safety will continue to be of utmost importance meeting and exceeding our customers’ needs will continue to be a primary focus and we will as always conduct our business in an ethical and sustainable manner

see note 19 to our consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k also see below for selected financial information related to our segments 

agricultural products 

financial information in millions 

 

 overview 

our agricultural products segment which represents approximately 40 percent of our 2010 consolidated revenues develops manufactures and sells a portfolio of crop protection professional pest control and lawn and garden products our growth efforts focus on developing environmentally compatible solutions that can effectively increase farmers’ yields provide costeffective alternatives to older chemistries to which insects weeds or disease may have developed resistance and strengthen our customer relevancy in focus markets we are committed to providing unique differentiated products to our customers by acquiring and further developing technologies as well as by making selective investments in innovation to extend product life cycles our external growth efforts include product acquisitions inlicensing of chemistries and technologies and alliances to strengthen our market access or complement our existing product portfolio in 2010 we successfully acquired the proprietary herbicide fluthiacetmethyl which has an excellent fit in our focus market segments and is particularly effective on many toughtocontrol weeds that have developed resistance to glyphosate 

we differentiate ourselves by focusing on specific crops and markets and by our lowcost manufacturing strategy we are continually working to gain access to proprietary chemistries and technologies which are complementary to our existing products and market focus we are encouraged by our progress in licensing and partnering to create proprietary products developing technicallyadvanced delivery systems and commercializing unique product premixes and combinations we are optimistic that these efforts will continue to result in sales and profit growth in the foreseeable future 

  

products and markets 

 

 agricultural products provides a wide range of proprietary branded products—based on both patented and offpatent technologies product branding is a prevalent industry practice used to help maintain and grow market share by promoting enduser recognition and product and supplier reputation agricultural products enjoys relatively strong niche positions in crop and noncrop market segments in the americas europe and other parts of the world and derived approximately 80 percent of its revenue from outside north america in 2010 

insecticides represent the largest product line in the agricultural products segment which include our pyrethroid and carbamate chemistries in which we maintain leading market positions based on revenues our proprietary herbicides have grown significantly over the last several years due to organic growth new product launches product acquisitions and the inlicensing of new chemistries our herbicide portfolio primarily targets niche uses and controls a wide variety of difficulttocontrol weeds we are evaluating opportunities to enhance our market position in fungicides so that we can broaden our portfolio across the three major pesticide categories ie insecticides herbicides and fungicides in 2009 we successfully acquired the proprietary fungicide benalaxyl which has an excellent fit in several regions and crops 

the following table summarizes the principal product chemistries in agricultural products and the principal uses of each chemistry 

 

   

we have entered into a number of agreements with thirdparty pesticide producers under which we work together to develop market andor distribute existing and new pesticide chemistries in various markets these proprietary chemistries and technologies are complementary to our existing products and market strategies the chemistries include flonicamid a unique insecticide for controlling sucking pests cyazofamid a novel fungicide for crop and noncrop uses in the americas fluthiacetmethyl a proprietary herbicide for controlling glyphosateresistant weeds and acetamiprid for pest control markets in north america we also have numerous supply and access agreements with thirdparty producers for other pesticide products including the commercialization of proprietary premixes and combinations 

we access key western european markets through a belgianbased pesticide distribution company belchim crop protection nv in which we have an ownership interest we also have joint venture arrangements with nufarm limited in three countries in eastern europe which allows us to capitalize on growth in this part of europe in north america we access the market through several major national and regional distributors in the large agricultural market of brazil we access the market in part through independent distributors and in part we sell directly to large growers through our own skilled sales and marketing organization through these and other alliances along with our own targeted marketing efforts access to novel technologies and our innovation initiatives we expect to maintain and enhance our access in key agricultural and noncrop markets and develop new products that will help us continue to compete effectively 

we maintain competitive manufacturing cost positions through our strategy of sourcing raw materials intermediates and finished products from third parties in lowercost manufacturing countries such as china india and mexico we have been implementing this lowcost manufacturing strategy for more than ten years this strategy has resulted in significant cost savings and lower capital spending and has reduced the fixed capital intensity of the business since its inception through 2010 we estimate that our lowcost manufacturing strategy has produced annual cost savings of more than 90 million 

growth 

we plan to grow by obtaining new and approved uses for existing product lines and acquiring accessing developing marketing distributing andor selling complementary chemistries andor related technologies in order to enhance and expand our product portfolio and our capabilities to effectively service our target markets and customers our growth will depend on our ability to deliver unique innovative solutions to our customers over the next several years growth is anticipated from our proprietary insecticides herbicides and fungicides as well as recentlyaccessed third party chemistries andor technologies for our insecticides we launched a number of new products expanded labels andor introduced unique formulations that deliver valueadding solutions to our customers the continued spread of herbicideresistant weeds and shifts in weed populations coupled with several recently launched product formulations expanded labels premixes and new chemistries provide growth opportunities for our herbicide product line the successful development and commercialization of our productivityenhancing technologies should also contribute to growth over the next five years 

industry overview 

the three principal categories of agricultural and noncrop chemicals are herbicides representing approximately half of global industry revenue insecticides representing approximately a quarter of global industry revenue and fungicides representing most of the remaining portion of global industry revenue 

insecticides are used to control a wide range of insects including chewing pests such as caterpillars and sucking pests such as aphids insecticides are applied as sprays dusts or granules and are used on a wide variety of crops such as fruits vegetables cotton soybean corn and cereals there are several major classes of insecticide chemistries including organophosphates carbamates pyrethroids and neonicotinoids 

herbicides prevent or inhibit weed growth thereby reducing or eliminating the need for manual or mechanical weeding herbicides can be selective controlling only specific unwanted vegetation or nonselective controlling all vegetation and are also segmented by their time of application preplanting preemergent and postemergent 

fungicides prevent or inhibit the spread of plant disease which can adversely impact crop yields and quality 

fungicides are used on a wide variety of crops such as fruits vegetables soybean cereals and rice 

the agrochemicals industry is relatively consolidated leading crop protection companies syngenta ag bayer ag monsanto company basf ag the dow chemical company and e i du pont de nemours and company dupont 

  

currently represent approximately 75 percent of the industry’s global sales significant drivers for this consolidation have been the growth and grower acceptance of biotechnology employed in row crops and the escalation of research and development and marketing costs 

the next tier of agrochemical producers including fmc makhteshimagan industries ltd sumitomo chemical company limited nufarm limited arysta lifescience corporation united phosphorous limited and cheminova as employ various differentiated strategies and compete by 1 unique technologies 2 focusing on certain crops markets and geographies andor 3 competitive pricing based on lowcost manufacturing positions some of these producers are generic competitors with little or no investment in innovation there is a growing trend among these producers to partner with one another to gain economies of scale and competitive market access more comparable to larger competitors additionally a number of these companies have grown rapidly through acquisitions of other companies andor product divestitures from the leading crop protection companies 

specialty chemicals

 industry overview 

food ingredients 

our biopolymer business serves the texture structure and physical stability “tsps” food ingredients market tsps ingredients impart physical properties to thicken and stabilize foods there are many types of tsps ingredients and a wide range of food groups served including bakery meats dairy and convenience products the industry is dispersed geographically with the majority of our sales in europe north america and asia 

trends driving market growth include increasing consumer interest in healthier foods greater convenience and growth in per capita consumption of processed foods in emerging markets the trend toward health and convenience drives the need for more functional ingredients to impart desired food tastes and textures we believe carrageenan and mcc which address this need are growing faster than the overall tsps market the global customer base for tsps is relatively fragmented and includes large and small food processors consolidation among these customers has been a significant trend over the past several years as a result tsps ingredient suppliers such as us have focused on establishing alliances with market leaders with the goal of reducing costs leveraging technology and expanding product offerings with key accounts 

within the entire food ingredients market there are a relatively large number of suppliers due principally to the broad spectrum of chemistries employed segment leadership global position and investment in technology are key factors to sustaining profitability in addition compared to our business larger suppliers may often provide a broader product line and a range of services to food companies including functional systems or blends the top suppliers of tsps ingredients include fmc dupont jm huber corporation kerry group plc and cargill incorporated 

  

pharmaceutical ingredients 

our biopolymer business sells formulation ingredients to the pharmaceutical industry our raw materials function as binders disintegrants suspending agents and control release compounds in the production of both solid and liquid pharmaceutical products 

competitors tend to be grouped by chemistry our principal mcc competitors include j rettenmaier  sôhne gmbh ming tai chemical co ltd asahi kasei corporation and blanver farmoquimica ltda while pricing pressure from low cost producers is a common competitive dynamic companies like us offset that pressure by providing the most reliable and broadest range of products and services our customers are pharmaceutical firms who depend upon reliable therapeutic performance of their drug products 

we also supply alginates mcc and carrageenan into oral care cosmetics and health care markets highly refined extracts from selected seaweeds provide a broad range of alginate functionality including uses in antireflux dental impressions control release of drugs and wound dressings special grades of carrageenan extracts are used in liquid cough medicines toothpaste and a variety of skin care products

overview 

our industrial chemicals segment which represents 34 percent of our 2010 consolidated revenues has lowcost positions in high volume inorganic chemicals including soda ash and hydrogen peroxide complemented by high value niche positions in specialty alkali and peroxygen products through december 31 2010 we also held a niche position in phosphorous chemicals products however in november 2010 we made the decision to exit the phosphate business and have shutdown our huelva facility in spain our strategic intent for the industrial chemicals group is to create a portfolio of high performing businesses exhibiting greater top and bottom line growth with significantly higher margins and reduced volatility than in the past we will achieve this by enhancing our leadership position in natural soda ash and specialty peroxygens while restructuring our spanish foret subsidiary to its profitable core we expect steady organic growth in our soda ash business due to consistent growth in global demand we anticipate significant organic growth in environmental applications over the next five years and we see opportunities to expand our environmental technology platform through targeted acquisitions of complementary technologies in addition to solid revenue growth we expect improved profit mix stemming from increased specialty market participation and the benefits of restructuring actions 

products and markets 

 

 industrial chemicals serves a diverse group of markets from economicallysensitive industrial sectors to technologyintensive specialty markets we process and sell refined inorganic products that are sought by customers for their critical reactivity or specific functionality in markets such as glass detergents chemicals and pulp and paper in addition we produce purify and market higher value downstream derivatives into specialized and customerspecific applications these applications include electronics biocides and animal nutrition 

alkali 

our alkali chemicals division produces natural soda ash soda ash is used by manufacturers in glass chemical processing and detergent industries to lesser degrees we also produce sodium bicarbonate caustic soda and sodium sesquicarbonate the majority of our alkali sales are manufactured by and sold through fmc wyoming corporation which we manage as an integral part of our alkali business and in which we own shares representing an 875 percent economic interest with the remaining shares held by two japanese companies 

we mine and produce natural soda ash using proprietary lowcost mining technologies such as longwall and solution mining which we believe give us the lowest cost position our two production sites in green river wyoming have the name plate capacity to produce approximately 485 million tons of soda ash annually with approximately 13 million tons of this capacity mothballed at december 31 2010 during 2009 with the economic downturn resulting in a drop in soda ash demand we mothballed the granger facility and consolidated all of our soda ash production at the westvaco facility since then us export markets have recovered much faster than the us domestic market and in january 2011 we announced the restart of our granger production at a rate of 500000 tons per year by july 1 2011 to satisfy export demand we plan to evaluate further production increases at granger during 2011 

  

peroxygens 

we produce hydrogen peroxide at production facilities in the united states canada spain and the netherlands we also participate in a joint venture company in thailand we sell hydrogen peroxide into the pulp and paper industry and increasingly to the chemical processing environmental electronics and food industries we are a leading north american producer of hydrogen peroxide due in part to our broad product line geographicallyadvantaged plant locations stateoftheart processing technology and superior customer service hydrogen peroxide represents approximately 65 percent of our peroxygens sales 

our specialty peroxygens business supplies persulfate products primarily to polymer printed circuit board hair care and soil remediation markets peracetic acid is predominantly supplied to the food industry for biocidal applications typically we compete as a specialty player where we believe that we are differentiated by our strong technical expertise unique process technology intellectual property and geographic location 

zeolites and silicates 

we have two manufacturing facilities in spain where we have market position in zeolites and silicates we sell zeolites and silicates products which are used in detergents car tires pulp and paper markets we are exploring new applications of the zeolite and silicate uses including water treatment environmental applications and agricultural markets 

industry overview 

through december 31 2010 we primarily participated in the following product areas soda ash peroxygens phosphorus chemicals zeolites and silicates subsequent to december 31 2010 and as a result of the huelva facility shutdown our primary product areas are soda ash peroxygens zeolites and silicates these products are generally inorganic and are generally commodities that in many cases have few costeffective substitutes growth is typically a function of industrial production in developed economies and a function of the rate of industrialization in developing economies in the export markets pricing tends to reflect the supply and demand balance as producers add or reduce capacity in response to demand changes 

soda ash 

soda ash is a highly alkaline inorganic chemical essential in the production of glass and widely used in the production of chemicals soaps and detergents and many other products natural soda ash is typically produced from trona a natural form of sodium sesquicarbonate through mining and chemical processing soda ash may also be produced synthetically but this process requires a significant amount of energy and produces large quantities of waste byproducts making it much less costeffective than natural soda ash production 

because of the processing cost advantages of trona and the large natural reserves of trona in the us particularly in green river wyoming all us soda ash is naturally produced by contrast due to a lack of trona the majority of the soda ash that is manufactured in the rest of the world is produced synthetically other us producers are oci chemical corporation solvay sa the general chemical group inc in which a majority stake is owned by tata chemicals limited and nirma limited 

approximately 52 percent of us soda ash production served export markets in 2010 with approximately 31 percent of us soda ash production exported through the american natural soda ash corporation “ansac” ansac is the foreign sales association of wyoming us soda ash producers established in 1983 under the webbpomerene act and subsequent legislation since its creation ansac has been successful in coordinating soda ash exports taking advantage of the inherent cost benefits of us produced natural soda ash and leveraging its large scale of operations to the benefit of its member companies consequently us exports of soda ash have increased over fivefold in the last 25 years 

peroxygens 

hydrogen peroxide is typically sold for use as a bleach or oxidizer as such it often competes with other chemicals capable of performing similar functions some of our specialty peroxygen derivatives eg persulfates and percarbonates also function as bleaching or oxidizing agents environmental regulations regional cost differences primarily due to transportation costs and technical differences in product performance factor into the decision to use hydrogen peroxide or one of its derivatives rather than another product since these considerations vary by region the consumption patterns vary 

  

in different parts of the world hydrogen peroxide is sold in aqueous solutions usually 70 percent 50 percent or 35 percent by weight 

the north american and european pulp and paper industry represents approximately 65 and 70 percent respectively of north american and european demand for hydrogen peroxide in these markets hydrogen peroxide is used as an environmentally friendly bleaching agent to brighten chemical mechanical and recycled pulps as well as to treat a wide range of mill pollutants in the waste stream the north american and european paper markets are mature and new investment in pulp and paper capacity is largely focused in asia and south america the other north american and european hydrogen peroxide producers are eka a wholly owned subsidiary of akzo nobel nv arkema inc evonik industries ag kemira ovj and solvay sa 

zeolites and silicates 

zeolite has a network structure which facilitates the exchange of cations enabling it to soften hard water in detergents environmental regulations limiting or banning the use of sodium tripolyphosphate in detergents have facilitated the introduction of zeolite as builder in detergents the properties of zeolites make them very suitable for specific applications such as adsorption separation ion exchange and others in addition the zeolite network structure can be modified to produce specialty zeolite products designed to meet sophisticated market demands we are currently working on applications to meet these demands the main european zeolite producers are pq industrial zeolite and fmc 

soluble silicates are very versatile inorganic chemical products they are produced by combining various ratios of sand with alkali to obtain a variety of products used in many industries the applications of silicates include detergents ceramics paper foundry construction rubber agriculture textiles and production of other chemicals due to their relatively low price and high logistic cost the silicate market is very fragmented with mostly local production the main european producers are pq cognis and fmc

our raw material requirements vary by business segment and include mineralrelated natural resources trona ore and lithium brines processed chemicals seaweed specialty wood pulps and energy sources such as gas coal oil and electricity raw materials represented approximately 25 percent of our 2010 costs of sales and services and no one raw material represented more than 10 percent of our total raw material purchases 

we extract ores used in industrial chemicals’ manufacturing processes from mines eg trona in north america raw materials used by specialty chemicals include lithium brines various types of seaweed that are sourced on a global basis and specialty pulps which are purchased from selected global producers raw materials used by agricultural products primarily processed chemicals are obtained from a variety of suppliers worldwide through december 31 2010 our huelva facility purchased the raw material phosphorous rock from others 

patents 

we own a number of us and foreign patents trademarks and licenses that are cumulatively important to our business we do not believe that the loss of any one or group of related patents trademarks or licenses would have a material adverse effect on the overall business of fmc the duration of our patents depends on their respective jurisdictions their expiration dates range through 2030 

seasonality 

the seasonal nature of the crop protection market and the geographic spread of the agricultural products business can result in significant variations in quarterly earnings among geographic locations agricultural products sold into the northern hemisphere north america europe and parts of asia serve seasonal agricultural markets from march through september generally resulting in earnings in the first second and third quarters markets in the southern hemisphere latin america and parts of the asia pacific region including australia are served from july through february generally resulting in earnings in the third fourth and first quarters the remainder of our businesses are generally not subject to significant seasonal fluctuations 

  

competition 

we have a number one or number two market position in many of our product lines based on revenue either globally or in north america largely as a result of our product offerings proprietary technologies and our position as a lowcost producer the following product lines accounted for the majority of our 2010 consolidated revenue market positions are based on the most recently available revenue data 

 

 we encounter substantial competition in each of our three business segments this competition is expected to continue in both the united states and markets outside of the united states we market our products through our own sales organization and through alliance partners independent distributors and sales representatives the number of our principal competitors varies from segment to segment in general we compete by operating in a costefficient manner and by leveraging our industry experience to provide advanced technology high product quality and reliability and quality customer and technical service 

our agricultural products segment competes primarily in the global chemical crop protection market for insecticides herbicides and fungicides the industry is characterized by a relatively small number of large competitors and a large number of smaller often regional competitors industry products include crop protection chemicals and for certain major competitors genetically engineered crop biotechnology products competition from generic agrochemical producers has increased as a significant number of product patents held industrywide have expired in the last decade in general we compete as an innovator by focusing on product development including novel formulations proprietary mixes and advanced delivery systems and by acquiring or licensing mostly proprietary chemistries or technologies that complement our product and geographic focus we also differentiate ourselves by our global costcompetitiveness via our manufacturing strategies establishing effective product stewardship programs and developing strategic alliances that strengthen market access in key countries and regions 

with significant positions in markets that include alginate carrageenan microcrystalline cellulose and lithiumbased products our specialty chemicals segment competes on the basis of product differentiation market applications expertise customer service and price biopolymer competes with both direct suppliers of cellulose and seaweed extract as well as suppliers of other hydrocolloids which may provide similar functionality in specific applications in microcrystalline cellulose competitors are typically smaller than us while in seaweed extracts carrageenan and alginates we compete with other broadbased chemical companies we and each of our two most significant competitors in lithium extract the element from naturally occurring lithiumrich brines located in the andes mountains of argentina and chile which are believed to be the world’s most significant and lowest cost sources of lithium 

our industrial chemicals segment serves the soda ash markets worldwide the peroxygens markets predominantly in north america and europe and the zeolite and silicate markets in europe in north america our soda ash business competes with four domestic producers of natural soda ash three of which operate in the vicinity of our mine and processing facilities near green river wyoming outside of the us canada europe and south africa we sell soda ash mainly through ansac internationally our natural soda ash competes with synthetic soda ash manufactured by numerous producers ranging from integrated multinational companies to smaller regional companies we maintain a leading position in the north american market for hydrogen peroxide especially in specialty segments there are currently five other firms competing in the hydrogen peroxide market in north america but most of them focus primarily on the commodity pulp and paper segment the primary competitive factor affecting the sales of soda ash and hydrogen peroxide to commodity markets is price we seek to maintain our competitive position by employing low cost processing technology we possess strong cost and market positions in our european peroxygens business zeolites and silicates in each of these markets we face significant completion from a range of multinational and regional chemical producers 

  

research and development expense 

we perform research and development in all of our segments with the majority of our efforts focused in the agricultural products segment the development efforts in the agricultural products segment focus on developing environmentally sound solutions and new product formulations that costeffectively increase farmers’ yields and provide alternatives to existing and new chemistries our research and development expenses in the last three years are set forth below

 item 3 legal proceedings tableend like hundreds of other industrial companies we have been named as one of many defendants in asbestosrelated personal injury litigation most of these cases allege personal injury or death resulting from exposure to asbestos in premises of fmc or to asbestoscontaining components installed in machinery or equipment manufactured or sold by discontinued operations the machinery and equipment businesses we owned or operated did not fabricate the asbestoscontaining component parts at issue in the litigation and to this day neither the us occupational safety and health administration nor the environmental protection agency has banned the use of these components further the asbestoscontaining parts for this machinery and equipment were accessible only at the time of infrequent repair and maintenance recently a few jurisdictions have permitted claims to proceed against equipment manufacturers relating to insulation installed by other companies on such machinery and equipment we believe that overall the claims against fmc are without merit indeed the bulk of the claims against us to date have been dismissed without payment 

as of december 31 2010 there were approximately 12000 premises and product asbestos claims pending against fmc in several jurisdictions since the 1980s we have had discharged approximately 98000 asbestos claims against fmc the overwhelming majority of which have been dismissed without any payment to the plaintiff settlements by us with claimants since that time have totaled approximately 366 million 

we intend to continue managing these cases in accordance with our historical experience we have established a reserve for this litigation 

in late june 2004 we were served in a lawsuit captioned “lewis et al v fmc corporation” which was filed in united states district court for the western district of new york the suit was brought by thirteen residents of middleport new york who allege that we violated certain state and federal environmental laws and seeks injunctive relief and monetary damages for personal injuries and property damage in connection with such alleged violations a motion for summary was filed by the company in 2007 and is expected to be decided in 2011 we believe this suit is without merit 

we have certain other contingent liabilities arising from litigation claims performance guarantees and other commitments incident to the ordinary course of business based on information currently available and established reserves the ultimate resolution of our known contingencies including the matters described in note 18 to the consolidated financial statements in this form 10k is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or liquidity however there can be no assurance that the outcome of these contingencies will be favorable and adverse results in certain of these contingencies could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or liquidity

minimum future rentals under noncancelable leases are estimated to be payable as follows 257 million in 2011 226 million in 2012 219 million in 2013 195 million in 2014 218 million in 2015 and 270 million thereafter minimum future rentals for transportation assets included above aggregated approximately 956 million against which we expect to continue to receive credits to substantially defray our rental expense 

our minimum commitments under our takeorpay purchase obligations associated with the sourcing of materials and energy total approximately 958 million since the majority of our minimum obligations under these contracts are over the life of the contract as opposed to a yearbyyear basis we are unable to determine the periods in which these obligations could be payable under these contracts however we intend to fulfill the obligations associated with these contracts through our purchases associated with the normal course of business 

the following table provides the estimated undiscounted amount of potential future payments for each major group of guarantees 

 

 other commitments 

we provide guarantees to financial institutions on behalf of certain agricultural products customers principally in brazil for their seasonal borrowing the total of these guarantees was 241 million and 495 million at december 31 2010 and 2009 respectively and are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets for each date as “guarantees of vendor financing” the higher level of guarantees at december 31 2009 compared with december 31 2010 arose from a greater borrowing need of our brazilian sugar cane customers in 2009 

we guarantee repayment of some of the borrowings of certain foreign affiliates accounted for using the equity method for investments as of december 31 2010 these guarantees had maximum potential payments of 62 million compared to 58 million at december 31 2009 

in connection with our property and asset sales and divestitures we have agreed to indemnify the buyer for certain liabilities including environmental contamination and taxes that occurred prior to the date of sale our indemnification obligations with respect to these liabilities may be indefinite as to duration and may or may not be subject to a deductible minimum claim amount or cap as such it is not possible for us to predict the likelihood that a claim will be made or to make a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential loss or range of loss if triggered we may be able to recover certain of the indemnity payments from third parties we have not recorded any specific liabilities for these guarantees 

contingencies 

on january 28 2005 we and our wholly owned subsidiary foret received a statement of objections from the european commission concerning alleged violations of competition law in the hydrogen peroxide business in europe during the period 1994 to 2001 all of the significant european hydrogen peroxide producers also received the statement of objections we and foret responded to the statement of objections in april 2005 and a hearing on the matter was held at the end of june 2005 on may 3 2006 we received a notice from the european commission indicating that the european commission had imposed a fine on us and foret in the aggregate amount of €250 million as a result of alleged violations during the period 19971999 in connection with this fine we recorded an expense of 300 million reflecting thenprevailing exchange rates in our consolidated statements of income for the year ended december 31 2006 this expense was included as a component of “restructuring and other charges income” both we and foret have appealed the decision of the european commission the foret appeal was argued before the court of first instance on march 4 2010 but no decision has been rendered the fmc appeal was argued in may of 2010 during the appeal process interest accrues on the fine which as of december 31 2010 was at a rate of 40 percent per annum we have provided a bank letter of credit in favor of the european commission to guarantee our payment of the fine and accrued interest at december 31 2010 the amount of the letter of credit was €305 million us 412 million 

  

in february 2005 putative direct and indirect purchaser class action complaints were filed against six us hydrogen peroxide producers and certain of their foreign affiliates in various federal courts alleging violations of antitrust laws related cases were also filed in various state courts in january 2009 fmc reached an agreement to settle with the direct purchaser class for 10 million with a pro rata credit for opt outs the 10 million figure was included as a component of “restructuring and other charges income” in our consolidated statements of income for the year ended december 31 2008 ten companies predominantly paper producers opted out of this class settlement fmc settled with two of the ten companies for an amount within the opt out credit described above the remaining eight opt outs filed suit against fmc and in some cases foret these cases were assigned to the same judge as the class action fmc’s motion to dismiss the opt out claims to the extent they were based on foreign purchases was granted on april 1 2010 fmc has settled the remaining claims of these eight opt outs for an aggregate of 17 million which is net of a 03 million opt out credit another individual opt out case was dismissed following the bankrupt opt out’s decision to participate in the class settlement fmc settled the indirect purchaser class claims for 025 million the settlement has been finally approved by the court and all remaining state court cases have been dismissed with prejudice we recorded the 20 million as a component of “restructuring and other charges income” in our consolidated statements of income for the year ended december 31 2010 as a result all us litigation against fmc regarding alleged price fixing in the hydrogen peroxide industry is now concluded we still face putative class actions against fmc and five other major hydrogen peroxide producers in provincial courts in ontario quebec and british columbia under the laws of canada four of the defendants have settled these claims for a total of approximately 205 million on september 28 2009 the ontario superior court of justice certified a class of direct and indirect purchasers of hydrogen peroxide fmc moved for leave to appeal the class certification decision which was denied in june 2010 the company intends to defend these cases since the proceedings are in the preliminary stages with respect to the merits we believe an exposure of loss cannot be reasonably estimated 

like hundreds of other industrial companies we have been named as one of many defendants in asbestosrelated personal injury litigation most of these cases allege personal injury or death resulting from exposure to asbestos in premises of fmc or to asbestoscontaining components installed in machinery or equipment manufactured or sold by discontinued operations we intend to continue managing these cases in accordance with our historical experience we have established a reserve for this litigation within our discontinued operations and believe that any exposure of a loss in excess of the established reserve cannot be reasonably estimated 

in late june 2004 we were served in a lawsuit captioned “lewis et al v fmc corporation” which was filed in united states district court for the western district of new york the suit was brought by thirteen residents of middleport new york who allege that we violated certain state and federal environmental laws and seeks injunctive relief and monetary damages for personal injuries and property damage in connection with such alleged violations a motion for summary was filed by the company in 2007 and is expected to be decided in 2011 we believe this suit is without merit and therefore have not established a reserve for it 

we have certain other contingent liabilities arising from litigation claims performance guarantees and other commitments incident to the ordinary course of business based on information currently available and established reserves the ultimate resolution of our known contingencies including the matters described in this note 18 is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or liquidity however there can be no assurance that the outcome of these contingencies will be favorable and adverse results in certain of these contingencies could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or liquidity

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend overview 

we are a diversified chemical company serving agricultural consumer and industrial markets globally with innovative solutions applications and marketleading products we operate in three distinct business segments agricultural products specialty chemicals and industrial chemicals our agricultural products segment develops markets and sells all three major classes of crop protection chemicals – insecticides herbicides and fungicides – with particular strength in insecticides and herbicides these products are used in agriculture to enhance crop yield and quality by controlling a broad spectrum of insects weeds and disease as well as pest control in nonagricultural markets specialty chemicals consists of our biopolymer and lithium businesses and focuses on food ingredients that are used to enhance texture structure and physical stability pharmaceutical additives for binding encapsulation and disintegrant applications ultrapure biopolymers for medical devices and lithium for energy storage specialty polymers and pharmaceutical synthesis our industrial chemicals segment manufactures a wide range of inorganic materials including soda ash hydrogen peroxide specialty peroxygens zeolites and silicates through december 31 2010 our industrial chemicals segment also held a niche position in phosphorous chemicals products however in november 2010 we made the decision to exit the phosphate business via the shutdown of our huelva facility in spain 

2010 highlights 

our businesses this year have been positively impacted by the increase in global economic activity resulting in higher volumes results for 2010 reflect increases in both consolidated revenues and earnings in all three of our operating segments driven by solid performance 

our agricultural products segment revenues increased 18 percent driven by sales gains in north america latin america particularly brazil and asia due to improved market conditions in several key crops and growth from new and recently introduced products revenue also increased in our specialty chemicals segment with revenues up nine percent compared to the prior year period increases in the specialty chemicals segment were led by a robust demand recovery in lithium primaries and strong commercial performance in biopolymer our industrial chemicals segment revenues increased three percent from prior year period as volume gains across all businesses were largely offset by reduced selling prices and lower electricity sales stemming from the sale of a spanish cogeneration facility in 2009 in spain we operate electricity cogeneration facilities and sell excess electricity into the spanish electrical grid 

agricultural products operating profit increased seven percent compared to the prior year period reflecting strong sales performance partially offset by less favorable mix higher inventory and distribution costs increased selling and administrative expenses and higher spending on growth initiatives specialty chemicals operating profit grew by 16 percent as volume gains in lithium primaries favorable commercial performance in biopolymer and the benefits of productivity initiatives were partially offset by higher raw material costs industrial chemicals operating profit increased 37 percent from the prior year period driven by the strong demand recovery and lower raw material particularly phosphate rock and energy costs which more than offset lower selling prices across the segment see “segment results” section starting on page 28 for further discussion on the results of our operating segments 

in the fourth quarter of 2010 we announced a new corporate strategy which we refer to as vision 2015 vision 2015 is focused on driving sales and earnings growth while sustaining a return on invested capital well above our cost of capital and has as one of its key objectives achieving a total shareholder return in the top quartile of a broad group of industry peers vision 2015 and its five key elements are explained in more detail in our strategy section of this form 10k included in item 1 

in november 2010 we made the decision to cease operations at our huelva spain facility and exit the phosphate business in europe the facility was a part of our subsidiary fmc foret sa “foret” which is included in our industrial chemicals segment the closure of the facility was initiated as a consequence of the spanish judicial ruling which effective january 1 2011 prohibited us from storing phosphogypsum on a site adjacent to our production facility the phosphogypsum is a byproduct of the process of manufacturing phosphoric acid which is used in the manufacturing of our phosphate products since receipt of the unfavorable spanish judicial ruling we attempted to pursue strategic alternatives for our foret phosphorus business with no reasonable economic alternatives the judicial ruling inhibited our ability to cost effectively produce our phosphate product and therefore rendered it uneconomical for fmc to continue operations at the facility the huelva decision resulted in the incurrence of significant restructuring charges in 2010 

  

2011 outlook 

in 2011 we expect a year of solid performance we expect to have an increase to our revenues driven by increased volumes in most regions particularly latin america and asia in our agricultural products segment and favorable commercial performance in biopolymer and higher selling prices and favorable mix in lithium in our specialty chemicals segment this revenue increase will be slightly offset by lower revenue in our industrial chemicals segment as growth in soda ash and peroxygens is expected to be fully offset by the absence of revenue for the exited phosphate business 

we expect an increase in earnings the increase will be partially driven by higher sales as discussed above additionally we expect continued productivity improvements in our specialty chemicals segments as well as the benefit of cost reduction initiatives in our industrial chemicals segment our projected earnings increase will be partially offset by higher spending on growth initiatives and higher raw material costs particularly in our agricultural products segment we expect cash flow from our business segments to remain strong

agricultural products 

 

 revenue of 12418 million increased 18 percent versus the prior year as higher sales were recognized in north america latin america and asia north america revenue increased 15 percent to 2520 million due to strong demand for our proprietary herbicides growth from new and recently introduced products particularly our newly acquired herbicide fluthiacetmethyl and improving market conditions in some noncrop segments europe middle east and africa revenue of 1587 million were flat year over year latin america revenue of 6289 million increased 24 percent due to improved market conditions particularly in the sugarcane cotton soybeans corn and tobacco segments and growth in new and recently introduced products revenue in asia increased 21 percent to 2021 million reflecting better market conditions the introduction of new products and growth in most countries particularly india indonesia australia and china 

segment operating profit of 3095 million increased seven percent compared to the prior year period reflecting strong sales performance partially offset by higher firsthalf inventory and distribution costs and selling and administrative expenses higher selling and administrative expenses were primarily due to foreign exchange impacts higher spending on growth initiatives and increased peoplerelated costs 

in 2011 we expect fullyear revenue growth in the highsingle digits driven by increased volumes in most regions particularly latin america and asia due to expected strong market conditions and growth in new and recently introduced products fullyear segment operating profit growth is expected in the highsingle digits reflecting the sales gains partially offset by higher spending on growth initiatives and higher raw material costs 

certain regulatory issues 

in our agricultural products segment several products are undergoing reregistration in the us andor a comparable regulatory review by the european union “eu” governmental authorities in august 2006 the us environmental protection agency “epa” issued its “interim reregistration eligibility decision” “ired” for our carbofuran insecticide under the us federal pesticide law the ired proposed cancellation of all carbofuran uses in the united states subject to a phase out period for certain minor crop uses while maintaining tolerances for imported commodities bananas coffee rice and sugarcane the epa reiterated its proposal in january 2008 with the issuance of a draft notice of intent to cancel carbofuran use “notice” in february 2008 the epa convened a scientific advisory panel meeting to evaluate scientific issues relevant to the notice separately the us department of agriculture issued its comments on the notice stating that carbofuran should continue to be registered on july 24 2008 the epa published a proposal to revoke all carbofuran tolerances under the federal food drug and cosmetic act in advance of any issuance of a final notice under the federal pesticide law we responded to that notice expressing our strong disagreement with the epa’s proposal to revoke tolerances and our belief that carbofuran residues on food do not pose a threat to human health in may 2009 the epa published its final revocation of all carbofuran tolerances effective december 31 2009 we filed our objections to this revocation and requested a hearing before an administrative law judge on october 30 2009 the epa denied our objections and our request for a hearing we believe that we are entitled to a hearing and we have challenged this decision by seeking judicial review in the us federal courts on july 23 2010 the us court of appeals for the dc circuit ruled that the epa acted arbitrarily and capriciously in revoking the import tolerances and ordered that those tolerances be reinstated however the court did not extend its rationale to the domestic tolerances and instead ruled that the epa had the right to deny our request for administrative hearing in midfebruary 2011 we filed a petition for writ of certiorari seeking review before the us supreme court in light of the december 31 2009 tolerance revocation fmc ceased sales of carbofuran in the united states in 2009 fmc’s sales of our carbofuran products in the united states were not significant and termination of such us sales did not have a material effect on the company’s financial condition or results of operations we do not know the epa’s timing on a final notice of intent to cancel the carbofuran registration though the epa has said it intends to issue such notice after the tolerance revocation decision is finally resolved 

  

in the eu following an administrative appeals process the european commission’s proposal to exclude our bifenthrin product from the european commission’s official list of approved pesticides was adopted on november 30 2009 fmc had an additional six months to sell bifenthrin in the eu ie through endmay 2010 and subsequently in most eu countries there is up to 612 months for further sale by distributors or dealers and use by farmers we have resubmitted for reconsideration and the product dossier is now being reviewed by relevant european authorities on december 30 2010 the french ministry of agriculture issued a notice adding bifenthrin along with eight other pesticidal active ingredients to the “grenelle” list of pesticides prohibited for sale in france we believe that such listing was unwarranted and contrary to french administrative law and we are challenging the decision through these efforts we are seeking to minimize the interruption in existing and future bifenthrin sales in the european market 

we intend to defend vigorously all our products in the us eu and other countries’ regulatory processes where fmc’s pesticide products will be reviewed in the ordinary course of regulatory programs during 2011 as part of the ongoing cycle of reregistration in countries around the world the brazilian health surveillance agency has informed us that they intend to review carbofuran along with 13 other major pesticides but has yet to issue any required formal announcement that identifies their specific concerns or preliminary position on reregistration fmc is cooperating and defending our product in this process under the brazilian regulatory process any recommendation would require public notice and comment as well as concurrence from the brazilian environmental and agricultural ministries before any regulatory change is effective thus we do not expect a potential sales impact in brazil in 2011 

specialty chemicals 

 

 revenue in specialty chemicals was 8245 million an increase of approximately nine percent versus the prioryear period the increase was driven primarily by a robust demand recovery in lithium primaries and strong commercial performance in biopolymer 

biopolymer revenues of 6115 million increased six percent from the prioryear period this increase was primarily due to higher volumes which increased revenue by five percent biopolymer experienced broadbased volume gains across both food and pharmaceutical markets additionally improved pricing and mix increased revenue driven primarily by higher pricing in food ingredients 

lithium revenues of 2130 million increased 22 percent from the prioryear period primarily due to higher volumes driven by improving economic conditions slightly offset by lower pricing higher volumes increased revenue by 29 percent while the lower pricing impacted revenues downward by seven percent the improving economic conditions in lithium are driven primarily by growth in battery and metals markets in asia 

segment operating profit of 1850 million increased 16 percent versus the year ago period as volume gains in lithium primaries favorable commercial performance in biopolymer and the benefits of productivity initiatives were partially offset by higher raw material costs 

in 2011 we expect fullyear revenue growth in the midsingle digits driven by favorable commercial performance in biopolymer and higher selling prices and favorable mix in lithium fullyear segment operating profit growth is expected in the low teens reflecting higher sales across all businesses and continued productivity improvements 

  

industrial chemicals 

 

 revenue in industrial chemicals was 10548 million an increase of approximately three percent versus the prioryear period an increase in volumes across the segment increased revenues by eight percent which was offset by a seven percent decline in pricing soda ash revenues were up due to increased volumes particularly in the export market partially offset by lower prices the segment experienced volume increases in peroxygens and phosphates offset by reduced selling prices for these products the higher volumes in the segment also resulted in increased freight billings which increased revenue by three percent the segment was also negatively impacted by 12 million or one percent decrease due to lower electricity sales due to the divestiture of a spanish cogeneration facility in the third quarter of 2009 in spain we operate electricity cogeneration facilities and sell excess electricity into the spanish electrical grid 

segment operating profit of 1229 million increased approximately 37 percent versus the year ago period driven by the strong demand recovery and lower raw material particularly phosphate rock and energy costs which more than offset lower selling prices across the segment 

in 2011 we expect fullyear revenue to be approximately 5 percent lower as growth in soda ash and peroxygens will be offset by the absence of revenue from the exited phosphate business which occurred at the end of 2010 fullyear operating profit growth is expected in the midtwenties driven by higher selling prices and volume growth augmented by the benefit of cost reduction initiatives 

recent events in venezuela such as hyperinflation devaluation of currency government price controls parallel exchange rates and political issues have created significant risks and uncertainties for the venezuelan operations of usbased companies our spanish subsidiary fmc foret holds a noncontrolling interest in a venezuelan jointventure named tripoliven the value of this investment on our consolidated balance sheet at december 31 2010 is approximately 9 million while the receipts of collecting dividends from this entity have slowed we continued to receive dividends from the entity during 2010 we do not believe there is any impairment of the entity at december 31 2010 and in light of the facts and circumstances noted above will continue to monitor this situation the risks associated with this entity would have an immaterial impact on our liquidity or consolidated financial position but could result in an impact to our results of operations in any one period in the form of an impairment charge 

other results of operations 

corporate expenses 

we recorded expenses of 630 million in 2010 compared to 441 million in 2009 the increase was primarily due to increased incentive compensation expense and consulting expense compared to the prior year the increase in consulting services is a result of several new initiatives primarily involving global procurement aimed at reducing the costs of goods and services purchased on a worldwide basis corporate expenses are included as a component of the line item “selling general and administrative expenses” on our consolidated statements of income 

other income expense net 

other income expense net is comprised primarily of lifo inventory adjustments and pension expense other expense was 180 million in 2010 compared to 275 million in 2009 the decrease was due primarily to income related to a decrease in our lifo inventory reserves these charges were partially offset by higher pension expense and incentive compensation excluding pension expense other income expense net is included as a component of the line item “costs of sales and services” on our consolidated statements of income pension expense is included as a component of the line item “selling general and administrative expenses” on our consolidated statements of income 

interest expense net 

the 2010 net interest expense increased to 393 million compared to 270 million in 2009 primarily due to higher interest rates associated with our senior bond offering in the fourth quarter 2009 whose proceeds were used to pay off lower variable rate debt under out committed credit facilities

on the consolidated statements of income these charges are included in “selling general and administrative expenses” for the year ended december 31 2010 no such event occurred for the year ended december 31 2009 

provision for income taxes 

we recorded a provision of 1320 million in 2010 compared with a provision of 530 million in 2009 resulting in effective tax rates of 377 percent and 171 percent respectively the change in the effective tax rate was primarily a result of tax adjustments recorded in 2010 and 2009 as described below 

2010 tax adjustments were unfavorable in the amount of 387 million and are primarily a result of recording a 40 million valuation allowance in our spanish legal entity predominantly due to the huelva facility shutdown for tax losses that are not expected to be fully recoverable in future years from the earnings of the remaining businesses in that entity 2010 tax adjustments were also impacted by a 36 million tax charge associated with the tax treatment of the medicare part d subsidy which was enacted as part of the recent us health care reform legislation the unfavorable tax adjustments were partially offset by a reduction in our liability for unrecognized tax benefits due to settlements of audits and expiration of statute of limitations and recognition of various tax credits 

2009 tax adjustments were favorable in the amount of 437 million and were primarily a result of a reduction in our liability for unrecognized tax benefits due to favorable settlements of tax audits and the expiration of statutes of limitations as well as the reversal of certain domestic related tax valuation allowances these domestic valuation allowances were no longer necessary because of our expectation that the related deferred tax assets were likely to be realized 

excluding the impact of these tax adjustments our effective tax rate in 2010 was 266 percent versus 311 percent in 2009 and the fluctuation is primarily the result of the mix of domestic income compared to income earned outside of the us income we earn domestically is typically taxed at rates higher than income earned outside the us 

discontinued operations net of income tax 

our discontinued operations represent adjustments to retained liabilities primarily related to operations discontinued between 1976 and 2001 the primary liabilities retained include environmental liabilities other postretirement benefit liabilities selfinsurance and longterm obligations related to legal proceedings 

discontinued operations net of income tax totaled a loss of 336 million in 2010 versus a loss of 182 million in 2009 the 2010 loss is primarily related to environmental charges associated with our middleport site and operating and maintenance activities partially offset by recoveries the 2010 loss also includes charges for legal reserves and expenses related to discontinued operations the 2009 loss is primarily related to environmental charges associated with our front royal and middleport sites and operating and maintenance activities partially offset by recoveries related to our front royal site the 2009 loss also includes charges for legal reserves and expenses related to discontinued operations 

net income attributable to fmc stockholders 

net income attributable to fmc stockholders decreased to 1725 million in 2010 compared with 2285 million in 2009 the decrease was primarily due to higher restructuring and other charges income and increased corporate expenses interest expense income taxes and environmental charges partially offsetting these decreases were higher profits across all segments

segment results 

agricultural products 

 

 revenue of 10516 million was one percent lower than the prior year period as sales gains in north america latin america which is primarily brazil and noncrop markets and generally higher pricing across the entire business were more than fully offset by lower sales in europe and asia which also included unfavorable currency impacts in these two regions north american revenues of 2187 million increased three percent on new product introductions price increases and sales from the cb professional products line acquisition revenues in europe middle east and africa of 1464 million declined 11 percent due to weaker markets and unfavorable currency impacts in latin america revenues increased two percent to 5068 million primarily due to improved second half market conditions in brazil partially offset by unfavorable currency impacts in asia revenues declined two percent to 1666 million due mainly to unfavorable weather conditions weak pest pressures and unfavorable currency impacts 

segment operating profit of 2890 million was 18 percent higher than the prior year driven by growth from new products particularly in north america and brazil better second half market conditions in brazil higher selling prices in most regions continued global supply chain productivity improvements the benefit of indirect tax recoveries in brazil lower raw material costs and lower selling and administrative expenses 

specialty chemicals 

 

 specialty chemicals revenue of 7531 million decreased one percent versus the prior year period the decrease was driven primarily by lower volumes across the lithium business mostly offset by higher selling prices and a full year of revenue related to the acquisitions in the midthird quarter of 2008 in biopolymer 

biopolymer revenues increased to 5792 million which is eight percent higher than prior year this change was due to the benefit of a full year of revenue related to the acquisitions in the midthird quarter of 2008 which increased revenue by ten percent improved pricing and mix increased revenue by an additional five percent these benefits were partially offset by volume declines of approximately three percent and the impact of a weaker euro 

lithium revenues of 1739 million declined 24 percent from the prior year primarily due to weak demand across the business 

segment operating profit of 1596 million was five percent higher than the prior year as favorable commercial performance in biopolymer the benefits of acquisitions in biopolymer productivity initiatives and a recovery of export taxes in argentina were partially offset by lower lithium volumes temporary plant curtailments to reduce inventories and unfavorable currency translation 

  

industrial chemicals 

 

 industrial chemicals revenue of 10267 million decreased 21 percent versus the prior year period due primarily to volume declines across the segment these volume declines reduced segment revenues by approximately 15 percent while pricing remained flat despite a significant yearoveryear reduction in pricing for phosphates the remaining decline of approximately six percent was driven primarily by unfavorable currency impacts and reduced freight billings in line with the volume declines noted above soda ash revenues were down on lower volumes with pricing improvements partially offsetting these unfavorable impacts foret revenues were down on lower volumes and pricing particularly for phosphates and an unfavorable euro finally north american peroxygens revenue decreased primarily due to volume declines partially offset by pricing improvements 

segment operating profit of 897 million was 55 percent lower than the prior period driven by lower volumes across the segment 

other results of operations 

corporate expenses 

we recorded charges of 441 million in 2009 compared to 498 million in 2008 the decrease was primarily due to reduced incentive compensation expense and reductions in discretionary spending compared to the prior year 

other income expense net 

other expense was 275 million in 2009 compared to 86 million in 2008 the increase was due primarily to higher charges related to our lifo inventory reserves higher pension expense and an increase to the mark to market impact of our deferred compensation liability

2008 tax adjustments were favorable in the amount of 87 million and primarily result from a benefit to adjust our reserve for unrecognized tax benefits due to favorable settlements of tax audits partially offsetting this benefit are charges associated with adjustments for prior years’ tax matters 

excluding the impact of these tax adjustments our effective tax rate in 2009 was 311 percent versus 284 percent in 2008 this change was related to the 2009 resolution of a regulatory matter in our industrial chemicals segment that was nondeductible for tax purposes

the change in 2010 compared to 2009 was due to higher spending on legal proceedings associated with discontinued operations partially offset by lower net environmental spending in 2010 the change in 2009 compared to 2008 was due to lower net environmental spending for discontinued sites in 2009 discontinued environmental spending was 171 million in 2010 compared to 221 million in 2009 and 322 million in 2008 the remaining discontinued cash outflows primarily represents spending against reserves for legal proceedings associated with discontinued operations 

cash required by investing activities was 1540 million 2007 million and 1917 million for 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively 

the decrease in cash required in 2010 was driven primarily by a reduction in acquisitions and capital expenditures the increase in cash required in 2009 was driven primarily by significant reduction of proceeds from the sale of the properties and assets during 2009 as compared to 2008 partially offset by reduced spending on acquisitions in 2009 additionally capital expenditures in 2009 were approximately 14 million less than the prior year period 

cash required by financing activities was 1166 million 778 million and 1375 million in 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively 

the change in 2010 compared to 2009 was due primarily to the repurchases of common stock and lower proceeds from borrowings of long term debt partially offset by lower repayments under our committed credit facilities and the inclusion of excess tax benefits from sharebased compensation the change in 2009 compared to 2008 was due primarily to the proceeds from our borrowings of longterm debt a reduction in repurchases of common stock and a reduction in repayments of longterm debt partially offset by higher repayments under our committed credit facilities 

other potential liquidity needs 

our cash needs for 2011 include operating cash requirements capital expenditures scheduled mandatory payments of longterm debt dividend payments contributions to our pension plans environmental spending and restructuring we plan to meet our liquidity needs through available cash cash generated from operations and borrowings under our committed revolving credit facilities we continually evaluate our options for divesting real estate holdings and property plant and equipment that are no longer integral to any of our operating businesses 

projected 2011 capital expenditures are expected to be approximately 15 percent higher than 2010 levels primarily to increase capacity in biopolymer lithium and soda ash 

projected 2011 spending includes approximately 350 million of net environmental remediation spending this spending does not include expected spending of approximately 66 million in 2011 on capital projects relating to environmental control facilities also we expect to spend approximately 239 million in 2011 for environmental compliance costs which we will include as a component of costs of sales and services in our consolidated statements of income since these amounts are not covered by established reserves capital spending to expand maintain or replace equipment at our production facilities may trigger requirements for upgrading our environmental controls which may increase our spending for environmental controls above the foregoing projections 

in regard to our us qualified defined benefit pension plan “us plan” the markets rebounded significantly in 2009 and 2010 exemplified by the sp 500 index in the us increasing 26 percent in 2009 and 15 percent in 2010 as a result of higher returns and contributions our us plan assets increased from 7084 million at december 31 2009 to 8424 million at december 31 2010 our us plan assets comprise approximately 93 percent of our total plan assets with the difference representing plan assets related to foreign pension plans we are maintaining the 85 percent assumption for the longterm rate of return on plan assets used in 2010 for 2011 in developing the assumption for the longterm rate of return on plan assets for our us plan we take into consideration the technical analysis performed by our outside actuaries 

  

including historical market returns information on the assumption for longterm real returns by asset class inflation assumptions and expectations for standard deviation related to these best estimates we also consider the historical performance of our own plan’s trust which earned 15 percent in 2010 and has earned a compound annual rate of return of approximately 11 percent over the last 20 years which is in excess of comparable market indices for the same period as well as other factors given an actively managed investment portfolio the expected annual rate of return by asset class for our portfolio using geometric averaging and after being adjusted for an estimated inflation rate of approximately 25 percent is between 86 percent and 103 percent for equities and between 42 percent and 63 percent for fixedincome investments which generates a total expected portfolio return that is in line with our assumptions for the rate of return on assets in order to reduce future funding volatility we intend to contribute 550 million in 2011 which is in excess of the minimum requirements versus contributions of 800 million in 2010 and 750 million in 2009 we do not believe that the additional contribution will have a significant negative impact on our current and future liquidity needs however a continuation of the volatility of interest rates and negative equity returns under current market conditions may require greater contributions to the plan in the future 

on october 24 2008 the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to 250 million of our common stock at december 31 2010 548 million remained unused of the 2008 authorization on february 18 2011 the board authorized the repurchase of up to an additional 250 million of our common stock for a total of 3048 million the repurchase program does not include a specific timetable or price targets and may be suspended or terminated at any time shares may be purchased through open market or privately negotiated transactions at the discretion of management based on its evaluation of market conditions and other factors during the twelve months ended december 31 2010 we repurchased 1874519 shares under the publicly announced repurchase program for 1350 million we also reacquire shares from time to time from employees in connection with the vesting exercise and forfeiture of awards under our equity compensation plans 

on july 21 2010 the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act was signed into law title vii of the act contains significant changes in the ways derivatives are regulated several us government regulatory agencies and departments are charged with developing largely within 360 days of passage the many regulations required under the new law while the exact effects on fmc cannot be known until final regulations are promulgated we believe the liquidity requirements will be adequately met by the sources available to us 

commitments 

we provide guarantees to financial institutions on behalf of certain agricultural products customers principally in brazil for their seasonal borrowing the total of these guarantees was 241 million and 495 million at december 31 2010 and 2009 respectively and are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets for each date as “guarantees of vendor financing” the higher level of guarantees at december 31 2009 compared with december 31 2010 arose from a greater borrowing need of our brazilian sugar cane customers in 2009 

we guarantee repayment of some of the borrowings of certain foreign affiliates accounted for using the equity method as of december 31 2010 and 2009 these guarantees had maximum potential payments of 62 million and 58 million respectively 

shortterm debt consisted of foreign credit lines at december 31 2010 and 2009 we provide parentcompany guarantees to lending institutions providing credit to our foreign subsidiaries 

in connection with our property and asset sales and divestitures we have agreed to indemnify the buyer for certain liabilities including environmental contamination and taxes that occurred prior to the date of sale our indemnification obligations with respect to these liabilities may be indefinite as to duration and may or may not be subject to a deductible minimum claim amount or cap as such it is not possible for us to predict the likelihood that a claim will be made or to make a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential loss or range of loss if triggered we may be able to recover certain of the indemnity payments from third parties we have not recorded any specific liabilities for these guarantees 

  

our total significant committed contracts that we believe will affect cash over the next four years and beyond are as follows 

 

  

       contingencies 

on january 28 2005 we and our wholly owned subsidiary foret received a statement of objections from the european commission concerning alleged violations of competition law in the hydrogen peroxide business in europe during the period 1994 to 2001 all of the significant european hydrogen peroxide producers also received the statement of objections we and foret responded to the statement of objections in april 2005 and a hearing on the matter was held at the end of june 2005 on may 3 2006 we received a notice from the european commission indicating that the european commission had imposed a fine on us and foret in the aggregate amount of €250 million as a result of alleged violations during the period 19971999 in connection with this fine we recorded an expense of 300 million reflecting thenprevailing exchange rates in our consolidated statements of income for the year ended december 31 2006 this expense was included as a component of “restructuring and other charges income” both we and foret have appealed the decision of the european commission the foret appeal was argued before the court of first instance on march 4 2010 but no decision has been rendered the fmc appeal was argued in may of 2010 during the appeal process interest accrues on the fine which as of december 31 2010 was at a rate of 40 percent per annum we have provided a bank letter of credit in favor of the european commission to guarantee our payment of the fine and accrued interest at december 31 2010 the amount of the letter of credit was €305 million us 412 million 

in february 2005 putative direct and indirect purchaser class action complaints were filed against six us hydrogen peroxide producers and certain of their foreign affiliates in various federal courts alleging violations of antitrust laws related cases were also filed in various state courts in january 2009 fmc reached an agreement to settle with the direct purchaser class for 10 million with a pro rata credit for opt outs the 10 million figure was included as a component of 

  

“restructuring and other charges income” in our consolidated statements of income for the year ended december 31 2008 ten companies predominantly paper producers opted out of this class settlement fmc settled with two of the ten companies for an amount within the opt out credit described above the remaining eight opt outs filed suit against fmc and in some cases foret these cases were assigned to the same judge as the class action fmc’s motion to dismiss the opt out claims to the extent they were based on foreign purchases was granted on april 1 2010 fmc has settled the remaining claims of these eight opt outs for an aggregate of 17 million which is net of a 03 million opt out credit another individual opt out case was dismissed following the bankrupt opt out’s decision to participate in the class settlement fmc settled the indirect purchaser class claims for 025 million the settlement has been finally approved by the court and all remaining state court cases have been dismissed with prejudice we recorded the 20 million as a component of “restructuring and other charges income” in our consolidated statements of income for the year ended december 31 2010 as a result all us litigation against fmc regarding alleged price fixing in the hydrogen peroxide industry is now concluded we still face putative class actions against fmc and five other major hydrogen peroxide producers in provincial courts in ontario quebec and british columbia under the laws of canada four of the defendants have settled these claims for a total of approximately 205 million on september 28 2009 the ontario superior court of justice certified a class of direct and indirect purchasers of hydrogen peroxide fmc moved for leave to appeal the class certification decision which was denied in june 2010 the company intends to defend these cases since the proceedings are in the preliminary stages with respect to the merits we believe an exposure of loss cannot be reasonably estimated 

like hundreds of other industrial companies we have been named as one of many defendants in asbestosrelated personal injury litigation most of these cases allege personal injury or death resulting from exposure to asbestos in premises of fmc or to asbestoscontaining components installed in machinery or equipment manufactured or sold by discontinued operations we intend to continue managing these cases in accordance with our historical experience we have established a reserve for this litigation within our discontinued operations and believe that any exposure of a loss in excess of the established reserve cannot be reasonably estimated 

in late june 2004 we were served in a lawsuit captioned “lewis et al v fmc corporation” which was filed in united states district court for the western district of new york the suit was brought by thirteen residents of middleport new york who allege that we violated certain state and federal environmental laws and seeks injunctive relief and monetary damages for personal injuries and property damage in connection with such alleged violations a motion for summary was filed by the company in 2007 and is expected to be decided in 2011 we believe this suit is without merit and therefore have not established a reserve for it 

we have certain other contingent liabilities arising from litigation claims performance guarantees and other commitments incident to the ordinary course of business based on information currently available and established reserves the ultimate resolution of our known contingencies including the matters described in note 18 to our consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or liquidity however there can be no assurance that the outcome of these contingencies will be favorable and adverse results in certain of these contingencies could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or liquidity  

climate change 

we have been following legislative and regulatory developments regarding climate change because the regulation of greenhouse gases depending on their nature and scope could subject some of our manufacturing operations to additional costs or limits on operations on december 29 2009 epa’s mandatory reporting of greenhouse gases rule became effective this rule requires fmc to collect information regarding greenhouse gas emissions from our large sources and report them beginning in 2011 our alkali chemicals division mines and processes trona ore into soda ash and related products at our facilities near green river wyoming this activity constitutes most of fmc’s greenhouse gas emissions globally we will report to the epa under the greenhouse gas reporting rule approximately 16 million metric tons of direct emissions from these operations for 2010 in addition two plants in our biopolymer business will also be required to report emissions above the epa’s reporting threshold but each plant’s emissions are substantially less than at our green river facilities in total less than 01 million metric tons 

a significant source of greenhouse gas emissions at green river are process emissions that is a significant portion of the greenhouse gases released during the mining and processing of soda ash occurs naturally in the trona ore feedstock unlike the situation with energy efficiency where efficiencies may result in a reduction of greenhouse gases the amount of greenhouse gases present in the trona ore cannot be reduced all of the companies 

  

producing natural soda ash have such process emissions yet the lower energy intensity of natural soda ash provides a favorable carbon intensity compared with synthetic soda ash produced throughout the rest of the world 

energy use is a major cost component of our alkali chemicals business leading to significant focus on reducing all forms of energy the alkali division has continued to make investments to lower energy intensity eg cogeneration solution mining as one of the division’s key performance indicators we measure and review monthly the amount of btuston of soda ash produced in 2010 the soda ash business engaged a third party consultant to assist in identifying new methods to reduce energy usage this effort has proven successful as we have lowered the energy needed per ton of output over the last 6 months and have a management system in place to sustain and build on the methodologies put in place 

the alkali chemicals division currently sells products soda ash sodium bicarbonate ground trona used in environmental scrubbing applications federal regulations require utilities and industrial plants to reduce emissions particularly at coal fired power plants where fmc’s products are sold stiffer regulations are expected to be implemented in the near future clean air interstate rule maximum achievable control technology and national ambient air quality standards that will increase the need for these products the uncertainty of final climate change legislation will likely lead to existing coal fired utility plants remaining in existence for a longer period of time sustaining demand for these products 

in addition soda ash is an essential raw material in the production of glass of all kinds climate change energy intensity and alternative forms of energy will drive increased production of new forms of glass lower emissivity glass solar panel glass etc and will increase the need for this essential raw material from fmc the soda ash industry has an interest in assuring that climate change legislation or regulation recognizes the benefits of soda ash particularly natural soda ash and the challenges facing this industry in controlling its greenhouse gas emissions 

it is not possible at this time to predict whether or when congress may enact climate change legislation in the united states or what provisions might be included in the final legislation in the absence of federal climate change legislation the epa has moved forward with a finding of “endangerment” and a promulgated “tailoring rule” to apply the prevention of significant deterioration psd provisions of the clean air act to greenhouse gas emissions this rule is being challenged in court and there may be bills introduced in congress to withdraw epa’s authority to regulate greenhouse gases under the clean air act while congress considers enactment of federal legislation 

because of the many variables it is premature to make any estimate of the costs of complying with unenacted federal climate change legislation or as yet unimplemented federal regulations in the united states 

at this point our us facilities are not subject to any state or regional greenhouse gas regulation that limits or imposes fees on current emissions and our foreign operations outside of europe and canada are not subject to national or local greenhouse gas regulation although some of our european and canadian operations may be subject to greenhouse gas regulation the cost to these facilities has not been and is not expected to be significant and effect of european union and canadian greenhouse gas regulation has not been and is not expected to be material to fmc 

we have considered the potential physical risks to fmc facilities and operations and the indirect consequences of regulation or business trends as a result of potential future climate change because of the many variables not only with respect to the science but also with respect to the nature and effect of future global climate change regulation itself it is impossible to predict in any meaningful way what type of property damage or disruptions to our operations or indirect consequences might result from future climate change

critical accounting policies 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses we have described our accounting policies in note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k we have reviewed these accounting policies identifying those that we believe to be critical to the preparation and understanding of our consolidated financial statements we have reviewed with the audit committee those accounting policies that we have deemed critical these policies are central to our presentation of results of operations and financial condition and require management to make estimates and judgments on certain matters we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience current conditions and other reasonable factors 

environmental obligations 

we provide for environmentalrelated obligations when they are probable and amounts can be reasonably estimated where the available information is sufficient to estimate the amount of liability that estimate has been used where the information is only sufficient to establish a range of probable liability and no point within the range is more likely than any other the lower end of the range has been used 

estimated obligations to remediate sites that involve oversight by the united states environmental protection agency “epa” or similar government agencies are generally accrued no later than when a record of decision “rod” or equivalent is issued or upon completion of a remedial investigationfeasibility study “rifs” or equivalent that is submitted by us to the appropriate government agency or agencies estimates are reviewed quarterly by our environmental remediation management as well as by financial and legal management and if necessary adjusted as additional information becomes available the estimates can change substantially as additional information becomes available regarding the nature or extent of site contamination required remediation methods and other actions by or against governmental agencies or private parties 

our environmental liabilities for continuing and discontinued operations are principally for costs associated with the remediation andor study of sites at which we are alleged to have released hazardous substances into the environment such costs principally include among other items rifs site remediation costs of operation and maintenance of the remediation plan fees to outside law firms and consultants for work related to the environmental effort and future monitoring costs estimated site liabilities are determined based upon existing remediation laws and technologies specific site consultants’ engineering studies or by extrapolating experience with environmental issues at comparable sites 

included in the environmental reserve balance other assets balance and disclosure of reasonably possible loss contingencies are amounts from third party insurance policies which we believe are probable of recovery 

provisions for environmental costs are reflected in income net of probable and estimable recoveries from named potentially responsible parties “prps” or other third parties such provisions incorporate inflation and are not discounted to their present values 

in calculating and evaluating the adequacy of our environmental reserves we have taken into account the joint and several liability imposed by comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act “cercla” and the analogous state laws on all prps and have considered the identity and financial condition of the other prps at each site to the extent possible we have also considered the identity and financial condition of other third parties from whom recovery is anticipated as well as the status of our claims against such parties although we are unable to forecast the ultimate contributions of prps and other third parties with absolute certainty the degree of uncertainty with respect to each party is taken into account when determining the environmental reserve by adjusting the reserve to reflect the facts and circumstances on a sitebysite basis our liability includes our best estimate of the costs expected to be paid before the consideration of any potential recoveries from third parties we believe that any recorded recoveries related to prps are realizable in all material respects recoveries are recorded as either an offset in “environmental liabilities continuing and discontinued” or as “other assets” in our consolidated balance sheets in accordance with us accounting literature 

see note 10 to our consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k for changes in estimates associated with our environmental obligations 

  

impairments and valuation of longlived assets 

our longlived assets include property plant and equipment and longterm investments goodwill and intangible assets we test for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the net book value of these assets may not be recoverable from the estimated undiscounted expected future cash flows expected to result from their use and eventual disposition in cases where the estimated undiscounted expected future cash flows are less than net book value an impairment loss is recognized equal to the amount by which the net book value exceeds the estimated fair value of assets which is based on discounted cash flows at the lowest level determinable the estimated cash flows reflect our assumptions about selling prices volumes costs and market conditions over a reasonable period of time 

we perform an annual impairment test of goodwill in the third quarter the assumptions used to estimate fair value include our best estimate of future growth rates discount rates and market conditions over a reasonable period we performed this test in 2010 and determined that no impairment charge was required 

see note 7 to our consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k for charges associated with longlived asset disposal costs and the activity associated with the restructuring reserves 

pensions and other postretirement benefits 

we provide qualified and nonqualified defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans as well as postretirement health care and life insurance benefit plans to our employees and retirees the costs benefits and obligations related to these benefits reflect key assumptions related to general economic conditions including interest discount rates healthcare cost trend rates expected rates of return on plan assets and the rates of compensation increases for employees the costs benefits and obligations for these benefit programs are also affected by other assumptions such as average retirement age mortality employee turnover and plan participation to the extent our plans’ actual experience as influenced by changing economic and financial market conditions or by changes to our own plans’ demographics differs from these assumptions the costs and obligations for providing these benefits as well as the plans’ funding requirements could increase or decrease when actual results differ from our assumptions the difference is typically recognized over future periods in addition the unrealized gains and losses related to our pension and postretirement benefit obligations may also affect periodic benefit costs benefits in future periods 

we use certain calculated values of assets under methods both to estimate the expected rate of return on assets component of pension cost and to calculate our plans’ funding requirements the expected rate of return on plan assets is based on a marketrelated value of assets that recognizes investment gains and losses over a fiveyear period we use an actuarial value of assets to determine our plans’ funding requirements the actuarial value of assets must be within a certain range high or low of the actual market value of assets and is adjusted accordingly 

we select the discount rate used to calculate pension and other postretirement obligations based on a review of available yields on highquality corporate bonds including moody’s investors service inc “moody’s” aarated corporate and industrial bond indices in selecting the discount rate for 2010 we placed particular emphasis on a yieldcurve approach designed by our actuary to derive an appropriate discount rate for computing the present value of the future cash flows associated with our pension and other postretirement obligations taking into consideration both the timing and amount of the cash flows the specific interest rates supporting the yield curve were derived from calculated returns yields from a portfolio of highquality aagraded or higher bond investments constructed by our actuary 

in developing the assumption for the longterm rate of return on assets for our us plan we take into consideration the technical analysis performed by our outside actuaries including historical market returns information on the assumption for longterm real returns by asset class inflation assumptions and expectations for standard deviation related to these best estimates we also consider the historical performance of our own plan’s trust which has earned a compound annual rate of return of approximately 1061 percent over the last 20 years which is in excess of comparable market indices for the same period as well as other factors which are discussed in note 13 to our consolidated financial statements in this form 10k for the sensitivity of our pension costs to incremental changes in assumptions see our discussion below 

sensitivity analysis related to key pension and postretirement benefit assumptions 

a onehalf percent increase in the assumed discount rate would have decreased pension and other postretirement benefit obligations by 607 million and 547 million at december 31 2010 and 2009 respectively and decreased pension and other postretirement benefit costs by 64 million 31 million and 05 million for 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively a onehalf percent decrease in the assumed discount rate would have increased pension and other postretirement benefit 

  

obligations by 666 million and 599 million at december 31 2010 and 2009 respectively and increased pension and other postretirement benefit net periodic benefit cost by 65 million 45 million and 05 million for 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively 

a onehalf percent increase in the assumed expected longterm rate of return on plan assets would have decreased pension costs by 45 million 42 million and 42 million for 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively a onehalf percent decrease in the assumed longterm rate of return on plan assets would have increased pension costs by 45 million 42 million and 42 million for 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively 

further details on our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and net periodic benefit costs benefits are found in note 13 to our consolidated financial statements in this form 10k 

income taxes 

we have recorded a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized in assessing the need for this allowance we have considered a number of factors including future taxable income the jurisdictions in which such income is earned and our ongoing tax planning strategies in the event that we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period such determination was made similarly should we conclude that we would be able to realize certain deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase income in the period such determination was made 

additionally we file income tax returns in the us federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions the income tax returns for fmc entities taxable in the us and significant foreign jurisdictions are open for examination and adjustment we assess our income tax positions and record a liability for all years open to examination based upon our evaluation of the facts circumstances and information available at the reporting date for those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained we have recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information we adjust these liabilities if necessary upon the completion of tax audits or changes in tax law 

see note 11 to our consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k for additional discussion surrounding income taxes 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we do not have any offbalance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition changes in financial condition revenues or expenses results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors 

dividends 

on january 20 2011 we paid dividends aggregating 90 million to our shareholders of record as of december 31 2010 this amount is included in “accrued and other liabilities” on the consolidated balance sheets as of december 31 2010 for the years ended december 31 2010 2009 and 2008 we paid 364 million 363 million and 344 million in dividends respectively

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend our earnings cash flows and financial position are exposed to market risks relating to fluctuations in commodity prices interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates our policy is to minimize exposure to our cash flow over time caused by changes in commodity interest and currency exchange rates to accomplish this we have implemented a controlled program of risk management consisting of appropriate derivative contracts entered into with major financial institutions see note 17 to our consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k for additional discussion surrounding the accounting treatment of our financial instruments 

the analysis below presents the sensitivity of the market value of our financial instruments to selected changes in market rates and prices the range of changes chosen reflects our view of changes that are reasonably possible over a oneyear period marketvalue estimates are based on the present value of projected future cash flows considering the market rates and prices chosen 

at december 31 2010 our net financial instrument position was a net liability of 68 million compared to a net asset of 03 million at december 31 2009 the change in the net financial instrument position was primarily due to higher unrealized losses in our commodity and foreign exchange portfolios 

commodity price risk 

energy costs are approximately 9 percent of our costs of sales and services and are diversified among coal electricity and natural gas we attempt to mitigate our exposure to increasing energy costs by hedging the cost of future deliveries of natural gas and by entering into fixedprice contracts for the purchase of coal and fuel oil to analyze the effect of changing energy prices we have performed a sensitivity analysis in which we assume an instantaneous 10 percent change in energy market prices from their levels at december 31 2010 and december 31 2009 with all other variables including interest rates held constant a 10 percent increase in energy market prices would result in a decrease of the net liability position of 34 million at december 31 2010 compared to a 51 million increase in the net asset position at december 31 2009 a 10 percent decrease in energy market prices would result in an increase of 34 million in the net liability position at december 31 2010 compared to a decrease of 70 million in the net asset position at december 31 2009 as a result at december 31 2009 the net asset position would have become a net liability position 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

the primary currencies for which we have exchange rate exposure are the us dollar versus the euro the us dollar versus the chinese yuan and the us dollar versus the brazilian real foreign currency debt and foreign exchange forward contracts are used in countries where we do business thereby reducing our net asset exposure foreign exchange forward contracts are also used to hedge firm and highly anticipated foreign currency cash flows 

to analyze the effects of changing foreign currency rates we have performed a sensitivity analysis in which we assume an instantaneous 10 percent change in the foreign currency exchange rates from their levels at december 31 2010 and december 31 2009 with all other variables including interest rates held constant a 10 percent strengthening of hedged currencies versus our functional currencies would have resulted in an increase of 333 million in the net liability position at december 31 2010 compared to an increase of 175 million in the net liability position at december 31 2009 a 10 percent weakening of hedged currencies versus our functional currencies would have resulted in a decrease of 311 million in the net liability position at december 31 2009 compared to a decrease of 178 million in the net liability position at december 31 2009 as a result at december 31 2010 and 2009 the net liability position would have become a net asset position 

interest rate risk 

one of the strategies that we can use to manage interest rate exposure is to enter into interest rate swap agreements in these agreements we agree to exchange at specified intervals the difference between fixed and variable interest amounts calculated on an agreedupon notional principal amount as of december 31 2010 and december 31 2009 we had no interest rate swap agreements 

our debt portfolio at december 31 2010 is composed of 93 percent fixedrate debt and 7 percent variablerate debt the variablerate component of our debt portfolio principally consists of borrowings under our domestic and european credit agreements variablerate industrial and pollution control revenue bonds and amounts outstanding under foreign 

  

subsidiary credit lines changes in interest rates affect different portions of our variablerate debt portfolio in different ways 

based on the variablerate debt in our debt portfolio at december 31 2010 a one percentage point increase in interest rates then in effect would have increased gross interest expense for 2010 by 04 million and a one percentage point decrease in interest rates then in effect would have decreased gross interest expense for 2010 by 03 million

 item 1 business tableend general 

we are a diversified chemical company serving agricultural consumer and industrial markets globally with innovative solutions applications and marketleading products we operate in three distinct business segments agricultural products specialty chemicals and industrial chemicals our agricultural products segment develops markets and sells all three major classes of crop protection chemicals—insecticides herbicides and fungicides—with particular strength in insecticides and herbicides these products are used in agriculture to enhance crop yield and quality by controlling a broad spectrum of insects weeds and disease as well as pest control in nonagricultural markets specialty chemicals consists of our biopolymer and lithium businesses and focuses on food ingredients that are used to enhance texture structure and physical stability pharmaceutical additives for binding encapsulation and disintegrant applications ultrapure biopolymers for medical devices and lithium specialties for pharmaceutical synthesis specialty polymers and energy storage our industrial chemicals segment manufactures a wide range of inorganic materials including soda ash hydrogen peroxide specialty peroxygens and phosphorus chemicals 

the following table shows the principal products produced by our three business segments and their raw materials and uses 

 

   

we have operations in many areas around the world with a worldwide manufacturing and distribution infrastructure we are able to respond rapidly to global customer needs offset downward economic trends in one region with positive trends in another and better match revenues to local costs to mitigate the impact of currency volatility the charts below detail our sales and longlived assets by major geographic region 

 

 our strategy 

our corporate strategy is balanced between driving growth and innovation within our specialty chemicals and agricultural products segments and generating strong cash flow in our industrial chemicals segment our longterm objectives are as follows 

realize the operating leverage inherent in our businesses we intend to maximize earnings growth and return on capital by maintaining or enhancing our market positions reducing costs and prudently managing our asset base in soda ash we continually strive to optimize our proprietary and lowcost solution mining and longwall mining techniques thereby reducing our production costs which we believe are already the lowest in the industry in foret which is part of our industrial chemicals segment we are selectively shutting down higher cost production capacities to improve profitability in agricultural products we completed the shutdown of operations at our baltimore maryland facility as part of our ongoing program to reduce manufacturing costs by producing our products andor intermediates in lowercost locations additionally we shut down our peroxygens’ manufacturing facility in santa clara mexico our lithium facility in bayport texas our lithium metal production unit in bromborough uk and we also curtailed our soda ash operations at our granger wyoming facility 

maintain strategic and financial flexibility going forward we expect continued sustained growth in our operating profit and resulting cash provided by operating activities furthermore our businesses will meet future expected demand growth through a combination of debottlenecking current production restarting mothballed capacity and sourcing from third parties 

focus the portfolio on higher growth businesses our goal is to achieve the highest overall growth while continuing to generate returns above our cost of capital in this regard we intend to focus on building upon our core franchises in the food ingredient pharmaceutical energy storage crop protection and nonagricultural pest control markets that exist within the specialty chemicals and agricultural products segments innovation will continue to be a core element of our growth strategy in both of these business segments our biopolymer business is developing new pharmaceutical delivery systems and working closely with top global food companies in the development of new health and convenience foods our lithium business is developing applications for 

  

energy storage markets to serve the rapid growth in global demand for handheld electronic devices our agricultural products business is testing proprietary product differentiating technologies which could improve the biological efficacy andor the cost competitiveness of existing and new chemistries thereby potentially enhancing those products’ market acceptance and value to endusers in addition to innovation product or business acquisitions inlicensing alliances and equity ventures are also strategic options we may consider to enhance our technology offerings broaden our market access and extend our geographic footprint each growth opportunity will be evaluated in the context of value creation for our shareholders including the degree to which the opportunity complements one of our existing franchises generates substantial synergies and is accretive to earnings finally we intend to divest any business that cannot sustain a return above its cost of capital 

financial information about our business segments 

see note 19 to our consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k also see below for selected financial information related to our segments 

agricultural products 

financial information in millions 

 

 overview 

our agricultural products segment which represents approximately 37 percent of our 2009 consolidated revenues develops manufactures and sells a portfolio of crop protection professional pest control and lawn and garden products our innovation and growth efforts focus on developing environmentally compatible solutions that can effectively increase farmers’ yields and provide costeffective alternatives to older chemistries to which insects weeds or disease may have developed resistance over the last several years we restructured and redeployed our research and development resources to focus our innovation efforts towards accelerating the development of new products and productivityenhancing technologies to our customers in addition to internal development our growth efforts include product acquisitions inlicensing of chemistries and technologies and alliances which strengthen our market access or complement our existing product portfolio 

we differentiate ourselves by our focused strategy in selected products crops and markets coupled with our lowcost manufacturing strategy we are continually working to gain access to proprietary chemistries and technologies from third parties which are complementary to our existing products and market focus we are 

  

encouraged by our progress in licensing and partnering to create proprietary products developing technically advanced delivery systems and commercializing unique product premixes and combinations we are optimistic that these efforts will continue to result in sales and profit growth in the forseeable future 

products and markets 

 

 agricultural products provides a wide range of proprietary branded products—based on both patented and offpatent technologies—for global crop protection professional pest control and lawn and garden markets product branding is a prevalent industry practice used to help maintain and grow market share by promoting enduser recognition and product and supplier reputation agricultural products enjoys relatively strong niche positions in crop and noncrop market segments in the americas europe and other parts of the world and derived approximately 79 percent of its revenue from outside north america in 2009 

insecticides represent the largest product line in the agricultural products segment which include our pyrethroid and carbamate chemistries in which we maintain leading market positions based on revenues our proprietary herbicides have grown significantly over the last several years due to organic growth new product launches and the inlicensing of new chemistries our herbicide portfolio primarily targets niche uses and controls a wide variety of difficulttocontrol weeds we are also evaluating opportunities to enhance our market position in fungicides so that we can broaden our portfolio across the three major pesticide categories ie insecticides herbicides and fungicides in 2009 we successfully acquired the proprietary fungicide benalaxyl which has an excellent fit in several of our focus market segments 

  

the following table summarizes the principal product chemistries in agricultural products and the principal uses of each chemistry 

 

 over the last several years we have entered into a number of agreements with thirdparty pesticide producers under which we work together to develop market andor distribute existing and new pesticide chemistries in various markets these proprietary chemistries and technologies are complementary to our existing products and market strategies the chemistries include flonicamid a unique insecticide for controlling sucking pests cyazofamid a novel fungicide for crop and noncrop uses in the americas fluthiacetmethyl a proprietary herbicide for controlling glyphosateresistant weeds and acetamiprid for pest control markets in north america we also have numerous supply and access agreements with thirdparty producers for other pesticide products including the commercialization of proprietary premixes and combinations 

we access key western european markets through a belgianbased pesticide distribution company belchim crop protection nv in which we have an ownership interest we also have joint venture arrangements with nufarm limited in three countries in eastern europe which allows us to capitalize on growth in this part of europe in north america we access the market through several major national and regional distributors in the large agricultural market of brazil we access the market in part through independent distributors and in part we sell directly to large growers through our own skilled sales and marketing organization through these and other alliances along with our own targeted marketing efforts access to novel technologies and our innovation initiatives we expect to maintain and enhance our access in key agricultural and noncrop markets and develop new products that will help us continue to compete effectively 

we maintain competitive manufacturing cost positions through our strategy of sourcing raw materials intermediates and finished products from third parties in lowercost manufacturing countries such as china india and mexico we have been implementing this lowcost manufacturing strategy for more than ten years this strategy has resulted in significant cost savings and lower capital spending and has reduced the fixed capital intensity of the business since its inception through 2009 we estimate that our lowcost manufacturing strategy has produced annual cost savings of approximately 90 million 

  

growth 

we plan to grow by obtaining new and approved uses for existing product lines and acquiring accessing developing marketing distributing andor selling complementary chemistries andor related technologies in order to enhance and expand our product portfolio and our capabilities to effectively service our target markets and customers our growth will depend on our ability to deliver unique innovative solutions to our customers over the next several years growth is anticipated from our proprietary insecticides herbicides and fungicides as well as recentlyaccessed third party chemistries andor technologies for our insecticides we launched a number of new products expanded labels andor introduced unique formulations that deliver valueadding solutions to our customers the continued spread of herbicideresistant weeds and shifts in weed populations coupled with several recently launched product formulations expanded labels premixes and new chemistries provide growth opportunities for our herbicide product line the successful development and commercialization of our productivityenhancing technologies should also contribute to growth over the next three to five years 

industry overview 

the three principal categories of agricultural and noncrop chemicals are herbicides representing approximately half of global industry revenue insecticides representing approximately a quarter of global industry revenue and fungicides representing most of the remaining portion of global industry revenue 

insecticides are used to control a wide range of insects including chewing pests such as caterpillars and sucking pests such as aphids insecticides are applied as sprays dusts or granules and are used on a wide variety of crops such as fruits vegetables cotton soybean corn and cereals there are several major classes of insecticide chemistries including organophosphates carbamates pyrethroids and neonicotinoids 

herbicides prevent or inhibit weed growth thereby reducing or eliminating the need for manual or mechanical weeding herbicides can be selective controlling only specific unwanted vegetation or nonselective controlling all vegetation and are also segmented by their time of application preplanting preemergent and postemergent 

fungicides prevent or inhibit the spread of plant disease which can adversely impact crop yields and quality fungicides are used on a wide variety of crops such as fruits vegetables soybean cereals and rice 

the agrochemicals industry has undergone significant consolidation over the past ten years leading crop protection companies syngenta ag bayer ag monsanto company basf ag the dow chemical company and e i du pont de nemours and company dupont currently represent approximately 75 percent of the industry’s global sales significant drivers for this consolidation have been the growth and grower acceptance of biotechnology employed in row crops and the escalation of research and development and marketing costs 

the next tier of agrochemical producers including fmc makhteshimagan industries ltd sumitomo chemical company limited nufarm limited arysta lifescience corporation united phosphorous limited and cheminova as employ various differentiated strategies and compete by 1 unique technologies 2 focusing on certain crops markets and geographies andor 3 competitive pricing based on lowcost manufacturing positions some of these producers are generic competitors with little or no investment in innovation there is a growing trend among these producers to partner with one another to gain economies of scale and competitive market access more comparable to larger competitors additionally a number of these companies have grown rapidly through acquisitions of other companies andor product divestitures from the leading crop protection companies

financial information in millions 

 

 overview 

our specialty chemicals segment which represents 27 percent of our 2009 consolidated revenues is focused on highperformance food ingredients pharmaceutical excipients and encapsulants biomedical technologies and lithium specialty products all of which enjoy solid customer bases and consistent growing demand the significant majority of specialty chemicals sales are to customers in noncyclical end markets we believe that our future growth in this segment will continue to be based on the valueadded performance capabilities of these products and our research and development capabilities as well as on the alliances and the close working relationships we have developed with key global customers 

products and markets 

 

   

biopolymer 

biopolymer is organized around the food pharmaceutical and biomedical device markets and is a key supplier to many companies in these markets many of biopolymer’s customers in the food and pharmaceutical markets have come to rely on us for the majority of their supply requirements for these product lines we believe that such reliance is based on our innovative solutions and operational quality 

biopolymer is a supplier of microcrystalline cellulose mcc carrageenan and alginates—ingredients that have high valueadded applications in the production of food pharmaceutical and other specialty consumer and industrial products mcc processed from specialty grades of both hardwood pulp and softwood pulp provides binding and disintegrant properties for dry tablets and capsules and has unique functionality that improves the texture and stability of many food products carrageenan and alginates both processed from seaweed are used in a wide variety of food pharmaceutical nutraceutical and biopharmaceutical applications which provides alginate and carrageenanbased encapsulant technologies for pharmaceutical and nutraceutical uses in our novamatrix business we are developing technology platforms within biomedical markets which develop and provide ultrapure biopolymers and application knowhow for biomedical devices the following chart summarizes the markets for biopolymer’s products and our chemistries in each market 

 

 lithium 

lithium is a verticallyintegrated technology business based on both inorganic and organic lithium chemistries while lithium is sold into a variety of endmarkets we have focused our efforts on energy storage specialty polymers and pharmaceuticals 

the electrochemical properties of lithium make it an ideal material for portable energy storage in high performance applications including heart pacemakers cell phones camcorders personal computers and nextgeneration technologies that combine cellular and wireless capabilities into a single device lithium is also being developed as the enabling element in advanced batteries for use in hybrid electric plugin hybrids and allelectric vehicles 

organolithium products are sold to fine chemical and pharmaceutical customers who use lithium’s unique chemical properties to synthesize high valueadded products organolithiums are also highly valued in the specialty polymer markets as initiators in the production of synthetic rubbers and elastomers 

  

the following chart summarizes the major markets for various lithium products 

 

 industry overview 

food ingredients 

our biopolymer business serves the texture structure and physical stability tsps food ingredients market tsps ingredients impart physical properties to thicken and stabilize foods there are many types of tsps ingredients and a wide range of food groups served including bakery meats dairy and convenience products the industry is dispersed geographically with the majority of our sales in europe north america and asia 

trends driving market growth include increasing consumer interest in healthier foods greater convenience and growth in per capita consumption of processed foods in emerging markets the trend toward health and convenience drives the need for more functional ingredients to impart desired food tastes and textures we believe carrageenan and mcc which address this need are growing faster than the overall tsps market the global customer base for tsps is relatively fragmented and includes large and small food processors consolidation among these customers has been a significant trend over the past several years as a result tsps ingredient suppliers such as us have focused on establishing alliances with market leaders with the goal of reducing costs leveraging technology and expanding product offerings with key accounts 

within the entire food ingredients market there are a relatively large number of suppliers due principally to the broad spectrum of chemistries employed segment leadership global position and investment in technology are key factors to sustaining profitability in addition larger suppliers may often provide a broader product line and a range of services to food companies including functional systems or blends the top suppliers of tsps ingredients include fmc danisco as dupont jm huber corporation kerry group plc cargill incorporated dgf stoess ag and tate  lyle plc 

  

pharmaceutical ingredients 

our biopolymer business sells formulation ingredients to the pharmaceutical industry our raw materials function as binders disintegrants suspending agents and control release compounds in the production of both solid and liquid pharmaceutical products 

competitors tend to be grouped by chemistry our principal mcc competitors in pharmaceuticals include j rettenmaier  sôhne gmbh ming tai chemical co ltd asahi kasei corporation and blanver farmoquimica ltda while pricing pressure from low cost producers is a common competitive dynamic companies like us offset that pressure by providing the most reliable and broadest range of products and services our customers are pharmaceutical firms who depend upon reliable therapeutic performance of their drug products 

we also supply alginates mcc and carrageenan into oral care cosmetics and health care markets highly refined extracts from selected seaweeds provide a broad range of alginate functionality including uses in antireflux disorders dental impressions control release of drugs and wound dressings special grades of carrageenan extracts are used in liquid cough medicines toothpaste and a variety of skin care products

there are only three key producers of lithium fmc rockwood holdings inc and sociedad química y minera de chile sa all of which produce lithium carbonate fmc has a stronger presence in downstream lithium specialties where rockwood is the primary competitor 

industrial chemicals 

financial information in millions 

 

   

overview 

our industrial chemicals segment which represents 36 percent of our 2009 consolidated revenues has lowcost positions in high volume inorganic chemicals including soda ash and hydrogen peroxide complemented by high value niche positions in specialty alkali phosphorus and peroxygen products 

products and markets 

 

 industrial chemicals serves a diverse group of markets from economicallysensitive industrial sectors to technologyintensive specialty markets we process and sell refined inorganic products that are sought by customers for their critical reactivity or specific functionality in markets such as glass detergents and pulp and paper in addition we produce purify and market higher value downstream derivatives into specialized and customerspecific applications these applications include electronics biocides and animal nutrition 

alkali 

our alkali chemical division produces natural soda ash soda ash is used by manufacturers in glass chemical processing and detergent industries to lesser degrees we also produce sodium bicarbonate caustic soda and sodium sesquicarbonate the majority of our alkali sales are manufactured by and sold through fmc wyoming corporation which we manage as an integral part of our alkali business and in which we own shares representing an 875 percent economic interest with the remaining shares held by two japanese companies 

we mine and produce natural soda ash using proprietary lowcost mining technologies such as longwall and solution mining which we believe give us the lowest cost position our two production sites in green river wyoming have the name plate capacity to produce approximately 485 million tons of soda ash annually with approximately 13 million tons of this capacity currently mothballed at december 31 2009 for the past several years the us soda ash industry was essentially sold out as a result of this condition during 2005 and 2006 we restarted 500000 tons of previously mothballed capacity to meet the increase in demand driven by the growth in export markets in february 2008 we announced the recommissioning of the remaining mothballed capacity in green river wyoming approximately 100000 tons of this capacity was commissioned prior to the end of 2008 we expected the remaining capacity approximately 700000 tons per year to be fully online by 20122013 depending on export demand growth however with the economic downturn in 2009 resulting in a drop in soda ash demand we again mothballed the granger facility and consolidated all of our soda ash production at the westvaco facility we will restart the granger operation as soda ash export market conditions warrant its restart 

peroxygens 

we produce hydrogen peroxide at production facilities in the united states and canada and as described below through our whollyowned foret subsidiary in spain and the netherlands we also participate in a joint 

  

venture company in thailand we sell hydrogen peroxide into the pulp and paper industry and increasingly to the chemical processing environmental electronics and food industries we are a leading north american producer of hydrogen peroxide due in part to our broad product line geographicallyadvantaged plant locations stateoftheart processing technology and superior customer service hydrogen peroxide represents approximately 65 percent of our peroxygens sales 

our specialty peroxygens business supplies persulfate products primarily to polymer printed circuit board hair care and soil remediation markets peracetic acid is predominantly supplied to the food industry for biocidal applications typically we compete as a specialty player where we believe that we are differentiated by our strong technical expertise unique process technology intellectual property and geographic location 

foret 

our european subsidiary fmc foret sa “foret” headquartered near barcelona spain is a leading provider of chemical products to the detergent paper textile mining and chemical industries foret operates six manufacturing facilities across europe with market positions in phosphates hydrogen peroxide percarbonates zeolites and silicates foret’s sales efforts are focused in europe africa and the middle east and in south america mainly via tripoliven our venezuelan jointventure in which foret holds a minority participation 

industry overview 

we primarily participate in three product areas soda ash peroxygens and phosphorus chemicals these products are generally inorganic and are generally commodities that in many cases have few costeffective substitutes growth is typically a function of industrial production in developed economies and a function of the rate of industrialization in developing economies in the export markets pricing tends to reflect the supply and demand balance as producers add or reduce capacity in response to demand changes 

soda ash 

soda ash is a highly alkaline inorganic chemical essential in the production of glass and widely used in the production of chemicals soaps and detergents and many other products natural soda ash is typically produced from trona a natural form of sodium sesquicarbonate through mining and chemical processing soda ash may also be produced synthetically but this process requires a significant amount of energy and produces large quantities of waste byproducts making it much less costeffective than natural soda ash production 

because of the processing cost advantages of trona and the large natural reserves of trona in the us particularly in green river wyoming all us soda ash is naturally produced by contrast due to a lack of trona the majority of the soda ash that is manufactured in the rest of the world is produced synthetically other us producers are oci chemical corporation solvay sa the general chemical group inc in which a majority stake is owned by tata chemicals limited and nirma limited 

approximately 50 percent of us soda ash production served export markets in 2009 with approximately 24 percent of us soda ash production exported through the american natural soda ash corporation “ansac” ansac is the foreign sales association of wyoming us soda ash producers established in 1983 under the webbpomerene act and subsequent legislation since its creation ansac has been successful in coordinating soda ash exports taking advantage of the inherent cost benefits of us produced natural soda ash and leveraging its large scale of operations to the benefit of its member companies consequently us exports of soda ash have increased over threefold in the last 25 years 

peroxygens 

hydrogen peroxide is typically sold for use as a bleach or oxidizer as such it often competes with other chemicals capable of performing similar functions some of our specialty peroxygen derivatives eg persulfates 

  

and percarbonates also function as bleaching or oxidizing agents environmental regulations regional cost differences primarily due to transportation costs and technical differences in product performance factor into the decision to use hydrogen peroxide or one of its derivatives rather than another product since these considerations vary by region the consumption patterns vary in different parts of the world hydrogen peroxide is sold in aqueous solutions usually 70 percent 50 percent or 35 percent by weight 

the north american pulp and paper industry represents approximately 65 percent of north american demand for hydrogen peroxide in this market hydrogen peroxide is used as an environmentally friendly bleaching agent to brighten chemical mechanical and recycled pulps as well as treat a wide range of mill pollutants in the waste stream the north american paper market is mature and new investment in pulp and paper capacity is largely focused in asia and south america the other north american hydrogen peroxide producers are eka a wholly owned subsidiary of akzo nobel nv arkema inc evonik industries ag kemira ovj and solvay sa 

phosphorous chemicals 

we participate in this business in europe the middle east africa and south america through foret major competitors include societe chimique alkimia sa thermphos international bv prayon rupel sa and various chinese producers phosphorous chemicals are used in many industrial applications in a wide array of chemical compounds 

overall growth in demand for phosphorous chemicals tends to correlate with gross domestic product “gdp” purified phosphoric acid ppa and phosphate salts eg sodium phosphates and calcium phosphates are sold into many markets including detergents cleaning compounds and animal feed 

the basic input material for making phosphates is now produced using two processes most industrial applications use the costeffective process that involves making ppa by the purification of fertilizergrade phosphoric acid thermal phosphoric acid long the industry standard is produced from elemental phosphorus but is more costly due to energy and environmental compliance costs and is now used in limited applications elemental phosphorus is still produced by thermphos in the netherlands and in several other countries including china 

over the next few years demand growth for phosphorous chemicals is generally expected to grow with gdp with relatively higher growth in newly industrializing regions 

source and availability of raw materials 

our raw material requirements vary by business segment and include mineralrelated natural resources trona ore and lithium brines processed chemicals seaweed specialty wood pulps and energy sources such as gas coal oil and electricity raw materials represented approximately 29 percent of our 2009 costs of sales and services and no one raw material represented more than nine percent of our total raw material purchases 

ores used in industrial chemicals’ manufacturing processes are extracted by us from mines eg trona in north america or are purchased from others eg phosphorous rock raw materials used by specialty chemicals include lithium brines various types of seaweed that are sourced on a global basis and specialty pulps which are purchased from selected global producers raw materials used by agricultural products primarily processed chemicals are obtained from a variety of suppliers worldwide 

  

patents 

we own a number of us and foreign patents trademarks and licenses that are cumulatively important to our business we do not believe that the loss of any one or group of related patents trademarks or licenses would have a material adverse effect on the overall business of fmc the duration of our patents depends on their respective jurisdictions their expiration dates range through 2029 

seasonality 

the seasonal nature of the crop protection market and the geographic spread of the agricultural products business can result in significant variations in quarterly earnings agricultural products sold into the northern hemisphere north america europe and parts of asia serve seasonal agricultural markets from march through september generally resulting in earnings in the first second and third quarters markets in the southern hemisphere latin america and parts of the asia pacific region including australia are served from july through february generally resulting in earnings in the third fourth and first quarters the remainder of our businesses are generally not subject to significant seasonal fluctuations 

competition 

we have a number one or number two market position in many of our product lines based on revenue either globally or in north america largely as a result of our product offerings proprietary technologies and our position as a lowcost producer the following product lines accounted for the majority of our 2009 consolidated revenue market positions are based on the most recently available revenue data 

 

 we encounter substantial competition in each of our three business segments this competition is expected to continue in both the united states and markets outside of the united states we market our products through our own sales organization and through alliance partners independent distributors and sales representatives the number of our principal competitors varies from segment to segment in general we compete by operating in a costefficient manner and by leveraging our industry experience to provide advanced technology high product quality and reliability and quality customer and technical service 

our agricultural products segment competes primarily in the global chemical crop protection market for insecticides herbicides and fungicides the industry is characterized by a relatively small number of large competitors and a large number of smaller often regional competitors industry products include crop protection chemicals and for certain major competitors genetically engineered crop biotechnology products competition from generic agrochemical producers has increased as a significant number of product patents held industrywide have expired in the last decade in general we compete as an innovator by focusing on product development including novel formulations proprietary mixes and advanced delivery systems and by acquiring or licensing mostly proprietary chemistries or technologies that complement our product and geographic focus we also differentiate ourselves by our global costcompetitiveness via our manufacturing strategies establishing effective product stewardship programs and developing strategic alliances that strengthen market access in key countries and regions 

with significant positions in markets that include alginate carrageenan microcrystalline cellulose and lithiumbased products our specialty chemicals segment competes on the basis of product differentiation market applications expertise customer service and price biopolymer competes with both direct suppliers of 

  

cellulose and seaweed extract as well as suppliers of other hydrocolloids which may provide similar functionality in specific applications in microcrystalline cellulose competitors are typically smaller than us while in seaweed extracts carrageenan and alginates we compete with other broadbased chemical companies we and each of our two most significant competitors in lithium extract the element from naturally occurring lithiumrich brines located in the andes mountains of argentina and chile which are believed to be the world’s most significant and lowest cost sources of lithium 

our industrial chemicals segment serves the soda ash markets worldwide the peroxygens markets predominantly in north america and europe and the phosphorus markets in europe the middle east and latin america in north america our soda ash business competes with four domestic producers of natural soda ash three of which operate in the vicinity of our mine and processing facilities near green river wyoming outside of the us canada europe and south africa we sell soda ash mainly through ansac internationally our natural soda ash competes with synthetic soda ash manufactured by numerous producers ranging from integrated multinational companies to smaller regional companies we maintain a leading position in the north american market for hydrogen peroxide especially in specialty segments there are currently five other firms competing in the hydrogen peroxide market in north america but most of them focus primarily on the commodity pulp and paper segment the primary competitive factor affecting the sales of soda ash and hydrogen peroxide to commodity markets is price we seek to maintain our competitive position by employing low cost processing technology at foret we possess strong cost and market positions in phosphates percarbonate peroxygens zeolites and silicates in each of these markets we face significant competition from a range of multinational and regional chemical producers competition in phosphorus chemicals is based primarily on price and to a lesser degree product differentiation 

research and development expense 

we perform research and development in all of our segments with the majority of our efforts focused in the agricultural products segment the development efforts in the agricultural products segment focus on developing environmentally sound solutions and new product formulations that costeffectively increase farmers’ yields and provide alternatives to existing and new chemistries our research and development expenses in the last three years are set forth below

 item 3 legal proceedings tableend like hundreds of other industrial companies we have been named as one of many defendants in asbestosrelated personal injury litigation most of these cases allege personal injury or death resulting from exposure to asbestos in premises of fmc or to asbestoscontaining components installed in machinery or equipment manufactured or sold by discontinued operations the machinery and equipment businesses we owned or operated did not fabricate the asbestoscontaining component parts at issue in the litigation and to this day neither the us occupational safety and health administration nor the environmental protection agency has banned the use of these components further the asbestoscontaining parts for this machinery and equipment were accessible only at the time of infrequent repair and maintenance recently a few jurisdictions have permitted claims to proceed against equipment manufacturers relating to insulation installed by other companies on such machinery and equipment we believe that overall the claims against fmc are without merit indeed the bulk of the claims against us to date have been dismissed without payment 

as of december 31 2009 there were approximately 22000 premises and product asbestos claims pending against fmc in several jurisdictions to date we have had discharged approximately 85000 asbestos claims against fmc the overwhelming majority of which have been dismissed without any payment to the plaintiff settlements by us with claimants to date have totaled approximately 31 million 

we intend to continue managing these cases in accordance with our historical experience we have established a reserve for this litigation and believe that the outcome of these cases will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or liquidity 

in late june 2004 we were served in a lawsuit captioned “lewis et al v fmc corporation” which was filed in united states district court for the western district of new york the suit was brought by thirteen residents of middleport new york who allege that we violated certain state and federal environmental laws and seeks injunctive relief and monetary damages for personal injuries and property damage in connection with such alleged violations we believe this suit is without merit 

we have certain other contingent liabilities arising from litigation claims performance guarantees and other commitments incident to the ordinary course of business based on information currently available and established reserves the ultimate resolution of our known contingencies including the matters described in note 18 to the consolidated financial statements in this form 10k is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or liquidity however there can be no assurance that the outcome of these contingencies will be favorable and adverse results in certain of these contingencies could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or liquidity

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend overview 

we are a diversified global chemical company providing innovative solutions applications and market leading products to a wide variety of markets we operate in three distinct business segments agricultural products specialty chemicals and industrial chemicals our agricultural products segment develops markets and sells all three major classes of crop protection chemicals—insecticides herbicides and fungicides—with particular strength in insecticides and herbicides these products are used in agriculture to enhance crop yield and quality by controlling a broad spectrum of insects weeds and disease as well as pest control in nonagricultural markets specialty chemicals consists of our biopolymer and lithium businesses and focuses on food ingredients that are used to enhance texture structure and physical stability pharmaceutical additives for binding encapsulation and disintegrant applications ultrapure biopolymers for medical devices and lithium specialties for pharmaceutical synthesis specialty polymers and energy storage our industrial chemicals segment manufactures a wide range of inorganic materials including soda ash hydrogen peroxide specialty peroxygens and phosphorus chemicals 

2009 highlights 

our businesses this year have each been affected by the downturn in the global economy but to varying degrees revenues in the aggregate are down nine percent versus 2008 our industrial chemicals segment has been the most impacted with revenues down 21 percent as a result of lower volume due to weak global demand particularly in end markets for flat glass detergents and pulp and paper our specialty chemicals segment had mixed results with lithium volumes down on weak end markets in industrial and electronics biopolymer continued to grow revenue based on good commercial performance and the alginates acquisition made in the third quarter of 2008 our agricultural products segment also had mixed results as lower revenues in europe and asia were mostly offset by growth in the americas 

despite the lower revenues we did have higher operating profits compared to the prior year in both our agricultural products and specialty chemicals segments of 18 percent and five percent respectively however the decrease in revenues due to volume declines across our industrial chemicals businesses led to a decrease in operating profits in this segment of 55 percent from prior year see “segment results” section starting on page 30 for further discussion on the results of our operating segments 

in response to these weaker market conditions we made a number of decisions this year to realign some of our operating assets during the first quarter we made the decision to shut down the peroxygens manufacturing facility in santa clara mexico and the lithium facility in bayport texas during the second quarter we decided to shut down foret’s operations in barcelona spain and in the third quarter we made the decision to curtail soda ash operations at our granger wyoming facility and to shut down our lithium metal production unit in bromborough uk as a result of these decisions we incurred significantly higher restructuring and other income charges in 2009 compared to 2008 

during the first half of 2009 we completed two acquisitions in our agricultural products business we acquired the cb professional products line of insect control products from waterbury companies inc and the proprietary fungicide benalaxyl from isagro spa both of these acquisitions fit our strategic goal of offering an expanding product portfolio in focused markets additionally we announced plans at the beginning of this year to realign our biopolymer alginates manufacturing operations in norway and the united kingdom as the company continues the integration of the international specialty products isp alginates business acquired in august 2008 

2010 outlook 

in 2010 despite what is expected to be a tempered recovery of the downturn in global economic conditions experienced in 2009 we expect a year of solid performance we expect to have an increase to our revenues 

  

driven by higher volumes in most regions particularly brazil in our agricultural products segment volume growth and higher selling prices in biopolymer in our specialty chemicals segment and flat revenue in our industrial chemicals segment driven by stronger volumes but offset by reduced selling prices 

we expect an increase in earnings driven by higher sales in our agricultural products segment volume driven growth and productivity improvements in our specialty chemicals segment and volume growth and favorable raw material and energy costs in our industrial chemicals segment our earnings growth is expected to be offset by less favorable product and geographic mix and increased spending on growth initiatives in our agricultural products segment reduced selling prices in our industrial chemicals segment and higher pension expenses we expect cash flow from our business segments to remain strong 

results of operations—2009 2008 and 2007 

overview 

the following presents a reconciliation of our segment operating profit to net income attributable to fmc stockholders as seen through the eyes of our management for management purposes we report the operating performance of each of our business segments based on earnings before interest and income taxes excluding corporate expenses other income expense net and corporate special incomecharges 

 

  

   

the below chart which is provided to assist the readers of our financial statements depicts certain aftertax charges gains these items are excluded by us in the measures we use to evaluate business performance and determine certain performancebased compensation these aftertax items are discussed in detail within the “other results of operations” section that follows additionally the below chart discloses our nongaap financial measure “aftertax income from continuing operations excluding restructuring and other income and charges” reconciled from the gaap financial measure “net income attributable to fmc stockholders” we believe that this measure provides useful information about our operating results to investors and securities analysts we also believe that excluding the effect of restructuring and other income and charges from operating results allows management and investors to compare more easily the financial performance of our underlying businesses from period to period this measure should not be considered as a substitute for net income loss or other measures of performance or liquidity reported in accordance with gaap 

 

 year ended december 31 2009 compared to december 31 2008 

in the following discussion “year” refers to the year ended december 31 2009 and “prior year” refers to the year ended december 31 2008 additionally in the discussion below please refer to our chart on page 29 under “overview” all comparisons are between the periods unless otherwise noted 

segment results 

for management purposes segment operating profit is defined as segment revenue less operating expenses segment operating expenses consist of costs of sales and services selling general and administrative expenses and research and development expenses we have excluded the following items from segment operating profit corporate staff expense interest income and expense associated with corporate debt facilities and investments income taxes gains or losses on divestitures of businesses restructuring and other charges income investment gains and losses loss on extinguishment of debt asset impairments lifo inventory adjustments amortization of inventory stepup from business acquisitions and other related inventory adjustments and other income and expense items 

information about how each of these items relates to our businesses at the segment level and results by segment are discussed below and in note 19 to our consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k 

agricultural products 

 

   

revenue of 10516 million was one percent lower than the prior year period as sales gains in north america latin america which is primarily brazil and noncrop markets and generally higher pricing across the entire business were more than fully offset by lower sales in europe and asia which also included unfavorable currency impacts in these two regions north american revenues increased three percent on new product introductions price increases and sales from the cb professional products line acquisition revenues in europe declined 11 percent due to weaker markets and unfavorable currency impacts in latin america revenues increased two percent primarily due to improved second half market conditions in brazil partially offset by unfavorable currency impacts in asia revenues declined two percent due mainly to unfavorable weather conditions weak pest pressures and unfavorable currency impacts 

segment operating profit of 2890 million was 18 percent higher than the prior year driven by growth from new products particularly in north america and brazil better second half market conditions in brazil higher selling prices in most regions continued global supply chain productivity improvements the benefit of indirect tax recoveries in brazil lower raw material costs and lower selling and administrative expenses 

in 2010 we expect fullyear revenue growth in the midsingle digits reflecting increased volumes in most regions particularly in brazil due to projected improving market conditions and growth in new and recently introduced products fullyear segment operating profit growth is expected in the mid to high single digits as a result of higher projected sales in most regions partially offset by less favorable product and geographic mix and increased spending on growth initiatives 

certain regulatory issues 

in our agricultural products segment several products are undergoing reregistration in the us andor a comparable regulatory review by the european union “eu” governmental authorities in august 2006 the us environmental protection agency issued its “interim reregistration eligibility decision” “ired” for our carbofuran insecticide the ired proposes cancellation of all carbofuran uses in the united states subject to a phase out period for certain minor crop uses while maintaining tolerances for imported commodities bananas coffee rice and sugarcane the epa reiterated its proposal in january 2008 with the issuance of a draft notice of intent to cancel in february 2008 the epa convened a scientific advisory panel meeting to evaluate scientific issues relevant to the draft notice of intent to cancel carbofuran separately the us department of agriculture issued its comments on the draft cancellation notice stating that carbofuran should continue to be registered on july 24 2008 the epa published a proposal to revoke all carbofuran tolerances under the federal food drug and cosmetic act in advance of any issuance of a final notice of intent to cancel under the federal pesticide law we responded to that notice expressing our strong disagreement with the epa’s proposal to revoke tolerances and our belief that carbofuran residues on food do not pose a threat to human health in may 2009 the epa published its final revocation of all carbofuran tolerances effective december 31 2009 we filed our objections to this revocation and requested a hearing before an administrative law judge on october 30 2009 epa issued its decision to deny our objections and request for a hearing we believe that we are entitled to a hearing and we have challenged this decision by seeking judicial review in the us federal courts the court of appeals granted expedited review of our case and will hear arguments in spring 2010 in light of the december 31 2009 tolerance revocation fmc has now ceased sales of carbofuran in the united states fmc’s sales of carbofuran in the united states are not significant the outcome of any litigation to compel a hearing is uncertain we do not know the epa’s timing on a final notice of intent to cancel the carbofuran registration though the epa has said it intends to issue such notice after the tolerance revocation decision 

in june 2007 the european commission published its decisions not to include carbofuran and carbosulfan on the official list of active ingredients approved for continued sale in the eu the published decisions required eu member states to deregister the products within six months and so fmc ceased its sales of these products in december 2007 we disagreed with the commission’s decisions and underlying assessment we have resubmitted carbosulfan for approval on the official list the outcome of our regulatory resubmission is 

  

uncertain we have decided not to continue pursuing a carbofuran resubmission due to various considerations including our plans to substitute the most significant eu carbofuran uses with other fmc products andor applications 

also in the eu in march 2009 the commission proposed not to include our pyrethroid insecticide bifenthrin on the official list but the standing committee rejected that proposal the regulatory decision was referred to the eu council of ministers in july 2009 the process concluded whereby the commission’s noninclusion proposal will now be implemented the noninclusion decision was adopted on november 30 2009 fmc has an additional six months to sell bifenthrin ie through endmay 2010 and subsequently in most countries there will be up to 612 months for further sale and use accordingly we do not anticipate a material sales impact in 2010 we have resubmitted for reconsideration and will seek to minimize any interruption in sales 

we intend to defend vigorously all our products in the us eu and other countries’ regulatory processes where fmc’s pesticide products will be reviewed in the ordinary course of regulatory programs during 2010 as part of the ongoing cycle of reregistration in countries around the world recently the brazilian health agency has informed us that they intend to review carbofuran along with 13 other major pesticides but has yet to issue any required formal announcement that identifies their specific concerns or preliminary position on reregistration fmc is cooperating and defending our product in this process under the brazilian regulatory process any recommendation would need public notice and comment as well as concurrence from the brazilian environmental and agricultural ministries before any regulatory change is effective thus we do not expect a potential sales impact in 2010 

specialty chemicals 

 

 specialty chemicals revenue of 7531 million decreased one percent versus the prior year period the decrease was driven primarily by lower volumes across the lithium business mostly offset by higher selling prices and a full year of revenue related to the acquisitions in the midthird quarter of 2008 in biopolymer 

biopolymer revenues increased to 5792 million which is eight percent higher than prior year this change was due to the benefit of a full year of revenue related to the acquisitions in the midthird quarter of 2008 which increased revenue by ten percent improved pricing and mix increased revenue by an additional five percent these benefits were partially offset by volume declines of approximately three percent and the impact of a weaker euro 

lithium revenues of 1739 million declined 24 percent from the prior year primarily due to weak demand across the business 

segment operating profit of 1596 million was five percent higher than the prior year as favorable commercial performance in biopolymer the benefits of acquisitions in biopolymer productivity initiatives and a recovery of export taxes in argentina were partially offset by lower lithium volumes temporary plant curtailments to reduce inventories and unfavorable currency translation 

in 2010 we expect fullyear revenue to increase approximately 10 percent driven by volume growth across biopolymer markets and lithium primaries augmented by higher biopolymer selling prices fullyear segment operating profit is expected to be up in the midteens reflecting volumedriven sales growth and productivity improvements 

  

industrial chemicals 

 

 industrial chemicals revenue of 10267 million decreased 21 percent versus the prior year period due primarily to volume declines across the segment these volume declines reduced segment revenues by approximately 15 percent while pricing remained flat despite a significant yearoveryear reduction in pricing for phosphates the remaining decline of approximately six percent was driven primarily by unfavorable currency impacts and reduced freight billings in line with the volume declines noted above soda ash revenues were down on lower volumes with pricing improvements partially offsetting these unfavorable impacts foret revenues were down on lower volumes and pricing particularly for phosphates and an unfavorable euro finally north american peroxygens revenue decreased primarily due to volume declines partially offset by pricing improvements 

segment operating profit of 897 million was 55 percent lower than the prior period driven by lower volumes across the segment 

for 2010 we expect fullyear revenue to be level compared to 2009 as stronger volumes in every business are offset by reduced selling prices fullyear segment operating profit is expected to be up 515 percent to prior year as volume growth and favorable raw material and energy costs are partially offset by lower selling prices 

other results of operations 

corporate expenses 

we recorded charges of 441 million in 2009 compared to 498 million in 2008 the decrease was primarily due to reduced incentive compensation expense and reductions in discretionary spending compared to the prior year corporate expenses are included as a component of the line item “selling general and administrative expenses” on our consolidated statements of income 

other income expense net 

other income expense net is comprised primarily of lifo inventory adjustments and pension expense other expense was 275 million in 2009 compared to 86 million in 2008 the increase was due primarily to higher charges related to our lifo inventory reserves higher pension expense and an increase to the mark to market impact of our deferred compensation liability other income expense net is included as a component of the line item “costs of sales and services” on our consolidated statements of income 

interest expense net 

the 2009 net interest expense decreased to 270 million compared to 319 million in 2008 primarily due to lower interest rates on the borrowings under our credit agreements as compared to the prior period 

  

corporate special income charges 

restructuring and other charges income were 1328 million in 2009 compared to 496 million in 2008 please see the table and further discussion regarding our restructuring and other charges income in note 7 to our consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k charges in this category for the year ended december 31 2009 include the following

purchase accounting inventory fair value impact and other related inventory adjustments for the year ended december 31 2009 totaled 71 million in purchase accounting inventory is stepped up from its cost value to estimated selling prices less costs to sell this   line item represented charges related to amortization of the 

  

inventory fair value stepup associated with the third quarter 2008 acquisition in our specialty chemicals segment and the first quarter 2009 acquisition in our agricultural products segment additionally the amount in 2009 includes inventory adjustments related to the third quarter 2008 acquisition in our specialty chemicals segment and subsequent alginates business restructuring for the year ended december 31 2008 the charges of 23 million represented the amortization of the inventory fair value stepup resulting from the application of purchase accounting associated with the third quarter 2008 acquisition in our specialty chemicals segment on the consolidated statements of income these charges are included in “costs of sales and services” 

provision for income taxes 

we recorded a provision of 530 million in 2009 compared with a provision of 1254 million in 2008 resulting in effective tax rates of 171 percent and 266 percent respectively the change in the effective tax rate was a result of a change in the mix of domestic income compared to income earned outside of the us and favorable tax adjustments partially offset by a charge in 2009 related to the resolution of a regulatory matter in our industrial chemicals segment that is nondeductible for tax purposes income we earn domestically is typically taxed at rates higher than income earned outside the us the effective tax rates were also impacted by tax adjustments recorded during 2009 and 2008 these tax adjustments are described below 

2009 tax adjustments were favorable in the amount of 437 million and are primarily a result of a reduction in our liability for unrecognized tax benefits due to favorable settlements of tax audits and the expiration of statutes of limitations as well as the reversal of certain tax valuation allowances these valuation allowances were no longer necessary because of our expectation that the related deferred tax assets were likely to be realized 

2008 tax adjustments were favorable in the amount of 87 million and primarily result from a benefit to adjust our reserve for unrecognized tax benefits due to favorable settlements of tax audits partially offsetting this benefit are charges associated with adjustments for prior years’ tax matters 

discontinued operations net of income tax 

our discontinued operations represent adjustments to retained liabilities primarily related to operations discontinued between 1976 and 2001 the primary liabilities retained include environmental liabilities other postretirement benefit liabilities selfinsurance and longterm obligations related to legal proceedings 

discontinued operations net of income tax totaled a loss of 182 million in 2009 versus a loss of 249 million in 2008 the 2009 loss is primarily related to environmental charges associated with our front royal and middleport sites and operating and maintenance activities partially offset by recoveries related to our front royal site the 2009 loss also includes charges for legal reserves and expenses related to discontinued operations the 2008 loss is primarily related to environmental charges associated with our front royal and middleport sites and charges for legal reserves and expenses related to discontinued operations discontinued environmental charges include environmental remediation costs at sites of discontinued businesses for which we are responsible for environmental compliance 

net income attributable to fmc stockholders 

net income attributable to fmc stockholders decreased to 2285 million in 2009 compared with 3046 million in 2008 the decrease was primarily due to lower industrial chemicals segment operating profit and significantly higher restructuring and other charges income partially offsetting these decreases were higher profits in our agricultural products segment and to a lesser extent our specialty chemicals segment

segment results 

agricultural products 

 

 revenue of 10587 million increased 19 percent versus the prior year period north america revenues grew by nine percent europe middle east and africa by 33 percent asia by 12 percent and latin america by 22 percent revenue benefited from favorable global agrochemical market conditions increased planted acres in key crops new product introductions and selective price increases to offset higher input costs 

segment operating profit of 2452 million was 18 percent higher than the prior year the earnings from the higher revenue coupled with supply chain productivity improvements from the shutdown of the baltimore manufacturing facility were partially offset by higher raw materials costs to a lesser extent higher selling costs to support the higher revenues also impacted operating profit in 2008 

specialty chemicals 

 

 revenue of 7645 million increased 16 percent versus the prior year period of which four percent was the result of revenue from the two acquisitions that closed in the third quarter of 2008 excluding the effects of these acquisitions biopolymer revenues increased 14 percent on volume growth particularly in food and personal care and price increases to partially offset rising input costs lithium revenues increased eight percent versus the prior period where volumes particularly in primary compounds and specialty organics have increased 

segment operating profit of 1520 million was seven percent higher than the prior year price increases were offset by rising raw material and energy costs particularly for seaweed and wood pulp during the period of 413 million to a lesser extent the introduction of export taxes in argentina in 2008 also reduced operating profits 

industrial chemicals 

 

 revenue of 12969 million increased 19 percent versus the prior year period alkali revenues increased 16 percent periodoverperiod primarily due to higher pricing soda ash volumes were up marginally peroxygen revenues periodoverperiod were higher by six percent with higher pricing being partially offset by volume declines in the fourth quarter due to the economic downturn foret revenues periodoverperiod were higher by

we recorded a provision of 1254 million in 2008 compared with a provision of 290 million in 2007 resulting in effective tax rates of 266 percent and 148 percent respectively the change in the effective tax rate is primarily a result of a change in the mix of domestic income compared to income earned outside the us the mix of domestic income was impacted by significantly lower baltimore restructuring charges incurred during 2008 compared to 2007 the effective tax rates were also impacted by tax adjustments recorded during 2008 and 2007 these tax adjustments are described below 

2008 tax adjustments were favorable in the amount of 87 million and primarily result from a benefit to adjust our reserve for unrecognized tax benefits due to favorable settlements of tax audits partially offsetting this benefit are charges associated with adjustments for prior years’ tax matters 

2007 tax adjustments were favorable in the amount of 154 million and primarily include tax benefits related to the reversal of certain tax valuation allowances these valuation allowances were no longer necessary because of our expectation that the related deferred tax assets were likely to be realized partially offsetting these valuation adjustments were charges associated with adjustments for prior years’ tax matters 

discontinued operations net of income tax 

discontinued operations net of income tax totaled a loss of 249 million in 2008 versus a loss of 243 million in 2007 the 2008 loss is primarily related to environmental charges associated with our front royal and middleport sites and charges for legal reserves and expenses related to discontinued operations the 2007 loss is primarily related to environmental charges associated with our middleport front royal and modesto sites and charges for legal reserves and expenses related to discontinued operations 

net income attributable to fmc stockholders 

net income attributable to fmc stockholders increased to 3046 million in 2008 compared with 1324 million in 2007 primarily due to higher profits in all three of our segments and significantly reduced restructuring and other charges income 

liquidity and capital resources 

cash and cash equivalents at december 31 2009 and 2008 were 766 million and 524 million respectively we had total debt of 6439 million and 6236 million at december 31 2009 and 2008 respectively this included 5880 million and 5929 million of longterm debt excluding current portions of 225 million and 21 million at december 31 2009 and 2008 respectively the 155 million increase in total longterm debt at december 31 2009 from december 31 2008 was primarily due to the proceeds from the 2009 senior notes offering partially offset by the full pay down of existing indebtedness under our revolving credit agreements shortterm debt which consists of foreign borrowings increased to 334 million at december 31 2009 compared to 286 million at december 31 2008 

2009 senior notes offering 

on november 30 2009 we issued 300 million aggregate principal amount of 520 senior notes due 2019 the net proceeds from the offering were used to pay down existing indebtedness under our revolving credit agreements and for general corporate purposes 

domestic credit agreement 

on august 28 2007 we executed a credit agreement the “domestic credit agreement” which provided for a fiveyear 600 million revolving credit facility the proceeds from this facility are available for general 

  

corporate purposes including issuing letters of credit up to a 300 million sublimit the domestic credit agreement also contains an option under which subject to certain conditions we may request an increase in the facility to 1 billion 

loans under the facility bear interest at a floating rate either a base rate as defined or the applicable euro currency rate for the relevant term plus an applicable margin the margin is 027 percent per year subject to adjustment based on the credit rating assigned to our senior unsecured debt at december 31 2009 the applicable borrowing rates under our domestic credit agreement ranged from 05 to 33 percent per annum 

we had no borrowings under our domestic credit agreement at december 31 2009 compared to 2030 million in borrowings at december 31 2008 letters of credit outstanding under the domestic credit agreement totaled 1532 million and 1515 million at december 31 2009 and 2008 respectively available funds under the domestic credit agreement were 4468 million at december 31 2009 and 2455 million at december 31 2008 

european credit agreement 

on december 16 2005 our dutch finance subsidiary executed a credit agreement the “european credit agreement” which provides for an unsecured revolving credit facility in the amount of €220 million borrowings may be denominated in euros or us dollars fmc and our dutch finance subsidiary’s direct parent provide guarantees of amounts due under the european credit agreement 

loans under the european credit agreement bear interest at a euro currency base rate which for loans denominated in euros is the euro interbank offered rate and for loans denominated in dollars is london interbank offered rate “libor” in each case plus a margin the applicable margin under our european credit agreement is subject to adjustment based on the rating assigned to fmc by each of moody’s and sp at december 31 2009 the applicable margin was 030 percent and the applicable borrowing rates under the european credit agreement ranged from 08 to 56 percent per annum 

at december 31 2009 we had no borrowings compared to 1572 million in us dollar equivalent revolving credit facility borrowings at december 31 2008 under the european credit agreement resulting in available funds of 3154 million and 1502 million respectively 

among other restrictions the domestic credit agreement and the european credit agreement contain financial covenants applicable to fmc and its consolidated subsidiaries related to leverage measured as the ratio of debt to adjusted earnings and interest coverage measured as the ratio of adjusted earnings to interest expense our actual leverage for the four consecutive quarters ended december 31 2009 was 14 which is below the maximum leverage of 35 our actual interest coverage for the four consecutive quarters ended december 31 2009 was 190 which is above the minimum interest coverage of 35 we were in compliance with all covenants at december 31 2009 

statement of cash flows 

cash provided by operating activities for 2009 was 3435 million 

income from continuing operations of 2570 million included net charges of 1328 million of which 463 million was for noncash asset writedowns on exit of various facilities during the year and 352 million of other facilities exit costs to be settled in cash mainly for severance costs cash spending on restructuring and other charges during 2009 was 374 million also included in restructuring and other income and charges was 202 million for environmental remediation at our operating sites which will be spent in years beyond 2009 cash spending on environmental remediation at our operating sites in 2009 was 74 million against preexisting reserves 

  

receivables in 2009 were a use of cash of 593 million as lower receivables in industrial chemicals due to the revenue decline was more than offset by increased receivables in agricultural products in brazil where sales have grown and terms are significantly longer inventories were a source of cash of 202 million due to lower inventory costs in industrial chemicals particularly for phosphate rock accounts payable were a use of cash of 715 million as the higher cost phosphate rock in payables at the end of 2008 was replaced with lower cost phosphate rock at the end of 2009 

accrued pension and other post retirement benefits was a use of cash of 934 million which included a voluntary contribution to our us defined benefit plan of 75 million 

cash provided by operating activities for 2008 was 3574 million 

income from continuing operations of 3465 million included net charges of 496 million of which 375 million was for noncash asset writedowns on exit of various facilities during the year and 147 million of other facilities exit costs to be settled in cash mainly for severance costs cash spending on restructuring and other charges during 2008 was 213 million also included in restructuring and other income and charges was 162 million for environmental remediation at our operating sites which will be spent in years beyond 2008 cash spending on environmental remediation at our operating sites in 2009 was 136 million against preexisting reserves 

receivables in 2008 were a use of cash of 990 million due to the higher revenue in all of our businesses and particularly in agricultural products in brazil where terms are significantly longer than in rest of our businesses inventories were a use of cash of 916 million as inventories were built to support the stronger trading levels experienced in 2008 prior to the global economic turndown additionally inventories in industrial chemicals increased due to the rising cost of phosphate rock during 2008 accounts payable were a source of cash of 520 million reflecting the higher inventory levels and phosphate rock in our accounts payable at year end 2008 

accrued pension and other post retirement benefits were a use of cash of 468 million which included a voluntary contribution to our us defined benefit plan of 30 million 

cash provided by operating activities for 2007 was 3147 million 

income from continuing operations of 1663 million included net charges of 1649 million of which 1106 million was for noncash asset writedowns on exit of various facilities during the year and 144 million of other facilities exit costs to be settled in cash mainly for severance costs cash spending on restructuring and other charges during 2007 was 298 million also included in restructuring and other income and charges was 102 million for environmental remediation at our operating sites which will be spent in years beyond 2007 cash spending on environmental remediation at our operating sites in 2009 was 83 million against preexisting reserves 

receivables in 2007 were a use of cash of 486 million due to the higher revenue in all of our businesses and particularly in agricultural products in brazil where terms are significantly longer than in rest of our businesses inventories were a use of cash of 396 million as inventories were built to support the stronger trading levels experienced in 2007 accounts payable were a source of cash of 105 million reflecting the higher inventory levels at year end 2007 

accrued pension and other post retirement benefits were a use of cash of 421 million which included a voluntary contribution to our us defined benefit plan of 30 million 

  

cash required by operating activities of discontinued operations was 420 million 498 million and 451 million for 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively 

the change in 2009 compared to 2008 was due to decreased environmental spending for discontinued sites in 2009 the change in 2008 compared to 2007 was due to increased environmental spending for discontinued sites in 2008 discontinued environmental spending was 221 million in 2009 compared to 322 million in 2008 and 224 million in 2007 the remaining discontinued cash outflows primarily represents spending against reserves for legal proceedings associated with discontinued operations 

cash required by investing activities was 2007 million 1917 million and 1206 million for 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively 

the increase in cash required in 2009 was driven primarily by significant reduction of proceeds from the sale of the properties and assets during 2009 as compared to 2008 partially offset by reduced spending on acquisitions in 2009 additionally capital expenditures in 2009 were approximately 14 million less than the prior year period the increase in cash required in 2008 was driven primarily by our net acquisition spending of 906 million and an increase in our capital expenditure spending primarily in our industrial chemicals segment partially offset by proceeds from the sale of the princeton property of 594 million and the sale of sodium sulfate assets of 167 million 

cash required by financing activities was 778 million 1375 million and 2434 million in 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively 

the change in 2009 compared to 2008 was due primarily to the proceeds from our borrowings of longterm debt a reduction in repurchases of common stock and a reduction in repayments of longterm debt partially offset by higher repayments under our committed credit facilities the change in 2008 compared to 2007 was due primarily to increased borrowings under our committed credit facilities partially offset by higher repayments of longterm debt and repurchases of common stock 

other potential liquidity needs 

our cash needs for 2010 include operating cash requirements capital expenditures scheduled mandatory payments of longterm debt dividend payments contributions to our pension plans environmental spending and restructuring we plan to meet our liquidity needs through available cash cash generated from operations and borrowings under our committed revolving credit facilities we continually evaluate our options for divesting real estate holdings and property plant and equipment that are no longer integral to any of our core operating businesses 

projected 2010 capital expenditures are expected to be approximately 20 percent lower than 2009 levels 

projected 2010 spending includes approximately 35 million of net environmental remediation spending this spending does not include expected spending of approximately 9 million in 2010 on capital projects relating to environmental control facilities also we expect to spend approximately 26 million in 2010 for environmental compliance costs which we will include as a component of costs of sales and services in our consolidated statements of income since these amounts are not covered by established reserves capital spending to expand maintain or replace equipment at our production facilities may trigger requirements for upgrading our environmental controls which may increase our spending for environmental controls above the foregoing projections 

during 2008 the world equity markets were down significantly exemplified by the sp 500 index in the us being down 37 percent our us qualified defined benefit pension plan “us plan” assets fell from 

8294 million at december 31 2007 to 5639 million at december 31 2008 these same equity markets 

  

rebounded significantly in 2009 exemplified by the sp 500 index in the us being up 26 percent as a result our us plan assets increased to 7084 million at december 31 2009 our us plan assets comprise approximately 93 percent of our total plan assets with the difference representing plan assets related to foreign pension plans we have reduced our expected return on our us plan assets from 875 percent in 2008 to 85 percent in 2009 and will maintain the 85 percent assumption in 2010 in developing the assumption for the longterm rate of return on assets for our us plan we take into consideration the technical analysis performed by our outside actuaries including historical market returns information on the assumption for longterm real returns by asset class inflation assumptions and expectations for standard deviation related to these best estimates we also consider the historical performance of our own plan’s trust which has earned a compound annual rate of return of approximately 971 percent over the last 20 years which is in excess of comparable market indices for the same period as well as other factors given an actively managed investment portfolio the expected annual rates of return by asset class for our portfolio using geometric averaging and after being adjusted for an estimated inflation rate of approximately 250 percent is between 825 percent and 1025 percent for equities and between 475 percent and 60 percent for fixedincome investments which generates a total expected portfolio return that is in line with our assumptions for the rate of return on assets under the pension protection act of 2006 we are not required to make a minimum level of funding into the us plan during 2010 however in order to reduce future funding volatility we intend to contribute 80 million in 2010 versus 75 million contributed in 2009 and 30 million contributed in 2008 we do not believe that the additional contribution will have a significant negative impact on our current and future liquidity needs however a continuation of the volatility of interest rates and negative equity returns under current market conditions may require greater contributions to the plan in the future 

in april 2007 the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to 250 million of our common stock in october 2008 the board authorized the repurchase of up to an additional 250 million of our common stock although the repurchase program does not include a specific timetable or price targets and may be suspended or terminated at any time we expect that the program will be accomplished over the next two years shares may be purchased through open market or privately negotiated transactions at the discretion of management based on its evaluation of market conditions and other factors during the twelve months ended december 31 2009 we repurchased 684681 shares under the publicly announced repurchase program for 350 million the remaining dollar value of shares that may yet be purchased under this program was 1898 million at december 31 2009 we also reacquire shares from time to time from employees and nonemployee directors to pay taxes owed in connection with the vesting and exercise of awards under our equity compensation plans 

commitments 

we guarantee repayment of some of the borrowings of certain foreign affiliates accounted for using the equity method we also guarantee the repayment of a borrowing of a minority partner in a foreign affiliate that we consolidate in our financial statements as of december 31 2009 and 2008 these guarantees had maximum potential payments of 58 million and 68 million respectively 

we also provide guarantees to financial institutions on behalf of certain agricultural product customers principally in brazil for their seasonal borrowing the total of these guarantees was 495 million and 203 million at december 31 2009 and 2008 respectively and are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets for each date as “guarantees of vendor financing” 

shortterm debt consisted of foreign credit lines at december 31 2009 and 2008 we provide parentcompany guarantees to lending institutions providing credit to our foreign subsidiaries 

in connection with our property and asset sales and divestitures we have agreed to indemnify the buyer for certain liabilities including environmental contamination and taxes that occurred prior to the date of sale our 

  

indemnification obligations with respect to these liabilities may be indefinite as to duration and may or may not be subject to a deductible minimum claim amount or cap as such it is not possible for us to predict the likelihood that a claim will be made or to make a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential loss or range of loss if triggered we may be able to recover certain of the indemnity payments from third parties we have not recorded any specific liabilities for these guarantees 

we spun off fmc technologies inc “technologies” in 2001 at this time we entered into a tax sharing agreement wherein each company is obligated for those taxes associated with its respective business generally determined as if each company filed its own consolidated combined or unitary tax returns for any period where technologies is included in the consolidated combined or unitary tax return of us or our subsidiaries the statute of limitations for the 2001 us federal income tax year has now closed and no questions regarding the spinoff were raised during the irs audit for 20002001 therefore any liability for taxes if the spinoff of technologies were not tax free due to an action taken by technologies has been favorably concluded the tax sharing agreement continues to be in force with respect to certain items which we do not believe would have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

our total significant committed contracts that we believe will affect cash over the next four years and beyond are as follows 

 

  

 

         

contingencies 

on january 28 2005 we and our wholly owned subsidiary foret received a statement of objections from the european commission concerning alleged violations of competition law in the hydrogen peroxide business in europe during the period 1994 to 2001 all of the significant european hydrogen peroxide producers also received the statement of objections we and foret responded to the statement of objections in april 2005 and a hearing on the matter was held at the end of june 2005 on may 3 2006 we received a notice from the european commission indicating that the commission had imposed a fine on us and foret in the aggregate amount of €250 million as a result of alleged violations during the period 19971999 in connection with this fine we recorded an expense of 300 million reflecting thenprevailing exchange rates in our consolidated statements of income for the year ended december 31 2006 this expense was included as a component of “restructuring and other charges income” since we are not required to make the payment during the appeal process the liability has been classified as longterm in the consolidated balance sheets as of december 31 2009 and 2008 both we and foret have appealed the decision of the commission during the appeal process interest accrues on the fine at a rate which as of december 31 2009 was 40 percent per annum we have provided a bank letter of credit in favor of the european commission to guarantee our payment of the fine and accrued interest at december 31 2009 the amount of the letter of credit was €293 million us 420 million 

in february 2005 putative direct and indirect purchaser class action complaints were filed against six us hydrogen peroxide producers and certain of their foreign affiliates in various federal courts alleging violations of antitrust laws federal law provides that persons who have been injured by violations of federal antitrust law may recover three times their actual damage plus attorney fees related cases were also filed in various state courts all of the federal court cases were consolidated in the united states district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania philadelphia the district court certified the direct purchaser class in january 2007 on december 30 2008 the court of appeals vacated the class certification order and remanded the case for further proceedings in the district court shortly thereafter fmc reached an agreement to settle with the direct purchaser class for 10 million with a pro rata credit for opt outs the 10 million figure was included as a component of “restructuring and other charges income” in our consolidated statements of income for the year ended december 31 2008 on july 14 2009 the settlement received final approval by the court no appeal has been taken and the appeal period has expired the court has also approved a settlement with arkema and finally approved settlements with four of the six original defendantgroups who collectively paid approximately 90 million seventeen companies predominantly paper producers have opted out of certain of the settlements with other defendants certain of the defendants in the class action have settled those opt out claims for undisclosed amounts ten companies again predominantly paper producers have opted out of the settlements with fmc and arkema fmc has settled with two of the ten for an amount within the opt out credit described above the remaining eight opt outs have filed suit against fmc and in some cases foret these cases have been assigned to the same judge as the class action and the stay of these actions entered by the district court during the class certification appeal remains in place fmc has moved to dismiss the opt out claims to the extent they are based on foreign purchases that motion is fully briefed and awaiting decision by the court another individual opt out case was dismissed following the bankrupt opt out’s decision to participate in the class settlement most of the state court cases have been dismissed although some remain in california in the indirect purchaser class action the court has lifted the stay to permit discovery related to class certification plaintiffs’ motion for class certification is due in may 2010 fmc intends to defend these cases solvay has settled with the indirect purchaser class for 21 million the settlement has not yet been preliminarily approved by the court one indirect purchaser filed a claim in federal court in kansas which has been transferred to the eastern district of pennsylvania and assigned to the same judge overseeing other hydrogen peroxide litigation fmc has moved to dismiss this complaint on statute of limitations grounds the motion is pending in addition putative class actions against the six major hydrogen peroxide producers have been filed in provincial courts in ontario quebec and british columbia under the laws of canada four of the defendants have settled these claims for a total of approximately 205 million on september 28 2009 the ontario superior court of justice certified a class of direct and indirect purchasers of hydrogen peroxide fmc has moved for leave to appeal the class certification decision and intends to defend these cases 

  

on january 19 2009 the european commission decided to initiate proceedings against fmc its netherlands subsidiary and foret following an investigation of the european producers of animal feed phosphates fmc is cooperating with the european commission in the investigation and has recorded a charge of 21 million reflecting our best estimation of the expense that is likely to be incurred in connection with the resolution of this matter this charge has been reflected as a component of “restructuring and other charges income” in our consolidated statements of income for the year ended december 31 2009 this amount is included in “accrued and other liabilities” on the consolidated balance sheets as of december 31 2009 

we have certain other contingent liabilities arising from litigation claims performance guarantees and other commitments incident to the ordinary course of business based on information currently available and established reserves the ultimate resolution of our known contingencies including the matters described in note 18 to our consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or liquidity however there can be no assurance that the outcome of these contingencies will be favorable and adverse results in certain of these contingencies could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or liquidity  

climate change 

we have been following legislative and regulatory developments regarding climate change because the regulation of greenhouse gases depending on their nature and scope could subject some of our manufacturing operations to additional costs or limits on operations on december 29 2009 epa’s mandatory reporting of greenhouse gases rule became effective this rule requires fmc to collect information regarding greenhouse gas emissions from our large sources and report them beginning in 2011 our alkali chemicals division mines and processes trona ore into soda ash and related products at our facilities near green river wyoming this activity constitutes most of fmc’s greenhouse gas emissions globally the direct emissions from these operations are expected to be approximately 22 million metric tons in 2010 in addition two plants in our biopolymer business are also expected to report emissions above the epa’s reporting threshold but each plant’s emissions are expected to be substantially less than at our green river facilities 

a significant source of greenhouse gas emissions at green river are process emissions that is a significant portion of the greenhouse gases released during the mining and processing of soda ash occurs naturally in the trona ore feedstock unlike energy efficiency the amount of greenhouse gases present in the trona ore cannot be reduced all of the companies producing natural soda ash have such process emissions yet the lower energy intensity of natural soda ash provides a favorable carbon intensity compared with synthetic soda ash produced throughout the rest of the world 

energy use is a major cost component of our alkali chemicals business leading to significant focus on reducing all forms of energy the alkali division has continued to make investments to lower energy intensity eg cogeneration solution mining as one of the division’s key performance indicators we measure and review monthly the amount of btuston of soda ash produced in 2010 the soda ash business has engaged a third party consultant to assist in identifying new methods to reduce energy usage 

the alkali chemicals division currently sells products soda ash sodium bicarbonate ground trona used in environmental scrubbing applications federal regulations require utilities and industrial plants to reduce emissions particularly at coal fired power plants where fmc’s products are sold stiffer regulations are expected to be implemented in the near future clean air interstate rule maximum achievable control technology national ambient air quality standards that will increase the need for these products the uncertainty of final climate change legislation will likely lead to existing coal fired utility plants remaining in existence for a longer period of time sustaining demand for these products 

in addition soda ash is an essential raw material in the production of glass of all kinds climate change energy intensity and alternative forms of energy will drive increased production of new forms of glass lower 

  

emissivity glass solar panel glass etc and will increase the need for this essential raw material from fmc the soda ash industry has an interest in assuring that climate change legislation or regulation recognizes the benefits of soda ash particularly natural soda ash and the challenges facing this industry in controlling its greenhouse gas emissions 

on june 26 2009 the us house of representatives passed the “american clean energy and security act of 2009” which would regulate the emission of greenhouse gases this legislation includes provisions specific to soda ash recognizing that as an energy and trade intensive industry it should not be penalized relative to less efficient international competition the united states senate is working on its own climate change legislation but this legislation has not been passed and contains significant differences from the corresponding house legislation for any new climate change legislation to become law both chambers of congress would be required to approve the same legislation and the president would have to sign the bill it is not possible at this time to predict whether or when the senate might act on climate change legislation or what provisions of the house or senate legislation would be modified in order to be reconciled with each other to arrive at one unified bill 

in the absence of federal climate change legislation the environmental protection agency epa has moved forward with a finding of “endangerment” and a proposed “tailoring rule” to apply the prevention of significant deterioration psd provisions of the clean air act to greenhouse gas emissions this rule is expected to be challenged in court and there may be bills introduced in congress to withdraw epa’s authority to regulate greenhouse gases under the clean air act while congress considers enactment of federal legislation even if the “tailoring rule” is upheld epa has not clarified how the rule will be implemented 

because of the many variables it is premature to make any estimate of the costs of complying with unenacted federal climate change legislation or as yet unpromulgated federal regulations 

at this point our us facilities are not subject to any state or regional greenhouse gas regulation and our foreign operations outside of europe and canada are not subject to national or local greenhouse gas regulation although some of our european and canadian operations may be subject to greenhouse gas regulation the cost to these facilities has not been and is not expected to be significant and effect of european union and canadian greenhouse gas regulation has not been and is not expected to be material to fmc 

we have considered the potential physical risks to fmc facilities and operations and the indirect consequences of regulation or business trends as a result of potential future climate change because of the many variables not only with respect to the science but also with respect to the nature and effect of future global climate change regulation itself it is impossible to predict in any meaningful way what type of property damage or disruptions to our operations or indirect consequences might result from future climate change 

recently adopted and issued accounting pronouncements and regulatory items 

see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k 

critical accounting policies 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses we have described our accounting policies in note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k we have reviewed these accounting policies identifying those that we believe to be critical to the preparation and understanding of our consolidated financial statements we have reviewed with the audit committee those accounting policies that we have deemed critical these policies are central to our presentation of results of operations and financial condition and require management to make estimates and judgments on certain matters we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience current conditions and other reasonable factors 

  

environmental obligations 

we provide for environmentalrelated obligations when they are probable and amounts can be reasonably estimated where the available information is sufficient to estimate the amount of liability that estimate has been used where the information is only sufficient to establish a range of probable liability and no point within the range is more likely than any other the lower end of the range has been used 

estimated obligations to remediate sites that involve oversight by the environmental protection agency epa or similar government agencies are generally accrued no later than when a record of decision rod or equivalent is issued or upon completion of a remedial investigationfeasibility study rifs that is submitted by us to the appropriate government agency or agencies estimates are reviewed quarterly by our environmental remediation management as well as by financial and legal management and if necessary adjusted as additional information becomes available the estimates can change substantially as additional information becomes available regarding the nature or extent of site contamination required remediation methods and other actions by or against governmental agencies or private parties 

our environmental liabilities for continuing and discontinued operations are principally for costs associated with the remediation andor study of sites at which we are alleged to have disposed of hazardous substances such costs principally include among other items rifs site remediation costs of operation and maintenance of the remediation plan fees to outside law firms and consultants for work related to the environmental effort and future monitoring costs estimated site liabilities are determined based upon existing remediation laws and technologies specific site consultants’ engineering studies or by extrapolating experience with environmental issues at comparable sites 

included in the environmental reserve balance other assets and reasonably possible loss contingencies for 2009 are potentially recoverable amounts from third party insurance policies and some of these amounts have been recognized as offsetting recoveries in 2009 

provisions for environmental costs are reflected in income net of probable and estimable recoveries from named potentially responsible parties prps or other third parties such provisions incorporate inflation and are not discounted to their present values 

in calculating and evaluating the adequacy of our environmental reserves we have taken into account the joint and several liability imposed by comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla and the analogous state laws on all prps and have considered the identity and financial condition of each of the other prps at each site to the extent possible we have also considered the identity and financial condition of other third parties from whom recovery is anticipated as well as the status of our claims against such parties although we are unable to forecast the ultimate contributions of prps and other third parties with absolute certainty the degree of uncertainty with respect to each party is taken into account when determining the environmental reserve by adjusting the reserve to reflect the facts and circumstances on a sitebysite basis our liability includes our best estimate of the costs expected to be paid before the consideration of any potential recoveries from third parties we believe that any recorded recoveries related to prps are realizable in all material respects recoveries are recorded as either an offset in “environmental liabilities continuing and discontinued” or as “other assets” in our consolidated balance sheets 

impairments and valuation of longlived assets 

our longlived assets include property plant and equipment and longterm investments goodwill and intangible assets we test for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the net book value of these assets may not be recoverable from the estimated undiscounted expected future cash flows expected to result from their use and eventual disposition in cases where the estimated undiscounted expected future cash flows are less than net book value an impairment loss is recognized equal to the amount by which the net book 

  

value exceeds the estimated fair value of assets which is based on discounted cash flows at the lowest level determinable the estimated cash flows reflect our assumptions about selling prices volumes costs and market conditions over a reasonable period of time 

we perform an annual impairment test of goodwill in the third quarter the assumptions used to estimate fair value include our best estimate of future growth rates discount rates and market conditions over a reasonable period we performed this test in 2009 and determined that no impairment charge was required 

pensions and other postretirement benefits 

we provide qualified and nonqualified defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans as well as postretirement health care and life insurance benefit plans to our employees the costs benefits and obligations related to these benefits reflect key assumptions related to general economic conditions including interest discount rates healthcare cost trend rates expected rates of return on plan assets and the rates of compensation increases for employees the costs benefits and obligations for these benefit programs are also affected by other assumptions such as average retirement age mortality employee turnover and plan participation to the extent our plans’ actual experience as influenced by changing economic and financial market conditions or by changes to our own plans’ demographics differs from these assumptions the costs and obligations for providing these benefits as well as the plans’ funding requirements could increase or decrease when actual results differ from our assumptions the difference is typically recognized over future periods in addition the unrealized gains and losses related to our pension and postretirement benefit obligations may also affect periodic benefit costs benefits in future periods 

we use certain calculated values of assets under methods both to estimate the expected rate of return on assets component of pension cost and to calculate our plans’ funding requirements the expected rate of return on plan assets is based on a marketrelated value of assets that recognizes investment gains and losses over a fiveyear period we use an actuarial value of assets to determine our plans’ funding requirements the actuarial value of assets must be within a certain range high or low of the actual market value of assets and is adjusted accordingly 

we select the discount rate used to calculate pension and other postretirement obligations based on a review of available yields on highquality corporate bonds including moody’s investors service inc “moody’s” aarated corporate and industrial bond indices in selecting the discount rate for 2009 we placed particular emphasis on a yieldcurve approach designed by our actuary to derive an appropriate discount rate for computing the present value of the future cash flows associated with our pension and other postretirement obligations taking into consideration both the timing and amount of the cash flows the specific interest rates supporting the yield curve were derived from calculated returns yields from a portfolio of highquality aagraded or higher bond investments constructed by our actuary 

in developing the assumption for the longterm rate of return on assets for our us plan we take into consideration the technical analysis performed by our outside actuaries including historical market returns information on the assumption for longterm real returns by asset class inflation assumptions and expectations for standard deviation related to these best estimates we also consider the historical performance of our own plan’s trust which has earned a compound annual rate of return of approximately 971 percent over the last 20 years which is in excess of comparable market indices for the same period as well as other factors which are discussed in note 13 to our consolidated financial statements in this form 10k for the sensitivity of our pension costs to incremental changes in assumptions see our discussion below 

  

sensitivity analysis related to key pension and postretirement benefit assumptions 

a onehalf percent increase in the assumed discount rate would have decreased pension and other postretirement benefit obligations by 547 million at december 31 2009 and 454 million at december 31 2008 and decreased pension and other postretirement benefit costs by 31 million 05 million and 37 million for 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively a onehalf percent decrease in the assumed discount rate would have increased pension and other postretirement benefit obligations by 599 million at december 31 2009 and 497 million at december 31 2008 and increased pension and other postretirement benefit net periodic benefit cost by 45million 05 million and 61 million for 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively 

a onehalf percent increase in the assumed expected longterm rate of return on plan assets would have decreased pension costs by 42 million 42 million and 40 million for 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively a onehalf percent decrease in the assumed longterm rate of return on plan assets would have increased pension costs by 42 million 42 million and 40 million for 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively 

further details on our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and net periodic benefit costs benefits are found in note 13 to our consolidated financial statements in this form 10k 

income taxes 

we have recorded a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized in assessing the need for this allowance we have considered a number of factors including future taxable income the jurisdictions in which such income is earned and our ongoing tax planning strategies in the event that we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period such determination was made similarly should we conclude that we would be able to realize certain deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase income in the period such determination was made 

additionally we file income tax returns in the us federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions the income tax returns for fmc entities taxable in the us and significant foreign jurisdictions are open for examination and adjustment we assess our income tax positions and record a liability for all years open to examination based upon our evaluation of the facts circumstances and information available at the reporting date for those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained we have recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information we adjust these liabilities if necessary upon the completion of tax audits or changes in tax law 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we do not have any offbalance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition changes in financial condition revenues or expenses results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors 

dividends 

on january 21 2010 we paid dividends aggregating 91 million to our shareholders of record as of december 31 2009 this amount is included in “accrued and other liabilities” on the consolidated balance sheets as of december 31 2009 for the years ended december 31 2009 2008 and 2007 we paid 363 million 344 million and 297 million in dividends respectively

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend our earnings cash flows and financial position are exposed to market risks relating to fluctuations in commodity prices interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates our policy is to minimize exposure to our cash flow over time caused by changes in commodity interest and currency exchange rates to accomplish this we have implemented a controlled program of risk management consisting of appropriate derivative contracts entered into with major financial institutions 

the analysis below presents the sensitivity of the market value of our financial instruments to selected changes in market rates and prices the range of changes chosen reflects our view of changes that are reasonably possible over a oneyear period marketvalue estimates are based on the present value of projected future cash flows considering the market rates and prices chosen 

at december 31 2009 our net financial instrument position was a net asset of 03 million compared to a net liability of 399 million at december 31 2008 the change in the net financial instrument position was primarily due to lower unrealized losses in our commodity and foreign exchange portfolios 

commodity price risk 

energy costs are approximately 11 percent of our costs of sales and services and are diversified among coal electricity and natural gas we attempt to mitigate our exposure to increasing energy costs by hedging the cost of future deliveries of natural gas and by entering into fixedprice contracts for the purchase of coal and fuel oil to analyze the effect of changing energy prices we have performed a sensitivity analysis in which we assume an instantaneous 10 percent change in energy market prices from their levels at december 31 2009 and december 31 2008 with all other variables including interest rates held constant a 10 percent increase in energy market prices would result in an increase of the net asset position of 51 million at december 31 2009 compared to a 76 million decrease in the net liability position at december 31 2008 a 10 percent decrease in energy market prices would result in a decrease of 70 million in the net asset position at december 31 2009 compared to an increase of 76 million in the net liability position at december 31 2008 as a result at december 31 2009 the net asset position would have become a net liability position 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

the primary currencies for which we have exchange rate exposure are the us dollar versus the euro the us dollar versus the chinese yuan and the us dollar versus the brazilian real foreign currency debt and foreign exchange forward contracts are used in countries where we do business thereby reducing our net asset exposure foreign exchange forward contracts are also used to hedge firm and highly anticipated foreign currency cash flows 

to analyze the effects of changing foreign currency rates we have performed a sensitivity analysis in which we assume an instantaneous 10 percent change in the foreign currency exchange rates from their levels at december 31 2009 and december 31 2008 with all other variables including interest rates held constant a 10 percent strengthening of hedged currencies versus our functional currencies would have resulted in an increase of 175 million in the net liability position at december 31 2009 compared to an increase of 109 million in the net liability position at december 31 2008 a 10 percent weakening of hedged currencies versus our functional currencies would have resulted in a decrease of 178 million in the net liability position at december 31 2009 compared to a decrease of 118 million in the net liability position at december 31 2008 as a result at december 31 2009 the net liability position would have become a net asset position 

interest rate risk 

one of the strategies that we can use to manage interest rate exposure is to enter into interest rate swap agreements in these agreements we agree to exchange at specified intervals the difference between fixed and variable interest amounts calculated on an agreedupon notional principal amount as of december 31 2009 and december 31 2008 we had no interest rate swap agreements 

  

our debt portfolio at december 31 2009 is composed of 87 percent fixedrate debt and 13 percent variablerate debt the variablerate component of our debt portfolio principally consists of borrowings under our domestic and european credit agreements variablerate industrial and pollution control revenue bonds and amounts outstanding under foreign subsidiary credit lines changes in interest rates affect different portions of our variablerate debt portfolio in different ways 

based on the variablerate debt in our debt portfolio at december 31 2009 a one percentage point increase in interest rates then in effect would have increased gross interest expense for 2009 by 08 million and a one percentage point decrease in interest rates then in effect would have decreased gross interest expense for 2009 by 05 million

 item 1 business tableend general 

we are a diversified global chemical company providing innovative solutions applications and market leading products to a wide variety of markets we operate in three distinct business segments agricultural products specialty chemicals and industrial chemicals our agricultural products segment focuses primarily on insecticides and herbicides which are used in agriculture to enhance crop yield and quality by controlling a broad spectrum of insects and weeds as well as pest control in nonagricultural markets specialty chemicals consists of our biopolymer and lithium businesses and focuses on food ingredients that are used to enhance texture structure and physical stability pharmaceutical additives for binding encapsulation and disintegrant applications ultrapure biopolymers for medical devices and lithium specialties for pharmaceutical synthesis specialty polymers and energy storage our industrial chemicals segment manufactures a wide range of inorganic materials including soda ash hydrogen peroxide specialty peroxygens and phosphorus chemicals 

the following table shows the principal products produced by our three business segments and their raw materials and uses 

 

   

we have operations in many areas around the world with a worldwide manufacturing and distribution infrastructure we are able to respond rapidly to global customer needs offset downward economic trends in one region with positive trends in another and better match revenues to local costs to mitigate the impact of currency volatility the charts below detail our sales and longlived assets by major geographic region 

 

 our strategy 

our corporate strategy is balanced between driving growth and innovation within our specialty chemicals and agricultural products segments and generating strong cash flow in our industrial chemicals segment our longterm objectives are as follows 

realize the operating leverage inherent in our businesses we intend to maximize earnings growth and return on capital by maintaining or enhancing our market positions reducing costs and prudently managing our asset base in soda ash we continually strive to optimize our proprietary and lowcost solution mining and longwall mining techniques thereby reducing our production costs which we believe are already the lowest in the industry in foret which is part of our industrial chemicals segment we have selectively shut down higher cost production capacity to improve profitability in agricultural products we completed the shutdown of operations at our baltimore maryland facility as part of our ongoing program to reduce manufacturing costs by producing our products andor intermediates in lowercost locations 

maintain strategic and financial flexibility going forward we expect continued sustained growth in our operating profit and resulting cash provided by operating activities furthermore our businesses will meet future expected demand growth through a combination of debottlenecking current production restarting mothballed capacity and sourcing from third parties 

focus the portfolio on higher growth businesses our goal is to achieve the highest overall growth while continuing to generate returns above our cost of capital in this regard we intend to focus on building upon our core franchises in the food ingredient pharmaceutical energy storage crop protection and nonagricultural pest control markets that exist within the specialty chemicals and agricultural products segments internal development will continue to be a core element of our growth strategy in both of these business segments our biopolymer business is developing new pharmaceutical delivery systems and working closely with top global food companies in the development of new health and convenience foods our lithium business is developing applications for energy storage markets to serve the rapid growth in global demand for handheld electronic devices our agricultural products business is testing proprietary product differentiating technologies which could improve the biological efficacy andor the cost competitiveness of existing and new chemistries thereby potentially enhancing those products’ market acceptance and value to endusers in addition to internal 

  

development as discussed above product or business acquisitions inlicensing alliances and equity ventures are also strategic options we may consider to enhance our technology offerings broaden our market access and extend our geographic footprint each growth opportunity will be evaluated in the context of continued value creation for our shareholders including the degree to which the opportunity complements one of our existing franchises generates substantial synergies and is accretive to earnings finally we intend to divest any business that cannot sustain a return above its cost of capital 

financial information about our business segments 

see note 19 to our consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k also see below for selected financial information related to our segments 

agricultural products 

financial information in millions 

 

 overview 

our agricultural products segment which represents approximately 34 percent of our 2008 consolidated revenues develops manufactures and sells a portfolio of crop protection professional pest control and lawn and garden products our innovation and growth efforts focus on developing environmentally compatible solutions that can effectively increase farmers’ yields and provide costeffective alternatives to older chemistries to which insects or weeds may have developed resistance over the last several years we restructured and redeployed our rd resources to focus our innovation efforts towards accelerating the development of new products and productivityenhancing technologies to our customers our goal is to shorten the innovation cycle and provide quicker payback on our investments in innovation 

we differentiate ourselves by our focused strategy in selected products crops and markets coupled with our lowcost manufacturing strategy we are continually working to gain access to proprietary chemistries and technologies from third parties which are complementary to our existing products and market focus we are encouraged by our progress in licensing and partnering to create proprietary products developing technicallyadvanced delivery systems and commercializing unique product premixes and combinations we are optimistic that these efforts will continue to result in sales and profit growth over the next few years 

  

products and markets 

 

 agricultural products provides a wide range of proprietary branded products—based on both patented and offpatent technologies—for global crop protection professional pest control and lawn and garden markets product branding is a prevalent industry practice used to help maintain and grow market share by promoting enduser recognition and product and supplier reputation agricultural products enjoys relatively strong niche positions in crop and noncrop market segments in the americas europe and other parts of the world and derived approximately 79 percent of its revenue from outside north america in 2008 

insecticides represent the majority of our sales in the agricultural products segment particularly pyrethroid and carbamate chemistries in which we maintain leading market positions based on revenues our proprietary herbicides have grown significantly over the last several years our herbicide portfolio primarily targets niche uses and controls a wide variety of difficulttocontrol weeds we are also selectively evaluating opportunities to enhance our market position in fungicides so that we can broaden our portfolio across the three major pesticide categories ie insecticides herbicides and fungicides 

the following table summarizes the principal product chemistries in agricultural products and the principal uses of each chemistry 

 

 over the last several years we have entered into a number of key agreements with thirdparty pesticide producers under which we work together to develop market andor distribute existing and new pesticide chemistries in various markets these proprietary chemistries and technologies are complementary to our 

  

existing products and market strategies the chemistries include flonicamid a unique insecticide for controlling sucking pests cyazofamid a novel fungicide for crop and noncrop uses in the americas fluthiacetmethyl a proprietary herbicide for controlling glyphosateresistant weeds and acetamiprid for pest control markets in north america we also have numerous supply and access agreements with thirdparty producers for other pesticide products including the commercialization of proprietary premixes and combinations 

we access the market in key western european markets through the belgianbased pesticide distribution company belchim crop protection nv in which we have an ownership interest we also have joint venture arrangements with nufarm limited in several key countries in eastern europe which allows us to capitalize on growth in this part of europe in north america we access the market through several major national and regional distributors and strengthened our access capabilities by signing a longterm distribution agreement with nufarm to market and sell a number of proprietary chemistries in canada in the large agricultural market of brazil we access the market in part through independent distributors and in part we sell directly to large growers through our own skilled sales and marketing organization through these and other alliances along with our own targeted marketing efforts access to novel technologies and our internal development initiatives we expect to enhance our access in key agricultural and noncrop markets and develop new products that will help us continue to compete effectively 

we maintain competitive manufacturing cost positions through our strategy of sourcing raw materials intermediates and finished products from third parties in lowercost manufacturing countries such as china india and mexico we have been implementing this lowcost manufacturing strategy for more than ten years this strategy has resulted in significant cost savings and lower capital spending and has reduced the fixed capital intensity of the business in may 2008 we completed the next stage of this strategy with the shutdown of operations of our baltimore maryland manufacturing facility this initiative is expected to produce additional annual cost savings of approximately 25 million to 30 million which is expected to be fully realized in fiscal year 2009 

growth 

we plan to grow by obtaining new and approved uses for existing product lines and acquiring accessing developing marketing distributing andor selling complementary chemistries andor related technologies in order to enhance and expand our product portfolio and our capabilities to effectively service our target markets and customers our growth will depend on our ability to deliver unique innovative solutions to our customers over the next several years growth is anticipated from our proprietary insecticides and herbicides and recentlyaccessed third party chemistries andor technologies for our proprietary insecticides we launched a number of new products expanded labels andor unique formulations that deliver valueadding solutions to our customers the emergence and spread of herbicideresistant weeds and shifts in weed populations coupled with several recently launched product formulations expanded labels and premixes provide growth opportunities for our proprietary herbicide chemistries 

industry overview 

the three principal categories of agricultural chemicals are herbicides representing approximately half of global industry revenue insecticides representing approximately a quarter of global industry revenue and fungicides representing most of the remaining portion of global industry revenue 

insecticides are used to control a wide range of insects including chewing pests such as caterpillars and sucking pests such as aphids insecticides are applied as sprays dusts or granules and are used on a wide variety of crops such as fruits vegetables cotton soybean maize and cereals there are several major classes of insecticide chemistries including organophosphates carbamates pyrethroids and neonicotinoids 

  

herbicides prevent or inhibit weed growth thereby reducing or eliminating the need for manual or mechanical weeding herbicides can be selective controlling only specific unwanted vegetation or nonselective controlling all vegetation and are also segmented by their time of application preplanting preemergent and postemergent 

fungicides prevent or inhibit the spread of plant disease which can adversely impact crop yields and quality fungicides are used on a wide variety of crops such as fruits vegetables soybean cereals and rice 

the agrochemicals industry has undergone significant consolidation over the past ten years leading crop protection companies syngenta ag bayer ag monsanto company basf ag the dow chemical company and e i du pont de nemours and company dupont currently represent approximately 70 percent of the industry’s global sales significant drivers for this consolidation have been the growth and grower acceptance of biotechnology employed in row crops and the escalation of research and development and marketing costs 

the next tier of agrochemical producers including fmc makhteshimagan industries ltd sumitomo chemical company limited nufarm limited arysta lifescience united phosphorous and cheminova as employ various differentiated strategies and compete by 1 unique technologies 2 focusing on certain crops markets and geographies andor 3 competitive pricing based on lowcost manufacturing positions some of these producers are generic competitors with little or no investment in innovation there is a growing trend among these producers to partner with one another to gain economies of scale and competitive market access more comparable to larger competitors additionally a number of these companies have grown rapidly through acquisitions of other companies andor product divestitures from the leading crop protection companies

 industry overview 

food ingredients 

our biopolymer business serves the texture structure and physical stability tsps food ingredients market tsps ingredients impart physical properties to thicken and stabilize foods there are many types of tsps ingredients and a wide range of food groups served including bakery meats dairy and convenience products the industry is dispersed geographically with the majority of our sales in europe north america and asia 

trends driving market growth include increasing consumer interest in healthier foods greater convenience and growth in per capita consumption of processed foods in emerging markets the trend toward health and convenience drives the need for more functional ingredients to impart desired food tastes and textures we believe carrageenan and mcc which address this need are growing faster than the overall tsps market the 

  

global customer base for tsps is relatively fragmented and includes large and small food processors consolidation among these customers has been a significant trend over the past several years as a result tsps ingredient suppliers such as us have focused on establishing alliances with market leaders with the goal of reducing costs leveraging technology and expanding product offerings with key accounts 

within the entire food ingredients market there are a relatively large number of suppliers due principally to the broad spectrum of chemistries employed segment leadership global position and investment in technology are key factors to sustaining profitability in addition larger suppliers may often provide a broader product line and a range of services to food companies including functional systems or blends the top suppliers of tsps ingredients include fmc danisco as dupont jm huber kerry ingredients cargill incorporated dgf stoess ag and tate  lyle plc 

pharmaceutical chemicals 

our biopolymer business sells into the formulation chemicals segment of the pharmaceutical market the major end markets for formulation chemicals include coatings and colors fillers binders sweeteners and flavors disintegrants and others 

competitors tend to be grouped by chemistry our principal mcc competitors in pharmaceuticals include j rettenmaier  sôhne gmbh ming tai chemical co ltd asahi kasei corporation and blanver farmoquimica ltda while pricing pressure from low cost producers is a common competitive dynamic companies like us offset that pressure by providing the most reliable and broadest range of products and services our customers are pharmaceutical firms who depend upon reliable therapeutic performance of their drug products 

we also supply alginates mcc and carrageenan into oral care cosmetics and health care markets highly refined extracts from selected seaweeds provide a broad range of alginate functionality including uses in antireflux disorders dental impressions control release of drugs and wound dressings special grades of carrageenan extracts are used in liquid cough medicines toothpaste and a variety of skin care products

there are only three key producers of lithium fmc rockwood holdings inc and sociedad quimica y minera de chile sa all of which produce lithium carbonate fmc has a stronger presence in downstream lithium specialties where rockwood is the primary competitor 

  

industrial chemicals 

financial information in millions 

 

 overview 

our industrial chemicals segment which represents 41 percent of our 2008 consolidated revenues has lowcost positions in high volume inorganic chemicals including soda ash and hydrogen peroxide complemented by high value niche positions in specialty alkali phosphorus and peroxygen products 

products and markets 

 

 industrial chemicals serves a diverse group of markets from economicallysensitive industrial sectors to technologyintensive specialty markets we process and sell refined inorganic products that are sought by customers for their critical reactivity or specific functionality in markets such as glass detergents and pulp and paper in addition we produce purify and market higher value downstream derivatives into specialized and customerspecific applications these applications include electronics biocides and animal nutrition 

alkali 

our alkali chemical division produces natural soda ash soda ash is used by manufacturers in glass chemical processing and detergent industries to lesser degrees we also produce sodium bicarbonate caustic soda and sodium sesquicarbonate the majority of our alkali sales are manufactured by and sold through fmc wyoming corporation which we manage as an integral part of our alkali business and in which we own shares representing an 875 percent economic interest with the remaining shares held by two japanese companies 

  

we mine and produce natural soda ash using proprietary lowcost mining technologies such as longwall and solution mining which we believe give us the lowest cost position our two production sites in green river wyoming have the capacity to produce approximately 485 million tons of soda ash annually with approximately seven hundred thousand tons of this capacity currently mothballed at december 31 2008 for the past several years the us soda ash industry was essentially sold out as a result of this condition during 2005 and 2006 we restarted 500000 tons of previously mothballed capacity to meet the increase in demand driven by the growth in export markets on february 8 2008 we announced the recommissioning of the remaining mothballed capacity in green river wyoming approximately 100000 tons of this capacity was commissioned prior to the end of 2008 we expect the remaining capacity approximately 700000 tons per year to be fully online by 2012 depending on export demand growth 

peroxygens 

we produce hydrogen peroxide at production facilities in the united states canada and mexico and as described below through our whollyowned foret subsidiary in spain and the netherlands we also participate in a joint venture company in thailand we sell hydrogen peroxide into the pulp and paper industry and to a lesser extent in the chemical processing environmental electronics and food industries we are a leading north american producer of hydrogen peroxide due in part to our broad product line geographicallyadvantaged plant locations stateoftheart processing technology and superior customer service hydrogen peroxide represents approximately 70 percent of our peroxygens sales 

our specialty peroxygens business supplies persulfate products primarily to polymer and printed circuit board markets and peracetic acid predominantly to the food industry for biocidal applications typically we compete as a specialty player where we believe that we are differentiated by our strong technical expertise unique process technology intellectual property and geographic location 

foret 

our european subsidiary fmc foret sa “foret” headquartered near barcelona spain is a leading provider of chemical products to the detergent paper textile mining and chemical industries foret operates six manufacturing facilities across europe with market positions in phosphates hydrogen peroxide percarbonates sulfur derivatives zeolites and silicates foret’s sales efforts are focused in europe africa and the middle east and in south america mainly via tripoliven our venezuelan jointventure in which foret holds a minority participation 

industry overview 

we primarily participate in three product areas soda ash peroxygens and phosphorus chemicals these products are generally inorganic and are generally commodities that in many cases have few costeffective substitutes growth is typically a function of gdp in developed markets or the rate of industrialization in key export markets pricing tends to reflect the supply and demand balance as producers add or reduce capacity in response to demand changes 

soda ash 

soda ash is a highly alkaline inorganic chemical essential in the production of glass and widely used in the production of chemicals soaps and detergents and many other products natural soda ash is typically produced from trona a natural form of sodium sesquicarbonate through mining and chemical processing soda ash may also be produced synthetically but this process requires a significant amount of energy and produces large quantities of waste byproducts making it much less costeffective than natural soda ash production 

because of the processing cost advantages of trona and the large natural reserves of trona in the us particularly in green river wyoming all us soda ash is naturally produced by contrast due to a lack of trona 

  

the majority of the soda ash that is manufactured in the rest of the world is produced synthetically other us producers are oci chemical corporation solvay sa the general chemical group inc in which a majority stake was acquired by tata chemicals limited and searles valley minerals which was acquired by nirma limited in november 2007 

approximately 47 percent of us soda ash production served export markets in 2008 with approximately 35 percent of us soda ash production exported through the american natural soda ash corporation “ansac” ansac is the foreign sales association of the significant us soda ash producers established in 1983 under the webbpomerene act and subsequent legislation since its creation ansac has been successful in coordinating soda ash exports exploiting the inherent cost benefits of us produced natural soda ash and leveraging its large scale of operations to the benefit of its member companies consequently us exports of soda ash have risen significantly over the last 25 years 

peroxygens 

hydrogen peroxide is typically sold for use as a bleach or oxidizer as such it often competes with other chemicals capable of performing similar functions some of our specialty peroxygen derivatives eg persulfates and percarbonates also function as bleaching or oxidizing agents environmental regulations regional cost differences primarily due to transportation costs and technical differences in product performance factor into the decision to use hydrogen peroxide or one of its derivatives rather than another product since these considerations vary by region the consumption patterns vary in different parts of the world hydrogen peroxide is sold in aqueous solutions usually 35 percent 50 percent or 70 percent by weight 

the north american pulp and paper industry represents approximately 70 percent of north american demand for hydrogen peroxide in this market hydrogen peroxide is used as an environmentally friendly bleaching agent to brighten chemical mechanical and recycled pulps as well as treat a wide range of mill pollutants in the waste stream the north american paper market is mature and new investment in pulp and paper capacity is largely focused in asia and south america the other north american hydrogen peroxide producers are eka a wholly owned subsidiary of akzo nobel nv arkema inc evonik industries kemira ovj and solvay sa 

phosphorous chemicals 

we participate in this business in europe the middle east africa and south america through foret major competitors include thermphos international bv prayon rupel sa and various chinese producers phosphorous chemicals are used in many industrial applications in a wide array of chemical compounds 

overall growth in demand for phosphorous chemicals tends to correlate with gdp purified phosphoric acid ppa and phosphate salts eg sodium phosphates and calcium phosphates are sold into many markets including detergents cleaning compounds and animal feed 

the basic input material for making phosphates is now produced using two processes most industrial applications use the costeffective process that involves making ppa by the purification of fertilizergrade phosphoric acid thermal phosphoric acid long the industry standard is produced from elemental phosphorus but is more costly due to energy and environmental compliance costs and is now used in limited applications elemental phosphorus is still produced by thermphos in the netherlands and in several other countries including china 

over the next few years industrial demand for phosphorous chemicals is expected to grow driven by growing demand in the detergent industry in newly industrializing nations 

  

source and availability of raw materials 

our raw material requirements vary by business segment and include mineralrelated natural resources trona ore and lithium brines processed chemicals seaweed specialty wood pulps and energy sources such as oil gas coal and electricity raw materials represented approximately 32 percent of our 2008 costs of sales and services and no one raw material represented more than 12 percent of our total raw material purchases 

ores used in industrial chemicals’ manufacturing processes are extracted by us from mines eg trona in north america or are purchased from others eg phosphorous rock raw materials used by specialty chemicals include lithium brines various types of seaweed that are sourced on a global basis and specialty pulps which are purchased from selected global producers raw materials used by agricultural products primarily processed chemicals are obtained from a variety of suppliers worldwide 

patents 

we own a number of us and foreign patents trademarks and licenses that are cumulatively important to our business we do not believe that the loss of any one or group of related patents trademarks or licenses would have a material adverse effect on the overall business of fmc the duration of our patents depends on their respective jurisdictions their expiration dates range through 2028 

seasonality 

the seasonal nature of the crop protection market and the geographic spread of the agricultural products business can result in significant variations in quarterly earnings agricultural products sold into the northern hemisphere north america europe and parts of asia serve seasonal agricultural markets from march through september generally resulting in earnings in the first second and third quarters markets in the southern hemisphere latin america and parts of the asia pacific region including australia are served from july through february generally resulting in earnings in the third fourth and first quarters the remainder of our businesses are generally not subject to significant seasonal fluctuations 

competition 

we have a number one or number two market position in many of our product lines based on revenue either globally or in north america largely as a result of our product offerings proprietary technologies and our position as a lowcost producer the following product lines accounted for the majority of our 2008 consolidated revenue market positions are based on the most recently available revenue data 

 

  

 we encounter substantial competition in each of our three business segments this competition is expected to continue in both the united states and markets outside of the united states we market our products through our own sales organization and through alliance partners independent distributors and sales representatives the number of our principal competitors varies from segment to segment in general we compete by operating in a costefficient manner and by leveraging our industry experience to provide advanced technology high product quality and reliability and quality customer and technical service 

our agricultural products segment competes primarily in the global chemical crop protection market for insecticides herbicides and fungicides the industry is characterized by a relatively small number of large 

  

competitors and a large number of smaller often regional competitors industry products include crop protection chemicals and for certain major competitors genetically engineered crop biotechnology products competition from generic agrochemical producers has increased as a significant number of product patents held industrywide have expired in the last decade in general we compete as an innovator by focusing on product development including novel formulations proprietary mixes and advanced delivery systems and by acquiring or licensing mostly proprietary chemistries or technologies that complement our product and geographic focus we also differentiate ourselves by our global costcompetitiveness via our manufacturing strategies establishing effective product stewardship programs and developing strategic alliances that strengthen market access in key countries and regions 

with significant positions in markets that include alginate carrageenan microcrystalline cellulose and lithiumbased products specialty chemicals competes on the basis of product differentiation market applications expertise customer service and price biopolymer competes with both direct suppliers of cellulose and seaweed extract as well as suppliers of other hydrocolloids which may provide similar functionality in specific applications in microcrystalline cellulose competitors are typically smaller than us while in seaweed extracts alginates we compete with other broadbased chemical companies we and each of our two most significant competitors in lithium extract the element from naturally occurring lithiumrich brines located in the andes mountains of argentina and chile which are believed to be the world’s most significant and lowest cost sources of lithium 

industrial chemicals serves the soda ash markets worldwide the peroxygens markets predominantly in north america and europe and the phosphorus markets in europe the middle east and latin america in north america our soda ash business competes with four domestic producers of natural soda ash three of which operate in the vicinity of our mine and processing facilities in green river wyoming outside of the us canada and europe we sell soda ash mainly through ansac internationally our natural soda ash competes with synthetic soda ash manufactured by numerous producers ranging from integrated multinational companies to smaller regional companies we maintain a leading position in the north american market for peroxygens there are currently five other firms competing in the peroxygens market in north america the primary competitive factor affecting the sales of soda ash and peroxygens is price we seek to maintain our competitive position by employing low cost processing technology at foret we possess strong cost and market positions in phosphates percarbonate peroxygens zeolites silicates and sulfur derivatives in each of these markets we face significant competition from a range of multinational and regional chemical producers competition in phosphorus chemicals is based primarily on price and to a lesser degree product differentiation 

research and development expense 

we perform research and development in all of our segments with the majority of our efforts focused in the agricultural products segment the development efforts in the agricultural products segment focus on developing environmentally sound solutions and new product formulations that costeffectively increase farmers’ yields and provide alternatives to existing and new chemistries beginning in 2006 we redeployed our agricultural products innovation spending away from the discovery of new chemistry to focus our efforts on delivering valueadding solutions and new product formulations more quickly to our customers this shift in strategy should result in a shorter innovation cycle for the segment our research and development expenses in the last three years are set forth below 

 

   

environmental laws and regulations 

we are subject to various federal state local and foreign environmental laws and regulations that govern emissions of air pollutants discharges of water pollutants and the manufacture storage handling and disposal of hazardous substances hazardous wastes and other toxic materials and remediation of contaminated sites we are also subject to liabilities arising under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla and similar state laws that impose responsibility on persons who arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances and on current and previous owners and operators of a facility for the cleanup of hazardous substances released from the facility into the environment in addition we are subject to liabilities under the resource conservation and recovery act rcra and analogous state laws that require owners and operators of facilities that treat store or dispose of hazardous waste to follow certain waste management practices and to clean up releases of hazardous substances into the environment associated with past or present practices 

we have been named a potentially responsible party prp at 31 sites on the federal government’s national priorities list npl at which our potential liability has not yet been settled in addition we also have received notice from the environmental protection agency epa or other regulatory agencies that we may be a prp or prp equivalent at other sites including 39 sites at which we have determined that it is reasonably possible that we have environmental liability in cooperation with appropriate government agencies we are currently participating in or have participated in a remedial investigationfeasibility study rifs or its equivalent at most of the identified sites with the status of each investigation varying from site to site at certain sites a rifs has only recently begun providing limited information if any relating to cost estimates timing or the involvement of other prps whereas at other sites the studies are complete remedial action plans have been chosen or a record of decision rod has been issued 

environmental liabilities include obligations relating to waste handling and the remediation andor study of sites at which we are alleged to have released or disposed of hazardous substances these sites include current operations previously operated sites and sites associated with discontinued operations we have provided reserves for potential environmental obligations that we consider probable and for which a reasonable estimate of the obligation can be made as of december 31 2008 our net environmental reserve was 1727 million compared to 1698 million at december 31 2007 we have recorded recoveries representing probable realization of claims against insurance companies us government agencies and other third parties of 477 million and 354 million respectively at december 31 2008 and 2007 the recoveries at december 31 2008 are recorded as either an offset to the “environmental liabilities continuing and discontinued” totaling 215 million or as “other assets” totaling 262 million in our consolidated balance sheets the recoveries at december 31 2007 are recorded as either an offset to the “environmental liabilities continuing and discontinued” totaling 188 million or as “other assets” totaling 166 million in our consolidated balance sheets in addition we have estimated that reasonably possible environmental loss contingencies may exceed amounts accrued by approximately 80 million at december 31 2008 

employees 

we employ approximately 5000 people with approximately 2500 people in our domestic operations and 2500 people in our foreign operations approximately 33 percent of our usbased employees and 38 percent of our foreignbased employees are represented by collective bargaining agreements we have successfully concluded virtually all of our recent contract negotiations without a work stoppage in those rare instances where a work stoppage has occurred there has been no material effect on consolidated sales and earnings we cannot predict however the outcome of future contract negotiations in 2009 we have six collectivebargaining agreements expiring these contracts affect approximately 26 percent of foreignbased employees and have no impact on usbased employees

 item 3 legal proceedings tableend like hundreds of other industrial companies we have been named as one of many defendants in asbestosrelated personal injury litigation these cases most cases involve between 25 and 200 defendants allege personal injury or death resulting from exposure to asbestos in premises of fmc or to asbestoscontaining components installed in machinery or equipment manufactured or sold by discontinued operations the machinery and equipment businesses we owned or operated did not fabricate the asbestoscontaining component parts at issue in the litigation and to this day neither the us occupational safety and health administration nor the epa has banned the use of these components further the asbestoscontaining parts for this machinery and equipment were accessible only at the time of infrequent repair and maintenance therefore we believe that 

  

overall the claims against fmc are without merit indeed the bulk of the claims against us to date have been dismissed without payment 

as of december 31 2008 there were approximately 29000 premises and product asbestos claims pending against fmc in several jurisdictions to date we have had discharged approximately 77000 asbestos claims against fmc the overwhelming majority of which have been dismissed without any payment to the plaintiff settlements by us with claimants to date have totaled approximately 203 million 

we intend to continue managing these cases in accordance with our historical experience we have established a reserve for this litigation and believe that the outcome of these cases will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or liquidity 

in late june 2004 we were served in a lawsuit captioned “lewis et al v fmc corporation” which was filed in united states district court for the western district of new york the suit was brought by thirteen residents of middleport new york who allege that we violated certain state and federal environmental laws and seeks injunctive relief and monetary damages for personal injuries and property damage in connection with such alleged violations we believe this suit is without merit 

we have certain other contingent liabilities arising from litigation claims performance guarantees and other commitments incident to the ordinary course of business based on information currently available and established reserves the ultimate resolution of our known contingencies including the matters described in note 18 to the consolidated financial statements in this form 10k is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or liquidity however there can be no assurance that the outcome of these contingencies will be favorable and adverse results in certain of these contingencies could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or liquidity

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend overview 

we are a diversified global chemical company providing innovative solutions applications and market leading products to a wide variety of markets we operate in three distinct business segments agricultural products specialty chemicals and industrial chemicals our agricultural products segment primarily focuses on insecticides and herbicides which are used in agriculture to enhance crop yield and quality by controlling a broad spectrum of insects and weeds as well as pest control in nonagricultural markets specialty chemicals consists of our biopolymer and lithium businesses and focuses on food ingredients that are used to enhance texture structure and physical stability pharmaceutical additives for binding encapsulation and disintegrant applications ultrapure biopolymers for medical devices and lithium specialties for pharmaceutical synthesis specialty polymers and energy storage our industrial chemicals segment manufactures a wide range of inorganic materials including soda ash hydrogen peroxide specialty peroxygens and phosphorus chemicals 

2008 highlights 

2008 was a year in which we experienced continued sales and earnings growth in all of our business segments consolidated revenue of 31153 million was up 18 percent from the prior year agricultural products specialty chemicals and industrial chemicals had revenue increases of 19 percent 16 percent and 19 percent respectively and had segment operating profit increases of 18 percent 7 percent and 118 percent respectively compared to the prior year period we continue to be impacted by increases to raw material costs across all of our businesses and to a lesser extent higher energy costs 

our segment results for the year ended december 31 2008 were driven by the following 

 

  

  

 included in our net income were various restructuring and other income and charges there was a significant decrease in restructuring and other income and charges for the year ended december 31 2008 compared to the prior period as a result of the gains on the princeton and foret asset sales described below and reduced charges related to the phase out of operations at our baltimore maryland agricultural chemicals facility the baltimore facility which was part of our agricultural products segment was closed in the second quarter of 2008 the announcement to phase out the facility was made in the second quarter of 2007 

on march 18 2008 we completed the sale of our 158acre princeton research center to the princeton healthcare system gross proceeds from the sale were 625 million and net proceeds after offsets commissions and fees totaled approximately 60 million the gain on the sale was 290 million which is included in “restructuring and other charges income” in the consolidated statements of income for the year ended december 31 2008 

  

in february 2008 we completed the sale of foret’s sodium sulfate assets foret is part of our industrial chemicals segment we recognized a gain on the sale of these assets of 36 million which is included in “restructuring and other charges income” in the consolidated statements of income for the year ended december 31 2008 net proceeds from the transaction were 167 million 

in august 2008 we acquired the hydrocolloids ingredients business of international specialty products isp this acquisition is intended to strengthen our position in hydrocolloids and enhance service to the global customers in food pharmaceutical and specialty industries under the agreement we acquired isp’s alginates and food blends business other than isp’s germinal blending business based in brazil including isp’s girvan scotland manufacturing facility and employees the results of operations of the isp business are included in the specialty chemicals segment beginning on the acquisition date of august 18 2008 

in september 2008 we acquired shares and assets comprising the food ingredients business of the coliving group the acquisition is intended to enhance our position in supplying specialty hydrocolloid products and services to the rapidly growing food ingredient market in china the results of operations of the coliving business are included in the specialty chemicals segment beginning on the acquisition date of september 27 2008 

2009 outlook 

in 2009 despite the challenging global economic conditions we expect continued growth in our revenue and earnings the increase in revenue is expected to be driven by higher volumes and selling prices across most regions in our agricultural products segment strong commercial performance in biopolymer and the full year inclusion of the isp and coliving acquisitions in our specialty chemicals segment as well as higher selling prices in our industrial chemicals segment these revenue increases are expected to be partially offset by lower volumes and unfavorable currency translation in our industrial chemicals segment 

the increase in earnings is expected to be driven by higher sales and continued global supply chain productivity initiatives in our agricultural products segment higher sales in our specialty chemicals segment and higher prices in our industrial chemicals segment our earnings growth is expected to be offset by higher raw material and energy costs in our specialty chemicals segment increased spending on growth initiatives in our agricultural products segment lower volumes and higher raw material and other input costs in our industrial chemicals segment and higher pension expenses we expect cash flow generation from our business segments to remain strong 

  

results of operations—2008 2007 and 2006 

overview 

the following presents a reconciliation of our segment operating profit to net income as seen through the eyes of our management for management purposes we report the operating performance of each of our business segments based on earnings before interest and income taxes excluding corporate expenses other income expense net and corporate special incomecharges 

 

 the below chart which is provided to assist readers of our financial statements depicts certain aftertax charges gains these items are excluded by us in the measures we use to evaluate business performance and determine certain performancebased compensation these items are discussed in detail within the “other results of operations” section that follows 

 

   

year ended december 31 2008 compared to december 31 2007 

in the following discussion “year” refers to the year ended december 31 2008 and “prior year” refers to the year ended december 31 2007 additionally in the discussion below please refer to our chart on page 30 under “overview” all comparisons are between the periods unless otherwise noted 

segment results 

for management purposes segment operating profit is defined as segment revenue less operating expenses segment operating expenses consist of costs of sales and services selling general and administrative expenses and research and development expenses we have excluded the following items from segment operating profit corporate staff expense interest income and expense associated with corporate debt facilities and investments income taxes gains or losses on divestitures on businesses restructuring and other charges investment gains and losses loss on extinguishment of debt asset impairments lifo inventory adjustments amortization of inventory stepup from business acquisitions and other income and expense items 

information about how each of these items relates to our businesses at the segment level and results by segment are discussed below and in note 19 to our consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k 

agricultural products 

 

 revenue of 10587 million increased 19 percent versus the prior year period north america revenues grew by nine percent europe middle east and africa by 33 percent asia by 12 percent and latin america by 22 percent revenue benefited from favorable global agrochemical market conditions increased planted acres in key crops new product introductions and selective price increases to offset higher input costs 

segment operating profit of 2452 million was 18 percent higher than the prior year the earnings from the higher revenue coupled with supply chain productivity improvements from the shutdown of the baltimore manufacturing facility were partially offset by higher raw materials costs which had an unfavorable period over period impact on operating profit by 355 million to a lesser extent higher selling costs to support the higher revenues also impacted operating profit in 2008 

in 2009 fullyear revenue growth in the midsingle digits is expected driven by higher volumes and selling prices across most regions partially offset by unfavorable currency impacts fullyear segment operating profit is expected to increase approximately 5—10 percent as higher sales and continued global supply chain productivity initiatives are partially offset by spending on growth initiatives 

in our agricultural products segment several products are undergoing reregistration in the us andor a comparable regulatory review by eu governmental authorities in august 2006 the us environmental protection agency issued its “interim reregistration eligibility decision” “ired” for our carbofuran insecticide the ired proposes cancellation of all carbofuran uses in the united states subject to a phase out period for certain minor crop uses while maintaining tolerances for imported commodities bananas coffee rice and sugarcane the epa reiterated its proposal in january 2008 with the issuance of a draft notice of intent to cancel in february 2008 the epa convened a scientific advisory panel meeting to evaluate scientific issues relevant to the draft notice of intent to cancel carbofuran at this meeting the epa and fmc presented their views on the relevant scientific assessments of carbofuran separately the us department of agriculture issued 

  

its comments on the draft cancellation notice stating that carbofuran should continue to be registered on july 24 2008 the epa published a proposal to revoke all carbofuran tolerances under the federal food drug and cosmetic act in advance of any issuance of a final notice of intent to cancel under the federal pesticide law we have responded to that notice expressing our strong disagreement with the epa’s proposal to revoke tolerances and our belief that carbofuran residues on food do not pose a threat to human health if the epa chooses to revoke tolerances or issue a final notice of intent to cancel which continues to eliminate all carbofuran uses fmc plans to challenge such decision by requesting review by an administrative law judge meanwhile fmc can continue to sell carbofuran in the united states at this time should the epa issue a final decision to revoke tolerances the epa will also decide on when the revocation will take effect if tolerances are revoked immediately and we cannot obtain a stay of such decision sales of carbofuran into the relevant crops will be negatively impacted we expect a final epa decision on the tolerance revocation proposal in the first half of 2009 the conclusion of any subsequent administrative hearings might take as long as a year from the issuance of a final revocation order we do not know epa’s timing on a final notice of intent to cancel the carbofuran registration though epa has said it intends to issue such notice after the tolerance revocation decision 

in november 2006 the european union “eu” commission’s standing committee on animal health and food chain voted not to include our carbofuran carbosulfan and cadusafos products on the official list of active ingredients approved for continued sale in the eu we believe the committee’s decision was based on a flawed underlying scientific review and a failure to take into account all available data in june 2007 the european commission published its decisions not to include carbofuran carbosulfan and cadusafos on the official list of active ingredients approved for continued sale in the eu the published decisions required eu member states to deregister the products within six months and so fmc ceased its sales of these products in december 2007 we disagreed with the commission and initiated litigation in the european community courts seeking annulment of the carbofuran and carbosulfan decisions in february 2009 we withdrew those cases we have also resubmitted cadusafos carbofuran and carbosulfan for approval on the official list the outcome of our regulatory resubmissions is uncertain as expected the lost sales attributable to the cancellation of eu registrations for carbofuran carbosulfan and cadusafos had a modest negative impact in this region in 2008 but growth in other products new registrations andor label expansions more than offset the unfavorable impact 

we intend to defend vigorously all our products in the us and eu regulatory processes several of fmc’s pesticide products will be reviewed in the ordinary course of regulatory programs during 2009 as part of the ongoing cycle of reregistration in countries around the world in the eu two of our pyrethroid insecticide products bifenthrin and zetacypermethrin will be considered for inclusion on the official list of euapproved active ingredients in 2009 in january 2009 we were informed that the standing committee voted in favor of including zetacypermethrin on the official list bifenthrin has not yet been put on the agenda for decision by the standing committee we expect to have a final decision from the commission on these products by the end of 2009 

specialty chemicals 

 

 revenue of 7645 million increased 16 percent versus the prior year period of which four percent was the result of revenue from the two acquisitions that closed in the third quarter of 2008 excluding the effects of these acquisitions biopolymer revenues increased 14 percent on volume growth particularly in food and personal care and price increases to partially offset rising input costs lithium revenues increased eight percent versus the prior period where volumes particularly in primary compounds and specialty organics have increased 

  

segment operating profit of 1520 million was seven percent higher than the prior year price increases were offset by rising raw material and energy costs particularly for seaweed and wood pulp during the period of 413 million to a lesser extent the introduction of export taxes in argentina in 2008 also reduced operating profits 

in 2009 we expect fullyear revenue growth in the high single digits as result of strong commercial performance in biopolymer and the full year inclusion of the isp and coliving acquisitions fullyear segment operating profit growth of approximately 510 percent is expected driven by higher sales partially offset by higher raw material and energy costs 

industrial chemicals 

 

 revenue of 12969 million increased 19 percent versus the prior year period alkali revenues increased 16 percent periodoverperiod primarily due to higher pricing soda ash volumes were up marginally peroxygen revenues periodoverperiod were higher by six percent with higher pricing being partially offset by volume declines in the fourth quarter due to the economic downturn foret revenues periodoverperiod were higher by 31 percent due mainly to higher pricing for phosphates the effect of a stronger euro and improved electricity selling prices foret operates electricity cogeneration facilities and sells excess electricity into the spanish electrical grid 

segment operating profit of 2014 million was 118 percent higher than the prior period higher pricing in alkali and foret more than offset the increase in raw materials particularly for phosphate rock for the segment of 546 million period over period 

for 2009 we expect fullyear revenue to be level compared to prior year as higher selling prices are offset by lower volumes and unfavorable currency translation fullyear segment operating profit is expected to be flat to down 10 percent as the higher prices are more than offset by lower volumes and higher raw material and other input costs 

other results of operations 

corporate expenses 

we recorded charges of 498 million in 2008 compared to 523 million in 2007 the decrease was primarily due to reduced legal costs associated with the legal settlement with solutia that occurred in 2007 corporate expenses are included as a component of the line item “selling general and administrative expenses” on our consolidated statements of income 

other income expense net 

other income expense net is comprised primarily of lifo inventory adjustments and pension expense other expense was 86 million in expense in 2008 compared to 120 million in expense in 2007 this decrease was primarily due to the mark to market impact of our deferred compensation liability reduced incentive accruals lower pension expense partially offset by a charge related to lifo inventory reserves other income expense net is included as a component of the line item “costs of sales and services” on our consolidated statements of income

we recorded a provision of 1254 million in 2008 compared with a provision of 290 million in 2007 resulting in effective tax rates of 276 percent and 156 percent respectively the change in the effective tax rate is primarily a result of a change in the mix of domestic income compared to income earned outside the us income we earn domestically in typically taxed at rates higher than income earned outside the us the mix of domestic income was impacted by significantly lower baltimore restructuring charges incurred during 2008 compared to 2007 the effective tax rates were also impacted by tax adjustments recorded during 2008 and 2007 these tax adjustments are described below 

2008 tax adjustments were favorable in the amount of 87 million and primarily result from a benefit to adjust our reserve for unrecognized tax benefits due to favorable conclusions to tax audits partially offsetting this benefit are charges associated with adjustments for prior years’ tax matters 

2007 tax adjustments were favorable in the amount of 154 million and primarily include tax benefits related to the reversal of certain tax valuation allowances these valuation allowances were no longer necessary because of our expectation that the related deferred tax assets were likely to be realized partially offsetting these valuation adjustments were charges associated with adjustments for prior years’ tax matters

discontinued operations net of income tax totaled a loss of 249 million in 2008 versus a loss of 243 million in 2007 the 2008 loss is primarily related to environmental charges associated with our front royal and middleport sites and charges for legal reserves and expenses related to discontinued operations discontinued environmental and legal charges include environmental remediation costs at sites of discontinued businesses for which we are responsible for environmental compliance the 2007 loss is primarily related to environmental charges associated with our middleport front royal and modesto sites and charges for legal reserves and expenses related to discontinued operations 

net income 

net income increased to 3046 million in 2008 compared with 1324 million in 2007 primarily due to higher profits in all three of our segments and significantly reduced restructuring and other charges income

segment operating profit was 2070 million an increase of 38 percent from the year earlier as a result of the higher revenue and favorable product mix selling and distribution costs increased 163 million to support the higher revenues additionally higher energy and raw materials costs were offset by continued global supply chain productivity improvements 

specialty chemicals

charge in 2006 these tax adjustments are described below the change in effective rates is also a result of the mix of domestic income compared to income earned outside the us and the european commission fine of €25 million 30 million at thenprevailing exchange rates incurred in 2006 that was nondeductible for tax purposes in 2006

net income increased to 1324 million in 2007 compared with 1313 million in 2006 and was primarily attributable to higher earnings in our agricultural products and specialty chemicals segments mostly offset by higher restructuring and other charges income due to the baltimore facility shut down 

liquidity and capital resources 

domestic credit agreement 

on august 28 2007 we executed a new credit agreement the “domestic credit agreement” which provided for a fiveyear 600 million revolving credit facility the proceeds from this facility are available for general corporate purposes including issuing letters of credit up to a 300 million sublimit the domestic credit agreement also contains an option under which subject to certain conditions we may request an increase in the facility to 1 billion 

there were no borrowings under the new facility at inception and our prior credit agreement dated as of june 21 2005 was terminated obligations under the prior credit agreement and related transaction costs fees and expenses for the new agreement were paid with available cash loans under the new facility bear interest at a floating rate either a base rate as defined or the applicable euro currency rate for the relevant term plus an applicable margin the margin is 035 percent per year subject to adjustment based on the credit rating assigned to our senior unsecured debt at december 31 2008 the applicable borrowing rates under our domestic credit agreement ranged from 082 to 325 percent per annum 

european credit agreement 

on december 16 2005 our dutch finance subsidiary executed a credit agreement the “european credit agreement” which provides for an unsecured revolving credit facility in the amount of €220 million borrowings may be denominated in euros or us dollars fmc and our dutch finance subsidiary’s direct parent provide guarantees of amounts due under the european credit agreement 

  

loans under the european credit agreement bear interest at a euro currency base rate which for loans denominated in euros is the euro interbank offered rate and for loans denominated in dollars is london interbank offered rate “libor” in each case plus a margin the applicable margin under our european credit agreement is subject to adjustment based on the rating assigned to fmc by each of moody’s and sp at december 31 2008 the applicable margin was 035 percent and the applicable borrowing rates under the european credit agreement ranged from 306 to 564 percent per annum 

among other restrictions the domestic credit agreement and the european credit agreement contain financial covenants applicable to fmc and its consolidated subsidiaries related to leverage measured as the ratio of debt to adjusted earnings and interest coverage measured as the ratio of adjusted earnings to interest expense our actual leverage for the year ended december 31 2008 was 10 which is within the maximum leverage of 35 our actual interest coverage for the year ended december 31 2008 was 200 which is within the minimum interest coverage of 35 we were in compliance with all covenants at december 31 2008 

at december 31 2008 and 2007 we had 1572 million and 1717 million in us dollar equivalent revolving credit facility borrowings under the european credit agreement resulting in available funds of 1502 million and 1471 million respectively 

we had 2030 million in borrowings under our domestic credit agreement at december 31 2008 compared to no borrowings at december 31 2007 letters of credit outstanding under the domestic credit agreement totaled 1515 million and 1469 million at december 31 2008 and 2007 respectively available funds under the domestic credit agreement were 2455 million at december 31 2008 and 4531 million at december 31 2007 

cash and cash equivalents at december 31 2008 and 2007 were 524 million and 755 million respectively we had total debt of 6236 million and 5452 million at december 31 2008 and 2007 respectively this included 5929 million and 4196 million of longterm debt excluding current portions of 21 million and 777 million at december 31 2008 and 2007 respectively shortterm debt which consists of foreign borrowings decreased to 286 million at december 31 2008 compared to 479 million at december 31 2007 the 977 million increase in total longterm debt at december 31 2008 from december 31 2007 was primarily due to increased borrowing under the domestic credit agreement 

statement of cash flows 

cash provided by operating activities was 3574 million for 2008 compared to 3147 million for 2007 and 3072 million for 2006 the increase in cash provided by operating activities in 2008 compared to 2007 reflected higher earnings from continuing operations excluding noncash items partially offset by an increase in working capital to support our higher trading activities the more significant noncash items included with our earnings include depreciation and amortization restructuring and other charges income and deferred income taxes receivables increased as a result of stronger year over year sales in all of our businesses and particularly in our agricultural products business in brazil where payment terms are generally longer than in our other businesses in addition sales activity of the recent acquisition of isp in the third quarter of 2008 added 12 million to our receivables at december 31 2008 our collections experience for all businesses during the year has with limited exceptions shown no deterioration year over year inventories increased to support the needs of our higher trading activities and as a result of the higher energy and raw material costs particularly for phosphate rock accounts payable increased mainly as a result of the higher inventory levels and the increased cost of raw materials the net remaining change in the other working capital items primarily represents timing associated with a number of miscellaneous accruals and prepaid expenses as well as higher spending for asset retirement obligations 

the increase in cash provided by operating activities in 2007 compared to 2006 reflected higher earnings from continuing operations excluding noncash items partially offset by an increase in working capital to support 

  

our higher trading activities the more significant noncash items included with our earnings include depreciation and amortization restructuring and other charges income and deferred income taxes receivables increased as a result of stronger year over year sales in all of our businesses and particularly in our agricultural products business in brazil where terms are generally longer than in our other businesses inventories increased to support the needs of our higher trading activities and for temporary buffer stocks to manage the transition of the supply chain in agricultural products from our baltimore plant which was in the processes of being shutdown to third party contract manufacturers accounts payable increased mainly as a result of the higher inventory levels 

cash required by operating activities of discontinued operations was 498 million for 2008 compared to cash required of 451 million and 432 million in 2007 and 2006 respectively the change in 2008 compared to 2007 was due to increased environmental spending for discontinued sites in 2008 the change in 2007 compared to 2006 was due to the absence of proceeds from the sale of land in san jose california partially offset by lower discontinued operations environmental spending the majority of the spending for our discontinued operations was for environmental remediation on discontinued sites discontinued environmental spending was 322 million in 2008 compared to 224 million in 2007 and 441 million in 2006 

cash required by investing activities for 2008 was 1917 million compared to cash required by investing activities of 1206 million in 2007 and cash required by investing activities of 1098 in 2006 the increase in cash required in 2008 was driven primarily by our net acquisition spending of 906 million and an increase in our capital expenditure spending primarily in our industrial chemicals segment partially offset by proceeds from the sale of the princeton property of 594 million and the sale of sodium sulfate assets of 167 million the increase in cash required in 2007 was a result of lower proceeds from the sales of investments and assets held for sale and an increase in other investing activities which represents increases to longterm deferred costs 

cash required by financing activities for 2008 was 1375 million compared to cash required by financing activities of 2434 million in 2007 and cash required by financing activities of 1985 million in 2006 the change in 2008 compared to 2007 was due primarily to increased borrowings under our committed credit facilities partially offset by higher repayments of longterm debt and repurchases of common stock the increase in 2007 compared to 2006 was primarily due to higher repurchases of common stock and lower proceeds from the issuances of common stock which primarily represent cash received from the exercise of stock options 

for the years ended december 31 2007 and 2006 we contributed approximately 2000 and 470000 shares of treasury stock to our employee benefit plans having a cost of 01 million and 173 million respectively which is considered a noncash activity we had no such comparable activity in the year ended december 31 2008 

other potential liquidity needs 

our cash needs for 2009 include operating cash requirements capital expenditures scheduled mandatory payments of longterm debt dividend payments contributions to our pension plans environmental spending and restructuring we plan to meet our liquidity needs through available cash cash generated from operations and borrowings under our committed revolving credit facilities we continually evaluate our options for divesting real estate holdings and property plant and equipment that are no longer integral to any of our core operating businesses 

projected 2009 capital expenditures are expected to be consistent with 2008 levels 

projected 2009 spending includes approximately 312 million of net environmental remediation spending this spending does not include expected spending of approximately 154 million in 2009 on capital projects relating to environmental control facilities also we expect to spend approximately 245 million in 2009 for environmental compliance costs which we will include as a component of costs of sales and services in our consolidated statements of income since these amounts are not covered by established reserves capital spending to expand maintain or replace equipment at our production facilities may trigger requirements for upgrading our environmental controls which may increase our spending for environmental controls above the foregoing projections 

  

during 2008 the world equity markets were down significantly exemplified by the sp 500 index in the us being down 37 percent our us qualified defined benefit pension plan “us plan” assets fell from 8294 million at december 31 2007 to  5639 million at december 31 2008 our us plan assets comprise approximately 93 percent of our total plan assets with the difference representing plan assets related to foreign pension plans we have reduced our expected return on our us plan assets from 875 percent in 2008 to 85 percent in 2009 in developing the assumption for the longterm rate of return on assets for our us plan we take into consideration the technical analysis performed by our outside actuaries including historical market returns information on the assumption for longterm real returns by asset class inflation assumptions and expectations for standard deviation related to these best estimates we also consider the historical performance of our own plan’s trust which has earned a compound annual rate of return of approximately 951 percent over the last 20 years which is in excess of comparable market indices for the same period as well as other factors given an actively managed investment portfolio the expected annual rates of return by asset class for our portfolio using geometric averaging and after being adjusted for an estimated inflation rate of approximately 275 percent is between 875 percent and 1075 percent for equities and between 425 percent and 775 percent for fixedincome investments which generates a total expected portfolio return that is in line with our assumptions for the rate of return on assets this lower expected return on plan assets along with decreased assets and the amortization of actuarial losses primarily associated with the equity market decline in 2008 are estimated to increase our net periodic benefit costs by approximately 57 million during 2009 compared to 2008 under the pension protection act of 2006 we are not required to make a minimum level of funding into the us plan during 2009 however in order to reduce future funding volatility we intend to contribute 75 million in 2009 versus 30 million contributed in 2008 and 2007 we do not believe that the additional contribution will have a significant negative impact on our current and future liquidity needs however a continuation of the volatility of interest rates and negative equity returns under current market conditions may require greater contributions to the plan in the future 

in april 2008 the board of directors approved a quarterly cash dividend of 0125 per share this represents an increase of 002 above our previous rate of 0105 per share we declared dividends aggregating 357 million to our shareholders of record during the year 2008 and 91 million of this amount is included in “accrued and other liabilities” on the consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2008 

in april 2007 the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to 250 million of our common stock in october 2008 the board authorized the repurchase of up to an additional 250 million of our common stock although the repurchase program does not include a specific timetable or price targets and may be suspended or terminated at any time we expect that the program will be accomplished over a twoyear period shares may be purchased through open market or privately negotiated transactions at the discretion of management based on its evaluation of market conditions and other factors we also reacquire shares from time to time in connection with the vesting and exercise of awards under our equity compensation plans during the twelve months ended december 31 2008 we repurchased 3503914 of our shares at an aggregate cost of 1852 million under the publicly announced program 

commitments 

in 2001 we split fmc into separate chemical and machinery companies and we refer to the spunoff company fmc technologies inc as “technologies” throughout this annual report we agreed to guarantee the performance by technologies of a debt instrument see note 18 to the consolidated financial statements in this form 10k as of december 31 2008 these guaranteed obligations totaled 08 million compared to 16 million at december 31 2007 

we guarantee repayment of some of the borrowings of certain foreign subsidiaries accounted for using the equity method the other equity owners provide parallel agreements we also guarantee the repayment of a borrowing of a minority equity holder in a foreign subsidiary that we consolidate in our financial statements as of december 31 2008 and 2007 these guarantees had maximum potential payments of 68 million and 69 million respectively 

  

we also provide guarantees to financial institutions on behalf of certain agricultural product customers principally in brazil for their seasonal borrowing the total of these guarantees was 203 million and 297 million at december 31 2008 and 2007 respectively and are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets for each date as “guarantees of vendor financing” 

shortterm debt consisted of foreign credit lines at december 31 2008 and december 31 2007 we provide parentcompany guarantees to lending institutions providing credit to our foreign subsidiaries 

in connection with our property and asset sales and divestitures we have agreed to indemnify the buyer for certain liabilities including environmental contamination and taxes that occurred prior to the date of sale our indemnification obligations with respect to these liabilities may be indefinite as to duration and may or may not be subject to a deductible minimum claim amount or cap as such it is not possible for us to predict the likelihood that a claim will be made or to make a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential loss or range of loss if triggered we may be able to recover certain of the indemnity payments from third parties we have not recorded any specific liabilities for these guarantees 

we spun off fmc technologies inc “technologies” in 2001 at this time we entered into a tax sharing agreement wherein each company is obligated for those taxes associated with its respective business generally determined as if each company filed its own consolidated combined or unitary tax returns for any period where technologies is included in the consolidated combined or unitary tax return of us or our subsidiaries the statute of limitations for the 2001 us federal income tax year has now closed and no questions regarding the spinoff were raised during the irs audit for 20002001 therefore any liability for taxes if the spinoff of technologies were not tax free due to an action taken by technologies has been favorably concluded the tax sharing agreement continues to be in force with respect to certain items which we do not believe would have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

our total significant committed contracts that we believe will affect cash over the next four years and beyond are as follows 

 

  

      

  contingencies 

on january 28 2005 we and our wholly owned subsidiary foret received a statement of objections from the european commission concerning alleged violations of competition law in the hydrogen peroxide business in europe during the period 1994 to 2001 all of the significant european hydrogen peroxide producers also received the statement of objections we and foret responded to the statement of objections in april 2005 and a hearing on the matter was held at the end of june 2005 on may 3 2006 we received a notice from the european commission indicating that the commission had imposed a fine on us and foret in the aggregate amount of €250 million as a result of alleged violations during the period 19971999 in connection with this fine we recorded an expense of 300 million reflecting thenprevailing exchange rates in our consolidated statements of income for the year ended december 31 2006 this expense was included as a component of restructuring and other charges income since we are not required to make the payment during the appeal process which may extend beyond one year the liability has been classified as longterm in the consolidated balance sheets as of december 31 2008 and 2007 both we and foret have appealed the decision of the commission during the appeal process interest accrues on the fine at a rate which as of december 31 2008 was 40 percent per annum we have provided a bank letter of credit in favor of the european commission to guarantee our payment of the fine and accrued interest at december 31 2008 the amount of the letter of credit was €282 million us 394 million 

in 2004 we also received a subpoena for documents from a grand jury sitting in the northern district of california which is investigating anticompetitive conduct in the hydrogen peroxide business in the united states during the period 1994 through 2003 we have since learned that degussa ag was a leniency applicant in the investigation and that solvay sa and akzo nobel chemicals international bv have pled guilty to sherman act violations during the period july 1 1998 through december 1 2001 on december 29 2008 we received notice from the department of justice that it has closed the investigation without filing charges against fmc 

in connection with these two matters in february 2005 putative class action complaints were filed against six us hydrogen peroxide producers and certain of their foreign affiliates in various federal courts alleging violations of antitrust laws federal law provides that persons who have been injured by violations of federal antitrust law may recover three times their actual damage plus attorney fees related cases were also filed in various state courts all of the federal court cases were consolidated in the united states district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania philadelphia the district court certified the class in january 2007 on december 30 2008 the court of appeals vacated the class certification order and remanded the case for further proceedings in the district court shortly thereafter fmc reached an agreement in principle to settle with the class for 10 million subject to final documentation and approval by the court this amount was included as a component of “restructuring and other charges income” in our consolidated statements of income for the year ended december 31 2008 the court has already finally approved settlements with four of the six original defendant groups who collectively paid approximately 90 million seventeen companies predominantly paper producers have opted out of certain of the settlements with other defendants certain of the defendants in the class action have settled those opt out claims for undisclosed amounts six of the 17 opt outs have filed suit against fmc and foret in the united states district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania and one has sued fmc as well as two other producers these cases have been assigned to the same judge as the class action two other opt out cases have been pending for some time against fmc and other hydrogen peroxide producers and in august of 2008 foret was added as a defendant to these cases the stay of all these actions entered by the 

  

district court during the class certification appeal remains in place most of the state court cases have been dismissed although some remain in california in addition putative class actions have been filed in provincial courts in ontario quebec and british columbia under the laws of canada a motion for class certification is pending 

another antitrust class action previously brought in federal court in the eastern district of pennsylvania alleging violations of antitrust laws involving our microcrystalline cellulose product was settled for 250 million the same amount paid by our codefendant asahi kasei corporation the court approved this settlement in november 2006 the claims of plaintiffs who opted out of the class settlement were also settled late in 2006 for 07 million the above amounts for 2006 have been reflected in “restructuring and other charges” in our consolidated statement of income for the year ended december 31 2006 the parties have also reached an agreement to settle a related state court case pending in california for a total for 25 million with the company and asahi kasei each contributing 125 million this settlement was approved by the california state court in november 2007 a third related state class action against fmc in tennessee state court has been settled for 05 million this settlement was approved by the tennessee state court in november 2008 the above amounts for 2007 have been reflected in “restructuring and other charges income” in our consolidated statements of income for the year ended december 31 2007 

we have certain other contingent liabilities arising from litigation claims performance guarantees and other commitments incident to the ordinary course of business based on information currently available and established reserves the ultimate resolution of our known contingencies including the matters described in note 18 to our consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or liquidity however there can be no assurance that the outcome of these contingencies will be favorable and adverse results in certain of these contingencies could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or liquidity  

recently adopted and issued accounting pronouncements and regulatory items 

see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k 

critical accounting policies 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses we have described our accounting policies in note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k we have reviewed these accounting policies identifying those that we believe to be critical to the preparation and understanding of our consolidated financial statements we have reviewed with the audit committee those accounting policies that we have deemed critical these policies are central to our presentation of results of operations and financial condition and require management to make estimates and judgments on certain matters we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience current conditions and other reasonable factors 

environmental obligations 

we provide for environmentalrelated obligations when they are probable and amounts can be reasonably estimated where the available information is sufficient to estimate the amount of liability that estimate has been used where the information is only sufficient to establish a range of probable liability and no point within the range is more likely than any other the lower end of the range has been used 

estimated obligations to remediate sites that involve oversight by the environmental protection agency epa or similar government agencies are generally accrued no later than when a record of decision rod or equivalent is issued or upon completion of a remedial investigationfeasibility study rifs that is submitted 

  

by us to the appropriate government agency or agencies estimates are reviewed quarterly by our environmental remediation management as well as by financial and legal management and if necessary adjusted as additional information becomes available the estimates can change substantially as additional information becomes available regarding the nature or extent of site contamination required remediation methods and other actions by or against governmental agencies or private parties 

our environmental liabilities for continuing and discontinued operations are principally for costs associated with the remediation andor study of sites at which we are alleged to have disposed of hazardous substances such costs principally include among other items rifs site remediation costs of operation and maintenance of the remediation plan fees to outside law firms and consultants for work related to the environmental effort and future monitoring costs estimated site liabilities are determined based upon existing remediation laws and technologies specific site consultants’ engineering studies or by extrapolating experience with environmental issues at comparable sites 

included in the environmental reserve balance other assets and reasonably possible loss contingencies for 2008 are potentially recoverable amounts from third party insurance policies and some of these amounts have been recognized as offsetting recoveries in 2008 

provisions for environmental costs are reflected in income net of probable and estimable recoveries from named potentially responsible parties prps or other third parties such provisions incorporate inflation and are not discounted to their present values 

in calculating and evaluating the adequacy of our environmental reserves we have taken into account the joint and several liability imposed by comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla and the analogous state laws on all prps and have considered the identity and financial condition of each of the other prps at each site to the extent possible we have also considered the identity and financial condition of other third parties from whom recovery is anticipated as well as the status of our claims against such parties although we are unable to forecast the ultimate contributions of prps and other third parties with absolute certainty the degree of uncertainty with respect to each party is taken into account when determining the environmental reserve by adjusting the reserve to reflect the facts and circumstances on a sitebysite basis our liability includes our best estimate of the costs expected to be paid before the consideration of any potential recoveries from third parties we believe that any recorded recoveries related to prps are realizable in all material respects recoveries are recorded as either an offset in “environmental liabilities continuing and discontinued” or as “other assets” in our consolidated balance sheets 

impairments and valuation of longlived assets 

our longlived assets include property plant and equipment and longterm investments goodwill and intangible assets we test for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the net book value of these assets may not be recoverable from the estimated undiscounted expected future cash flows expected to result from their use and eventual disposition in cases where the estimated undiscounted expected future cash flows are less than net book value an impairment loss is recognized equal to the amount by which the net book value exceeds the estimated fair value of assets which is based on discounted cash flows at the lowest level determinable the estimated cash flows reflect our assumptions about selling prices volumes costs and market conditions over a reasonable period of time 

we perform an annual impairment test of goodwill in the third quarter the assumptions used to estimate fair value include our best estimate of future growth rates discount rates and market conditions over a reasonable period we performed this test in 2008 and determined that no impairment charge was required 

  

pensions and other postretirement benefits 

we provide qualified and nonqualified defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans as well as postretirement health care and life insurance benefit plans to our employees the costs benefits and obligations related to these benefits reflect key assumptions related to general economic conditions including interest discount rates healthcare cost trend rates expected rates of return on plan assets and the rates of compensation increases for employees the costs benefits and obligations for these benefit programs are also affected by other assumptions such as average retirement age mortality employee turnover and plan participation to the extent our plans’ actual experience as influenced by changing economic and financial market conditions or by changes to our own plans’ demographics differs from these assumptions the costs and obligations for providing these benefits as well as the plans’ funding requirements could increase or decrease when actual results differ from our assumptions the difference is typically recognized over future periods in addition the unrealized gains and losses related to our pension and postretirement benefit obligations may also affect periodic benefit costs benefits in future periods 

we use certain calculated values of assets under methods both to estimate the expected rate of return on assets component of pension cost and to calculate our plans’ funding requirements the expected rate of return on plan assets is based on a marketrelated value of assets that recognizes investment gains and losses over a fiveyear period we use an actuarial value of assets to determine our plans’ funding requirements the actuarial value of assets must be within a certain range high or low of the actual market value of assets and is adjusted accordingly 

we recorded 69 million 115 million and 151 million of net annual pension and other postretirement benefit cost in 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively 

we are required to recognize in our consolidated balance sheet the total underfunded status of our defined benefit postretirement plans the underfunded status is defined as the difference between the fair value of the plan assets and the projected benefit obligation at december 31 2008 and 2007 our net underfunded status recorded on our consolidated balance sheets was 3762 million and 1106 million respectively 

we made voluntary cash contributions to our us qualified pension plan of 300 million in both 2008 and 2007 in addition we paid nonqualified pension benefits from company assets of 58 million and 30 million for 2008 and 2007 respectively we paid other postretirement benefits net of participant contributions of 47 million in both 2008 and 2007 our estimated cash contributions for 2009 include approximately 61 million in nonqualified pension benefits 41 million in other postretirement benefits and we plan to make voluntary cash contributions to our us qualified pension plan of approximately 75 million 

we select the discount rate used to calculate pension and other postretirement obligations based on a review of available yields on highquality corporate bonds including moody’s investors service inc “moody’s” aarated corporate and industrial bond indices in selecting the discount rate for 2008 we placed particular emphasis on a yieldcurve approach designed by our actuary to derive an appropriate discount rate for computing the present value of the future cash flows associated with our pension and other postretirement obligations taking into consideration both the timing and amount of the cash flows the specific interest rates supporting the yield curve were derived from calculated returns yields from a portfolio of highquality aagraded or higher bond investments constructed by our actuary 

in developing the assumption for the longterm rate of return on assets for our us plan we take into consideration the technical analysis performed by our outside actuaries including historical market returns information on the assumption for longterm real returns by asset class inflation assumptions and expectations for standard deviation related to these best estimates we also consider the historical performance of our own plan’s trust which has earned a compound annual rate of return of approximately 951 percent over the last 20 years which is in excess of comparable market indices for the same period as well as other factors given an 

  

actively managed investment portfolio the expected annual rates of return by asset class for our portfolio using geometric averaging and after being adjusted for an estimated inflation rate of approximately 275 percent is between 875 percent and 1075 percent for equities and between 425 percent and 775 percent for fixedincome investments which generates a total expected portfolio return that is in line with our assumption for the rate of return on assets we continually monitor the appropriateness of this rate in light of current market conditions for the sensitivity of our pension costs to incremental changes in assumptions see our discussion below 

sensitivity analysis related to key pension and postretirement benefit assumptions 

a onehalf percent increase in the assumed discount rate would have decreased pension and other postretirement benefit obligations by 454 million at december 31 2008 and 525 million at december 31 2007 and decreased pension and other postretirement benefit costs by 05 million 37 million and 52 million for 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively a onehalf percent decrease in the assumed discount rate would have increased pension and other postretirement benefit obligations by 497 million at december 31 2008 and 577 million at december 31 2007 and increased pension and other postretirement benefit net periodic benefit cost by 05 million 61 million and 59 million for 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively 

a onehalf percent increase in the assumed expected longterm rate of return on plan assets would have decreased pension costs by 42 million 40 million and 36 million for 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively a onehalf percent decrease in the assumed longterm rate of return on plan assets would have increased pension costs by 42 million 40 million and 36 million for 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively 

further details on our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and net periodic benefit costs benefits are found in note 13 to our consolidated financial statements in this form 10k 

income taxes 

we have recorded a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized in assessing the need for this allowance we have considered a number of factors including future income the jurisdictions in which such income is earned and our ongoing tax planning strategies in the event that we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period such determination was made similarly should we conclude that we would be able to realize certain deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase income in the period such determination was made at december 31 2008 and 2007 the valuation allowance was 553 million and 651 million respectively 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we do not have any significant offbalance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition changes in financial condition revenues or expenses results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors 

dividends 

in april 2008 the board of directors approved a quarterly cash dividend of 0125 per share this represents an increase of 002 above our previous rate of 0105 per share we declared dividends aggregating 357 million to our shareholders of record during the year 2008 and 91 million of this amount is included in “accrued and other liabilities” on the consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2008 total cash dividends of 344 million 297 million and 210 million were paid in 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend our earnings cash flows and financial position are exposed to market risks relating to fluctuations in commodity prices interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates our policy is to minimize exposure to our cash flow over time caused by changes in commodity interest and currency exchange rates to accomplish this we have implemented a controlled program of risk management consisting of appropriate derivative contracts entered into with major financial institutions 

the analysis below presents the sensitivity of the market value of our financial instruments to selected changes in market rates and prices the range of changes chosen reflects our view of changes that are reasonably possible over a oneyear period marketvalue estimates are based on the present value of projected future cash flows considering the market rates and prices chosen we calculate the market value foreign currency risk using thirdparty software incorporating standard pricing models to determine the present value of the instruments based on market conditions spot and forward foreign exchange rates as of the valuation date we obtain estimates of the market value energy price risk from calculations performed internally and by a third party 

at december 31 2008 our net financial instrument position was a net liability of 399 million compared to a net liability of 32 million at december 31 2007 the change in the net financial instrument position was primarily due to higher unrealized losses in our commodity and foreign exchange portfolios 

commodity price risk 

energy costs are approximately 13 percent of our costs of sales and services and are well balanced among coal electricity and natural gas we attempt to mitigate our exposure to increasing energy costs by hedging the cost of future deliveries of natural gas and by entering into fixedprice contracts for the purchase of coal and fuel oil to analyze the effect of changing energy prices we have performed a sensitivity analysis in which we assume an instantaneous 10 percent change in energy market prices from their levels at december 31 2008 and december 31 2007 with all other variables including interest rates held constant a 10 percent increase in energy market prices would result in a decrease of the net liability position of 76 million at december 31 2008 compared to a 97 million decrease in the net liability position at december 31 2007 as a result at december 31 2007 the net liability position would have become a net asset position a 10 percent decrease in energy market prices would result in an increase of 76 million in the net liability position at december 31 2008 compared to an increase of 97 million in the net liability position at december 31 2007 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

the primary currencies for which we have exchange rate exposure are the us dollar versus the euro the us dollar versus the chinese yuan and the us dollar versus the brazilian real foreign currency debt and foreign exchange forward contracts are used in countries where we do business thereby reducing our net asset exposure foreign exchange forward contracts are also used to hedge firm and highly anticipated foreign currency cash flows 

to analyze the effects of changing foreign currency rates we have performed a sensitivity analysis in which we assume an instantaneous 10 percent change in the foreign currency exchange rates from their levels at december 31 2008 and december 31 2007 with all other variables including interest rates held constant a 10 percent strengthening of hedged currencies versus our functional currencies would have resulted in an increase of 109 million in the net liability position at december 31 2008 a 10 percent strengthening of hedged currencies versus our functional currencies would have resulted in an increase of 176 million in the net liability position at december 31 2007 a 10 percent weakening of hedged currencies versus our functional currencies would have resulted in a decrease of 118 million in the net liability position at december 31 2008 compared to a decrease of 176 million in the net liability position at december 31 2007 as a result at december 31 2007 the net liability position would have become a net asset position 

  

interest rate risk 

one of the strategies that we can use to manage interest rate exposure is to enter into interest rate swap agreements in these agreements we agree to exchange at specified intervals the difference between fixed and variable interest amounts calculated on an agreedupon notional principal amount as of december 31 2008 and december 31 2007 we had no interest rate swap agreements 

our debt portfolio at december 31 2008 is composed of 33 percent fixedrate debt and 67 percent variablerate debt the variablerate component of our debt portfolio principally consists of borrowings under our domestic and european credit agreements variablerate industrial and pollution control revenue bonds and amounts outstanding under foreign subsidiary credit lines changes in interest rates affect different portions of our variablerate debt portfolio in different ways 

based on the variablerate debt in our debt portfolio at december 31 2008 a one percentage point increase or decrease in interest rates then in effect would have increased or decreased gross interest expense for 2008 by 42 million

 item 1 business tableend general 

we are a diversified global chemical company providing innovative solutions applications and marketleading products to a wide variety of markets we operate in three distinct business segments agricultural products specialty chemicals and industrial chemicals our agricultural products segment primarily focuses on insecticides which are used in agriculture to enhance crop yield and quality by controlling a broad spectrum of pests and in pest control for nonagricultural applications and on herbicides which are used to reduce the need for manual or mechanical weeding by inhibiting or preventing weed growth specialty chemicals consists of our biopolymer and lithium businesses and focuses on food ingredients that are used to enhance texture structure and physical stability pharmaceutical additives for binding encapsulation and disintegrant applications ultrapure biopolymers for medical devices and lithium specialties for pharmaceutical synthesis specialty polymers and energy storage our industrial chemicals segment manufactures a wide range of inorganic materials including soda ash hydrogen peroxide specialty peroxygens and phosphorus chemicals 

the following table shows the principal products produced by our three business segments and their raw materials and uses 

 

   

 we have operations in many areas around the world with a worldwide manufacturing and distribution infrastructure we are able to respond rapidly to global customer needs offset downward economic trends in one region with positive trends in another and better match revenues to local costs to mitigate the impact of currency volatility the charts below detail our sales and longlived assets by major geographic region 

 

 our strategy 

our corporate strategy is balanced between driving growth and innovation within our specialty chemicals and agricultural products segments and generating strong cash flow in our industrial chemicals segment our longterm objectives are as follows 

realize the operating leverage inherent in our businesses we intend to maximize earnings growth and return on capital by maintaining or enhancing our market positions reducing costs and prudently managing our asset base in soda ash we continually strive to optimize our proprietary and lowcost solution mining and longwall mining techniques thereby reducing our production costs which we believe are already the lowest in the industry in foret we have selectively shut down higher cost production capacity to improve profitability these initiatives have positioned our industrial chemicals business to profitably benefit from higher capacity utilization rates in agricultural products we began to phase out operations at our baltimore maryland facility as part of our ongoing program to reduce manufacturing costs by producing our products andor intermediates in lowercost locations agricultural products also benefits from its efforts to continually streamline its supply chain and reduce logistics costs 

  

maintain strategic and financial flexibility going forward we expect continued sustained growth in our operating profit and resulting cash provided by operating activities furthermore our businesses will meet future expected demand growth through a combination of debottlenecking current production restarting mothballed capacity and sourcing from third parties lastly we continue to explore asset sale opportunities in the second quarter of 2006 we entered into an agreement with the princeton healthcare system to sell the fmc research center facility in princeton new jersey this sale is expected to close in the first half of 2008 we intend to reinvest a portion of these proceeds into new more cost efficient research facilities for our agricultural products and specialty chemicals businesses 

focus the portfolio on higher growth businesses our goal is to achieve the highest overall growth while continuing to generate returns above our cost of capital in this regard we intend to focus on building upon our core franchises in the food ingredient pharmaceutical energy storage crop protection and nonagricultural pest control markets that exist within the specialty chemicals and agricultural products segments internal development will continue to be a core element of our growth strategy our biopolymer business is developing new pharmaceutical delivery systems and ultrapure biopolymers for medical devices and working closely with top global food companies in the development of new health and convenience foods our lithium business is developing applications for energy storage markets to serve the rapid growth in global demand for handheld electronic devices our agricultural products business is testing proprietary product differentiating technologies which could improve the biological efficacy andor the cost competitiveness of existing and new chemistries thereby potentially enhancing those products’ market acceptance and value to endusers product or business acquisitions inlicensing alliances and equity ventures are strategic options to enhance our technology offerings broaden our market access and extend our geographic footprint each growth opportunity will be evaluated in the context of continued value creation for our shareholders including the degree to which the opportunity complements one of our existing franchises generates substantial synergies and are accretive to earnings in addition we intend to divest any business that cannot sustain a return above its cost of capital 

financial information about our business segments 

see note 19 to our consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k also see below for selected financial information related to our segments 

agricultural products 

financial information in millions 

 

   

overview 

our agricultural products segment which represents approximately 34 percent of our 2007 consolidated revenues develops manufactures and sells a portfolio of crop protection professional pest control and lawn and garden products our innovation and growth efforts focus on developing environmentally compatible solutions that can effectively increase farmers’ yields and provide more costeffective alternatives to older chemistries to which insects or weeds may have developed resistance over the last several years we restructured and redeployed our rd resources to focus our innovation efforts towards accelerating the delivery of new products and productivityenhancing technologies to our customers our goal is to shorten the innovation cycle and provide quicker payback on development and technology spending 

we differentiate ourselves by our focused strategy in selected products crops and markets coupled with our lowcost manufacturing strategy we are continually working to gain access to proprietary chemistries and technologies from third parties which are complementary to our existing products and market focus we are encouraged by our progress in licensing and partnering to create proprietary products developing technically advanced delivery systems and commercializing unique product premixes and combinations we are optimistic that these efforts will continue to result in sales and profit growth over the next few years 

products and markets 

 

 agricultural products provides a wide range of proprietary branded products—based on both patented and offpatent technologies—for global crop protection professional pest control and lawn and garden markets product branding is a prevalent industry practice used to help maintain and grow market share by promoting enduser recognition and product and supplier reputation agricultural products enjoys relatively strong niche positions in crop and noncrop market segments in the americas europe and other parts of the world and derived approximately 78 percent of its revenue from outside north america in 2007 

insecticides represent the majority of our sales in the agricultural products segment particularly pyrethroid and carbamate chemistries in which we maintain leading market positions based on revenues pyrethroids are a major class of insecticides whose efficient application rates and cost competitiveness are differentiated compared to most other classes of insecticides they are most effective against worm pests carbamates are broad spectrum insecticides used to control a wide variety of pests in both soil and foliar applications our proprietary herbicides have grown significantly over the last several years our herbicide portfolio primarily targets niche uses and controls a wide variety of difficulttocontrol weeds we are also selectively evaluating opportunities to enhance our market position in fungicides so that we can broaden our portfolio across the three major pesticide categories ie insecticides herbicides and fungicides 

  

the following table summarizes the principal product chemistries in agricultural products and the principal uses of each chemistry 

 

 over the last several years we have entered into a number of key agreements with thirdparty pesticide producers under which we work together to develop market andor distribute existing and new pesticide chemistries in various markets these proprietary chemistries and technologies are complementary to our existing products and market strategies the chemistries include flonicamid a unique insecticide for controlling sucking pests cyazofamid a novel fungicide for crop and noncrop uses in the americas and acetamiprid for pest control markets in north america we also have numerous supply and access agreements with thirdparty producers for other pesticide products including the commercialization of proprietary premixes and combinations 

we access the market in key western european markets through the belgianbased pesticide distribution company belchim crop protection nv in which we have an ownership interest we also have joint venture arrangements with nufarm limited in several key countries in eastern europe which should allow us to capitalize on anticipated growth in this part of europe in north america we access the market through several major national and regional distributors and recently strengthened our access capabilities by signing a longterm distribution agreement with nufarm to market and sell a number of proprietary chemistries in canada through these and other alliances along with our own targeted marketing efforts and access to novel technologies we expect to enhance our access in key agricultural and noncrop markets and develop new products that will help us continue to compete effectively 

we maintain competitive manufacturing cost positions through our strategy of sourcing raw materials intermediates and finished products from third parties in lowercost manufacturing countries such as china india and mexico we are in the ninth year of implementing this lowcost manufacturing strategy this strategy has resulted in significant cost savings and lower capital spending and has reduced the fixed capital intensity of the business in june 2007 we implemented the next stage of this strategy with the decision to phase out operations of our baltimore maryland manufacturing facility by the end of the first quarter of 2008 this initiative will produce additional annual cost savings of approximately 25 million to 30 million which is expected to be fully realized in fiscal year 2009 

growth 

we plan to grow by obtaining new and approved uses for existing product lines and acquiring accessing developing marketing distributing andor selling complementary chemistries andor related technologies from third parties in order to enhance our current product portfolio and our capabilities to effectively service our target 

  

markets and customers our growth will depend on our ability to deliver unique innovative solutions to our customers at an accelerating rate over the next several years growth is anticipated from our proprietary insecticides and herbicides and newlyaccessed third party chemistries andor technologies for our proprietary insecticides we launched a number of new products expanded labels andor unique formulations that deliver valueadding solutions to our customers the emergence and spread of herbicideresistant weeds and shifts in weed populations coupled with several newly launched product formulations expanded labels and premixes provide growth opportunities for our proprietary herbicide chemistries 

industry overview 

the three principal categories of agricultural chemicals are herbicides representing approximately half of global industry revenue insecticides representing approximately a quarter of global industry revenue and fungicides representing most of the remaining portion of global industry revenue 

insecticides are used to control a wide range of insects including chewing pests such as caterpillars and sucking pests such as aphids insecticides are applied as sprays dusts or granules and are used on a wide variety of crops such as fruits vegetables cotton soybean maize and cereals there are several major classes of insecticide chemistries including organophosphates carbamates pyrethroids and neonicotinoids 

herbicides prevent or inhibit weed growth thereby reducing or eliminating the need for manual or mechanical weeding herbicides can be selective controlling only specific unwanted vegetation or nonselective controlling all vegetation and are also segmented by their time of application preplanting preemergent and postemergent 

fungicides prevent or inhibit the spread of plant disease which can adversely impact crop yields and quality fungicides are used on a wide variety of crops such as fruits vegetables soybean cereals and rice 

the agrochemicals industry has undergone significant consolidation over the past ten years leading crop protection companies syngenta ag bayer ag monsanto company basf ag the dow chemical company and e i du pont de nemours and company dupont currently represent approximately 70 percent of the industry’s global sales significant drivers for this consolidation have been the growth and grower acceptance of biotechnology employed in row crops and the escalation of research and development and marketing costs 

the next tier of agrochemical producers including fmc makhteshimagan industries ltd sumitomo chemical company limited ishihara sangyo kaisha nufarm limited arysta lifescience and cheminova as employ various differentiated strategies and compete by 1 unique technologies 2 focusing on certain crops markets and geographies andor 3 competitive pricing based on lowcost manufacturing positions some of these producers are generic competitors with little or no investment in innovation there is a growing trend among these producers to partner with one another to gain economies of scale and competitive market access more comparable to larger competitors additionally a number of these companies have grown rapidly through acquisition of other companies andor product divestitures from the leading crop protection companies

 industry overview 

food ingredients 

our biopolymer business serves the texture structure and physical stability tsps food ingredients market tsps ingredients impart physical properties to thicken and stabilize foods there are many types of tsps ingredients and a wide range of food groups served including bakery meats dairy and convenience products the industry is dispersed geographically with the majority of our sales in europe north america and asia 

trends driving market growth include increasing consumer interest in healthier foods greater convenience and growth in per capita consumption of processed foods in emerging markets the trend toward health and convenience drives the need for more functional ingredients to impart desired food tastes and textures we believe carrageenan and mcc which address this need are growing faster than the overall tsps market the global customer base for tsps is relatively fragmented and includes large and small food processors consolidation among these customers has been a significant trend over the past several years as a result tsps ingredient suppliers such as us have focused on establishing alliances with market leaders with the goal of reducing costs leveraging technology and expanding product offerings with key accounts 

within the entire food ingredients market there are a relatively large number of suppliers due principally to the broad spectrum of chemistries employed segment leadership global position and investment in technology are key factors to sustaining profitability in addition larger suppliers may often provide a broader product line and a range of services to food companies including functional systems or blends the top suppliers of tsps ingredients include fmc danisco as dupont jm huber kerry ingredients cargill incorporated dgf stoess ag and tate  lyle plc 

  

pharmaceutical chemicals 

our biopolymer business sells into the formulation chemicals segment of the pharmaceutical market the major end markets for formulation chemicals include coatings and colors fillers binders sweeteners and flavors disintegrants and others 

competitors tend to be grouped by chemistry our principal mcc competitors in pharmaceuticals include j rettenmaier  sôhne gmbh ming tai chemical co ltd asahi kasei corporation and blanver farmoquimica ltda while pricing pressure from low cost producers is a common competitive dynamic companies like us offset that pressure by providing the most reliable and broadest range of products and services our customers are pharmaceutical firms who depend upon reliable therapeutic performance of their drug products

industrial chemicals 

financial information in millions 

 

   

overview 

our industrial chemicals segment which represents 41 percent of our 2007 consolidated revenues has lowcost positions in high volume inorganic chemicals including soda ash and hydrogen peroxide complemented by high value niche positions in specialty alkali phosphorus and peroxygen products 

products and markets 

 industrial chemicals serves a diverse group of markets from economicallysensitive industrial sectors to technologyintensive specialty markets we process and sell refined inorganic products that are sought by customers for their critical reactivity or specific functionality in markets such as glass detergents and pulp and paper in addition we produce purify and market higher value downstream derivatives into specialized and customerspecific applications these applications include electronics biocides and animal nutrition 

alkali 

our alkali chemical division produces natural soda ash soda ash is used by manufacturers in glass chemical processing and detergent industries to lesser degrees we also produce sodium bicarbonate caustic soda and sodium sesquicarbonate the majority of our alkali sales are manufactured by and sold through fmc wyoming corporation which we manage as an integral part of our alkali business and in which we own shares representing an 875 percent economic interest with the remaining shares held by two japanese companies 

we mine and produce natural soda ash using proprietary lowcost mining technologies such as longwall and solution mining which we believe give us the lowest cost position our two production sites in green river wyoming have the capacity to produce approximately 485 million tons of soda ash annually with approximately eight hundred thousand tons of this capacity currently mothballed at december 31 2007 for the past several years the us soda ash industry was essentially sold out as a result of this condition during 2005 and 2006 we restarted 500000 tons of previously mothballed capacity to meet the increase in demand driven by the growth in export markets on february 8 2008 we announced the recomissioning of the remaining mothballed capacity in green river wyoming we expect the additional capacity to be fully online by 2012 the initial volume increase will be above 100000 tons per year starting in 2009 and the remaining capacity approximately 700000 tons per year will be commissioned in increments over the next three to four years depending on export growth 

  

peroxygens 

we produce hydrogen peroxide at production facilities in the united states canada and mexico and as described below through our whollyowned foret subsidiary in spain and the netherlands we also participate in a joint venture company in thailand we sell hydrogen peroxide into the pulp and paper industry and to a lesser extent in the chemical processing environmental electronics and food industries we are a leading north american producer of hydrogen peroxide due in part to our broad product line geographicallyadvantaged plant locations stateoftheart processing technology and superior customer service hydrogen peroxide represents approximately 70 percent of our peroxygens sales 

our specialty peroxygens business supplies persulfate products primarily to polymer and printed circuit board markets and peracetic acid predominantly to the food industry for biocidal applications typically we compete as a specialty player where we believe that we are differentiated by our strong technical expertise unique process technology and geographic location 

foret 

our european subsidiary fmc foret sa “foret” headquartered near barcelona spain is a leading provider of chemical products to the detergent paper textile mining and chemical industries foret operates seven manufacturing facilities across europe including one mine with market positions in phosphates hydrogen peroxide perborates percarbonates sulfur derivatives zeolites silicates and sodium sulfate foret’s sales efforts are focused in europe africa and the middle east and in south america mainly via tripoliven our venezuelan jointventure in which foret holds a minority participation 

in february 2008 we completed the sale of foret’s sodium sulfate assets 

industry overview 

we primarily participate in three product areas soda ash peroxygens and phosphorus chemicals these products are generally inorganic and are generally commodities that in many cases have few costeffective substitutes growth is typically a function of gdp in developed markets or the rate of industrialization in key export markets pricing tends to reflect the shortterm supply and demand balance as producers add or reduce capacity in response to demand changes 

soda ash 

soda ash is a highly alkaline inorganic chemical essential in the production of glass and widely used in the production of chemicals soaps and detergents and many other products natural soda ash is typically produced from trona a natural form of sodium sesquicarbonate through mining and chemical processing soda ash may also be produced synthetically but this process requires a significant amount of energy and produces large quantities of waste byproducts making it much less costeffective than natural soda ash production 

because of the processing cost advantages of trona and the large natural reserves of trona in the us particularly in green river wyoming all us soda ash is naturally produced by contrast due to a lack of trona the majority of the soda ash that is manufactured in the rest of the world is produced synthetically other us producers are oci chemical corporation solvay sa the general chemical group inc and searles valley minerals which was acquired by nirma limited in november 2007 

approximately 46 percent of us soda ash production served export markets in 2007 with approximately 29 percent of us soda ash production exported through the american natural soda ash corporation “ansac” ansac is the foreign sales association of the significant us soda ash producers established in 1983 under the webbpomerene act and subsequent legislation since its creation ansac has been successful in coordinating soda ash exports exploiting the inherent cost benefits of us produced natural soda ash and 

  

leveraging its large scale of operations to the benefit of its member companies consequently us exports of soda ash have risen significantly over the last 20 years 

peroxygens 

hydrogen peroxide is typically sold for use as a bleach or oxidizer as such it often competes with other chemicals capable of performing similar functions some of our specialty peroxygen derivatives eg persulfates perborates percarbonates also function as bleaching or oxidizing agents environmental regulations regional cost differences primarily due to transportation costs and technical differences in product performance factor into the decision to use hydrogen peroxide or one of its derivatives rather than another product since these considerations vary by region the consumption patterns vary in different parts of the world hydrogen peroxide is sold in aqueous solutions usually 35 percent 50 percent or 70 percent by weight 

the north american pulp and paper industry represents approximately 70 percent of north american demand for hydrogen peroxide in this market hydrogen peroxide is used as an environmentally friendly bleaching agent to brighten chemical mechanical and recycled pulps as well as treat a wide range of mill pollutants in the waste stream the north american paper market is mature and new investment in pulp and paper capacity is largely focused in asia and south america the other north american hydrogen peroxide producers are akzo nobel nv arkema inc evonik industries kemira ovj and solvay sa 

phosphorous chemicals 

we participate in this business in europe the middle east africa and south america through foret major competitors include thermphos international bv prayon rupel sa and various chinese producers 

phosphorous chemicals are used in many industrial applications in a wide array of chemical compounds overall growth in demand for phosphorous chemicals tends to correlate with gdp purified phosphoric acid ppa and phosphate salts eg sodium phosphates and calcium phosphates are sold into many markets including detergents cleaning compounds and animal feed 

the basic input material for making phosphates is now produced using two processes most industrial applications use the costeffective process that involves making ppa by the purification of fertilizergrade phosphoric acid thermal phosphoric acid long the industry standard is produced from elemental phosphorus but is more costly due to energy and environmental compliance costs and is now used in limited applications elemental phosphorus is still produced by thermphos in the netherlands and in several other countries including china 

over the next few years industrial demand for phosphorous chemicals is expected to grow driven by growing demand in the detergent industry in newly industrializing nations 

source and availability of raw materials 

our raw material requirements vary by business segment and include mineralrelated natural resources trona ore and lithium brines processed chemicals seaweed specialty wood pulps and energy sources such as oil gas coal and electricity raw materials represented approximately 28 percent of our 2007 cost of sales and services and no one raw material represented more than 8 percent of our total raw material purchases 

ores used in industrial chemicals manufacturing processes are extracted by us from mines eg trona in north america or are purchased from others eg phosphorous rock raw materials used by specialty chemicals include lithium brines various types of seaweed that are sourced on a global basis and specialty pulps which are purchased from selected global producers raw materials used by agricultural products primarily processed chemicals are obtained from a variety of suppliers worldwide 

  

patents 

we own a number of us and foreign patents trademarks and licenses that are cumulatively important to our business we do not believe that the loss of any one or group of related patents trademarks or licenses would have a material adverse effect on the overall business of fmc the duration of our patents depends on their respective jurisdictions their expiration dates range through 2027 

seasonality 

the seasonal nature of the crop protection market and the geographic spread of the agricultural products business can result in significant variations in quarterly earnings agricultural products sold into the northern hemisphere north america europe and parts of asia serve seasonal agricultural markets from march through september generally resulting in earnings in the first second and third quarters markets in the southern hemisphere latin america and parts of the asia pacific region including australia are served from july through february generally resulting in earnings in the third fourth and first quarters the remainder of our businesses is generally not subject to significant seasonal fluctuations 

competition 

we have a number one or number two market position in many of our product lines based on revenue either globally or in north america largely as a result of our product offerings proprietary technologies and our position as a lowcost producer the following product lines accounted for the majority of our 2007 consolidated revenue market positions are based on the most recently available revenue data 

 

  

 we encounter substantial competition in each of our three business segments this competition is expected to continue in both the united states and markets outside of the united states we market our products through our own sales organization and through alliance partners independent distributors and sales representatives the number of our principal competitors varies from segment to segment in general we compete by operating in a costefficient manner and by leveraging our industry experience to provide advanced technology high product quality and reliability and quality customer and technical service 

our agricultural products segment competes primarily in the global chemical crop protection market for insecticides herbicides and fungicides the industry is characterized by a relatively small number of large competitors and a large number of smaller often regional competitors industry products include crop protection chemicals and for certain major competitors genetically engineered crop biotechnology products competition from generic producers has increased as a significant number of product patents held industrywide have expired in the last decade in general we compete as an innovator by focusing on product development including novel formulations proprietary mixes and advanced delivery systems and by acquiring or licensing mostly proprietary chemistries or technologies that complement our product and geographic focus we also differentiate ourselves by our global costcompetitiveness via our manufacturing strategies establishing effective product stewardship programs and developing strategic alliances that strengthen market access in key countries and regions 

with significant positions in markets that include alginate carrageenan microcrystalline cellulose and lithiumbased products specialty chemicals competes on the basis of product differentiation market 

  

applications expertise customer service and price biopolymer competes with both direct suppliers of cellulose and seaweed extract as well as suppliers of other hydrocolloids which may provide similar functionality in specific applications in microcrystalline cellulose competitors are typically smaller than us while in seaweed extracts alginates we compete with other broadbased chemical companies we and each of our two most significant competitors in lithium extract the element from naturally occurring lithiumrich brines located in the andes mountains of argentina and chile which are believed to be the world’s most significant and lowest cost sources of lithium 

industrial chemicals serves the soda ash markets worldwide the peroxygens markets predominantly in north america and europe and the phosphorus markets in europe the middle east and latin america in north america our soda ash business competes with four domestic producers of natural soda ash three of which operate in the vicinity of our mine and processing facilities in green river wyoming outside of the us canada and europe we sell soda ash mainly through ansac internationally our natural soda ash competes with synthetic soda ash manufactured by numerous producers ranging from integrated multinational companies to smaller regional companies we maintain a leading position in the north american market for hydrogen peroxide there are currently five other firms competing in the hydrogen peroxide market in north america the primary competitive factor affecting the sales of soda ash and hydrogen peroxide is price we seek to maintain our competitive position by employing low cost processing technology at foret we possess strong cost and market positions in phosphates percarbonate peroxygens zeolites silicates and sulfur derivatives in each of these markets we face significant competition from a range of multinational and regional chemical producers competition in phosphorus chemicals is based primarily on price and to a lesser degree product differentiation 

research and development expense 

we perform research and development in all of our segments with the majority of our efforts focused in the agricultural products segment the product development efforts in the agricultural products segment focus on developing environmentally sound solutions and new product formulations that costeffectively increase farmers’ yields and provide alternatives to insectresistant chemistries in 2006 we restructured and redeployed our agricultural products new chemistry discovery spending to focus our innovation efforts on delivering valueadding solutions more quickly to our customers this shift in strategy should result in a shorter innovation cycle for the segment our research and development expenses in the last three years are set forth below 

 

 environmental laws and regulations 

we are subject to various federal state local and foreign environmental laws and regulations that govern emissions of air pollutants discharges of water pollutants and the manufacture storage handling and disposal of hazardous substances hazardous wastes and other toxic materials and remediation of contaminated sites we are also subject to liabilities arising under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla and similar state laws that impose responsibility on persons who arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances and on current and previous owners and operators of a facility for the cleanup of hazardous substances released from the facility into the environment in addition we are subject to liabilities under the resource conservation and recovery act rcra and analogous state laws that require owners and operators of facilities that treat store or dispose of hazardous waste to follow certain waste management practices and to clean up releases of hazardous substances into the environment associated with past or present practices 

  

we have been named a potentially responsible party prp at 30 sites on the federal government’s national priorities list npl at which our potential liability has not yet been settled in addition we also have received notice from the epa or other regulatory agencies that we may be a prp or prp equivalent at other sites including 39 sites at which we have determined that it is reasonably possible that we have environmental liability in cooperation with appropriate government agencies we are currently participating in or have participated in a remedial investigationfeasibility study rifs or its equivalent at most of the identified sites with the status of each investigation varying from site to site at certain sites a rifs has only recently begun providing limited information if any relating to cost estimates timing or the involvement of other prps whereas at other sites the studies are complete remedial action plans have been chosen or a record of decision rod has been issued 

environmental liabilities include obligations relating to waste handling and the remediation andor study of sites at which we are alleged to have released or disposed of hazardous substances these sites include current operations previously operated sites and sites associated with discontinued operations we have provided reserves for potential environmental obligations that we consider probable and for which a reasonable estimate of the obligation can be made as of december 31 2007 our net environmental reserve was 1698 million compared to 1672 million at december 31 2006 we have recorded recoveries representing probable realization of claims against insurance companies us government agencies and other third parties of 354 million and 370 million respectively at december 31 2007 and 2006 the recoveries at december 31 2007 are recorded as either an offset to the “environmental liabilities continuing and discontinued” totaling 188 million or as “other assets” totaling 166 million in our consolidated balance sheets the recoveries at december 31 2006 are recorded as either an offset to the “environmental liabilities continuing and discontinued” totaling 224 million or as “other assets” totaling 146 million in our consolidated balance sheets in addition we have estimated that reasonably possible environmental loss contingencies may exceed amounts accrued by approximately 75 million at december 31 2007 

employees 

we employ approximately 5000 people with approximately 2600 people in our domestic operations and 2400 people in our foreign operations approximately 34 percent of our usbased employees and 39 percent of our foreignbased employees are represented by collective bargaining agreements we have successfully concluded virtually all of our recent contract negotiations without a work stoppage in those rare instances where a work stoppage has occurred there has been no material effect on consolidated sales and earnings we cannot predict however the outcome of future contract negotiations in 2008 we have four collectivebargaining agreements expiring these contracts affect approximately 2 percent of usbased employees and 10 percent of foreignbased employees

 item 3 legal proceedings tableend like hundreds of other industrial companies we have been named as one of many defendants in asbestosrelated personal injury litigation these cases most cases involve between 25 and 200 defendants allege personal injury or death resulting from exposure to asbestos in premises of fmc or to asbestoscontaining components installed in machinery or equipment manufactured or sold by discontinued operations the machinery and equipment businesses we owned or operated did not fabricate the asbestoscontaining component parts at issue in the litigation and to this day neither the us occupational safety and health administration nor the epa has banned the use of these components further the asbestoscontaining materials were housed inside of machinery and equipment and accessible only at the time of infrequent repair and maintenance therefore we believe that overall the claims against fmc are without merit and consider ourselves to be a peripheral defendant in these matters indeed the bulk of the claims against us to date have been dismissed without payment 

as of december 31 2007 there were approximately 29000 premises and product asbestos claims pending against fmc in several jurisdictions to date we have had discharged approximately 75000 asbestos claims against fmc the overwhelming majority of which have been dismissed without any payment to the plaintiff settlements by us with claimants to date have totaled approximately 177 million 

we intend to continue managing these cases in accordance with our historical experience we have established a reserve for this litigation and believe that the outcome of these cases will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or liquidity 

in late june 2004 we were served in a lawsuit captioned “lewis et al v fmc corporation” which was filed in united states district court for the western district of new york the suit was brought by thirteen residents of middleport new york who allege that we violated certain state and federal environmental laws and seeks injunctive relief and monetary damages for personal injuries and property damage in connection with such alleged violations we believe this suit is without merit 

we have certain other contingent liabilities arising from litigation claims performance guarantees and other commitments incident to the ordinary course of business based on information currently available and established reserves the ultimate resolution of our known contingencies including the matters described in note 18 to the consolidated financial statements in this form 10k is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or liquidity however there can be no assurance that the outcome of these 

  

contingencies will be favorable and adverse results in certain of these contingencies could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or liquidity

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend overview 

we are a diversified global chemical company providing innovative solutions and applications to a wide variety of end markets we operate in three business segments agricultural products specialty chemicals and industrial chemicals agricultural products’ principal focus is on insecticides which are used to enhance crop yield and quality by controlling a wide spectrum of pests and on herbicides which are used to reduce the need for manual or mechanical weeding by inhibiting or preventing weed growth specialty chemicals consists of our biopolymer and lithium businesses and focuses on food ingredients that are used to enhance texture structure and physical stability pharmaceutical additives for binding and disintegrant use and lithium specialties for pharmaceutical synthesis specialty polymers and energy storage our industrial chemicals segment manufactures a wide range of inorganic materials including soda ash peroxygens and phosphorus chemicals 

2007 highlights 

2007 was a year in which we experienced continued sales growth in all of our business segments consolidated revenue of 26329 million was up 122 percent from the prior year agricultural products specialty chemicals and industrial chemicals had revenue increases of 16 percent 11 percent and 10 percent respectively we also had strong performance across most of our business segments for the year ended december 31 2007 segment operating profit as presented in note 19 to the consolidated financial statements in this form 10k increased 210 percent for the year ended december 31 2007 compared to the prior period we continue to be impacted by higher energy costs and higher raw material costs included in our net income were various restructuring and other income and charges which are described in more detail below under “results of operations” our segment results for the year ended december 31 2007 were impacted in particular by the following 

 

  

  

 2008 outlook 

in 2008 we expect continued growth in our revenue and earnings the increase in revenue is expected to be driven by higher selling prices for soda ash higher volumes in biopolymer and lithium higher selling prices in biopolymer and in agricultural products a healthy global agribusiness economy new product introductions and increased demand for biofuels the increase in earnings is expected to be driven by sales growth new product introductions and further supply chain productivity improvements in agricultural products continued strong commercial performance in biopolymer and aggregate price and volume benefits in industrial chemicals higher raw material and energy costs are expected to partially offset our profit growth we expect cash flow generation from our business segments to remain strong 

  

critical accounting policies 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses we have described our accounting policies in note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k we have reviewed these accounting policies identifying those that we believe to be critical to the preparation and understanding of our consolidated financial statements we have reviewed with the audit committee those accounting policies that we have deemed critical these policies are central to our presentation of results of operations and financial condition and require management to make estimates and judgments on certain matters we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience current conditions and other reasonable factors 

environmental obligations 

we provide for environmentalrelated obligations when they are probable and amounts can be reasonably estimated where the available information is sufficient to estimate the amount of liability that estimate has been used where the information is only sufficient to establish a range of probable liability and no point within the range is more likely than any other the lower end of the range has been used 

estimated obligations to remediate sites that involve oversight by the epa or similar government agencies are generally accrued no later than when a rod or equivalent is issued or upon completion of a rifs that is submitted by us to the appropriate government agency or agencies estimates are reviewed quarterly by our environmental remediation management as well as by financial and legal management and if necessary adjusted as additional information becomes available the estimates can change substantially as additional information becomes available regarding the nature or extent of site contamination required remediation methods and other actions by or against governmental agencies or private parties 

our environmental liabilities for continuing and discontinued operations are principally for costs associated with the remediation andor study of sites at which we are alleged to have disposed of hazardous substances such costs principally include among other items rifs site remediation costs of operation and maintenance of the remediation plan fees to outside law firms and consultants for work related to the environmental effort and future monitoring costs estimated site liabilities are determined based upon existing remediation laws and technologies specific site consultants’ engineering studies or by extrapolating experience with environmental issues at comparable sites 

included in the environmental reserve balance other assets and reasonably possible loss contingencies for 2007 are potentially recoverable amounts from third party insurance policies and some of these amounts have been recognized as offsetting recoveries in 2007 

provisions for environmental costs are reflected in income net of probable and estimable recoveries from named prps or other third parties such provisions incorporate inflation and are not discounted to their present values 

in calculating and evaluating the adequacy of our environmental reserves we have taken into account the joint and several liability imposed by cercla and the analogous state laws on all prps and have considered the identity and financial condition of each of the other prps at each site to the extent possible we have also considered the identity and financial condition of other third parties from whom recovery is anticipated as well as the status of our claims against such parties although we are unable to forecast the ultimate contributions of prps and other third parties with absolute certainty the degree of uncertainty with respect to each party is taken into account when determining the environmental reserve by adjusting the reserve to reflect the facts and circumstances on a sitebysite basis our liability includes our best estimate of the costs expected to be paid before the consideration of any potential recoveries from third parties we believe that any recorded recoveries related to prps are realizable in all material respects recoveries are recorded as either an offset in “environmental liabilities continuing and discontinued” or as “other assets” in our consolidated balance sheets 

  

impairments and valuation of longlived assets 

our longlived assets include property plant and equipment and longterm investments goodwill and intangible assets we test for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the net book value of these assets may not be recoverable from the estimated undiscounted expected future cash flows expected to result from their use and eventual disposition in cases where the estimated undiscounted expected future cash flows are less than net book value an impairment loss is recognized equal to the amount by which the net book value exceeds the estimated fair value of assets which is based on discounted cash flows at the lowest level determinable the estimated cash flows reflect our assumptions about selling prices volumes costs and market conditions over a reasonable period of time 

we prepare an annual impairment test of goodwill the assumptions used to estimate fair value include our best estimate of future growth rates discount rates and market conditions over a reasonable period we performed this test in 2007 and determined that no impairment charge was required 

pensions and other postretirement benefits 

we provide qualified and nonqualified defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans as well as postretirement health care and life insurance benefit plans to our employees effective july 1 2007 all of our newly hired and rehired salaried and nonunion hourly employees are no longer eligible for our defined benefit pension plans the costs benefits and obligations related to these benefits reflect key assumptions related to general economic conditions including interest discount rates healthcare cost trend rates expected rates of return on plan assets and the rates of compensation increases for employees the costs benefits and obligations for these benefit programs are also affected by other assumptions such as average retirement age mortality employee turnover and plan participation to the extent our plans’ actual experience as influenced by changing economic and financial market conditions or by changes to our own plans’ demographics differs from these assumptions the costs and obligations for providing these benefits as well as the plans’ funding requirements could increase or decrease when actual results differ from our assumptions the difference is typically recognized over future periods in addition the unrealized gains and losses related to our pension and postretirement benefit obligations may also affect periodic benefit costs benefits in future periods 

we use certain calculated values of assets under methods both to estimate the expected rate of return on assets component of pension cost and to calculate our plans’ funding requirements the expected rate of return on plan assets is based on a marketrelated value of assets that recognizes investment gains and losses over a fiveyear period we use an actuarial value of assets to determine our plans’ funding requirements the actuarial value of assets must be within a certain range high or low of the actual market value of assets and is adjusted accordingly 

we recorded 115 million 151 million and 106 million of net annual pension and other postretirement benefit cost in 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively 

as of december 31 2006 we adopted a new pension accounting standard see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements in this form 10k which required us to recognize in our consolidated balance sheet the total underfunded status of our defined benefit postretirement plans the underfunded status is defined as the difference between the fair value of the plan assets and the projected benefit obligation at december 31 2007 and 2006 our net underfunded status recorded on our consolidated balance sheets was 1106 million and 1402 million respectively 

we made voluntary cash contributions to our us qualified pension plan of 300 million in both 2007 and 2006 in addition we paid nonqualified pension benefits from company assets of 30 million and 27 million for 2007 and 2006 respectively we paid other postretirement benefits net of participant contributions of 47 million and 50 million for 2007 and 2006 respectively our estimated cash contributions for 2008 include approximately 30 million in nonqualified pension benefits 42 million in other postretirement benefits and we plan to make voluntary cash contributions to our us qualified pension plan of approximately 300 million 

  

we select the discount rate used to calculate pension and other postretirement obligations based on a review of available yields on highquality corporate bonds including moody’s investors service inc “moody’s” aarated corporate and industrial bond indices in selecting the discount rate for 2007 we placed particular emphasis on a yieldcurve approach designed by our actuary to derive an appropriate discount rate for computing the present value of the future cash flows associated with our pension and other postretirement obligations taking into consideration both the timing and amount of the cash flows the specific interest rates supporting the yield curve were derived from calculated returns yields from a portfolio of highquality aagraded or higher bond investments constructed by our actuary 

in developing the expected longterm rate of return on asset assumption for our plan we take into consideration the technical analysis performed by our outside actuaries including historical market returns information on longterm real return expectations by asset class inflation assumptions and expectations for standard deviation related to these best estimates we also consider the historical performance of our own plan’s trust which has earned a compound annual rate of return of approximately 95 percent over the last 10 years which is in excess of comparable market indices for the same period as well as other factors the current asset allocation for our plan is approximately 79 percent equities us and nonus 18 percent fixedincome and 3 percent cash and other shortterm investments given an actively managed investment portfolio the expected annual rates of return by asset class for our portfolio using geometric averaging and after being adjusted for an estimated inflation rate of approximately 3 percent is between 9 percent and 11 percent for both us and nonus equities and between 5 percent and 75 percent for fixedincome investments which generates a total expected portfolio return that is in line with our rate of return assumption we continually monitor the appropriateness of this rate in light of current market conditions for the sensitivity of our pension costs to incremental changes in assumptions see our discussion below 

sensitivity analysis related to key pension and postretirement benefit assumptions 

a onehalf percent increase in the assumed discount rate would have decreased pension and other postretirement benefit obligations by 525 million at december 31 2007 and 530 million at december 31 2006 and decreased pension and other postretirement benefit costs by 37 million 52 million and 30 million for 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively a onehalf percent decrease in the assumed discount rate would have increased pension and other postretirement benefit obligations by 577 million at december 31 2007 and 571 million at december 31 2006 and increased pension and other postretirement benefit net periodic benefit cost by 61 million 59 million and 56 million for 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively 

a onehalf percent increase in the assumed expected longterm rate of return on plan assets would have decreased pension costs by 40 million 36 million and 34 million for 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively a onehalf percent decrease in the assumed longterm rate of return on plan assets would have increased pension costs by 40 million 36 million and 34 million for 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively 

further details on our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and net periodic benefit costs benefits are found in note 13 to our consolidated financial statements in this form 10k 

income taxes 

we have recorded a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized in assessing the need for this allowance we have considered a number of factors including future income the jurisdictions in which such income is earned and our ongoing tax planning strategies in the event that we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period such determination was made similarly should we conclude that we would be able to realize certain deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase income in the period such determination was made at december 31 2007 and 2006 the valuation allowance was 651 million and 815 million respectively 

  

results of operations—2007 2006 and 2005 

overview 

 

  

  

      

  see “segment results” for a detailed discussion of events affecting our results for 2007 2006 and 2005 

results of operations—2007 compared to 2006 

in the following discussion “year” refers to the year ended december 31 2007 and “prior year” refers to the year ended december 31 2006 additionally in the discussion below please refer to our consolidated statements of income and our segment information from note 19 included in item 8 of this form 10k as well as the aftertax charges included in net income in the above table all comparisons are between the periods unless otherwise noted 

revenue for the year ended december 31 2007 was 26329 million an increase of 122 percent compared to the 23459 million recorded in the prior year period this increase was driven by higher sales in all of our segments which are discussed separately below 

inprocess research and development for the years ended december 31 2007 and 2006 was 20 million 12 million after tax and 20 million 12 million after tax respectively in the first quarter of 2007 our agricultural products segment acquired further rights for 10 million from a thirdparty company to develop a proprietary compound in the third quarter of 2007 our agricultural products segment entered into a collaboration and license agreement with a thirdparty company for the purpose of obtaining certain technology and intellectual property rights we paid an initial 10 million upon entering into this agreement 

for the year ended december 31 2006 our agricultural products segment entered into development agreements with a thirdparty company whereby we were given the right to develop further one of such party’s products in certain geographic markets for 20 million 

restructuring and other charges were 1629 million 1025 million aftertax in 2007 compared to 748 million 579 million aftertax in 2006 charges in this category for the year ended december 31 2007 primarily include the following 

 

    

  

  

  

  

 the restructuring and other charges of 748 million that we recorded in 2006 were primarily a result of the following 

 

  

  

  

  

 equity in earnings loss of affiliates was 25 million of earnings in 2007 which was essentially level with 23 million of earnings recorded in the prior year 

interest expense net increased to 349 million compared to 329 million in 2006 primarily due to a reduction in interest income caused by lower cash balances 

  

loss on extinguishment of debt was 03 million 02 million aftertax for the year ended december 31 2007 which represented losses related to the write off of certain deferred financing fees related to our previous credit agreement which was replaced in the third quarter of 2007 with our new domestic credit agreement we did not incur any comparable charge for the year ended december 31 2006 

provision for income taxes was 290 million in 2007 compared with 683 million in 2006 reflecting effective tax rates of 156 and 322 respectively the change in effective tax rates is the result of tax adjustments resulting in income in 2007 as opposed to tax adjustments resulting in expense in 2006 these tax adjustments are described below the change in effective rates is also a result of the mix of domestic income compared to income earned outside the us and the european commission fine of €25 million 30 million at thenprevailing exchange rates incurred in 2006 that was nondeductible for tax purposes in 2006 

2007 tax adjustments were favorable in the amount of 154 million and primarily include tax benefits related to the reversal of certain tax valuation allowances these valuation allowances are no longer necessary because of our expectation that the related deferred tax assets are now likely to be realized partially offsetting these valuation adjustments are charges associated with adjustments for prior year tax matters 

2006 tax adjustments were unfavorable in the amount of 125 million and primarily include charges associated with adjustments to deferred taxes 

discontinued operations net of income tax totaled a loss of 243 million in 2007 versus a loss of 128 million in 2006 the 2007 loss is primarily related to environmental charges associated with our middleport front royal and modesto sites and charges for legal reserves and expenses related to discontinued operations discontinued environmental and legal charges include environmental remediation costs at sites of discontinued businesses for which we are responsible for environmental compliance 

the 2006 loss includes net charges of 273 million related to environmental issues and legal reserves and expenses related to previously discontinued operations the charges in 2006 were primarily related to our front royal and middleport sites as well as to increase reserves for operating and maintenance activities offsetting these charges was a gain of 140 million from the sale of 23 acres real estate property in san jose california related to our former defense business this completed the sale of land that was formerly used by fmc’s defense business which was divested in 1997 

net income increased to 1324 million in 2007 compared with 1313 million in 2006 primarily attributable to changes in the aftertax items included in net income described above additionally net income in 2007 was favorably impacted by higher earnings in our agricultural products and specialty chemicals segments 

other financial data 

corporate expenses were 523 million in 2007 compared to 462 million in 2006 due to higher incentive compensation expenses 

other income expense net is comprised primarily of lifo inventory adjustments and pension expense other expense increased to 120 million in the year ended december 31 2007 compared to income of 30 million in the year ended december 31 2006 during 2006 inventory balances were reduced in the us due to liquidation of inventory quantities carried at lower costs as compared with the cost of 2006 purchases this resulted in income recorded in 2006 related to a decrease in lifo inventory reserves that did not repeat in 2007 

segment results 2007 compared to 2006 

information about how each of these items relates to our businesses at the segment level and results by segment are discussed below and in note 19 to our consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k 

  

agricultural products 

 

 revenue in agricultural products was 8897 million an increase of 16 percent versus the prior year higher sales were realized in all geographic regions but were particularly strong in brazil due to increased planted acres in other key crops and higher commodity prices sales growth in europe was driven by increased demand for biofuels crops new product introductions and the benefits of the stronger euro in asia sales increased due to better growing conditions in several countries 

segment operating profit was 2070 million an increase of 38 percent from the year earlier as a result of the higher sales and continued global supply chain productivity improvements which more than offset higher incremental selling and distribution costs due to the increased sales and higher energy and raw materials costs 

in 2008 fullyear revenue growth is expected to be up 510 percent as a result of a healthy global agricultural economy new product introductions and increased demand for biofuels fullyear segment operating profit is expected to increase approximately 1015 percent driven by the sales growth and further supply chain productivity improvements partially offset by higher raw material costs 

in our agricultural products segment several products are undergoing reregistration in the us and a comparable regulatory review by eu governmental authorities in august 2006 the us environmental protection agency issued its “interim reregistration eligibility decision” “ired” for our carbofuran insecticide the ired proposes cancellation of all carbofuran uses in the united states subject to a phase out period for certain minor crop uses fmc does not agree with the scientific analysis or conclusions in the ired in early february 2008 the epa convened a scientific advisory panel meeting to evaluate scientific issues relevant to a draft notice of intent to cancel carbofuran prepared by epa at this meeting epa and fmc presented their views on the relevant scientific assessments of carbofuran we are vigorously defending the us registration and have conducted new studies to address epa’s stated concerns we will undertake other appropriate actions to seek to maintain carbofuran as a registered product if epa chooses to issue a final notice of intent to cancel carbofuran after the scientific advisory panel reports its recommendations to epa fmc plans to challenge such decision by requesting review by an administrative law judge the outcomes of the scientific advisory panel meeting and any administrative hearing are uncertain fmc can continue to sell carbofuran in the united states at this time and through 2008 sales can continue through the duration of any administrative hearing—if a hearing takes place it is not expected to conclude before december 31 2008 

in november 2006 the eu commission’s standing committee on animal health and food chain voted not to include our carbofuran carbosulfan and cadusafos products on the official list of active ingredients approved for continued sale in the eu we believe the committee’s decision was based on a flawed underlying scientific review and we have initiated litigation against the european food safety authority in june 2007 the european commission published its decisions not to include carbofuran carbosulfan and cadusafos on the official list of active ingredients approved for continued sale in the european union the published decisions required eu member states to deregister the products within 6 months and so fmc ceased its sales of these products in december 2007 the commission decision requires that channel sales generally cease within 12 months afterwards we disagree with the commission and have initiated litigation in the european community courts seeking annulment of the carbofuran and carbosulfan decisions we have resubmitted cadusafos for approval on the official list and plan to resubmit carbofuran and carbosulfan in parallel with our litigation the outcome of these cases and our regulatory resubmissions is uncertain we currently anticipate that lost sales attributable to 

  

the cancellation of eu registrations for carbofuran carbosulfan and cadusafos will have a modest negative impact in this region over the next few years but we believe that growth in other products new registrations andor label expansions should offset such impact over time 

we intend to defend vigorously all our products in the us and eu regulatory processes several of fmc’s pesticide products will be reviewed in the ordinary course of regulatory programs during 2008 as part of the ongoing cycle of reregistration in countries around the world this will include eu review of two of our pyrethroid insecticide products 

specialty chemicals 

 

 revenue in specialty chemicals was 6595 million an increase of 11 percent versus the prior year driven by higher selling prices for primary lithium compounds and strong commercial performance in both pharmaceutical and food businesses in biopolymer 

segment operating profit of 1427 million increased 20 percent versus the prior year due to higher sales improved mix and continued productivity improvements which more than offset increased raw material costs 

in 2008 we expect fullyear revenue growth in the midsingle digits due to higher volumes across the segment and higher selling prices in biopolymer fullyear segment operating profit growth in the low single digits is expected as strong commercial performance in biopolymer and the benefit of continued productivity improvements are expected to be mitigated by lower selling prices for primary lithium compounds and higher export taxes in argentina 

industrial chemicals 

 

 revenue in industrial chemicals was 10871 million an increase of 10 percent versus the prior year as a result of higher selling prices for soda ash and volume growth across the segment 

segment operating profit of 925 million decreased 4 percent versus the prior year due to higher energy and raw material costs across the segment and lower electricity selling prices in spain in the first three quarters of the year where foret operates electricity cogeneration facilities and excess electricity is sold into the spanish electrical grid these higher costs more than offset the positive impact of higher sales 

for 2008 we expect fullyear revenue growth of 510 percent as a result of higher volumes and selling prices across all businesses particularly in soda ash fullyear segment operating profit is expected to be up 5560 percent as aggregate price and volume benefits and improved power market conditions in spain more than offset higher raw material costs 

  

a major factor affecting phosphorus products in foret in 2008 will be raw material costs particularly for phosphate rock where prices have increased dramatically versus 2007 we purchase phosphate rock in foret from morocco the escalation in phosphate rock prices has been driven by tight supply conditions we intend to recover these raw material cost increases in foret in the form of higher pricing 

results of operations—2006 compared to 2005 

in the following discussion “year” refers to the year ended december 31 2006 and “prior year” refers to the year ended december 31 2005 additionally in the discussion below please refer to our consolidated statements of income and our segment information from note 19 included in item 8 of this form 10k as well as the aftertax charges included in net income in the above table all comparisons are between the periods unless otherwise noted 

revenue for the year ended december 31 2006 was 23459 million an increase of 9 percent compared to the 21460 million recorded in the prior year period this increase was driven by higher sales in all of our segments which are discussed separately below 

inprocess research and development for the year ended december 31 2006 was 20 million 12 million after tax see previous discussion under “results of operations – 2007 compared to 2006” which describes “inprocess research and development” charges we did not incur any comparable charge for the year ended december 31 2005 

restructuring and other charges were 748 million 579 million aftertax in 2006 compared to 404 million 261 million aftertax in 2005 charges in this category for the year ended december 31 2006 are primarily related to the €25 million fine 30 million at thenprevailing exchange rates in our industrial chemicals segment the mcc legal settlements of 257 million in our specialty chemicals segment a 60 million charge for the abandonment of a building in our agricultural products segment and severance and asset abandonment charges of 52 million related to research and development redeployment in our agricultural products segment we also incurred 54 million of charges related to continuing environmental sites as a corporate charge 

the charges of 404 million we recorded for the year ended december 31 2005 primarily related to the 170 million for the closing of our carrageenan plant in copenhagen denmark in our specialty chemicals segment 54 million for the abandonment of certain assets in our agricultural products segment and 75 million for impairment and shutdown charges at our spring hill west virginia facility in our industrial chemicals segment we also incurred charges of 61 million at our pocatello site to increase reserves for demolition and other shutdown costs 

equity in earnings loss of affiliates was 23 million of earnings in 2006 versus 706 million of earnings in the prior year the significant decrease was primarily the result of our sale of astaris and substantially all of its assets in the fourth quarter of 2005 we recorded a gain from this sale of 577 million 217 million aftertax the decrease is also the result of income at astaris up to the date of the asset sale in 2005 

investment gains for the year ended december 31 2005 were due to the sale of our 50 equity method investment in sibelco we recorded a gain of 93 million 24 million aftertax in conjunction with this sale in our consolidated statement of income there were no gains from the sale of investments for the year ended december 31 2006 

interest expense net decreased to 329 million compared to 581 million in 2005 the decrease primarily reflected lower interest costs and debt levels in the year ended december 31 2006 compared to the prior year the decreases were due to our debt refinancing in june 2005 and the redemption of the 1025 percent senior notes in july 2005 

  

loss on extinguishment of debt was 605 million 374 million aftertax in 2005 in 2005 in connection with our industrial revenue bond refinancing we incurred an approximately 21 million loss and in connection with entering into the 2005 credit agreement we wrote off approximately 12 million of deferred financing fees associated with the previous agreement and 06 million of fees associated with the new agreement additionally in 2005 we incurred a loss of 566 million associated with the redemption of the 1025 percent senior notes 

provision for income taxes was 683 million in 2006 compared with 807 million in 2005 reflecting effective tax rates of 322 and 427 respectively the change was primarily due to higher tax adjustments in 2005 which include income taxes associated with the repatriations under the american jobs creation act ajca tax adjustments are described separately below offsetting this decrease was the effect on the tax provision in 2006 from having the 30 million european commission fine that is nondeductible for tax purposes excluding the effect of these tax adjustments and the nondeductibility of the european commission fine the change from 2005 to 2006 is primarily a result of the mix of domestic income compared to income earned outside of the us dividends received from foreign operations and valuation allowance adjustments 

2006 tax adjustments of 125 million primarily include charges associated with adjustments to deferred taxes 

2005 tax adjustments of 217 million primarily include charges of 319 million associated with repatriations net tax benefits of 192 million primarily related to agreement on certain prior year tax matters previously reserved and charges of 95 million associated with adjustments to deferred tax liabilities 

cumulative effect of change in accounting principle net of income tax on december 31 2005 we adopted fasb interpretation no 47 “accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations” the cumulative effect of adoption was a charge of 05 million in 2005 

discontinued operations net of income tax totaled a loss of 128 million in 2006 versus a gain of 61 million in 2005 the 2006 loss includes net charges of 273 million related to environmental issues and legal expenses related to previously discontinued operations discontinued environmental and legal charges include environmental remediation costs at sites of discontinued businesses for which we are responsible for environmental compliance the charges in 2006 were primarily related to our front royal and middleport sites as well as to increase reserves for operating and maintenance activities offsetting these charges was a gain of 140 million from the sale of 23 acres real estate property in san jose california related to our former defense business this completed the sale of land that was formerly used by fmc’s defense business which was divested in 1997 

the 2005 net gain included income of 292 million related to a sale to the city of san jose california of approximately 52 acres of land used by our former defense systems operations primarily offsetting this income in 2005 was net environmental and legal charges of 234 million the charges in 2005 were primarily related to our front royal and middleport sites and in recognition of our share of liabilities related to a consent order between the epa and the primary responsible parties at the anniston site 

net income increased to 1313 million in 2006 compared with 1140 million in 2005 primarily as a result of changes in the aftertax items included in net income described above the change in these items was the primary driver behind the increase in net income from 2005 to 2006 which was also due to higher earnings from our agricultural products specialty chemicals and industrial chemicals segments and a decrease in interest expense 

  

other financial data 

corporate expenses were 462 million in 2006 compared to 451 million in 2005 essentially level from the prior year 

other income and expense net decreased to 30 million from 139 million in the prior year due to a gain related to the settlement of certain energy contracts in 2005 which was not repeated in 2006 as well as higher pension expense and the recognition of stock option expense in 2006 offsetting these decreases was a gain recorded in 2006 related to a refund of previously submitted payroll taxes 

segment results 2006 compared to 2005 

information about how each of these items relates to our businesses at the segment level and results by segment are discussed below and in note 19 to our consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k 

agricultural products 

 

 revenue in agricultural products was 7659 million in 2006 an increase of 6 percent versus 2005 driven primarily by strong sales growth in latin america particularly in brazil as well as by higher sales in north america and in asia 

segment operating profit was 1499 million in 2006 an increase of 24 percent from the year earlier as a result of the higher sales and the favorable impact of supply chain productivity initiatives which more than offset the impact of generic bifenthrin competition higher raw material costs and increased spending associated with growth initiatives 

specialty chemicals 

 

 revenue in specialty chemicals was 5928 million in 2006 an increase of 6 percent versus 2005 driven by higher sales of primary lithium compounds and continued strength in biopolymer’s pharmaceutical business 

segment operating profit of 1188 million in 2006 increased 10 percent versus 2005 the sales gains improved results in biopolymer’s food ingredients business and the benefit of restructuring initiatives were partially offset by higher raw material costs and increased spending for growth initiatives 

  

industrial chemicals 

 

 revenue in industrial chemicals was 9909 million in 2006 an increase of 14 percent versus 2005 the soda ash business accounted for the majority of the increase due to significant improvements in both domestic and export soda ash selling prices and higher volumes north american hydrogen peroxide also benefited from higher selling prices and energy surcharges 

segment operating profit of 967 million increased 15 percent in 2006 versus 2005 driven by the sales gains offset in part by higher energy costs particularly for natural gas in spain higher raw material costs and the absence of earnings from astaris which was divested in november 2005 prior to its divestiture astaris contributed approximately 11 million of income in 2005

liquidity and capital resources 

domestic credit agreement refinancing 

on august 28 2007 we executed a new credit agreement the “domestic credit agreement” which provided for a fiveyear 600 million revolving credit facility the proceeds from this facility are available for general corporate purposes including issuing letters of credit up to a 300 million sublimit the domestic credit agreement also contains an option under which subject to certain conditions we may request an increase in the facility to 1 billion 

there were no borrowings under the new facility at inception and our prior credit agreement dated as of june 21 2005 was terminated at that time obligations under the prior credit agreement and related transaction costs fees and expenses for the new agreement were paid with available cash 

loans under the new facility bear interest at a floating rate either a base rate as defined or the applicable eurocurrency rate for the relevant term plus an applicable margin the initial margin is 035 percent per year subject to adjustment based on the credit rating assigned to our senior unsecured debt at december 31 2007 if we had borrowings under our domestic credit agreement then the applicable rate would have been 495 percent per annum 

in connection with entering into the domestic credit agreement we wrote off 03 million of deferred financing fees associated with our previous credit agreement these fees were previously a component of “other assets” in our consolidated balance sheet and were recorded as “loss on extinguishment of debt” in the consolidated statement of income for the year ended december 31 2007 

on february 21 2008 we entered into amendment no 1 to the domestic credit agreement the “amendment” among us certain of our subsidiaries each lender and issuing bank party thereto from time to time and citibank na as administrative agent for the lenders thereunder the amendment amends the domestic credit agreement by correcting minor technical flaws and conforming certain definitions to the european credit agreement described below 

  

european credit agreement 

on december 16 2005 our dutch finance subsidiary executed a credit agreement the “european credit agreement” which provides for an unsecured revolving credit facility in the amount of €220 million borrowings may be denominated in euros or us dollars fmc and our dutch finance subsidiary’s direct parent provide guarantees of amounts due under the european credit agreement 

loans under the european credit agreement bear interest at a eurocurrency base rate which for loans denominated in euros is the euro interbank offered rate and for loans denominated in dollars is london interbank offered rate “libor” in each case plus a margin the applicable margin under our european credit agreement is subject to adjustment based on the rating assigned to fmc by each of moody’s and sp at december 31 2007 the applicable margin was 035 percent and the applicable borrowing rate under the european credit agreement was 512 percent per annum 

on february 21 2008 our dutch finance subsidiary agreed upon an amendment and restatement of its european credit agreement with the bank lenders party thereto and citibank international plc as agent for the lenders to conform the representations warranties and covenants in the european credit agreement to those contained in the domestic credit agreement 

among other restrictions the domestic credit agreement and the european credit agreement contain financial covenants applicable to fmc and its consolidated subsidiaries related to leverage measured as the ratio of debt to adjusted earnings and interest coverage measured as the ratio of adjusted earnings to interest expense we were in compliance with all covenants at december 31 2007 

at december 31 2007 and 2006 we had 1717 and 1964 million in us dollar equivalent revolving credit facility borrowings under the european credit agreement resulting in available funds of 1471 million and 917 million respectively 

we had no borrowings under our domestic credit agreement at december 31 2007 and 2006 letters of credit outstanding under the domestic credit agreement totaled 1469 million and 1445 million at december 31 2007 and 2006 respectively available funds under the domestic credit agreement were 4531 million at december 31 2007 and 4555 million at december 31 2006 

cash and cash equivalents at december 31 2007 and 2006 were 755 million and 1655 million respectively we had total debt of 5452 million and 6297 million at december 31 2007 and 2006 respectively this included 4196 million and 5235 million of longterm debt excluding current portions of 777 million and 525 million at december 31 2007 and 2006 respectively shortterm debt which consists of foreign borrowings decreased to 479 million at december 31 2007 compared to 537 million at december 31 2006 the 787 million decrease in total longterm debt at december 31 2007 from december 31 2006 was primarily due to the scheduled repayment of a maturing mediumterm note and partial repayment of our european credit agreement offset by higher exchange rates for the euro against the us dollar 

statement of cash flows 

cash provided by operating activities was 3147 million for 2007 compared to 3072 million for 2006 and 1996 million for 2005 the increase in cash provided by operating activities in 2007 compared to 2006 reflected higher earnings from continuing operations offset by an increase in inventories and accounts receivable balances the increase in cash provided by operating activities in 2006 compared to 2005 reflected higher earnings from continuing operations and improved working capital management in inventories and accounts payable these were partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable balances 

  

cash required by operating activities of discontinued operations was 451 million for 2007 compared to cash required of 432 million and cash provided of 174 million in 2006 and 2005 respectively the change in 2007 compared to 2006 was due to the absence of proceeds from the sale of land in san jose california partially offset by lower discontinued operations environmental spending the change in 2006 compared to 2005 was due to higher environmental spending in 2006 and lower cash proceeds of 253 million from the sale of a portion of our san jose property in 2006 as compared to similar proceeds of 561 million in 2005 the majority of the spending for our discontinued operations is for environmental remediation on discontinued sites discontinued environmental spending was 224 million in 2007 compared to 441 million in 2006 and 244 million in 2005 

cash required by investing activities was 1206 million 1098 million and 64 million for the years ended december 31 2007 2006 and 2005 respectively the increase in cash required in 2007 was a result of lower proceeds from the sales and returns of investments and assets held for sale and an increase in other investing activities which represents increases to longterm deferred costs the increase in cash required in 2006 was a result of lower asset sale proceeds primarily attributable to the asset sale of our former phosphorus joint venture astaris which took place in 2005 

cash required by financing activities for 2007 was 2434 million compared to cash required of 1985 million in 2006 and cash required by financing activities of 2153 million in 2005 the increase in 2007 compared to 2006 was primarily due to higher repurchases of common stock and lower proceeds from the issuances of common stock which primarily represent cash received from the exercise of stock options the decrease in 2006 compared to 2005 was primarily due to the higher redemption of longterm debt in 2005 partially offsetting this change was the repurchase of 922 million of common stock and the payment of 210 million in dividends in 2006 we did not repurchase any common stock or pay any dividends in 2005 

for the years ended december 31 2007 2006 and 2005 we contributed approximately 2000 470000 and 528000 shares of treasury stock to our employee benefit plans having a cost of 01 million 173 million and 149 million respectively which is considered a noncash activity 

commitments and other potential liquidity needs 

our cash needs for 2008 include operating cash requirements capital expenditures scheduled mandatory payments of longterm debt dividend payments environmental spending and restructuring we plan to meet our liquidity needs through available cash cash generated from operations and borrowings under our 600 million committed revolving credit facility 

we continually evaluate our options for divesting real estate holdings and property plant and equipment that are no longer integral to any of our core operating businesses 

projected 2008 spending includes approximately 34 million of environmental remediation spending this spending does not include expected spending of approximately 20 million in 2008 on capital projects relating to environmental control facilities also we expect to spend in the range of approximately 26 million to 27 million in 2008 for environmental compliance costs which we will include as a component of cost of sales in our consolidated statements of income since these amounts are not covered by established reserves capital spending to expand maintain or replace equipment at our production facilities may trigger requirements for upgrading our environmental controls which may increase our spending for environmental controls above the foregoing projections 

we have historically made voluntary pension payments and plan to make such payments totaling approximately 30 million in 2008 

  

in 2006 the board of directors approved the initiation of a quarterly cash dividend of 009 per share which was paid in april july and october of 2006 and january of 2007 in april 2007 the board announced its plan to increase the quarterly dividend by 17 percent from 009 to 0105 per share we declared dividends aggregating 309 million to our shareholders of record during the year 2007 and 79 million of this amount is included in “accrued and other liabilities” on the consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2007 

in 2006 the board of directors also authorized the repurchase of up to 150 million of our common stock in april 2007 a new 250 million authorization was announced replacing the original 150 million program although the new repurchase program does not include a specific timetable or price targets and may be suspended or terminated at any time we expect the program will be accomplished over the next two years during the year ended december 31 2007 we repurchased 2474839 of our shares at an aggregate cost of approximately 110 million including 536422 shares for approximately 20 million under the old program and 1938417 shares for approximately 90 million under the new program we also reacquire shares from time to time in connection with the vesting and exercise of awards under our equity compensation plans see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in this form 10k for information regarding the stock split 

in 2001 we split fmc into separate chemical and machinery companies and we refer to the spunoff company fmc technologies inc as “technologies” throughout this annual report we agreed to guarantee the performance by technologies of a debt instrument see note 18 to the consolidated financial statements in this form 10k as of december 31 2007 these guaranteed obligations totaled 16 million compared to 24 million at december 31 2006 

we guarantee repayment of some of the borrowings of certain foreign subsidiaries accounted for using the equity method the other equity owners provide parallel agreements we also guarantee the repayment of a borrowing of a minority equity holder in a foreign subsidiary that we consolidate in our financial statements as of december 31 2007 and 2006 these guarantees had maximum potential payments of 69 million and 82 million respectively 

we also provide guarantees to financial institutions on behalf of certain agricultural product customers principally in brazil for their seasonal borrowing the total of these guarantees was 297 million and 256 million at december 31 2007 and 2006 respectively and are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets for each date as “guarantees of vendor financing” 

shortterm debt consisted of foreign credit lines at december 31 2007 and december 31 2006 we provide parentcompany guarantees to lending institutions providing credit to our foreign subsidiaries 

our total significant committed contracts that we believe will affect cash over the next four years and beyond are as follows 

 

  

   

    contingencies 

when fmc technologies inc was spun off from us in 2001 we entered into a tax sharing agreement wherein each company is obligated for those taxes associated with its respective business generally determined as if each company filed its own consolidated combined or unitary tax returns for any period where technologies is included in the consolidated combined or unitary tax return of us or our subsidiaries the statute of limitations for the 2001 us federal income tax year has now closed and no questions regarding the spinoff were raised during the irs audit for 20002001 therefore any liability for taxes if the spinoff of technologies were not tax free due to an action taken by technologies has been favorably concluded the tax sharing agreement continues to be in force with respect to certain items which we do not believe would have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

on january 28 2005 we and our wholly owned subsidiary foret received a statement of objections from the european commission concerning alleged violations of competition law in the hydrogen peroxide business in europe during the period 1994 to 2001 all of the significant european hydrogen peroxide producers also received the statement of objections we and foret responded to the statement of objections in april 2005 and a hearing on the matter was held at the end of june 2005 on may 3 2006 we received a notice from the european commission indicating that the commission has imposed a fine on us in the amount of €250 million as a result of alleged violations during the period 19971999 in connection with this fine we recorded an expense of 300 million in our consolidated statements of income reflecting thenprevailing exchange rates this expense is included as a component of restructuring and other charges for 2006 both we and foret have appealed the decision of the commission during the appeal process interest accrues on the fine at a rate of 41 percent per annum we have provided a bank letter of credit in favor of the european commission to guarantee our payment of the fine and accrued interest at december 31 2007 the amount of the letter of credit was €271 million 393 million 

we also received a subpoena in 2004 for documents from a grand jury sitting in the northern district of california which is investigating anticompetitive conduct in the hydrogen peroxide business in the united states during the period 1994 through 2003 in connection with these two matters in february 2005 putative class action complaints were filed against all of the us hydrogen peroxide producers in various federal courts alleging violations of antitrust laws federal law provides that persons who have been injured by violations of federal antitrust law may recover three times their actual damage plus attorney fees related cases were also filed in various state courts all of the federal court cases were consolidated in the united states district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania philadelphia the district court certified the class in january 2007 which the defendants have appealed in early summer 2007 codefendant degussa agreed to a settlement in the federal 

  

cases in the amount of 21 million which has received final court approval two other codefendants akzo nobel and kemira have reached settlements in the amount of 234 million and 50 million respectively both settlements have received preliminary approval from the court the akzo nobel settlement has been approved by the court but the kemira settlement remains subject to court approval most of the state court cases have been dismissed although some remain in california in addition putative class actions have been filed in provincial courts in ontario quebec and british columbia under the laws of canada 

another antitrust class action previously brought in federal court in the eastern district of pennsylvania alleging violations of antitrust laws involving our microcrystalline cellulose product was settled for 250 million the same amount paid by our codefendant asahi kasei corporation the court approved this settlement in november 2006 the claims of plaintiffs who opted out of the class settlement were also settled late in 2006 for 07 million the above amounts for 2006 have been reflected in “restructuring and other charges” in our consolidated statement of income for the year ended december 31 2006 the parties have also reached an agreement to settle a related state court case pending in california for a total of 25 million with the company and asahi kasei each contributing 125 million this settlement was approved by the california state court in november 2007 a third related state court case remains pending against fmc in tennessee although the parties have reached a tentative agreement to settle the case for 05 million which will be subject to tennessee state court approval the above amounts for 2007 have been reflected in “restructuring and other charges” in our consolidated statement of income for the year ended december 31 2007 

we have certain other contingent liabilities arising from litigation claims performance guarantees and other commitments incident to the ordinary course of business based on information currently available and established reserves the ultimate resolution of our known contingencies including the matters described in note 18 to the consolidated financial statements is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or liquidity however there can be no assurance that the outcome of these contingencies will be favorable and adverse results in certain of these contingencies could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or liquidity 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we do not have any significant offbalance sheet arrangements that are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources 

dividends 

in 2006 the board of directors approved the initiation of a quarterly cash dividend of 009 per share which was paid in april july and october of 2006 and january and april of 2007 in april 2007 the board announced its plan to increase the quarterly dividend by 17 percent from 009 to 0105 per share we declared dividends aggregating 309 million to our shareholders of record during the year 2007 and 79 million of this amount is included in “accrued and other liabilities” on the consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2007 total cash dividends of 297 million and 210 million were paid in 2007 and 2006 respectively and no cash dividends were paid in 2005

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend our earnings cash flows and financial position are exposed to market risks relating to fluctuations in commodity prices interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates our policy is to minimize exposure to our cash flow over time caused by changes in commodity interest and currency exchange rates to accomplish this we have implemented a controlled program of risk management consisting of appropriate derivative contracts entered into with major financial institutions 

  

the analysis below presents the sensitivity of the market value of our financial instruments to selected changes in market rates and prices the range of changes chosen reflects our view of changes that are reasonably possible over a oneyear period marketvalue estimates are based on the present value of projected future cash flows considering the market rates and prices chosen we calculate the market value foreign currency risk using thirdparty software incorporating standard pricing models to determine the present value of the instruments based on market conditions spot and forward foreign exchange rates as of the valuation date we obtain estimates of the market value energy price risk from calculations performed internally and by a third party 

at december 31 2007 our net financial instrument position was a net liability of 32 million compared to a net liability of 248 million at december 31 2006 the change in the net financial instrument position was primarily due to lower unrealized losses in our commodity portfolio partially offset by higher unrealized losses on our foreign exchange portfolio 

commodity price risk 

energy costs are approximately 13 percent of our cost of sales and services and are well balanced among coal electricity and natural gas we attempt to mitigate our exposure to increasing energy costs by hedging the cost of future deliveries of natural gas and by entering into fixedprice contracts for the purchase of coal and fuel oil to analyze the effect of changing energy prices we have performed a sensitivity analysis in which we assume an instantaneous 10 percent change in energy market prices from their levels at december 31 2007 and december 31 2006 with all other variables including interest rates held constant a 10 percent increase in energy market prices would result in a decrease of the net liability position of 97 million at december 31 2007 compared to a 136 million decrease in the net liability position at december 31 2006 as a result at december 31 2007 the net liability position would become a net asset position a 10 percent decrease in energy market prices would result in an increase of 97 million in the net liability position at december 31 2007 compared to an increase of 136 million in the net liability position at december 31 2006 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

the primary currencies for which we have exchange rate exposure are the us dollar versus the euro the euro versus the norwegian krone the us dollar versus the japanese yen the us dollar versus the chinese yuan and the us dollar versus the brazilian real foreign currency debt and foreign exchange forward contracts are used in countries where we do business thereby reducing our net asset exposure foreign exchange forward contracts are also used to hedge firm and highly anticipated foreign currency cash flows 

to analyze the effects of changing foreign currency rates we have performed a sensitivity analysis in which we assume an instantaneous 10 percent change in the foreign currency exchange rates from their levels at december 31 2007 and december 31 2006 with all other variables including interest rates held constant a 10 percent strengthening of hedged currencies versus our functional currencies would have resulted in an increase of 176 million in the net liability position at december 31 2007 a 10 percent strengthening of hedged currencies versus our functional currencies would have resulted in a decrease of 194 million in the net asset position and as a result would have changed the net asset position into a net liability position at december 31 2006 a 10 percent weakening of hedged currencies versus our functional currencies would have resulted in a decrease of 176 million in the net liability position at december 31 2007 compared to an increase of 179 million in the net asset position at december 31 2006 as a result at december 31 2007 the net liability position would become a net asset position 

  

interest rate risk 

one of the strategies that we use to manage interest rate exposure is to enter into interest rate swap agreements in these agreements we agree to exchange at specified intervals the difference between fixed and variable interest amounts calculated on an agreedupon notional principal amount in 2003 we entered into swaps with an aggregate notional value of 1000 million in 2005 we terminated these swaps at a net cost of 27 million and redeemed the underlying debt as of december 31 2007 and 2006 we had no interest rate swap agreements 

our debt portfolio at december 31 2007 is composed of 52 percent fixedrate debt and 48 percent variablerate debt the variablerate component of our debt portfolio principally consists of foreign bank borrowings including borrowings under our european credit agreement and variablerate industrial and pollution control revenue bonds changes in interest rates affect different portions of our variablerate debt portfolio in different ways 

based on the variablerate debt in our debt portfolio at december 31 2007 a one percentage point increase or decrease in interest rates then in effect would have increased or decreased gross interest expense for 2007 by 26 million

general 

  

we are a diversified global chemical company providing innovative solutions applications and marketleading products to a wide variety of end markets we operate in three distinct business segments agricultural products specialty chemicals and industrial chemicals our agricultural products segment primarily focuses on insecticides which are used in agriculture to enhance crop yield and quality by controlling a broad spectrum of pests and in pest control for nonagricultural applications and on herbicides which are used to reduce the need for manual or mechanical weeding by inhibiting or preventing weed growth specialty chemicals consists of our biopolymer and lithium businesses and focuses on food ingredients that are used to enhance texture structure and physical stability pharmaceutical additives for binding encapsulation and disintegrant applications ultrapure technologies for medical devices and lithium specialties for pharmaceutical synthesis specialty polymers and energy storage our industrial chemicals segment manufactures a wide range of inorganic materials including soda ash hydrogen peroxide specialty peroxygens and phosphorus chemicals 

  

the following table shows the principal products produced by our three business segments and their raw materials and uses 

  

   

we have operations in many areas around the world with a worldwide manufacturing and distribution infrastructure we are able to respond rapidly to global customer needs offset downward economic trends in one region with positive trends in another and better match revenues to local costs to mitigate the impact of currency volatility the charts below detail our sales and longlived assets by major geographic region 

  

   

our strategy 

  

our corporate strategy is balanced between driving growth and innovation within our specialty chemicals and agricultural products segments and generating strong cash flow in our industrial chemicals segment our longterm objectives are as follows 

  

realize the operating leverage inherent in our businesses we intend to maximize earnings growth and return on capital by maintaining our market positions reducing costs and prudently managing our asset base in soda ash we continually strive to optimize our proprietary and lowcost solution mining and longwall mining techniques thereby reducing our production costs which we believe are already the lowest in the industry in hydrogen peroxide we have shut down higher cost production capacity to improve profitability these initiatives have positioned our industrial chemicals business to profitably benefit from higher capacity utilization rates in agricultural products we continue to reduce manufacturing costs by producing our products andor intermediates in lowcost locations and benefit from additional savings from our efforts to streamline our supply chain and reduce logistics costs 

  

maintain strategic and financial flexibility through the series of refinancing steps taken in 2005 we achieved our capital structure objectives of maintaining strong liquidity and continuous access to capital markets lowering aftertax financing costs on a worldwide basis and providing flexibility for future corporate initiatives we also reestablished an investmentgrade credit profile in 2005 through improvements to our liquidity and a significant reduction in our indebtedness going forward we expect continued sustained growth in our operating profit and resulting cash provided by operating activities furthermore we expect capital expenditures to remain below depreciation and amortization as our businesses will meet future expected demand growth through a combination of debottlenecking current production restarting mothballed plants and sourcing from third parties additionally as compared to 2005 and 2006 levels we believe our spending for the shutdown and remediation of the former elemental phosphorus facility in pocatello idaho will be significantly reduced in 2007 and thereafter lastly we continue to explore asset sale opportunities such as the sale of our former defense system site in san jose california from which we realized net proceeds of 253 million in may 2006 and 561 million in february 2005 in addition in the second quarter of 2006 we entered into an agreement with the princeton healthcare system to sell the fmc research center facility in princeton new jersey 

  

focus the portfolio on higher growth businesses our goal is to achieve the highest overall growth while continuing to generate returns above our cost of capital in this regard we intend to focus on building upon our core franchises in the food ingredient pharmaceutical energy storage crop protection and nonagricultural pest control markets that exist within the specialty chemicals and agricultural products segments internal development will continue to be a core element of our growth strategy our biopolymer business is developing new pharmaceutical delivery systems and ultrapure technologies for medical devices and working closely with top global food companies in the development of new health and convenience foods our lithium business is developing applications for energy storage markets to serve the rapid growth in global demand for handheld electronic devices our agricultural products business is testing proprietary delivery technologies which could increase the biological efficacy of existing and new chemistries thereby potentially enhancing those products’ market acceptance and value to endusers product or business acquisitions inlicensing alliances and equity ventures are strategic options to enhance our technology offerings broaden our market access and extend our geographic footprint for example agricultural products employs a strategy focused on selected products markets and geographies where increasingly growth will be sourced via product acquisitions inlicensing and strategic alliances that extend the group’s market presence or expand its geographic penetration each growth opportunity will be evaluated in the context of continued value creation for our shareholders including the degree to which they complement one of our existing franchises generate substantial synergies and are accretive to earnings in addition we intend to divest any business that cannot sustain a return above its cost of capital

financial information in millions 

  

   

overview 

  

our agricultural products segment which represents approximately 33 percent of our 2006 consolidated revenues develops manufactures and sells a portfolio of crop protection professional pest control and lawn and garden products our innovation and growth efforts focus on developing environmentally compatible solutions that can effectively increase farmers’ yields and provide more costeffective alternatives to older chemistries to which insects or weeds may have developed resistance in 2006 we restructured and redeployed our rd resources to focus our innovation efforts towards accelerating the delivery of new products and productivityenhancing technologies to our customers our goal is to significantly shorten the innovation cycle and provide quicker payback on development and technology spending 

  

we differentiate ourselves by our focused strategy in selected products crops and markets coupled with our lowcost sourcing strategy we are continually working to gain access to proprietary chemistries from third party producers which are complementary to our existing products and market focus we are encouraged by our progress in licensing and partnering to create proprietary products developing technically advanced delivery systems and commercializing unique product premixes and combinations we are optimistic that these efforts will result in sales and profit growth over the next few years 

  

products and markets 

  

   

agricultural products provides a wide range of proprietary branded products—based on both patented and offpatent technologies—for global crop protection professional pest control and lawn and garden markets product branding is a prevalent industry practice used to help maintain and grow market share by promoting enduser recognition and product and supplier reputation agricultural products enjoys relatively strong niche positions in crop and noncrop market segments in the americas europe and other parts of the world and derived approximately 73 percent of its revenue from outside north america in 2006 

  

insecticides represent the majority of our sales in the agricultural products segment particularly pyrethroid and carbamate chemistries in which we maintain leading market positions based on revenues pyrethroids are a major class of insecticides whose efficient application rates and cost competitiveness are differentiated compared to most other classes of insecticides they are most effective against worm pests carbamates are a broad spectrum of insecticides used to control a wide variety of pests in both soil and foliar applications our proprietary herbicides have grown significantly over the last several years and now represent a larger portion of agricultural products segment sales our herbicide portfolio primarily targets niche uses and control a wide variety of difficulttocontrol weeds we are also evaluating opportunities to establish a stronger market position in fungicides so that we can fill out our portfolio across the three major pesticide categories ie insecticides herbicides and fungicides in 2006 we entered into a developmental agreement with a third party company whereby we obtained exclusive rights to develop a proprietary fungicide for certain geographic markets we differentiate ourselves through a highly focused strategy in selected crops and regions and leverage our proprietary chemistries pestspecific research and development rd and selected technologies accessed from third party producers to develop and market new pesticides and new applications of our existing products 

  

the following table summarizes the principal product chemistries in agricultural products and the principal uses of each chemistry 

  

   

over the last several years we have entered into a number of key agreements with thirdparty pesticide producers under which we work together to develop market andor distribute existing and new pesticide chemistries in various markets these proprietary chemistries and technologies are complementary to our existing products and market strategies the chemistries include flonicamid a unique insecticide for controlling sucking pests cyazofamid a novel fungicide for crop and noncrop uses in the americas and acetamiprid for pest control markets in north america we also have numerous supply and access agreements with thirdparty producers for other pesticide products including the commercialization of proprietary premixes and combinations 

  

we access the market in key western european markets through the belgianbased pesticide distribution company belchim crop protection nv in which we have an ownership interest in the first quarter of 2006 we expanded this alliance to include spain and portugal we also have joint venture arrangements with nufarm limited in several key countries in eastern europe which should allow us to capitalize on anticipated growth in this part of europe in north america we recently strengthened our access capabilities by signing a longterm distribution agreement with nufarm to market and sell a number of proprietary chemistries in canada through these and other alliances along with our own targeted marketing efforts and access to novel technologies we expect to enhance our access in key agricultural and noncrop markets and develop new products that will help us continue to compete effectively 

  

we maintain competitive manufacturing cost positions through our strategy of sourcing raw materials intermediates and finished products from third parties in lowercost manufacturing regions such as china india and mexico we are in the seventh year of implementing this lowcost manufacturing strategy this strategy has resulted in significant annual cost savings and lower capital spending and has reduced the fixed capital intensity of the business this initiative is expected to produce additional cost savings over the next several years 

  

growth 

  

we plan to grow by obtaining new and approved uses for existing product lines and acquiring accessing developing marketing distributing andor selling complementary chemistries andor related technologies from third parties in order to enhance our current product portfolio and our capabilities to effectively service our target markets and customers our growth will depend on our ability to deliver unique innovative solutions to our customers at an accelerating rate over the next several years growth is anticipated from our proprietary insecticides and herbicides and newlyaccessed third party chemistries andor technologies for our proprietary insecticides we launched a number of new products expanded labels andor unique formulations that deliver valueadding solutions to our customers the emergence and potential spread of herbicideresistant weeds and shifts in weed populations coupled with several newly launched product formulations and expanded labels provide growth opportunities for our proprietary herbicide chemistries

the three principal categories of agricultural chemicals are herbicides representing approximately half of global industry revenue insecticides representing approximately a quarter of global industry revenue and fungicides representing most of the remaining portion of global industry revenue 

  

insecticides are used to control a wide range of insects including chewing pests such as caterpillars and sucking pests such as aphids insecticides are applied as sprays dusts or granules and are used on a wide variety of crops such as fruits vegetables cotton soybean maize and cereals there are several major classes of insecticide chemistries including organophosphates carbamates pyrethroids and neonicotinoids 

  

herbicides prevent or inhibit weed growth thereby reducing or eliminating the need for manual or mechanical weeding herbicides can be selective controlling only specific unwanted vegetation or nonselective controlling all vegetation and are also segmented by their time of application preplanting preemergent and postemergent 

  

fungicides prevent or inhibit the spread of plant disease which can adversely impact crop yields and quality fungicides are used on a wide variety of crops such as fruits vegetables soybean cereals and rice 

  

the agrochemicals industry has undergone significant consolidation over the past ten years leading crop protection companies syngenta ag bayer ag monsanto company basf ag the dow chemical company and e i du pont de nemours and company dupont currently represent more than 70 percent of global sales significant drivers for this consolidation have been the advent of biotechnology particularly in herbicides employed in row crops and the escalation of research and development and marketing costs 

  

the next tier of agrochemical producers including fmc makteshimagan industries ltd sumitomo chemical company limited isk nufarm limited arysta lifescience and cheminova as employ various differentiated strategies and compete by 1 unique technologies 2 focusing on certain crops markets and geographies andor 3 competitive pricing based on lowcost manufacturing positions some of these producers are generic competitors with little or no investment in innovation there is a growing trend among these producers to partner with one another to gain economies of scale and competitive market access more comparable to larger competitors additionally a number of these companies have grown rapidly through acquisition of other companies andor product divestitures from the leading crop protection companies

the following chart summarizes the major markets for various lithium products 

  

   

industry overview 

  

food ingredients 

  

our biopolymer business serves the texture structure and physical stability tsps food ingredients market tsps ingredients impart physical properties to thicken and stabilize foods there are many types of tsps ingredients and a wide range of food groups served including bakery meats dairy and convenience products the industry is dispersed geographically with the majority of our sales in europe north america and asia 

  

trends driving market growth include increasing consumer interest in healthier foods greater convenience and growth in per capita consumption of processed foods in emerging markets the industry’s revenue growth has moderated in recent years due to increased price pressure in most segments the trend toward health and convenience drives the need for more functional ingredients to impart desired food tastes and textures we believe carrageenan and mcc which address this need are growing faster than the overall tsps market the global customer base for tsps is relatively fragmented and includes large and small food processors consolidation among these customers has been a significant trend over the past several years as a result tsps ingredient suppliers such as us have focused on establishing alliances with market leaders with the goal of reducing costs leveraging technology and expanding product offerings with key accounts 

  

within the entire food ingredients market there are a relatively large number of suppliers due principally to the broad spectrum of chemistries employed segment leadership global position and investment in technology are key factors to sustaining profitability in addition larger suppliers may often provide a broader product line and a range of services to food companies including functional systems or blends the top suppliers of tsps ingredients include fmc danisco as dupont jm huber kerry ingredients cargill incorporated dgf stoess ag and tate  lyle plc 

  

pharmaceutical excipients 

  

our biopolymer business sells into the formulation chemicals segment of the pharmaceutical market the major end markets for formulation chemicals include coatings and colors fillers binders sweeteners and flavors disintegrants and others 

  

competitors tend to be grouped by chemistry our principal mcc competitors in pharmaceuticals include j rettenmaier  sôhne gmbh ming tai chemical co ltd asahi kasei corporation and blanver farmoquimica ltda while pricing pressure from low cost producers is a common competitive dynamic companies like us offset that pressure by providing the most reliable and broadest range of products and services customers of excipients are pharmaceutical firms who depend upon reliable therapeutic performance of their drug products 

  

we also supply alginates mcc and carrageenan into oral care cosmetics and health care markets highly refined extracts from selected seaweeds provide a broad range of alginate functionality including uses in antireflux disorders dental impressions control release of drugs and wound dressings special grades of carrageenan extracts are used in liquid cough medicines toothpaste and a variety of skin care products

we market a wide variety of lithiumbased products ranging from upstream commodity lithium carbonate to highly specialized downstream products such as organolithium compounds and cathodic materials for batteries during 2006 lithium carbonate market pricing improved as a result of balanced supply and demand conditions 

  

there are only three integrated producers of lithium fmc rockwood holdings inc and sociedad quimica y minera de chile sa all of which produce lithium carbonate fmc has a stronger presence in downstream lithium specialties where rockwood is the primary competitor 

  

industrial chemicals 

  

financial information in millions 

  

   

overview 

  

our industrial chemicals segment which represents 42 percent of our 2006 consolidated revenues has lowcost positions in high volume inorganic chemicals including soda ash and hydrogen peroxide complemented by high value niche positions in specialty alkali phosphorus and peroxygen products 

  

products and markets 

  

   

industrial chemicals serves a diverse group of markets from economicallysensitive industrial sectors to technologyintensive specialty markets we process and sell refined inorganic products that are sought by customers for their critical reactivity or specific functionality in markets such as glass detergents and pulp and paper in addition we produce purify and market higher value downstream derivatives into specialized and customerspecific applications these applications include electronics biocides and animal nutrition 

  

alkali 

  

our alkali chemical division produces natural soda ash soda ash is used by manufacturers in glass chemical processing and detergent industries to lesser degrees we also produce sodium bicarbonate caustic soda and sodium sesquicarbonate the majority of our alkali sales are manufactured by and sold through fmc wyoming corporation which we manage as an integral part of our alkali business and in which we own shares representing an 875 percent economic interest with the remaining shares held by two japanese companies 

  

we mine and produce natural soda ash using proprietary lowcost mining technologies such as longwall and solution mining which we believe give us the lowest cost position our two production sites in green river wyoming have the capacity to produce approximately 485 million tons of soda ash annually with approximately eight hundred thousand tons of this capacity currently mothballed for the past several years the us soda ash industry was essentially sold out as a result of this condition during 2005 and 2006 we restarted 500000 tons of previously mothballed capacity to meet the increase in demand driven by the growth in export markets 

  

peroxygens 

  

we produce hydrogen peroxide at production facilities in the united states canada and mexico and as described below through our whollyowned foret subsidiary in spain and the netherlands we also participate in a joint venture company in thailand we sell hydrogen peroxide into the pulp and paper industry and to a lesser extent in the chemical processing environmental electronics and food industries we are a leading north american producer of hydrogen peroxide due in part to our broad product line geographicallyadvantaged plant locations stateoftheart processing technology and superior customer service hydrogen peroxide represents approximately 75 percent of our peroxygens sales 

  

our specialty peroxygens business supplies persulfate products primarily to polymer and printed circuit board markets and peracetic acid predominantly to the food industry for biocidal applications typically we compete as a specialty player where we believe that we are differentiated by our strong technical expertise unique process technology and geographic location 

  

foret 

  

our european subsidiary fmc foret sa foret headquartered near barcelona spain is a leading provider of chemical products to the detergent paper textile tanning and chemical industries foret operates seven manufacturing facilities across europe with market positions in phosphates hydrogen peroxide perborates percarbonates sulfur derivatives zeolites silicates and sodium sulfate foret’s sales efforts are focused in europe africa and the middle east and in south america mainly via tripoliven our venezuelan jointventure in which foret holds a minority participation 

  

industry overview 

  

we primarily participate in three product areas soda ash peroxygens and phosphorus chemicals these products are generally inorganic and are generally commodities that in many cases have few costeffective substitutes growth is typically a function of gdp in developed markets or the rate of industrialization in key export markets pricing tends to reflect the shortterm supply and demand balance as producers add or reduce capacity in response to demand changes 

  

soda ash 

  

soda ash is a highly alkaline inorganic chemical essential in the production of glass and widely used in the production of chemicals soaps and detergents and many other products natural soda ash is generally produced from trona a natural form of sodium sesquicarbonate through mining and chemical processing soda ash may also be produced synthetically but this process requires a significant amount of energy and produces large quantities of waste byproducts making it much less costeffective than natural soda ash production 

  

because of the processing cost advantages of trona and the large natural reserves of trona in the us particularly in green river wyoming all us soda ash is naturally produced by contrast due to a lack of trona the majority of the soda ash that is manufactured in the rest of the world is produced synthetically other us producers are oci chemical corporation solvay sa the general chemical group inc and searles valley minerals 

  

approximately 43 percent of us soda ash production served export markets in 2006 with approximately 28 percent of us soda ash production exported through the american natural soda ash corporation “ansac” ansac is the foreign sales association of the significant us soda ash producers established in 1983 under the webbpomerene act and subsequent legislation since its creation ansac has been successful in coordinating soda ash exports exploiting the inherent cost benefits of us produced natural soda ash and leveraging its large scale of operations to the benefit of its member companies us exports of soda ash have risen significantly over the last 20 years 

  

peroxygens 

  

hydrogen peroxide is typically sold for use as a bleach or oxidizer as such it often competes with other chemicals capable of performing similar functions some of our specialty peroxygen derivatives eg persulfates perborates percarbonates also function as bleaching or oxidizing agents environmental regulations regional cost differences primarily due to transportation costs and technical differences in product performance factor into the decision to use hydrogen peroxide or one of its derivatives rather than another product since these considerations vary by region the consumption patterns vary in different parts of the world hydrogen peroxide is sold in aqueous solutions usually 35 percent 50 percent or 70 percent by weight 

  

the north american pulp and paper industry represents approximately 70 percent of north american demand for hydrogen peroxide in this market hydrogen peroxide is used as an environmentally friendly bleaching agent to brighten chemical mechanical and recycled pulps as well as treat a wide range of mill pollutants in the waste stream the north american paper market is mature and new investment in pulp and paper capacity is largely focused in asia and south america as a result hydrogen peroxide demand growth has slowed to a 12 per year rate after rapid growth in the early to mid 1990’s north american hydrogen peroxide capacity utilization is currently in the 8590 percent range of nameplate capacity prices increased significantly in 20052006 to offset significant energy price increases the other north american hydrogen peroxide producers are akzo nobel nv arkema degussa ag kemira ovj and solvay sa 

  

phosphorous chemicals 

  

we participate in this business in europe the middle east africa and south america through foret major competitors include thermphos prayon rupel sa and various chinese producers 

  

phosphorous chemicals are used in many industrial applications in a wide array of chemical compounds overall growth in demand for phosphorous chemicals tends to correlate with gdp purified phosphoric acid ppa and phosphate salts eg sodium phosphates and calcium phosphates are sold into many markets including detergents cleaning compounds and animal feed 

  

the basic input material for making phosphates is now produced using two processes most industrial applications use the costeffective process that involves making ppa by the purification of fertilizergrade phosphoric acid thermal phosphoric acid long the industry standard is produced from elemental phosphorus but is more costly due to energy and environmental compliance costs and is now used in limited applications elemental phosphorus is still produced by thermphos in the netherlands and in several other countries including china 

  

worldwide demand for phosphorous chemicals declined in the early 1990s as detergents containing phosphates for homelaundry use were banned in north america and parts of europe beginning in the late 1990s reduced demand the shift in growth toward developing regions and the advent of new technology resulted in a significant restructuring of the phosphorus chemicals industry as producers consolidated or exited the business 

  

over the next few years industrial demand for phosphorous chemicals is expected to improve driven by growing demand in the detergent industry in newly industrializing nations 

  

source and availability of raw materials 

  

our raw material requirements vary by business segment and include mineralrelated natural resources trona ore and lithium brines processed chemicals seaweed specialty hardwood pulp and energy sources such as oil gas coal and electricity raw materials represented approximately 24 percent of our 2006 cost of sales and services and no one raw material represented more than 9 percent of our total raw material purchases 

  

ores used in industrial chemicals manufacturing processes are extracted by us from mines eg trona in north america and sodium sulfate in spain or are purchased from others eg phosphorous rock raw materials used by specialty chemicals include lithium brines various types of seaweed that are sourced on a global basis and specialty hardwood pulp which is mainly purchased from several north american producers raw materials used by agricultural products primarily processed chemicals are obtained from a variety of suppliers worldwide 

  

patents 

  

we own a number of us and foreign patents trademarks and licenses that are cumulatively important to our business we do not believe that the loss of any one or group of related patents trademarks or licenses would have a material adverse effect on the overall business of fmc the duration of our patents depends on their respective jurisdictions their expiration dates range through 2026 

  

seasonality 

  

the seasonal nature of the crop protection market and the geographic spread of the agricultural products business can result in significant variations in quarterly earnings agricultural products sold into the northern hemisphere north america europe and parts of asia serve seasonal agricultural markets from march through september generally resulting in earnings in the first second and third quarters markets in the southern hemisphere latin america and parts of the asia pacific region including australia are served from july through february generally resulting in earnings in the third fourth and first quarters the remainder of our businesses is generally not subject to significant seasonal fluctuations 

  

  

competition 

  

we have a number one or number two market position in many of our product lines based on revenue either globally or in north america largely as a result of our product offerings proprietary technologies and our position as a lowcost producer the following product lines accounted for the majority of our 2006 consolidated revenue market positions are based on the most recently available revenue data 

  

    

we encounter substantial competition in each of our three business segments this competition is expected to continue in both the united states and markets outside of the united states we market our products through our own sales organization and through alliance partners independent distributors and sales representatives the number of our principal competitors varies from segment to segment in general we compete by operating in a costefficient manner and by leveraging our industry experience to provide advanced technology high product quality and reliability and quality customer and technical service 

  

our agricultural products segment competes primarily in the global crop protection market for insecticides herbicides and fungicides the industry is characterized by a relatively small number of large competitors and a large number of smaller often regional competitors industry products include crop protection chemicals and for certain major competitors genetically engineered crop biotechnology products competition from generic producers has increased as a significant number of product patents held industrywide have expired in the last decade in general we compete as an innovator by focusing on product development including novel formulations and advanced delivery systems and by acquiring or licensing mostly proprietary chemistries that complement our product and geographic focus we also differentiate ourselves by reacting quickly in key markets achieving global costcompetitiveness via our manufacturing strategies establishing effective product stewardship programs and developing strategic alliances that strengthen market access in key countries and regions 

  

with significant positions in markets that include alginate carrageenan microcrystalline cellulose and lithiumbased products specialty chemicals competes on the basis of product differentiation market applications expertise customer service and price biopolymer competes with both direct suppliers of cellulose and seaweed extract as well as suppliers of other hydrocolloids which may provide similar functionality in specific applications in microcrystalline cellulose competitors are typically smaller than us while in seaweed extracts alginates we compete with other broadbased chemical companies we and each of our two most significant competitors in lithium extract the element from naturally occurring lithiumrich brines located in the andes mountains of argentina and chile which are believed to be the world’s most significant and lowest cost sources of lithium 

  

industrial chemicals serves the soda ash markets worldwide peroxygens markets predominantly in north america and europe and phosphorus markets in europe the middle east and africa in north america our soda ash business competes with four domestic producers of natural soda ash three of which operate in the vicinity of our mine and processing facilities in green river wyoming outside of the us canada and europe we sell soda ash mainly through ansac internationally our natural soda ash competes with synthetic soda ash manufactured by numerous producers ranging from integrated multinational companies to smaller regional companies we maintain a leading position in the north american market for hydrogen peroxide there are currently five other firms competing in the hydrogen peroxide market in north america the primary competitive factor affecting the sales of soda ash and hydrogen peroxide is price we seek to maintain our competitive position by employing low cost processing technology at foret we possess strong cost and market positions in phosphates perborates peroxygens zeolites and sulfur derivatives in each of these markets we face significant competition from a range of multinational and regional chemical producers competition in phosphorus chemicals is based primarily on price and to a lesser degree product differentiation 

  

research and development expense 

  

we perform research and development in all of our segments with the majority of our efforts focused in the agricultural products segment the product development efforts in the agricultural products segment focus on developing environmentally sound solutions that costeffectively increase farmers’ yields and provide alternatives to insectresistant chemistries in 2006 we restructured and redeployed our agricultural products new chemistry discovery spending to focus our innovation efforts on delivering valueadding solutions more quickly to our customers this shift in strategy should result in a significantly shorter innovation cycle for the segment our research and development expenses in the last three years are set forth below 

  

   

environmental laws and regulations 

  

we are subject to various federal state local and foreign environmental laws and regulations that govern emissions of air pollutants discharges of water pollutants and the manufacture storage handling and disposal of hazardous substances hazardous wastes and other toxic materials and remediation of contaminated sites we are also subject to liabilities arising under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla and similar state laws that impose responsibility on persons who arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances and on current and previous owners and operators of a facility for the cleanup of hazardous substances released from the facility into the environment in addition we are subject to liabilities under the resource conservation and recovery act rcra and analogous state laws that require owners and operators of facilities that treat store or dispose of hazardous waste to follow certain waste management practices and to clean up releases of hazardous substances into the environment associated with past or present practices 

  

we have been named a potentially responsible party prp at 31 sites on the federal government’s national priorities list npl at which our potential liability has not yet been settled in addition we also have received notice from the epa or other regulatory agencies that we may be a prp or prp equivalent at other sites including 37 sites at which we have determined that it is reasonably possible that we have environmental liability in cooperation with appropriate government agencies we are currently participating in or have 

  

participated in a remedial investigationfeasibility study rifs or its equivalent at most of the identified sites with the status of each investigation varying from site to site at certain sites a rifs has only recently begun providing limited information if any relating to cost estimates timing or the involvement of other prps whereas at other sites the studies are complete remedial action plans have been chosen or a record of decision rod has been issued 

  

environmental liabilities include obligations relating to waste handling and the remediation andor study of sites at which we are alleged to have released or disposed of hazardous substances these sites include current operations previously operated sites and sites associated with discontinued operations we have provided reserves for potential environmental obligations that we consider probable and for which a reasonable estimate of the obligation can be made as of december 31 2006 our net environmental reserve was 1672 million compared to 1704 million at december 31 2005 we have recorded recoveries representing probable realization of claims against insurance companies us government agencies and other third parties of 370 million and 207 million respectively at december 31 2006 and 2005 the recoveries at december 31 2006 are recorded as either an offset to the “environmental liabilities continuing and discontinued” totaling 224 million or as “other assets” totaling 146 million in our consolidated balance sheets the recoveries at december 31 2005 are recorded as an offset to the “environmental liabilities continuing and discontinued” in our consolidated balance sheets in addition we have estimated that reasonably possible environmental loss contingencies may exceed this reserve by as much as 75 million at december 31 2006 

  

employees 

  

we employ approximately 5000 people with approximately 2600 people in our domestic operations and 2400 people in our foreign operations approximately 34 percent of our usbased employees and 43 percent of our foreignbased employees are represented by collective bargaining agreements we have successfully concluded virtually all of our recent contract negotiations without a work stoppage in those rare instances where a work stoppage has occurred there has been no material effect on consolidated sales and earnings we cannot predict however the outcome of future contract negotiations in 2007 we have seven collectivebargaining agreements expiring these contracts affect approximately 4 percent of usbased employees and 24 percent of foreignbased employees

 item 3 legal proceedings tableend   

like hundreds of other industrial companies we have been named as one of many defendants in asbestosrelated personal injury litigation these cases most cases involve between 25 and 200 defendants allege personal injury or death resulting from exposure to asbestos in premises of fmc or to asbestoscontaining components installed in machinery or equipment manufactured or sold by discontinued operations the machinery and equipment businesses we owned or operated did not fabricate the asbestoscontaining component parts at issue in the litigation and to this day neither the us occupational safety and health administration nor the epa has banned the use of these components further the asbestoscontaining materials were housed inside of machinery and equipment and accessible only at the time of infrequent repair and maintenance therefore we believe that overall the claims against fmc are without merit and consider ourselves to be a peripheral defendant in these matters indeed the bulk of the claims against us to date have been dismissed without payment 

  

as of december 31 2006 there were approximately 32000 premises and product asbestos claims pending against fmc in several jurisdictions to date we have had discharged approximately 71000 asbestos claims against fmc the overwhelming majority of which have been dismissed without any payment to the plaintiff settlements by us with claimants to date have totaled approximately 120 million 

  

we intend to continue managing these cases in accordance with our historical experience we have established a reserve for this litigation and believe that the outcome of these cases will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or liquidity 

  

in late june 2004 we were served in a lawsuit captioned “lewis et al v fmc corporation” which was filed in united states district court for the western district of new york the suit was brought by thirteen residents of middleport new york who allege that we violated certain state and federal environmental laws and seeks injunctive relief and monetary damages for personal injuries and property damage in connection with such alleged violations we believe this suit is without merit 

  

we have certain other contingent liabilities arising from litigation claims performance guarantees and other commitments incident to the ordinary course of business based on information currently available and established reserves the ultimate resolution of our known contingencies including the matters described in note 18 is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or liquidity however there can be no assurance that the outcome of these contingencies will be favorable and adverse results in certain of these contingencies could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or liquidity

2006 highlights 

  

2006 was a year during which we experienced continued sales growth in all of our business segments we also had significant growth in income from continuing operations before income tax our liquidity position continued to improve primarily due to growth in cash provided by operating activities additionally we have continued to reduce our debt level which has lowered our net interest expense in february 2006 our board of directors approved the initiation of a quarterly cash dividend and authorized the repurchase of up to 1500 million of the company’s common stock during 2006 we repurchased approximately 14 million shares at a cost of approximately 90 million 

  

consolidated revenue of 23470 million was up 9 percent from the prior year agricultural products specialty chemicals and industrial chemicals had revenue increases of 6 6 and 14 respectively in agricultural products our focused strategy combined with strong sales growth in south america particularly brazil as well as higher sales in north america and asia and for herbicides led to the increase in revenue specialty chemical increases were driven by higher volumes and selling prices of primary lithium compounds and in the pharmaceutical market in biopolymer industrial chemicals continued to benefit from volume growth and higher selling prices in soda ash and higher selling prices for north american hydrogen peroxide 

  

income from continuing operations before income tax of 2135 million was up significantly from the prior year this was driven primarily by 21 10 and 15 increases in operating profit in agricultural products specialty chemicals and industrial chemicals respectively and lower interest expense levels net interest expense of 329 million for the year ended december 31 2006 decreased by 252 million or 43 from the prior year primarily as a result of reduced debt levels partially offsetting these increases in operating profit were significantly higher energy and raw material costs and the absence of profits from astaris which was divested in november 2005 

  

2007 outlook 

  

in 2007 we expect continued growth in our revenue and earnings the increase in revenue is expected to be driven by higher selling prices for soda ash higher volumes and selling prices in biopolymer and lithium volume growth in foret and new product introductions in agricultural products the increase in earnings is expected to be driven by new product introductions and further supply chain productivity improvements in agricultural products and continued sales growth and productivity improvements in specialty chemicals higher energy costs particularly in spain higher raw material costs and increased spending on our growth initiatives are expected to partially offset our profit growth we expect cash flow generation from our business segments to remain strong 

  

critical accounting policies 

  

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses we have described our accounting policies in note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k we have reviewed these accounting policies identifying those that we believe to be critical to the preparation and understanding of our consolidated financial statements we have reviewed with the audit committee those accounting policies that we have deemed critical these policies are central to our presentation of results of operations and financial condition and require management to make estimates and judgments on certain matters we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience current conditions and other reasonable factors 

  

environmental obligations 

  

we provide for environmentalrelated obligations when they are probable and amounts can be reasonably estimated where the available information is sufficient to estimate the amount of liability that estimate has been used where the information is only sufficient to establish a range of probable liability and no point within the range is more likely than any other the lower end of the range has been used 

  

estimated obligations to remediate sites that involve oversight by the epa or similar government agencies are generally accrued no later than when a rod or equivalent is issued or upon completion of a rifs that is submitted by us to the appropriate government agency or agencies estimates are reviewed quarterly by our environmental remediation management as well as by financial and legal management and if necessary adjusted as additional information becomes available the estimates can change substantially as additional information becomes available regarding the nature or extent of site contamination required remediation methods and other actions by or against governmental agencies or private parties 

  

our environmental liabilities for continuing and discontinued operations are principally for costs associated with the remediation andor study of sites at which we are alleged to have disposed of hazardous substances such costs principally include among other items rifs site remediation costs of operation and maintenance of the remediation plan fees to outside law firms and consultants for work related to the environmental effort and future monitoring costs estimated site liabilities are determined based upon existing remediation laws and technologies specific site consultants’ engineering studies or by extrapolating experience with environmental issues at comparable sites we believe that it is reasonably possible that loss contingencies may exceed amounts accrued by as much as 75 million at december 31 2006 

  

included in the environmental reserve balance other assets and reasonably possible loss contingencies for 2006 are potentially recoverable amounts from third party insurance policies and some of these amounts have been recognized as offsetting recoveries in 2006 

  

provisions for environmental costs are reflected in income net of probable and estimable recoveries from named prps or other third parties such provisions incorporate inflation and are not discounted to their present values 

  

in calculating and evaluating the adequacy of our environmental reserves we have taken into account the joint and several liability imposed by cercla and the analogous state laws on all prps and have considered the identity and financial condition of each of the other prps at each site to the extent possible we have also considered the identity and financial condition of other third parties from whom recovery is anticipated as well as the status of our claims against such parties although we are unable to forecast the ultimate contributions of prps and other third parties with absolute certainty the degree of uncertainty with respect to each party is taken into account when determining the environmental reserve by adjusting the reserve to reflect the facts and circumstances on a sitebysite basis our liability includes our best estimate of the costs expected to be paid 

  

before the consideration of any potential recoveries from third parties we believe that any recorded recoveries related to prps are realizable in all material respects recoveries are recorded as either an offset in “environmental liabilities continuing and discontinued” or as “other assets” in our consolidated balance sheets 

  

impairments and valuation of longlived assets 

  

our longlived assets include property plant and equipment and longterm investments goodwill and intangible assets we test for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the net book value of these assets may not be recoverable from the estimated undiscounted expected future cash flows expected to result from their use and eventual disposition in cases where the estimated undiscounted expected future cash flows are less than net book value an impairment loss is recognized equal to the amount by which the net book value exceeds the estimated fair value of assets which is based on discounted cash flows at the lowest level determinable the estimated cash flows reflect our assumptions about selling prices volumes costs and market conditions over a reasonable period of time 

  

we prepare an annual impairment test of goodwill the assumptions used to estimate fair value include our best estimate of future growth rates discount rates and market conditions over a reasonable period we performed this test in 2006 and determined that no impairment charge was required 

  

pensions and other postretirement benefits 

  

we provide qualified and nonqualified defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans as well as postretirement health care and life insurance benefit plans to our employees the costs benefits and obligations related to these benefits reflect key assumptions related to general economic conditions including interest discount rates healthcare cost trend rates expected rates of return on plan assets and the rates of compensation increases for employees the costs benefits and obligations for these benefit programs are also affected by other assumptions such as average retirement age mortality employee turnover and plan participation to the extent our plans’ actual experience as influenced by changing economic and financial market conditions or by changes to our own plans’ demographics differs from these assumptions the costs and obligations for providing these benefits as well as the plans’ funding requirements could increase or decrease when actual results differ from our assumptions the difference is typically recognized over future periods in addition the unrealized gains and losses related to our pension and postretirement benefit obligations may also affect periodic benefit costs benefits in future periods 

  

we use certain calculated values of assets under methods both to estimate the expected rate of return on assets component of pension cost and to calculate our plans’ funding requirements the expected rate of return on plan assets is based on a marketrelated value of assets that recognizes investment gains and losses over a fiveyear period we use an actuarial value of assets to determine our plans’ funding requirements the actuarial value of assets must be within a certain range high or low of the actual market value of assets and is adjusted accordingly 

  

we recorded 151 million 106 million and 92 million of net annual pension and other postretirement benefit cost in 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively 

  

as of december 31 2006 we adopted a new pension accounting standard see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements which required us to recognize in our consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2006 the total underfunded status of our defined benefit postretirement plans the underfunded status is defined as the difference between the fair value of the plan assets and the projected benefit obligation at december 31 2006 our net underfunded status recorded on our consolidated balance sheets was 1402 million 

  

we made voluntary cash contributions to our us qualified pension plan of 300 million and 150 million respectively for 2006 and 2005 in addition we paid nonqualified pension benefits from company assets of 27 

  

million and 25 million for 2006 and 2005 respectively we paid other postretirement benefits net of participant contributions of 50 million and 70 million for 2006 and 2005 respectively our estimated cash contributions for 2007 include approximately 24 million in nonqualified pension benefits 47 million in other postretirement benefits and we plan to make voluntary cash contributions to our us qualified pension plan of approximately 30 million 

  

we select the discount rate used to calculate pension and other postretirement obligations based on a review of available yields on highquality corporate bonds including moody’s investors service inc “moody’s” aarated corporate and industrial bond indices in selecting the discount rate for 2006 we placed particular emphasis on a yieldcurve approach designed by our actuary to derive an appropriate discount rate for computing the present value of the future cash flows associated with our pension and other postretirement obligations taking into consideration both the timing and amount of the cash flows the specific interest rates supporting the yield curve were derived from calculated returns yields from a portfolio of highquality aagraded or higher bond investments constructed by our actuary 

  

in developing the expected longterm rate of return on asset assumption for our plan we take into consideration the technical analysis performed by our outside actuaries including historical market returns information on longterm real return expectations by asset class inflation assumptions and expectations for standard deviation related to these best estimates we also consider the historical performance of our own plan’s trust which has earned a compound annual rate of return of approximately 12 percent over the last 10 years which is in excess of comparable market indices for the same period as well as other factors the current asset allocation for our plan is approximately 79 percent equities us and nonus 18 percent fixedincome and 3 percent cash and other shortterm investments given an actively managed investment portfolio the expected annual rates of return by asset class for our portfolio using geometric averaging and after being adjusted for an estimated inflation rate of approximately 3 percent is between 9 percent and 11 percent for both us and nonus equities and between 5 percent and 7 percent for fixedincome investments which generates a total expected portfolio return that is in line with our rate of return assumption we continually monitor the appropriateness of this rate in light of current market conditions for the sensitivity of our pension costs to incremental changes in assumptions see our discussion below 

  

sensitivity analysis related to key pension and postretirement benefit assumptions 

  

a onehalf percent increase in the assumed discount rate would have decreased pension and other postretirement benefit obligations by 530 million at december 31 2006 and 508 million at december 31 2005 and decreased pension and other postretirement benefit costs by 52 million 30 million and 25 million for 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively a onehalf percent decrease in the assumed discount rate would have increased pension and other postretirement benefit obligations by 571 million at december 31 2006 and 560 million at december 31 2005 and increased pension and other postretirement benefit net periodic benefit cost by 59 million 56 million and 50 million for 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively 

  

a onehalf percent increase in the assumed expected longterm rate of return on plan assets would have decreased pension costs by 36 million 34 million and 32 million for 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively a onehalf percent decrease in the assumed longterm rate of return on plan assets would have increased pension costs by 36 million 34 million and 32 million for 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively 

  

further details on our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and net periodic benefit costs benefits are found in note 13 to our consolidated financial statements 

  

income taxes 

  

we have recorded a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized in assessing the need for this allowance we have considered a number of factors including future income the jurisdictions in which such income is earned and our ongoing tax planning 

  

strategies in the event that we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period such determination was made similarly should we conclude that we would be able to realize certain deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase income in the period such determination was made at december 31 2006 and 2005 the valuation allowance was 815 million and 726 million respectively 

  

results of operations—2006 2005 and 2004 

  

overview 

  

      

see “segment results” for a detailed discussion of events affecting our results for 2006 2005 and 2004 

  

results of operations—2006 compared to 2005 

  

in the following discussion “year” refers to the year ending december 31 2006 and “prior year” refers to the year ending december 31 2005 additionally in the discussion below please refer to our consolidated statements of income included in item 8 of this form 10k as well as the aftertax charges included in net income in the above table all comparisons are between the periods unless otherwise noted 

  

revenue for the year ended december 31 2006 was 23470 million an increase of 9 percent compared to the 21502 million recorded in the prior year period this increase was driven by higher sales in all of our segments which are discussed separately below 

  

inprocess research and development for the year ended december 31 2006 was 20 million 12 million after tax our agricultural products segment entered into development agreements with a thirdparty company whereby we were given the right to develop further one of such party’s products in certain geographic markets 

  

restructuring and other charges were 748 million 579 million aftertax in 2006 compared to 404 million 261 million aftertax in 2005 charges for the year ended december 31 2006 primarily include the following 

  

   

   

   

   

   

the charges of 404 million that we recorded in 2005 were primarily a result of the following 

  

   

   

   

equity in earnings loss of affiliates was 23 million of earnings in 2006 versus 706 million of earnings in the prior year the significant decrease was primarily the result of our sale of astaris and substantially all of its assets in the fourth quarter of 2005 we recorded a gain from this sale of 577 million 217 million aftertax the decrease is also the result of income at astaris up to the date of the asset sale in 2005 

  

investment gains for the year ended december 31 2005 were due to the sale of our 50 equity method investment in sibelco we recorded a gain of 93 million 24 million aftertax in conjunction with this sale in our consolidated statement of income there were no gains from the sale of investments for the year ended december 31 2006 

  

interest expense net decreased to 329 million compared to 581 million in 2005 the decrease primarily reflects lower interest costs and debt levels in the year ended december 31 2006 compared to the prior year the decreases were due to our debt refinancing in june 2005 and the redemption of the 1025 percent senior notes in july 2005 

  

loss on extinguishment of debt was 605 million 374 million aftertax in 2005 in 2005 in connection with our industrial revenue bond refinancing we incurred an approximate 21 million loss and in connection with entering into the 2005 credit agreement we wrote off approximately 12 million of deferred financing fees associated with the previous agreement and 06 million of fees associated with the new agreement additionally in 2005 we incurred a loss of 566 million associated with the redemption of the 1025 percent senior notes 

  

provision benefit for income taxes was an expense of 687 million in 2006 compared with expense of 823 million in 2005 reflecting effective tax rates of 322 and 426 respectively the change was primarily due to higher tax adjustments in 2005 which include income taxes associated with the repatriations under the american jobs creation act ajca offsetting this decrease is the effect on the tax provision in 2006 from having the 30 million european commission fine that is nondeductible for tax purposes excluding the effect of these tax adjustments and the nondeductibility of the european commission fine the change from 2005 to 2006 is primarily a result of the mix of domestic income compared to income earned outside of the us dividends received from foreign operations and valuation allowance adjustments 

  

2006 tax adjustments of 125 million primarily include charges associated with adjustments to deferred taxes 

  

2005 tax adjustments of 217 million primarily include charges of 319 million associated with repatriations net tax benefits of 192 million primarily related to agreement on certain prior year tax matters previously reserved and charges of 95 million associated with adjustments to deferred tax liabilities 

  

cumulative effect of change in accounting principle net of income tax on december 31 2005 we adopted fasb interpretation no 47 “accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations” the cumulative effect of adoption was a charge of 05 million in 2005 see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements 

  

discontinued operations net of income tax totaled a loss of 128 million in 2006 versus a gain of 61 million in 2005 the 2006 loss includes net charges of 273 million related to environmental issues and legal expenses related to previously discontinued operations discontinued environmental and legal charges include environmental remediation costs at sites of discontinued businesses for which we are responsible for environmental compliance the charges in 2006 were primarily related to our front royal and middleport sites as well as to increase reserves for operating and maintenance activities offsetting these charges was a gain of 140 million from the sale of 23 acres real estate property in san jose california related to our former defense business this completed the sale of land that was formerly used by fmc’s defense business which was divested in 1997 

  

2005 net gain includes income of 292 million related to a sale to the city of san jose california of approximately 52 acres of land used by our former defense systems operations primarily offsetting this income in 2005 was net environmental and legal charges of 234 million the charges in 2005 were primarily related to our front royal and middleport sites and in recognition of our share of liabilities related to a consent order between the epa and the primary responsible parties at the anniston site 

  

net income increased to 1320 million in 2006 compared with 1166 million in 2005 primarily as a result of changes in the aftertax items included in net income described above the change in these items was the primary driver behind the increase in net income from 2005 to 2006 as well as higher earnings from our agricultural products specialty chemicals and industrial chemicals segments and a decrease in interest expense 

  

other financial data 

  

corporate expenses were 462 million in 2006 compared to 451 million in 2005 essentially level from one year ago 

  

other income and expense net is comprised primarily of lifo inventory adjustments pension expense and realized foreign currency gains and losses other income net decreased to 30 million from 139 million in the prior year due to a gain related to the settlement of certain energy contracts in 2005 which was not repeated in 2006 as well as higher pension expense and the recognition of stock option expense in 2006 offsetting these decreases was a gain recorded in 2006 related to a refund of previously submitted payroll taxes 

  

segment results 2006 compared to 2005 

  

information about how each of these items relates to our businesses at the segment level and results by segment are discussed below and in note 19 to our consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k 

  

agricultural products 

  

   

revenue in agricultural products was 7670 million an increase of 6 percent versus the prior year driven primarily by strong sales growth in south america particularly in brazil as well as by higher sales in north america and in asia 

  

segment earnings were 1510 million an increase of 21 percent from the year earlier as a result of the higher sales and the favorable impact of supply chain productivity initiatives which more than offset the impact of generic bifenthrin competition higher raw material costs and increased spending associated with growth in innovation initiatives 

  

in 2007 fullyear revenue growth is expected to be up in the low to mid single digits as a result of new product introductions and continued label expansions and volume growth in herbicides fullyear segment earnings are expected to increase approximately 10 driven by our sales growth and further supply chain productivity improvements offset in part by increased spending on our growth initiatives and higher raw material costs a combination of lower commodity prices and a strengthening brazilian real is pressuring the cash flow of our brazilian customers who sell into us dollar priced export markets this continues to result in slower payments from these customers and an increase in our allowance for doubtful accounts 

  

in our agricultural products segment several products are undergoing reregistration in the us and a comparable regulatory review by eu governmental authorities in august 2006 the us environmental protection agency issued its “interim reregistration eligibility decision” “ired” for our carbofuran insecticide the ired proposes cancellation of all carbofuran uses in the united states subject to a phase out period for certain minor crop uses fmc does not agree with the scientific analysis or conclusions in the ired fmc intends to challenge epa’s conclusions and seek to maintain carbofuran as a registered product the ired is not a final agency action and is therefore subject to change it does not require fmc to stop selling carbofuran at this time 

  

in november 2006 the eu commission’s standing committee on animal health and food chain voted not to include our carbofuran carbosulfan and cadusafos products on the official list of active ingredients approved for continued sale in the eu we believe the committee’s decision was based on a flawed underlying scientific review and we have initiated litigation against the european food safety authority the standing committee’s vote is not final action and does not require fmc to stop selling these products at this time 

  

we intend to vigorously defend all our products in the us and eu regulatory processes several of fmc’s pesticide products will be reviewed in the ordinary course of regulatory programs during 2007 as part of the ongoing cycle of reregistration in countries around the world we do not anticipate significant impact on fmc agricultural products sales in 2007 as a result of any of these agency reviews at this time we cannot reasonably estimate the effect of such regulatory reviews beyond 2007 

  

specialty chemicals 

  

   

revenue in specialty chemicals was 5928 million an increase of 6 percent versus the prior year driven by higher sales of primary lithium compounds and continued strength in biopolymer’s pharmaceutical business 

  

segment earnings of 1188 million increased 10 percent versus the prior year the sales gains improved results in biopolymer’s food ingredients business and the benefit of restructuring initiatives were partially offset by higher raw material costs and increased spending for growth initiatives 

  

in 2007 we expect revenue growth in the midsingle digits driven by higher volumes and higher selling prices in both lithium and biopolymer fullyear earnings growth of approximately 10 is expected as a result of the sales growth and the benefit of productivity improvements mitigated somewhat by higher energy and raw material costs 

  

industrial chemicals 

  

   

revenue in industrial chemicals was 9909 million an increase of 14 percent versus the prior year the soda ash business accounted for the majority of the increase due to significant improvements in both domestic and export soda ash selling prices and higher volumes north american hydrogen peroxide also benefited from higher selling prices and energy surcharges 

  

segment earnings of 967 million increased 15 percent versus the prior year driven by the sales gains offset in part by higher energy costs particularly for natural gas in spain higher raw material costs and the absence of earnings from astaris which was divested in november 2005 prior to its divestiture astaris contributed approximately 11 million of income in 2005 

  

for 2007 we expect fullyear revenue growth in the midteens as a result of higher soda ash volumes and selling prices and volume growth in foret fullyear segment earnings are expected to be level to prior year as aggregate price and volume benefits are offset by higher energy costs particularly in spain and higher raw material costs 

  

results of operations—2005 compared to 2004 

  

revenue for the year ended december 31 2005 was 21502 million an increase of 5 percent compared to the 20512 million recorded in the prior year period this increase was driven by higher sales in all of our segments which are discussed separately below 

  

restructuring and other charges were 404 million 261 million aftertax in 2005 compared to 35 million 22 million aftertax in 2004 charges for the year ended december 31 2005 primarily related to the closing of our carrageenan plant in copenhagen denmark in our specialty chemicals segment a charge for the abandonment of certain assets in our agricultural products segment and impairment and shutdown charge at our spring hill west virginia facility in our industrial chemicals segment 

  

the charges of 35 million that we recorded in 2004 were primarily a result of severance costs agricultural products and specialty chemicals recorded 33 million and 03 million respectively of these severance costs severance costs in 2004 related to approximately 80 people most of whom separated from us in 2004 we also recorded 11 million of charges related to continuing environmental sites these charges were partially offset by noncash gains totaling 11 million in industrial chemicals and 01 million in corporate 

  

equity in earnings loss of affiliates equity in earnings loss of affiliates was 706 million of earnings in 2005 versus a loss of 21 million in the prior year the significant increase was primarily a result of 577 million 217 million aftertax of earnings recorded in 2005 as a result of a gain in connection with astaris’s sale of substantially all of its assets the increase was also a result of income at astaris up to the date of the asset sale versus a loss at astaris in the prior period the 2004 loss included our portion of the astaris 2004 restructuring charges of 115 million 70 million aftertax 

  

investment gains for the year ended december 31 2005 was due to the sale of our 50 equity method investment in sibelco we recorded a gain of 93 million 24 million aftertax in conjunction with this sale in our consolidated statement of income 

  

interest expense net decreased to 581 million compared to 784 million in 2004 the decrease primarily reflects lower interest costs and debt levels in the year ended december 31 2005 compared to the prior year the decreases were due to our debt refinancing in october 2004 and june 2005 and the redemption of the 1025 percent senior notes in july 2005 

  

loss on extinguishment of debt was 605 million 374 million aftertax for the year ended december 31 2005 compared to 99 million 60 million aftertax in 2004 in 2005 in connection with our industrial revenue bond refinancing we incurred an approximate 21 million loss and in connection with entering into 

  

the 2005 credit agreement we wrote off approximately 12 million of deferred financing fees associated with the previous agreement and 06 million of fees associated with the new agreement additionally in 2005 we incurred a loss of 566 million associated with the redemption of the 1025 percent senior notes 

  

the 2004 loss represents the unamortized fees from our 2002 credit agreement that were written off when we refinanced it in october 2004 

  

provision benefit for income taxes was an expense of 823 million in 2005 compared with a benefit of 445 million in 2004 reflecting effective tax rates of 426 and 339 respectively the change was primarily due to tax adjustments in 2005 which include income taxes associated with the repatriations under the american jobs creation act ajca excluding the effect of these tax adjustments which are discussed below the change from 2004 to 2005 is primarily a result of the mix of domestic income compared to income earned outside of the us dividends received from foreign operations and valuation allowance adjustments 

  

2005 tax adjustments of 217 million primarily includes charges of 319 million associated with repatriations net tax benefits of 192 million primarily related to agreement on certain prior year tax matters previously reserved and charges of 95 million associated with adjustments to deferred tax liabilities 

  

2004 tax adjustments of 710 million of benefits primarily includes a tax benefit of 386 million from an adjustment to income tax liabilities due to a december 2004 pronouncement from the internal revenue service “irs” a tax benefit of 311 million primarily related to valuation allowance adjustments and a tax benefit of 13 million resulting from a refund received from the irs 

  

discontinued operations net of income tax totaled a gain of 61 million in 2005 versus a loss of 154 million in 2004 the 2005 net gain includes income of 292 million related to completion of sale to the city of san jose california of approximately 52 acres of land used by our former defense systems operations primarily offsetting this income in 2005 were net environmental and legal charges of 234 million discontinued environmental and legal charges include environmental remediation costs at sites of discontinued businesses for which we are responsible for environmental compliance the charges in 2005 were primarily related to our front royal and middleport sites and in recognition of our share of liabilities related to a consent order between the epa and the primary responsible parties at the anniston site 

  

2004 charges primarily include amounts totaling 114 million to increase our reserves for environmental issues at two sites in new jersey and at our middleport new york site 

  

cumulative effect of change in accounting principle net of income tax  on december 31 2005 we adopted fasb interpretation no 47 “accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations” the cumulative effect of adoption was a charge of 05 million see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements 

  

net income decreased to 1166 million in 2005 compared with 1602 million in 2004 primarily as a result of changes in the aftertax items included in net income described above the change in these items was the primary driver behind the decrease in net income from 2004 to 2005 partially offsetting the decrease in net income in 2005 was higher earnings from our agricultural products specialty chemicals and industrial chemicals segments and a decrease in interest expense 

  

other financial data 

  

corporate expenses increased 12 percent to 451 million in 2005 from 403 million in the prior year mostly due to higher legal expense and higher employee costs 

  

other income and expense net is comprised primarily of lifo inventory adjustments pension expense and realized foreign currency gains and losses other income net increased to 139 million from 46 million in the prior year due to the impact of the lifo adjustment and gain related to the settlement of certain energy contracts in the first half of 2005 

  

segment results 2005 compared to 2004 

  

information about how each of these items relates to our businesses at the segment level and results by segment are discussed below and in note 19 to our consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k 

  

agricultural products 

  

   

revenue increased 3 percent versus the prior year driven by stronger insecticide and herbicide sales in south america asia and europe revenues in north america were lower compared with the prior year primarily due to the impact of generic bifenthrin competition 

  

segment earnings were 1248 million an increase of 5 percent from the year earlier as a result of the higher sales in south america asia and europe and the favorable impact of manufacturing productivity initiatives which more than offset the impact of generic bifenthrin competition in north america and higher raw material and energy costs 

  

specialty chemicals 

  

   

revenue increased by 4 percent versus the prior year driven by strong global demand and higher pricing in pharmaceutical polymer and energy storage markets for lithium sales in biopolymer were essentially level to a year ago as the timing of demand in the pharmaceutical and personal care markets offset increased demand in food ingredients 

  

segment earnings increased 12 percent versus the prior year the strong lithium performance improved results in the biopolymer food ingredients business and the benefits of biopolymer restructuring initiatives were partially offset by higher raw material and energy costs 

  

industrial chemicals 

  

   

revenue in industrial chemicals was 8704 million an increase of 7 percent versus the prior year higher soda ash sales accounted for the majority of the increase due to significant improvements in both domestic and export soda ash selling prices north american hydrogen peroxide and foret also benefited from higher selling prices during 2005 

  

segment earnings of 839 million increased 46 percent versus the prior year driven by higher selling prices across the group and improved earnings from astaris offset in part by the granger soda ash plant startup expenses and higher raw material energy and transportation costs 

  

prior to its divestiture in november astaris contributed approximately 11 million of income in 2005 reflecting improved pricing lower costs and the fullyear benefit of the restructuring completed in 2004

domestic credit agreement 

  

on june 21 2005 we executed a new 8500 million fiveyear credit agreement the “domestic credit agreement” which provided for a 6000 million revolving credit facility 2500 million of which is available for the issuance of letters of credit and a 2500 million term loan facility the initial borrowings under the domestic credit agreement which is unsecured were used to prepay all borrowings and terminate the previous 6000 million senior secured credit agreement the 2500 million term loan under the domestic credit agreement was prepaid on december 21 2005 with proceeds from the european credit agreement as described below no further borrowings are permitted under the term loan facility 

  

obligations under the domestic credit agreement bear interest at a floating rate which is at our option either a base rate or a london interbank offered rate “libor” plus an applicable margin the applicable margin is subject to adjustment based on the rating assigned to the revolving credit facility by each of moody’s investors service inc “moody’s” and standard  poor’s corporation “sp” at december 31 2006 the applicable margin on liborbased loans was 075 percent at december 31 2006 if we had borrowings under our domestic credit agreement then the applicable rate would have been 607 percent per annum 

  

in connection with entering into the domestic credit agreement we wrote off 12 million of deferred financing fees associated with our previous credit agreement and 06 million of fees associated with the new agreement in addition with the prepayment in december 2005 of the term loan under the domestic credit agreement we wroteoff 01 million of fees associated with that facility these fees were previously included as a component of “other assets” in our consolidated balance sheet and were recorded as “loss on extinguishment of debt” in the consolidated statements of income for the year ended december 31 2005 

  

european credit agreement 

  

on december 16 2005 our dutch finance subsidiary executed a new credit agreement the “european credit agreement” which provides for an unsecured revolving credit facility in the amount of €220000000 equivalent to approximately us260 million borrowings may be denominated in euros or us dollars fmc and our dutch finance subsidiary’s direct parent provide guarantees of amounts due under the european credit agreement 

  

loans under the european credit agreement bear interest at a eurocurrency base rate which for loans denominated in euros is the euro interbank offered rate and for loans denominated in dollars is libor in each case plus a margin the applicable margin under our european credit agreement is subject to adjustment based on the rating assigned to the facility or if the facility is not rated to fmc by each of moody’s and sp at december 31 2006 the applicable margin was 040 percent and the applicable borrowing rate under the european credit agreement was 412 percent per annum 

  

among other restrictions the domestic credit agreement and the european credit agreement contain financial covenants applicable to fmc and its consolidated subsidiaries related to leverage measured as the ratio of adjusted earnings to debt and interest coverage measured as the ratio of interest expense to adjusted earnings we were in compliance with all covenants at december 31 2006 

  

1025 percent senior notes redemption 

  

on july 21 2005 using proceeds of borrowings under the domestic credit agreement and cash on hand we redeemed all of our 1025 percent senior notes due 2009 outstanding in the aggregate principal amount of 

  

3550 million pursuant to the terms of the senior notes and the related indenture we paid a redemption premium of 440 million in connection with the redemption of our 1025 percent senior notes we wrote off 114 million of deferred financing fees these amounts along with the settlement of a related interest rate lock resulted in a “loss on the extinguishment of debt” of 566 million in the consolidated statements of income for the year ended december 31 2005 

  

sweetwater county industrial revenue bond refunding 

  

on december 15 2005 we refinanced 900 million aggregate principal amount of sweetwater county wyoming industrial revenue bonds issued in 1994 through a new industrial revenue bond issue in the same principal amount we reduced our average interest cost from 695 percent per annum to 560 percent per annum and extended the maturity date by 11 years the 1994 bonds were legally defeased by deposit with the trustee of the proceeds of the new bond issue and other funds provided by fmc and the bonds were subsequently redeemed with a 1 percent redemption premium on january 17 2006 this refinancing resulted in a charge of 21 million that is also included in “loss on extinguishment of debt” for the year ended december 31 2005 

  

at december 31 2006 we had 1964 million in us dollar equivalent revolving credit facility borrowings under the european credit agreement resulting in available funds of 917 million this facility was fully drawn at december 31 2005 

  

we had no borrowings under our domestic credit agreement at december 31 2006 and 2005 letters of credit outstanding under the domestic credit agreement totaled 1445 million and 1474 million at december 31 2006 and december 31 2005 respectively available funds under the domestic credit agreement were 4555 million at december 31 2006 and 4526 million at december 31 2005 

  

cash and cash equivalents at december 31 2006 and december 31 2005 were 1655 million and 2064 million respectively we had total debt of 6297 million and 7202 million at december 31 2006 and 2005 respectively this included 5235 million and 6398 million of longterm debt excluding current portions of 525 million and 09 million at december 31 2006 and 2005 respectively shortterm debt which consists primarily of foreign borrowings decreased to 537 million at december 31 2006 compared to 795 million at december 31 2005 the 647 million decrease in total longterm debt at december 31 2006 from december 31 2005 was primarily due to partial repayment of our european credit agreement offset by higher exchange rates for the euro against the us dollar 

  

statement of cash flows 

  

cash provided by operating activities was 3072 million for 2006 compared to 1996 million for 2005 and 2390 million for 2004 the increase in cash provided by operating activities in 2006 compared to 2005 reflected higher earnings from continuing operations and improved working capital management in inventories and accounts payable these were partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable balances the decrease in cash provided by operating activities in 2005 compared to 2004 was due to our reduction in the use of vendor finance guarantees coupled with a decrease in accounts payable which were offset by higher earnings 

  

cash required by operating activities of discontinued operations was 432 million for 2006 compared to cash provided of 174 million and cash required of 283 million in 2005 and 2004 respectively the decrease in 2006 compared to 2005 was due to higher environmental spending in 2006 and lower cash proceeds of 253 million from the sale of a portion of our san jose property in 2006 as compared to similar proceeds of 561 million in 2005 the majority of the spending for our discontinued operations is for environmental remediation on discontinued sites discontinued environmental spending was 441 million in 2006 compared to 244 million in 2005 and 205 million in 2004 

  

cash required by investing activities was 1098 million 64 million and 1146 million for the years ended december 31 2006 2005 and 2004 respectively the increase in cash required in 2006 was a result of 

  

lower asset sale proceeds primarily the asset sale of our former phosphorus joint venture astaris this sale coupled with the sale of our investment in sibelco was the primary reasons for the change from 2004 to 2005 

  

cash required by financing activities for 2006 was 1985 million compared to cash required of 2153 million in 2005 in 2004 cash provided by financing activities was 461 million the decrease in 2006 compared to 2005 was primarily due to the redemption of all of our 675 percent mediumterm notes due may 2005 and all of our 1025 percent senior notes due november 2009 the redemption of our 1025 percent senior notes included a redemption premium of 440 million partially offsetting this change was the repurchase of 922 million of common stock and the payment of 210 million in dividends in 2006 

  

for the years ended december 31 2006 2005 and 2004 we contributed approximately 235000 264000 and 136000 shares of treasury stock to our employee benefit plans having a cost of 173 million 149 million and 36 million respectively which is considered a noncash activity 

  

commitments and other potential liquidity needs 

  

our cash needs for 2007 include operating cash requirements capital expenditures scheduled mandatory payments of longterm debt dividend payments environmental spending and restructuring we plan to meet our liquidity needs through available cash cash generated from operations and borrowings under our 6000 million committed revolving credit facility 

  

we continually evaluate our options for divesting real estate holdings and property plant and equipment that are no longer integral to any of our core operating businesses 

  

projected 2007 spending includes approximately 450 million of environmental remediation spending this spending does not include expected spending of approximately 10 million in 2007 respectively on capital projects relating to environmental control facilities also we expect to spend in the range of approximately 25 million to 26 million annually in 2007 for environmental compliance costs which we will include as a component of cost of sales in our consolidated statements of income since these amounts are not covered by established reserves capital spending to expand maintain or replace equipment at our production facilities may trigger requirements for upgrading our environmental controls which may increase our spending for environmental controls above the foregoing projections 

  

we have historically made voluntary pension payments and plan to make payments totaling approximately 30 million in 2007 we also have executive severance guidelines and changes of control arrangements which are described in our proxy statement 

  

on february 24 2006 our board of directors approved the initiation of a quarterly cash dividend of 018 per share in 2006 we declared dividends totaling 278 million additionally the board authorized the repurchase of up to 150 million of our common stock shares may be purchased through open market or privately negotiated transactions at the discretion of management based on its evaluation of market conditions and other factors although the repurchase program does not include a specific timetable or price targets and may be suspended or terminated at any time we expect that the program will be accomplished over the next year during 2006 we repurchased 1414389 shares at an aggregate cost of 900 million under this program 

  

in 2001 we split fmc into separate chemical and machinery companies and we refer to the spunoff company fmc technologies inc as “technologies” throughout this annual report we agreed to guarantee the performance by technologies of a debt instrument see note 18 to the consolidated financial statements in this form 10k as of december 31 2006 these guaranteed obligations totaled 24 million compared to 32 million at december 31 2005 

  

we guarantee repayment of some of the borrowings of certain foreign equity method investments the other investment owners provided parallel agreements we also guarantee the repayment of the borrowing of a minority partner in a foreign affiliate that we consolidate in our financial statements as of december 31 2006 these guarantees had maximum potential payments of 82 million 

  

we also provide guarantees to the financial institutions on behalf of certain agricultural product customers principally in brazil for their seasonal borrowing the total of these guarantees was 256 million and 304 million at december 31 2006 and 2005 respectively these guarantees are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets for each date as guarantees of vendor financing 

  

shortterm debt consisted of foreign credit lines at december 31 2006 and december 31 2005 we provide parentcompany guarantees to lending institutions providing credit to our foreign subsidiaries 

  

our total significant committed contracts that we believe will affect cash over the next four years and beyond are as follows 

  

       

contingencies 

  

when technologies was split from us in 2001 we entered into a tax sharing agreement wherein each company is obligated for those taxes associated with its respective business generally determined as if each company filed its own consolidated combined or unitary tax returns for any period where technologies is included in the consolidated combined or unitary tax return of us or our subsidiaries the statute of limitations for the 2001 us federal income tax year has now closed and no questions regarding the spinoff were raised during the irs audit for 20002001 therefore any liability for taxes if the spinoff of technologies were not tax free due to an action taken by technologies has been favorably concluded the tax sharing agreement continues to be in force with respect to certain items which we do not believe would have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

  

during 2004 we reached agreement in principle with the epa and the us department of justice to settle certain liabilities at two environmental remediation sites in new jersey a consent decree was negotiated and agreed and became final upon entry by the court in early october 2006 requiring a payment by the company in the amount of 18 million 

  

on october 14 2003 solutia our joint venture partner in astaris filed a lawsuit against us with the circuit court of st louis county missouri claiming that among other things we had breached our joint venture agreement due to the alleged failure of the ppa technology we contributed to astaris and also failed to disclose the information we had about the ppa technology solutia dismissed this missouri lawsuit in february 2004 after it had filed a virtually identical lawsuit in the us bankruptcy court in the southern district of new york solutia had filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in that same court on december 17 2003 our motion to remove the lawsuit from bankruptcy court was granted on june 18 2004 and the matter is now pending in us district court for the southern district of new york on march 29 2005 the court dismissed certain of the claims relating to the alleged failure of the ppa technology for lack of standing on the part of solutia the ppa technology was not included in the sale to icl described in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements in this form 10k and will continue to be owned by astaris now known as siratsa llc a trial in this matter is scheduled to occur in april 2007 although the court has rejected solutia’s demand for a jury 

  

on january 28 2005 we and our wholly owned subsidiary foret received a statement of objections from the european commission concerning alleged violations of competition law in the hydrogen peroxide business in europe during the period 1994 to 2001 all of the significant european hydrogen peroxide producers also received the statement of objections we and foret responded to the statement of objections in april 2005 and a hearing on the matter was held at the end of june 2005 on may 3 2006 we received a notice from the european commission indicating that the commission has imposed a fine on us in the amount of €250 million as a result of alleged violations during the period 19971999 in connection with this fine we recorded an expense of us 300 million in our consolidated statements of income this expense is included as a component of restructuring and other charges both we and foret have appealed the decision of the commission during the appeal process interest accrues on the fine at a variable rate which as of december 31 2006 was 41 percent per annum we have provided a bank letter of credit in favor of the european commission to guarantee our payment of the fine and accrued interest at december 31 2006 the amount of the letter of credit was €260 million us 340 million 

  

we also received a subpoena for documents from a grand jury sitting in the northern district of california which is investigating anticompetitive conduct in the hydrogen peroxide business in the united states during the period 1994 through 2003 at this time we do not believe the investigations are related in connection with these two matters in february 2005 putative class action complaints were filed against all of the us hydrogen peroxide producers in various federal courts alleging violations of antitrust laws federal law provides that persons who have been injured by violations of federal antitrust law may recover three times their actual damage plus attorney fees related cases were also filed in various state courts all of the federal court cases were consolidated in the united states district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania philadelphia the district court certified the class in january 2007 most of the state court cases have been dismissed although some remain in california in addition putative class actions have been filed in provincial courts in ontario quebec and british columbia under the laws of canada 

  

another antitrust class action previously brought in federal court in the eastern district of pennsylvania alleging violations of antitrust laws involving our microcrystalline cellulose product was settled for 250 million the same amount paid by our codefendant asahi kasei corporation the court approved this settlement in november 2006 the claims of plaintiffs who opted out of the class settlement were also settled late in 2006 for 07 million two related state court cases remain pending in california and tennessee 

  

we have certain other contingent liabilities arising from litigation claims performance guarantees and other commitments incident to the ordinary course of business based on information currently available and established reserves the ultimate resolution of our known contingencies including the matters described in note 18 to the consolidated financial statements is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or liquidity however there can be no assurance that the outcome of these contingencies will be favorable and adverse results in certain of these contingencies could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or liquidity 

  

offbalance sheet arrangements 

  

we do not have any significant offbalance sheet arrangements that are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources 

  

dividends 

  

on february 24 2006 our board of directors approved the initiation of a quarterly cash dividend of 018 per share in 2006 we declared dividends aggregating 278 million to our shareholders of record of this amount 68 million is included in accrued and other liabilities on the condensed consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2006 we paid no cash dividend in 2005 or 2004

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend   

our earnings cash flows and financial position are exposed to market risks relating to fluctuations in commodity prices interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates our policy is to minimize exposure to our cash flow over time caused by changes in commodity interest and currency exchange rates to accomplish this we have implemented a controlled program of risk management consisting of appropriate derivative contracts entered into with major financial institutions 

  

the analysis below presents the sensitivity of the market value of our financial instruments to selected changes in market rates and prices the range of changes chosen reflects our view of changes that are reasonably possible over a oneyear period marketvalue estimates are based on the present value of projected future cash flows considering the market rates and prices chosen we calculate the market value foreign currency risk using thirdparty software incorporating standard pricing models to determine the present value of the instruments based on market conditions spot and forward foreign exchange rates as of the valuation date we obtain estimates of the market value energy price risk from calculations performed internally and by a third party 

  

at december 31 2006 our net financial instrument position was a net liability of 248 million compared to a net asset of 232 million at december 31 2005 the change in the net financial instrument position was due to larger unrealized losses in our commodity portfolio attributable to lower market prices relative to our hedged prices 

  

commodity price risk 

  

energy costs are approximately 12 percent of our cost of sales and services and are well balanced among coal electricity and natural gas and to a lesser extent oil we attempt to mitigate our exposure to increasing energy costs by hedging the cost of natural gas and oil to analyze the effect of changing energy prices we have performed a sensitivity analysis in which we assume an instantaneous 10 percent change in energy market prices from their levels at december 31 2006 and december 31 2005 with all other variables including interest rates held constant a 10 percent increase in energy market prices would result in a decrease of the net liability position of 136 million at december 31 2006 compared to a 165 million increase in the net asset position at december 31 2005 a 10 percent decrease in energy market prices would result in an increase of 136 million in the net liability position at december 31 2006 a 10 percent decrease in energy market prices would result in a decrease of 165 million in the net asset position at december 31 2005 

  

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

  

the primary currencies for which we have exchange rate exposure are the us dollar versus the euro the euro versus the norwegian krone the us dollar versus the japanese yen and the us dollar versus the brazilian real foreign currency debt and foreign exchange forward contracts are used in countries where we do business thereby reducing our net asset exposure foreign exchange forward contracts are also used to hedge firm and highly anticipated foreign currency cash flows 

  

to analyze the effects of changing foreign currency rates we have performed a sensitivity analysis in which we assume an instantaneous 10 percent change in the foreign currency exchange rates from their levels at december 31 2006 and december 31 2005 with all other variables including interest rates held constant a 10 percent strengthening of hedged currencies versus our functional currencies would have resulted in a decrease of 194 million in the net asset position and as a result would have changed the net asset position into a net liability position at december 31 2006 a 10 percent strengthening of hedged currencies versus our functional currencies would have resulted in a decrease of 93 million in the net asset position and as a result would have changed the net asset position into a net liability position at december 31 2005 a 10 percent weakening of hedged currencies versus our functional currencies would have resulted in an increase of 179 million in the net asset position at december 31 2006 compared to an increase of 79 million in the net asset position at december 31 2005 

  

interest rate risk 

  

one of the strategies that we use to manage interest rate exposure is to enter into interest rate swap agreements in these agreements we agree to exchange at specified intervals the difference between fixed and variable interest amounts calculated on an agreedupon notional principal amount in 2003 we entered into swaps with an aggregate notional value of 1000 million in 2005 we terminated these swaps at a net cost of 27 million and redeemed the underlying debt as of december 31 2006 we had no interest rate swap agreements 

  

our debt portfolio at december 31 2006 is composed of 54 percent fixedrate debt and 46 percent variablerate debt the variablerate component of our debt portfolio principally consists of foreign bank borrowings and variablerate industrial and pollution control revenue bonds and borrowings under our european credit agreement changes in interest rates affect different portions of our variablerate debt portfolio in different ways 

  

based on the variablerate debt in our debt portfolio at december 31 2006 a one percentage point increase or decrease in interest rates then in effect would have increased or decreased interest expense for 2006 by 29 million

 item 1 business tableend   

general 

  

we are a diversified global chemical company providing innovative solutions applications and marketleading products to a wide variety of end markets we operate in three distinct business segments agricultural products specialty chemicals and industrial chemicals our agricultural products segment primarily focuses on insecticides which are used in agriculture to enhance crop yield and quality by controlling a broad spectrum of pests and for pest control for nonagricultural applications and on herbicides which are used to reduce the need for manual or mechanical weeding by inhibiting or preventing weed growth specialty chemicals consists of our biopolymer and lithium businesses and focuses on food ingredients that are used to enhance texture structure and physical stability pharmaceutical additives for binding and disintegrant applications and lithium specialties for pharmaceutical synthesis specialty polymers and energy storage our industrial chemicals segment manufactures a wide range of inorganic materials including soda ash hydrogen peroxide specialty peroxygens and phosphorus chemicals 

  

the following table shows the principal products produced by our three business segments and their raw materials and uses 

  

   

we have operations in many areas around the world north america represents our single largest geographic market generating approximately 40 percent of revenue in 2005 with our second largest market europe middle east and africa representing 29 percent and latin america our third largest representing 18 percent of 2005 revenue with a worldwide manufacturing and distribution infrastructure we are able to respond rapidly to global customer needs offset downward economic trends in one region with positive trends in another and better match revenues to local costs to mitigate the impact of currency volatility the charts below detail our sales and longlived assets by major geographic region 

  

  

our strategy 

  

our corporate strategy is balanced between driving growth and innovation within our specialty chemicals and agricultural products segments and generating strong cash flow in our industrial chemicals segment our longterm objectives are as follows 

  

realize the operating leverage inherent in our businesses we intend to maximize earnings growth and return on capital by maintaining our market positions reducing costs and prudently managing our asset base in soda ash we continually strive to optimize our proprietary and lowcost solution mining and longwall mining techniques thereby reducing our production costs which we believe are already the lowest in the industry in hydrogen peroxide we have shutdown higher cost production capacity to improve profitability these initiatives have positioned our industrial chemicals business to benefit from the significant economic recovery as capacity utilizations improve and selling prices continue to move higher additionally in agricultural products we continue to reduce manufacturing costs by outsourcing production to third parties in mexico china and india and are already benefiting from additional savings from our efforts to streamline our supply chain and reduce logistics costs 

  

maintain financial flexibility in 2005 we achieved our goal of reestablishing an investmentgrade credit profile through improvements to our liquidity and a significant reduction in our indebtedness the series of refinancing steps taken in 2005 were directed toward achieving our capital structure objectives of maintaining strong liquidity and continuous access to capital markets lowering aftertax financing costs on a worldwide basis and providing flexibility for future corporate initiatives we expect continued sustained growth in our operating profit and resulting cash provided by operating activities furthermore we expect capital expenditures to remain below depreciation and amortization as our businesses will meet future expected demand growth through a combination of debottlenecking current production restarting mothballed plants and outsourcing production to third parties additionally as compared to 2004 and 2005 levels we believe our spending for the shutdown and remediation of the former elemental phosphorus facility in pocatello idaho will be significantly reduced in 2006 

  

and thereafter lastly we continue to explore asset sale opportunities such as the sale of our former defense system site in san jose california from which we realized net proceeds of 561 million in february 2005 out of an anticipated total net proceeds of approximately 75 million 

  

focus the portfolio on higher growth businesses our goal is to achieve the highest overall growth while continuing to generate returns above our cost of capital in this regard we intend to focus on building upon our core franchises in the pharmaceutical food ingredient energy storage insecticide and herbicide markets that exist within the specialty chemicals and agricultural products segments internal development will continue to be a core element of our growth strategy our biopolymer business is developing new pharmaceutical delivery systems such as nrobe ® technology and working closely with top global food companies in the development of new health and convenience foods our lithium business is developing applications for energy storage markets to serve the rapid growth in global demand for handheld electronic devices we expect external development to become a greater component of our growth product or business acquisitions inlicensing and equity ventures are strategic options to enhance our technology offerings broaden our market access and extend our geographic footprint for example agricultural products employs a strategy focused on selected products markets and geographies where increasingly growth will be sourced via product acquisitions inlicensing and strategic alliances that extend the group’s market presence or expand its geographic penetration each growth opportunity will be evaluated in the context of continued value creation for our shareholders including the degree to which they complement one of our existing franchises generate substantial synergies and be accretive to earnings in addition we intend to divest any business that cannot sustain a return above its cost of capital in november 2005 astaris llc now known as siratsa llc our 50 owned phosphorus joint venture completed the sale of the majority of its assets to israel chemicals limited

agricultural products provides a wide range of proprietary branded products—based on both patented and offpatent technologies—for global agricultural and structural pest control turf and ornamental markets product branding is a prevalent industry practice used to help maintain and grow market share by promoting consumer recognition and product and supplier reputation agricultural products enjoys relatively strong niche positions in crop and noncrop market segments in the americas europe and other parts of the world and derived approximately 72 percent of its revenue from outside north america in 2005 

  

in contrast to most other major crop protection companies insecticides dominate our agricultural products segment particularly pyrethroid and carbamate chemistries in which we maintain leading market positions based on revenues pyrethroids are a major class of insecticides whose efficient application rates and cost competitiveness are differentiated compared to most other classes of insecticides they are most effective against worm pests carbamates are a broad spectrum of insecticides used to control a wide variety of pests in both soil and foliage our proprietary herbicides primarily target niche uses and control a wide variety of difficulttocontrol weeds we differentiate ourselves through a highly focused strategy in selected crops and regions and leverage our proprietary chemistries pestspecific research and development rd and selected technologies accessed from third party producers to develop and market new pesticides and new applications of our existing products 

  

the following table summarizes the principal product chemistries in agricultural products and the principal uses of each chemistry 

  

   

we have a growing number of agreements with thirdparty pesticide producers under which we work together to market and distribute existing and new pesticide chemistries in various markets these proprietary chemistries and technologies are complementary to our existing products and market strategy the new chemistries include flonicamid a unique insecticide for controlling sucking pests a novel fungicide for crop and noncrop uses in the americas and acetamiprid for pest control markets in north america we have significantly enhanced our market access capabilities in key european markets by jointly investing with ishihara sangyo kaisha ltd isk in the belgianbased pesticide distribution company belchim crop protection nv through these and other alliances along with our own targeted marketing efforts and access to novel technologies we expect to enhance our access to key agricultural and noncrop markets and develop new products that will help us continue to compete effectively 

  

we maintain competitive manufacturing cost positions through our strategy of sourcing raw materials intermediates and finished products from third parties in lowercost manufacturing regions such as china india and mexico this strategy has resulted in significant annual cost savings and lower capital spending and has reduced the fixed capital intensity of the business this initiative is expected to produce additional cost savings over the next several years 

  

growth 

  

over the near term we plan to grow by obtaining new and approved uses for existing product lines and accessing developing marketing andor distributing and selling complementary chemistries andor related technologies from third parties in order to enhance our current product portfolio and our capabilities to effectively service our target markets and customers over the next several years growth is anticipated from our proprietary herbicides and newlyaccessed third party chemistries andor technologies for example our carfentrazoneethyl herbicide has received recent registrations for use as a cotton defoliation agent and weed control on numerous specialty crop segments in north america and as a desiccant on potatoes and tiller control on vines in europe in addition the apparent emergence and spread of herbicideresistant weeds and shifts in weed populations in genetically modified crops provide growth opportunities for our proprietary herbicide chemistries 

  

we also believe that growth will result from products andor technologies inlicensed from our network of alliance partners for example in 2006 we plan to commercially launch flonicamid an insecticide licensed from isk which has a novel mode of action in controlling sucking pests in a broad range of crops as well as noncrop uses flonicamid received its first registration in key agricultural crops from the united states environmental protection agency epa during 2005 we already have epa registration for noncrop uses such as in nurseries 

  

and greenhouses also in 2006 we plan to launch acetamiprid a rapidlygrowing class of insecticide chemistry licensed from nippon soda company ltd for use in the us termite and general household pest segments acetamiprid has demonstrated outstanding activity against an array of pests including termites ants and roaches 

  

industry overview 

  

the three principal categories of agricultural chemicals are herbicides representing approximately half of global industry revenue insecticides representing approximately a quarter of global industry revenue and fungicides representing most of the remaining portion of global industry revenue 

  

insecticides are used to control a wide range of insects including chewing pests such as caterpillars and sucking pests such as aphids insecticides are applied as sprays dusts or granules and are used on a wide variety of crops such as fruits vegetables cotton soybean maize and cereals there are several major classes of insecticide chemistries including organophosphates carbamates pyrethroids and neonicotinoids 

  

herbicides prevent or inhibit weed growth thereby reducing or eliminating the need for manual or mechanical weeding herbicides can be selective killing only specific unwanted foliage or nonselective killing all foliage and are also segmented by their time of application preplanting preemergent and postemergent 

  

the agrochemicals industry has undergone significant consolidation over the past ten years leading crop protection companies syngenta ag bayer ag monsanto company basf ag the dow chemical company and e i du pont de nemours and company dupont currently represent more 70 percent of global sales significant drivers for this consolidation have been the advent of biotechnology particularly in herbicides employed in row crops and the escalation of research and development and marketing costs 

  

the next tier of agrochemical producers including fmc makteshimagan industries ltd sumitomo chemical company limited isk and nufarm limited and cheminova ltd generally employ various differentiated strategies and compete by 1 unique technologies 2 focusing on certain crops markets and geographies andor 3 on lower cost positions some of these producers are generic competitors with little or no investment in innovation additionally there is a growing trend among these producers to partner with one another to gain economies of scale and competitive market access more comparable to larger competitors

the following chart summarizes the major markets for various lithium products 

  

   

industry overview 

  

food ingredients 

  

our biopolymer business serves the texture structure and physical stability tsps ingredients market tsps ingredients impart physical properties to thicken and stabilize foods there are many types of tsps ingredients and a wide range of food groups served including bakery meats dairy and convenience products the industry is dispersed geographically with the majority of the sales in europe north america and asia 

  

trends driving growth include increasing consumer interest in healthier foods greater convenience and growth in per capita consumption of processed foods in emerging markets the industry’s revenue growth has moderated in recent years due to increased price pressure in most segments the trend toward health and convenience drives the need for more functional ingredients to impart desired food tastes and textures we believe carrageenan and mcc which address this need are growing faster than the overall tsps market the global customer base for tsps is relatively fragmented and includes large and small food processors consolidation among these customers has been a significant trend over the past several years mergers of large food companies have included slimfast foods companybestfoodsunilever plc nabisco group holdings corpkraft foods inc the pillsbury companygeneral mills inc and suiza foods corporationdean foods company in light of these conditions tsps ingredient suppliers such as us have focused on establishing alliances with market leaders with the goal of reducing costs leveraging technology and expanding product offerings with key accounts 

  

within the entire food ingredients market there are a relatively large number of suppliers due principally to the broad spectrum of chemistries employed segment leadership global position and investment in technology are key factors to sustaining profitability in addition larger suppliers may often provide a broader product line and a range of services to food companies including functional systems or blends the top suppliers of tsps ingredients include danisco as dupont jm huber kerry ingredients cargill incorporated sobel nv dgf stoess ag fmc degussa ag and tate  lyle plc 

  

pharmaceutical chemicals 

  

our biopolymer business sells into the formulation chemicals segment of the pharmaceutical market the major end markets for formulation chemicals include coatings and colors fillers binders sweeteners and flavors disintegrants and others 

  

competitors tend to be grouped by chemistry our principal mcc competitors in pharmaceuticals include j rettenmaier  sôhne gmbh ming tai chemical co ltd asahi kasei corporation and blanver farmoquimica ltda while pricing pressure from low cost producers is a common competitive dynamic companies like us offset that pressure by providing the most reliable and broadest range of products and services customers of excipients are pharmaceutical firms who depend upon reliable therapeutic performance of their drug products 

  

we also supply alginates mcc and carrageenan into oral care cosmetics and health care markets highly refined extracts from selected seaweeds provide a broad range of alginate functionality including uses in antireflux disorders dental impressions control release of drugs and wound dressings special grades of carrageenan extracts are used in liquid cough medicines toothpaste and a variety of skin care products 

  

lithium specialties 

  

lithium is a highly versatile metal with diverse enduse markets including glassceramics aluminum production pharmaceuticals polymers and both rechargeable and disposable batteries 

  

we market a wide variety of lithiumbased products ranging from upstream commodity lithium carbonate to highly specialized downstream products such as organolithium compounds and cathodic materials for batteries in past years lithium carbonate experienced a significant price decline due largely to industry oversupply during 2005 market pricing improved as a result of a better balance of supply and demand for lithium carbonate 

  

there are only three integrated producers of lithium chemetall sa sociedad quimica y minera de chile sa and fmc all of which produce lithium carbonate only two chemetell and fmc produce specialty grades of lithium new entry into the specialty lithium markets is difficult due to the level of proprietary processes and product technology involved the markets for specialty lithium products tend to be concentrated in more developed regions including north america europe and asia 

  

industrial chemicals 

  

financial information in millions 

  

  

overview 

  

our industrial chemicals segment which represents 40 percent of our 2005 consolidated revenues has lowcost positions in high volume inorganic chemicals including soda ash and hydrogen peroxide complemented by high value niche positions in specialty alkali phosphorus and peroxygen products 

  

products and markets 

  

  

industrial chemicals serves a diverse group of markets from economically sensitive industrial sectors to technologyintensive specialty markets we process and sell refined inorganic products that are sought by customers for their critical reactivity or specific functionality in markets such as paper pulp glass and detergents in addition we produce purify and market higher value downstream derivatives into specialized and customerspecific applications these applications include animal nutrition biocides and electronics 

  

alkali 

  

our alkali chemical division produces natural soda ash soda ash is used by manufacturers in glass chemical processing and detergent industries to lesser degrees we also produce sodium bicarbonate caustic soda and sodium sesquicarbonate the majority of our alkali sales are manufactured by and sold through fmc wyoming corporation which we manage as an integral part of our alkali business and in which we own shares representing an 875 percent economic interest with the remaining shares held by two japanese companies 

  

we mine and produce natural soda ash using proprietary lowcost mining technologies such as longwall and solution mining which we believe give us the lowest cost position our two production sites in green river wyoming have the capacity to produce approximately 485 million tons of soda ash annually with approximately one million tons of this capacity currently mothballed in 2005 the us soda ash industry was essentially sold out as a result of this condition in 2005 we restarted 250000 tons of previously mothballed capacity to meet the increase in demand driven by the growth in export markets 

  

peroxygens 

  

we produce hydrogen peroxide at production facilities in the united states canada and mexico and as described below through our whollyowned foret subsidiary in spain and the netherlands we also participate in a joint venture company in thailand we sell hydrogen peroxide into the pulp and paper industry and to a lesser extent in the chemical processing environmental electronics and food industries we are a leading north american producer of hydrogen peroxide due in part to our broad product line geographicallyadvantaged plant locations stateoftheart processing technology and superior customer service hydrogen peroxide represents approximately 75 percent of our peroxygens sales 

  

our specialty peroxygens business supplies persulfate products primarily to polymer and printed circuit board markets and peracetic acid predominately to the food industry for biocidal applications typically we compete as a specialty player where we believe that we are differentiated by our strong technical expertise unique process technology and geographic location 

  

foret 

  

our european subsidiary fmc foret sa foret headquartered near barcelona spain is a leading provider of chemical products to the detergent paper textile tanning and chemical industries foret operates seven manufacturing facilities across europe with market positions in phosphates hydrogen peroxide perborates percarbonates sulfur derivatives zeolites and sodium sulfate foret’s sales efforts are focused in europe africa south america via tripoliven our venezualan jointventure and the middle east 

  

industry overview 

  

we primarily participate in three product areas soda ash peroxygens and phosphorus chemicals these products are generally inorganicbased produced from minerals or air and generally are commodities that in many cases have few cost effective substitutes growth is typically a function of gdp or the rate of industrialization in key export markets pricing tends to reflect the shortterm supply and demand balance as producers add or reduce capacity andor demand changes 

  

soda ash 

  

soda ash is a highly alkaline inorganic chemical essential in the production of glass and widely used in the production of chemicals soaps and detergents and many other products natural soda ash is generally produced from trona a natural form of sodium sesquicarbonate through mining and chemical processing soda ash may also be produced synthetically but this process requires a significant amount of energy and produces large quantities of waste byproducts making it much less costeffective than natural soda ash production 

  

because of the processing cost advantages of trona and the large natural reserves of trona in the us particularly in green river wyoming all us soda ash production is natural by contrast due to a lack of trona the majority of the soda ash that is manufactured in the rest of the world is produced synthetically other us producers are oci chemical corporation solvay sa the general chemical group inc and searles valley minerals 

  

approximately 42 percent of us soda ash production served export markets in 2005 with approximately 32 percent of us soda ash production exported through the american natural soda ash corporation “ansac” ansac is the foreign sales association of the significant us soda ash producers established in 1983 under the webbpomerene act and subsequent legislation since its creation ansac has been successful in coordinating soda ash exports exploiting the inherent cost benefits of us produced natural soda ash and leveraging its large scale of operations to the benefit of its member companies us exports of soda ash have risen significantly over the last 20 years 

  

peroxygens 

  

hydrogen peroxide is typically sold for use as a bleach or oxidizer as such it often competes with other chemicals capable of performing similar functions some of our specialty peroxygen derivatives eg persulfates perborates percarbonates also function as bleaching or oxidizing agents environmental regulations regional cost differences often due to transportation costs and technical differences in product performance factor into the decision to use hydrogen peroxide or one of its derivatives rather than another product since these considerations vary by region the consumption patterns vary in different parts of the world hydrogen peroxide is sold in aqueous solutions usually 35 percent 50 percent or 70 percent by weight 

  

the north american pulp and paper industry represents approximately 70 percent of north american demand for hydrogen peroxide in this market hydrogen peroxide is used as an environmentally friendly bleaching agent to brighten chemical mechanical and recycled pulps as well as treat a wide range of mill pollutants in the waste stream the north american paper market is mature and new investment in pulp and paper capacity is largely focused in asia and south america as a result hydrogen peroxide demand growth has slowed to a 12 per year rate after rapid growth in the early to mid 1990’s north american hydrogen peroxide capacity utilization has improved to the low 90 percent range from as low as the mid70 percent range in 1998 prices have gradually increased since 2002 and increased significantly in 2005 to offset the unprecedented energy price increases the other north american hydrogen peroxide producers are akzo nobel nv arkema degussa ag kemira ovj and solvay sa 

  

phosphorous chemicals 

  

we participate in this business in europe the middle east south america and africa through foret major competitors include rhodia sa prayon rupel sa and chinese producers 

  

phosphorous chemicals are used in many industrial applications in a wide array of chemical compounds overall growth in demand for phosphorous chemicals tends to correlate with gdp purified phosphoric acid ppa and phosphate salts eg sodium phosphates and calcium phosphates are sold into many markets including detergents cleaning compounds and animal feed 

  

the basic input material for making phosphates is now produced using two processes most industrial applications use the costeffective process that involves making ppa by the purification of fertilizergrade phosphoric acid thermal phosphoric acid long the industry standard is produced from elemental phosphorus but is more costly due to energy and environmental compliance costs and is now used mainly in limited applications elemental phosphorus is still produced by thermphos in the netherlands and in several other countries including china 

  

worldwide demand for phosphorous chemicals declined in the early 1990s as detergents containing phosphates for homelaundry use were banned in north america and parts of europe beginning in the late 1990s reduced demand the shift in growth toward developing regions and the advent of new technology resulted in a significant restructuring of the phosphorus chemicals industry as producers consolidated or exited the business 

  

over the next few years industrial demand for phosphorous chemicals is expected to improve driven by growing demand in the detergent industry in newly industrializing nations 

  

source and availability of raw materials 

  

our raw material requirements vary by business segment and include mineralrelated natural resources trona ore and lithium brines processed chemicals seaweed specialty wood pulp and energy sources such as oil gas coal and electricity raw materials represented approximately 24 percent of our 2005 cost of sales and services and no one raw material represented more than 9 percent of our total raw material purchases 

  

ores used in industrial chemicals manufacturing processes such as trona are extracted from mines in the us on property held by us under longterm leases subject to periodic adjustment of royalty rates raw materials used by specialty chemicals include lithium carbonate the majority of which is obtained from a south american manufacturer under a longterm sourcing agreement various types of seaweed that are sourced on a global basis and specialty wood pulp which is mainly purchased from several north american producers raw materials used by agricultural products primarily processed chemicals are obtained from a variety of suppliers worldwide 

  

patents 

  

we own a number of us and foreign patents trademarks and licenses that are cumulatively important to our business we do not believe that the loss of any one or group of related patents trademarks or licenses would have a material adverse effect on the overall business of fmc the duration of our patents depends on their respective jurisdictions their expiration dates range through 2025 

  

seasonality 

  

the seasonal nature of the crop protection market and the geographic spread of the agricultural products business can result in significant variations in quarterly earnings agricultural products sold into the northern hemisphere north america europe and parts of asia serve seasonal agricultural markets from march through september generally resulting in earnings in the first second and third quarters markets in the southern hemisphere latin america and parts of the asia pacific region including australia are served from july through february generally resulting in earnings in the third fourth and first quarters the remainder of our businesses is generally not subject to significant seasonal fluctuations 

  

competition 

  

we have a number one or number two market position in many of our product lines based on revenue either globally or in north america largely as a result of our product offerings proprietary technologies and our position as a lowcost producer the following product lines accounted for the majority of our 2005 consolidated revenue market positions are based on the most recently available revenue data 

  

    

we encounter substantial competition in each of our three business segments this competition is expected to continue in both the united states and markets outside of the united states we market our products through our own sales organization and through independent distributors and sales representatives the number of our principal competitors varies from segment to segment in general we compete by operating in a costefficient manner and by leveraging our industry experience to provide advanced technology high product quality and reliability and quality customer and technical service 

  

our agricultural products segment competes primarily in the global crop protection market for insecticides and herbicides the industry is characterized by a relatively small number of large competitors and a large number of smaller often regional competitors such as fmc industry products include crop protection chemicals and for certain major competitors genetically engineered crop biotechnology products competition from generic producers has increased as a significant number of product patents have expired in the last decade in general we compete as an innovator by focusing on product development and by licensing chemistries and technologies from alliance partners when these products complement our product portfolio and geographic focus we also differentiate ourselves by reacting quickly in key markets achieving global costcompetitiveness via our manufacturing strategies establishing effective product stewardship programs and developing strategic alliances that strengthen market access in key countries and regions 

  

with significant positions in markets that include alginate carrageenan microcrystalline cellulose and lithiumbased products specialty chemicals competes on the basis of product differentiation customer service and price biopolymer competes with both direct suppliers of cellulose and seaweed extract as well as suppliers 

  

of other hydrocolloids which may provide similar functionality in specific applications in microcrystalline cellulose competitors are typically smaller than us while in seaweed extracts alginates we compete with other broadbased chemical companies we and each of our two most significant competitors in lithium extract the element from naturally occurring lithiumrich brines located in the andes mountains of argentina and chile which are believed to be the world’s most significant and lowest cost sources of lithium 

  

industrial chemicals serves the soda ash markets worldwide peroxygens markets predominantly in north america and europe and phosphorus markets in europe the middle east and africa in north america our soda ash business competes with four domestic producers of natural soda ash three of which operate in the vicinity of our mine and processing facility in green river wyoming outside of the us canada and europe we sell soda ash mainly through ansac internationally our natural soda ash competes with synthetic soda ash manufactured by numerous producers ranging from integrated multinational companies to smaller regional companies we maintain a leading position in the north american market for hydrogen peroxide there are currently five firms competing in the hydrogen peroxide market in north america the primary competitive factor affecting the sales of soda ash and hydrogen peroxide is price we seek to maintain our competitive position by employing low cost processing technology at foret we possess strong cost and market positions in phosphates perborates peroxygens zeolites and sulfur derivatives in each of these markets we face significant competition from a range of multinational and regional chemical producers competition in phosphorus chemicals is based primarily on price and to a lesser degree product differentiation 

  

research and development expense 

  

we perform research and development in all of our segments with the majority of our efforts focused in the agricultural products segment the product development efforts in the agricultural products segment focus on developing environmentally sound solutions that costeffectively increase farmers’ yields and provide alternatives to insectresistant chemistries our research and development expenses in the last three years are set forth below 

  

   

environmental laws and regulations 

  

we are subject to various federal state local and foreign environmental laws and regulations that govern emissions of air pollutants discharges of water pollutants and the manufacture storage handling and disposal of hazardous substances hazardous wastes and other toxic materials and remediation of contaminated sites we are also subject to liabilities arising under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla and similar state laws that impose responsibility on persons who arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances and on current and previous owners and operators of a facility for the cleanup of hazardous substances released from the facility into the environment in addition we are subject to liabilities under the resource conservation and recovery act rcra and analogous state laws that require owners and operators of facilities that treat store or dispose of hazardous waste to follow certain waste management practices and to clean up releases of hazardous waste into the environment associated with past or present practices 

  

we have been named a potentially responsible party or prp at 30 sites on the federal government’s national priority list in addition we also have received notice from the epa or other regulatory agencies that 

  

we may be a prp or prp equivalent at other sites including 44 sites at which we have determined that it is reasonably possible that we have an environmental liability in cooperation with appropriate government agencies we are currently participating in or have participated in a remedial investigationfeasibility study rifs or its equivalent at most of the identified sites with the status of each investigation varying from site to site at certain sites a rifs has only recently begun providing limited information if any relating to cost estimates timing or the involvement of other prps whereas at other sites the studies are complete remedial action plans have been chosen or a record of decision rod has been issued 

  

environmental liabilities include obligations relating to waste handling and the remediation andor study of sites at which we are alleged to have released or disposed of hazardous substances these sites include current operations previously operated sites and sites associated with discontinued operations we have provided reserves for potential environmental obligations that we consider probable and for which a reasonable estimate of the obligation could be made as of december 31 2005 our total environmental reserve after accounting for recoveries which represent the probable realization of claims from third parties which we estimate at 207 million was 1704 million compared to 1802 million at december 31 2004 after accounting for recoveries of 121 million in addition we have estimated that reasonably possible environmental loss contingencies may exceed this reserve by as much as 85 million at december 31 2005 

  

employees 

  

we employ approximately 5000 people with approximately 2700 people in our domestic operations and 2300 people in our foreign operations approximately 30 percent of our usbased employees and 45 percent of our foreignbased employees are represented by collective bargaining agreements we have successfully concluded virtually all of our recent contract negotiations without a work stoppage in those rare instances where a work stoppage has occurred there has been no material effect on consolidated sales and earnings we cannot predict however the outcome of future contract negotiations in 2006 we have ten collectivebargaining agreements expiring these contracts affect approximately 3 percent of usbased employees and 18 percent of foreignbased employees

 item 3 legal proceedings tableend   

like hundreds of other industrial companies we have been named as one of many defendants in asbestosrelated personal injury litigation these cases most cases involve between 25 and 200 defendants allege personal injury or death resulting from exposure to asbestos in premises of fmc or to asbestoscontaining components installed in machinery or equipment manufactured or sold by discontinued operations the machinery and equipment businesses we owned or operated did not fabricate the asbestoscontaining component parts at issue in the litigation and to this day neither the us occupational safety and health administration nor the epa has banned the use of these components further the asbestoscontaining materials were housed inside of machinery and equipment and accessible only at the time of infrequent repair and maintenance therefore we believe that overall the claims against fmc are without merit and consider ourselves to be a peripheral defendant in these matters indeed the bulk of the claims against us to date have been dismissed without payment 

  

as of december 31 2005 there were approximately 34000 premises and product asbestos claims pending against fmc in several jurisdictions to date we have had discharged all before trial approximately 65000 asbestos claims against fmc the overwhelming majority of which have been dismissed without any payment to the plaintiff settlements by us with claimants to date have totaled approximately 7 million 

  

we intend to continue managing these cases in accordance with our historical experience we have established a reserve for this litigation and believe that the outcome of these cases will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or liquidity 

  

in late june 2004 we were served in a lawsuit captioned “lewis et al v fmc corporation” which was filed in united states district court for the western district of new york the suit was brought by thirteen residents of middleport new york who allege that we violated certain state and federal environmental laws and seeks injunctive relief and monetary damages for personal injuries and property damage in connection with such alleged violations we believe this suit is without merit 

  

we have certain other contingent liabilities arising from litigation claims performance guarantees and other commitments incident to the ordinary course of business based on information currently available and established reserves the ultimate resolution of our known contingencies including the matters described in note 17 is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or liquidity however there can be no assurance that the outcome of these contingencies will be favorable and adverse results in certain of these contingencies could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position results of operations or liquidity

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend   

overview 

  

we are a diversified global chemical company providing innovative solutions and applications to a wide variety of end markets we operate in three business segments agricultural products specialty chemicals and industrial chemicals agricultural products’ principal focus is on insecticides which are used to enhance crop yield and quality by controlling a wide spectrum of pests and on herbicides which are used to reduce the need for manual or mechanical weeding by inhibiting or preventing weed growth specialty chemicals consists of our biopolymer and lithium businesses and focuses on food ingredients that are used to enhance texture structure and physical stability pharmaceutical additives for binding and disintegrant use and lithium specialties for pharmaceutical synthesis specialty polymers and energy storage our industrial chemicals segment manufactures a wide range of inorganic materials including soda ash peroxygens and phosphorus chemicals 

  

2005 highlights 

  

2005 was a year during which we experienced continued sales growth in all of our business segments we also had significant growth in income from continuing operations before income tax our liquidity position also continued to improve due to cash received in the amount of 561 million related to the sale of a portion of the san jose california property and 994 million received as a result of the astaris asset sale in november 2005 additionally we have continued to reduce our debt levels and refinanced our credit agreements 

  

consolidated revenue of 21502 million was up 5 percent from the prior year agricultural products specialty chemicals and industrial chemicals had revenue increases of 3 4 and 7 respectively in agricultural products our focused strategy combined with growth in asia and continued strong performance in europe and brazil led to an increase in revenue specialty chemical increases were driven by strong global demand and higher pricing in lithium industrial chemicals continued to benefit from price increases particularly in soda ash 

  

income from continuing operations before income tax of 1933 million was up significantly from the prior year this was driven primarily by a gain in connection with astaris’s sale of substantially all of its assets also contributing to the increase was a 5 12 and 46 increase in operating profit in agricultural products specialty chemicals and industrial chemicals respectively and lower interest expense levels interest expense of 623 million for the year ended december 31 2005 decreased 23 from the prior year primarily as a result of reduced debt levels offsetting these increases were higher restructuring and other charges and losses on extinguishment of debt 

  

2006 outlook 

  

in 2006 we expect continued growth in our earnings this increase is expected to be driven by higher selling prices in industrial chemicals lower interest expense and modest growth in agricultural products and specialty chemicals we expect higher raw material and energy prices will partially offset these increases we expect that cash flow generation from our business segments to remain strong 

  

critical accounting policies 

  

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of asset liabilities revenues and expenses we have described our accounting policies in note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k we have reviewed these accounting policies identifying those that we believe to be critical to the preparation and understanding of our consolidated 

  

financial statements we have reviewed with the audit committee those accounting policies that we have deemed critical these policies are central to our presentation of results of operations and financial condition and require management to make estimates and judgments on certain matters we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience current conditions and other reasonable factors 

  

environmental obligation 

  

we provide for environmentalrelated obligations when they are probable and amounts can be reasonably estimated where the available information is sufficient to estimate the amount of liability that estimate has been used where the information is only sufficient to establish a range of probable liability and no point within the range is more likely than any other the lower end of the range has been used 

  

estimated obligations to remediate sites that involve oversight by the epa or similar government agencies are generally accrued no later than when a rod or equivalent is issued or upon completion of a rifs that is submitted by us to the appropriate government agency or agencies estimates are reviewed quarterly by our environmental remediation management as well as by financial and legal management and if necessary adjusted as additional information becomes available the estimates can change substantially as additional information becomes available regarding the nature or extent of site contamination required remediation methods and other actions by or against governmental agencies or private parties 

  

our environmental liabilities for continuing and discontinued operations are principally for costs associated with the remediation andor study of sites at which we are alleged to have disposed of hazardous substances such costs principally include among other items rifs site remediation costs of operation and maintenance of the remediation plan fees to outside law firms and consultants for work related to the environmental effort and future monitoring costs estimated site liabilities are determined based upon existing remediation laws and technologies specific site consultants’ engineering studies or by extrapolating experience with environmental issues at comparable sites we believe that it is reasonably possible that loss contingencies may exceed amounts accrued by as much as 850 million at december 31 2005 

  

included in the environmental reserve balance and reasonably possible loss contingencies for 2005 are liabilities that are potentially recoverable from third party insurance policies these amounts have not been recognized as offsetting recoveries in 2005 but are expected to be recognized in future years as applicable criteria are met 

  

provisions for environmental costs are reflected in income net of probable and estimable recoveries from named prps or other third parties such provisions incorporate inflation and are not discounted to their present values 

  

in calculating and evaluating the adequacy of our environmental reserves we have taken into account the joint and several liability imposed by cercla and the analogous state laws on all prps and have considered the identity and financial condition of each of the other prps at each site to the extent possible we have also considered the identity and financial condition of other third parties from whom recovery is anticipated as well as the status of our claims against such parties although we are unable to forecast the ultimate contributions of prps and other third parties with absolute certainty the degree of uncertainty with respect to each party is taken into account when determining the environmental reserve by adjusting the reserve to reflect the facts and circumstances on a sitebysite basis our liability includes our best estimate of the costs expected to be paid before the consideration of any potential recoveries from third parties we believe that any recorded recoveries related to prps are realizable in all material respects recoveries are recorded in “environmental liabilities continuing and discontinued” 

  

impairments and valuation of longlived assets 

  

our longlived assets include property plant and equipment and longterm investments goodwill and intangible assets we test for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the net book value of 

  

these assets may not be recoverable from the estimated undiscounted expected future cash flows expected to result from their use and eventual disposition in cases where the estimated undiscounted expected future cash flows are less than net book value an impairment loss is recognized equal to the amount by which the net book value exceeds the estimated fair value of assets which is based on discounted cash flows at the lowest level determinable the estimated cash flows reflect our assumptions about selling prices volumes costs and market conditions over a reasonable period of time 

  

we prepare an annual impairment test of goodwill the assumptions used to estimate fair value include our best estimate of future growth rates discount rates and market conditions over a reasonable period we performed this test in 2005 and determined that no impairment charge was required 

  

pensions and other postretirement benefits 

  

we provide qualified and nonqualified defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans as well as postretirement health care and life insurance benefit plans to our employees the costs benefits and obligations related to these benefits reflect key assumptions related to general economic conditions including interest discount rates healthcare cost trend rates expected rates of return on plan assets and the rates of compensation increases for employees the costs benefits and obligations for these benefit programs are also affected by other assumptions such as average retirement age mortality employee turnover and plan participation to the extent our plans’ actual experience as influenced by changing economic and financial market conditions or by changes to our own plans’ demographics differs from these assumptions the costs and obligations for providing these benefits as well as the plans’ funding requirements could increase or decrease when actual results differ from our assumptions the difference is typically recognized over future periods in addition the unrealized gains and losses related to our pension and postretirement benefit obligations may also affect periodic benefit costs benefits in future periods 

  

we use certain calculated values of assets under methods both to estimate the expected rate of return on assets component of pension cost and to calculate our plans’ funding requirements the expected rate of return on plan assets is based on a marketrelated value of assets that recognizes investment gains and losses over a fiveyear period we use an actuarial value of assets to determine our plans’ funding requirements the actuarial value of assets must be within a certain range high or low of the actual market value of assets and is adjusted accordingly 

  

we recorded 106 million 92 million and 77 million of net annual pension and other postretirement benefit cost in 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively at december 31 2005 and 2004 708 million and 859 million respectively was recorded for pension and other postretirement benefit obligations the recorded amounts for pension benefit obligations include additional minimum pension liabilities of 633 million and 531 million at december 31 2005 and 2004 respectively which were recorded in the accumulated other comprehensive income section in stockholders’ equity 

  

we made voluntary cash contributions to our us qualified pension plan of 150 million and 80 million respectively for 2005 and 2004 in addition we paid nonqualified pension benefits from company assets of 25 million and 48 million for 2005 and 2004 respectively we paid other postretirement benefits net of participant contributions of 70 million and 72 million for 2005 and 2004 respectively our estimated cash contributions for 2006 include approximately 3 million in nonqualified pension benefits approximately 6 million in other postretirement benefits and we plan to make voluntary cash contributions to our us qualified pension plan of approximately 30 million 

  

we select the discount rate used to calculate pension and other postretirement obligations based on a review of available yields on highquality corporate bonds including moody’s investors service inc “moody’s” aarated corporate and industrial bond indices in selecting the discount rate for 2005 we placed particular emphasis on a yieldcurve approach designed by our actuary to derive an appropriate discount rate for computing the present value of the future cash flows associated with our pension and other postretirement obligations taking into consideration both the timing and amount of the cash flows the specific interest rates supporting the yield 

  

curve were derived from calculated returns yields from a portfolio of highquality aagraded or higher bond investments constructed by our actuary 

  

in developing the expected longterm rate of return on asset assumption for our plan we take into consideration the technical analysis performed by our outside actuaries including historical market returns information on longterm real return expectations by asset class inflation assumptions and expectations for standard deviation related to these best estimates we also consider the historical performance of our own plan’s trust which has earned a compound annual rate of return of approximately 12 percent over the last 10 years which is in excess of comparable market indices for the same period as well as other factors the current asset allocation for our plan is approximately 74 percent equities us and nonus 22 percent fixedincome and 4 percent cash and other shortterm investments given an actively managed investment portfolio the expected annual rates of return by asset class for our portfolio using geometric averaging and after being adjusted for an estimated inflation rate of approximately 3 percent is between 9 percent and 11 percent for both us and nonus equities and between 5 percent and 7 percent for fixedincome investments which generates a total expected portfolio return that is in line with our rate of return assumption we continually monitor the appropriateness of this rate in light of current market conditions for the sensitivity of our pension costs to incremental changes in assumptions see our discussion below 

  

sensitivity analysis related to key pension and postretirement benefit assumptions a onehalf percent increase in the assumed discount rate would have decreased pension and other postretirement benefit obligations by 508 million at december 31 2005 and 510 million at december 31 2004 and decreased pension and other postretirement benefit costs by 30 million 25 million and 09 million for 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively a onehalf percent decrease in the assumed discount rate would have increased pension and other postretirement benefit obligations by 560 million at december 31 2005 and 541 million at december 31 2004 and increased pension and other postretirement benefit net periodic benefit cost by 56 million 50 million and 40 million for 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively 

  

a onehalf percent increase in the assumed expected longterm rate of return on plan assets would have decreased pension costs by 34 million 32 million and 32 million for 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively a onehalf percent decrease in the assumed longterm rate of return on plan assets would have increased pension costs by 34 million 32 million and 32 million for 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively 

  

further details on our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and net periodic benefit costs benefits are found in note 12 to our consolidated financial statements 

  

income taxes 

  

we have recorded a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized in assessing the need for this allowance we have considered a number of factors including future income the jurisdictions in which such income is earned and our ongoing tax planning strategies in the event that we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period such determination was made similarly should we conclude that we would be able to realize certain deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase income in the period such determination was made at december 31 2005 and 2004 the valuation allowance was 726 million and 550 million respectively 

  

on october 22 2004 the american jobs creation act the “ajca” was signed into law the ajca provides for the deduction for us federal income tax purposes of 85 percent of certain foreign earnings that are repatriated as defined in the ajca during the year ended december 31 2005 we repatriated 528 million of earnings and capital of which approximately 480 million were qualifying dividends under the ajca we recorded an income tax charge in 2005 of 319 million associated with our total ajca dividends the charge includes 188 million on the repatriation of the qualifying dividends subject to the 85 percent ajca provision 

  

results of operations—2005 2004 and 2003 

  

overview 

  

      

see “segment results” for a detailed discussion of events affecting our results for 2005 2004 and 2003 

  

results of operations—2005 compared to 2004 

  

in the following discussion “year” refers to the year ending december 31 2005 and “prior year” refers to the year ending december 31 2004 additionally in the discussion below please refer to our consolidated statements of income included in item 8 of this form 10k as well as the aftertax charges included in net income in the above table all comparisons are between the periods unless otherwise noted 

  

revenue for the year ended december 31 2005 was 21502 million an increase of 5 percent compared to the 20512 million recorded in the prior year period this increase was driven by higher sales in all of our segments which are discussed separately below 

  

restructuring and other charges were 404 million 261 million aftertax in 2005 compared to 35 million 22 million aftertax in 2004 

  

charges for the year ended december 31 2005 primarily include the following 

  

   

   

   

the charges of 35 million that we recorded in 2004 were primarily a result of severance costs that are expected for result in improved cost efficiencies agricultural products and specialty chemicals recorded 33 million and 03 million respectively of these severance costs severance costs in 2004 related to approximately 80 people most of whom separated from us in 2004 we also recorded 11 million of charges related to continuing environmental sites these charges were partially offset by noncash gains totaling 11 million in industrial chemicals and 01 million in corporate 

  

equity in earnings loss of affiliates equity in earnings loss of affiliates was 706 million of earnings in 2005 versus a loss of 21 million in the prior year the significant increase was primarily a result of 577 million 217 million aftertax of earnings recorded in 2005 as a result of a gain in connection with astaris’s sale of substantially all of its assets the increase was also a result of income at astaris up to the date of the asset sale versus a loss at astaris in the prior period the prior period loss included our portion of the astaris 2004 restructuring charges of 115 million 70 million aftertax 

  

investment gains for the year ended december 31 2005 was due to the sale of our 50 equity method investment in sibelco we recorded a gain of 93 million 24 million aftertax in conjunction with this sale in our consolidated statement of income 

  

interest expense net decreased to 581 million compared to 784 million in 2004 the decrease primarily reflects lower interest costs and debt levels in the year ended december 31 2005 compared to the prior year the decreases were due to our debt refinancing in october 2004 and june 2005 and the redemption of the 1025 percent senior notes in july 2005 

  

loss on extinguishment of debt was 605 million 374 million aftertax for the year ended december 31 2005 compared to 99 million 60 million aftertax in the prior period in 2005 in connection with our 

  

industrial revenue bond refinancing we incurred an approximate 21 million loss and in connection with entering into the 2005 credit agreement we wrote off approximately 12 million of deferred financing fees associated with the previous agreement and 06 million of fees associated with the new agreement additionally in 2005 we incurred a loss of 566 million associated with the redemption of the 1025 percent senior notes 

  

the 2004 loss represents the unamortized fees from our 2002 credit agreement that were written off when we refinanced it in october 2004 

  

provision benefit for income taxes was an expense of 823 million in 2005 compared with a benefit of 445 million in 2004 reflecting effective tax rates of 43 and 34 respectively the change was primarily due to tax adjustments in 2005 which include income taxes associated with the repatriations under the american jobs creation act ajca excluding the effect of these tax adjustments which are discussed below the change from 2004 to 2005 is primarily a result of the mix of domestic income compared to income earned outside of the us dividends received from foreign operations and valuation allowance adjustments 

  

2005 tax adjustments of 217 million primarily includes charges of 319 million associated with repatriations net tax benefits of 192 million primarily related to agreement on certain prior year tax matters previously reserved and charges of 95 million associated with adjustments to deferred tax liabilities 

  

2004 tax adjustments of 710 million of benefits primarily includes a tax benefit of 386 million from an adjustment to income tax liabilities due to a december 2004 pronouncement from the internal revenue service “irs” a tax benefit of 311 million primarily related to valuation allowance adjustments and a tax benefit of 13 million resulting from a refund received from the irs 

  

discontinued operations net of income tax totaled a gain of 61 million in 2005 versus expense of 154 million in 2004 2005 net gain includes income of 292 million related to completion of sale to the city of san jose california of approximately 52 acres of land used by our former defense systems operations primarily offsetting this income in 2005 was net environmental and legal charges of 234 million discontinued environmental and legal charges include environmental remediation costs at sites of discontinued businesses for which we are responsible for environmental compliance the charges in 2005 were primarily related to our front royal and middleport sites and in recognition of our share of liabilities related to a consent order between the epa and the primary responsible parties at the anniston site 

  

2004 charges primarily include amounts totaling 114 million to increase our reserves for environmental issues at two sites in new jersey and at our middleport new york site 

  

cumulative effect of change in accounting principle  net of income tax  on december 31 2005 we adopted fasb interpretation no 47 “accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations” the cumulative effect of adoption was a charge of 05 million see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements 

  

net income decreased to 1166 million in 2005 compared with 1602 million in 2004 primarily as a result of changes in the aftertax items included in net income described above the change in these items was the primary driver behind the decrease in net income from 2004 to 2005 partially offsetting the decrease in net income in 2005 was higher earnings from our agricultural products specialty chemicals and industrial chemicals segments and a decrease in interest expense 

  

other financial data 

  

corporate expenses increased 12 percent to 451 million in 2005 from 403 million in the prior year mostly due to higher legal expense and higher employee costs 

  

other income and expense net is comprised primarily of lifo inventory adjustments pension expense and realized foreign currency gains and losses other income net increased to 139 million from 46 million in the prior year due to the impact of the lifo adjustment and gain related to the settlement of certain energy contracts in the first half of 2005 

  

segment results 2005 compared to 2004 

  

information about how each of these items relates to our businesses at the segment level and results by segment are discussed below and in note 18 to our consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k 

  

agricultural products 

  

   

revenue increased 3 percent versus the prior year driven by stronger insecticide and herbicide sales in south america asia and europe revenues in north america were lower compared with the prior year primarily due to the impact of generic bifenthrin competition 

  

segment earnings were 1248 million an increase of 5 percent from the year earlier as a result of the higher sales in south america asia and europe and the favorable impact of manufacturing productivity initiatives which more than offset the impact of generic bifenthrin competition in north america and higher raw material and energy costs 

  

in 2006 fullyear revenue is expected to be relatively flat as benefits of new products and label expansion are partially offset by the impact of lower north american bifenthrin selling prices due to continued generic competition fullyear expected segment earnings growth of 5 to 10 percent for 2006 reflects favorable sales mix and manufacturing productivity improvement partially offset by higher raw material costs a combination of lower commodity prices and a strengthening brazilian real is pressuring the cash flow of our brazilian customers who sell into us dollar priced export markets this has resulted in slower payments from these customers and an increase in our allowance for doubtful accounts 

  

specialty chemicals 

  

   

revenue increased by 4 percent versus the prior year driven by strong global demand and higher pricing in pharmaceutical polymer and energy storage markets for lithium sales in biopolymer were essentially level to a year ago as the timing of demand in the pharmaceutical and personal care markets offset increased demand in food ingredients 

  

segment earnings increased 12 percent versus the prior year the strong lithium performance improved results in the biopolymer food ingredients business and the benefits of biopolymer restructuring initiatives were partially offset by higher raw material and energy costs 

  

in 2006 we expect low to midsingle digit revenue growth in specialty chemicals driven by improved biopolymer pharmaceutical sales and higher selling prices in lithium and biopolymer fullyear segment earnings are expected to grow by midsingle digits as a result of the higher sales and continued productivity improvements 

  

industrial chemicals 

  

   

revenue in industrial chemicals was 8704 million an increase of 7 percent versus the prior year higher soda ash sales accounted for the majority of the increase due to significant improvements in both domestic and export soda ash selling prices north american hydrogen peroxide and foret also benefited from higher selling prices during 2005 

  

segment earnings of 839 million increased 46 percent versus the prior year driven by higher selling prices across the group and improved earnings from astaris offset in part by the granger soda ash plant startup expenses and higher raw material energy and transportation costs 

  

prior to its divestiture in november astaris contributed approximately 11 million of income in 2005 reflecting improved pricing lower costs and the fullyear benefit of the restructuring completed in 2004 

  

for 2006 we expect fullyear revenue growth in the midteens driven by higher selling prices across most businesses particularly in soda ash we also expect fullyear segment earnings growth of 3035 percent driven by higher selling prices partially offset by higher energy raw material and transportation costs and the absence of astaris’s earnings 

  

results of operations—2004 compared to 2003 

  

revenue for the year ended december 31 2004 was 20512 million an increase of 7 percent compared to the 19214 million recorded in the prior year period this increase was driven by higher sales in all our segments which are discussed separately below 

  

restructuring and other charges gains totaled a loss of 35 million 22 million aftertax in 2004 compared to a gain of 51 million 48 million aftertax in 2003 

  

the beforetax loss of 35 million that we recorded in 2004 was primarily a result of severance costs that are expected to result in improved cost efficiencies agricultural products and specialty chemicals recorded 33 million and 03 million respectively of these severance costs severance costs in 2004 related to approximately 80 people most of whom separated from us in 2004 we also recorded 11 million of charges related to continuing environmental sites these charges were partially offset by noncash gains totaling 11 million in industrial chemicals and 01 million in corporate 

  

the beforetax gain of 51 million in 2003 was primarily a result of the gain on the sale of an office building in foret our spanish subsidiary offset by charges related to severance costs asset abandonments and environmental costs 

  

equity in loss earnings of affiliates  equity in loss of affiliates was 21 million versus 686 million in the prior year in 2003 astaris began a restructuring plan to improve its financial performance the restructuring which included the exit of the commodity sodium tripolyphosphate “stpp” market reduced fixed costs through facility and selective product rationalizations and resulted in improvement in the venture’s position in food and technical phosphates the restructuring was completed in 2004 and included four facility closures and the consolidation of operations into the remaining three astaris sites our portion of astaris’ 2004 and 2003 restructuring charges which totaled 115 million 70 million aftertax and 533 million 325 million aftertax respectively were recorded in “equity in loss earnings of affiliates” astaris’s earnings improved during 2004 compared to the prior year due to the benefits of this restructuring 

  

interest expense net decreased to 784 million compared to 922 million in 2003 the decrease primarily reflects lower interest costs from the december 2003 and june 2004 term loan repricings lower debt levels in 2004 compared to the prior year and the effect of our debt refinancing in october 2004 

  

loss on extinguishment of debt in 2004 represents the unamortized fees from our 2002 financing that were written off when we refinanced our debt in october 2004 

  

provision benefit for income taxes was a benefit of 445 million in 2004 compared with a benefit of 18 million for 2003 reflecting effective tax rates of 34 and 5 respectively the change from 2003 to 2004 was due to tax adjustments recorded in 2004 the mix of domestic income compared to income earned outside of the us dividends received from foreign operations and valuation allowance adjustments the detail of the 2004 tax adjustments are explained further in our results of operations analysis—2005 compared to 2004 

  

discontinued operations net of income tax we recorded charges of 154 million in 2004 versus 133 million in 2003 2004 charges include environmental remediation costs at sites of discontinued businesses for which we are responsible for environmental compliance and legal reserves offset by gains related to tax adjustments for previously discontinued operations our environmental charges included amounts totaling 114 million to increase our reserves for environmental issues at two sites in new jersey and at our middleport new york site 2003 charges are primarily for environmental remediation costs at sites of discontinued businesses for which we are responsible for environmental compliance 

  

net income increased to 1602 million in 2004 compared with 265 million in 2003 reflecting higher earnings from our agricultural products and industrial chemicals segments and decreased interest expense somewhat offset by lower earnings in our specialty chemicals segment in addition net income for 2004 and 2003 included certain aftertax charges and gains which are separately described above 

  

reclassifications and adjustments 

  

see note 1 to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion on reclassifications and adjustments that impacted results for the year ended december 31 2004 

  

other financial data 

  

corporate expenses increased 8 percent to 403 million in 2004 from 373 million in the prior year due entirely to higher spending related to sarbanesoxley section 404 compliance 

  

other income and expense net increased to 46 million from 39 million in the prior year due to the impact of the lifo adjustment and other nonoperating items partially offset by an adjustment in pension expense 

  

segment results 2004 compared to 2003 

  

information about how each of these items relates to our businesses at the segment level and results by segment are discussed below and in note 18 to our consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k 

  

agricultural products 

  

   

higher insecticide sales in 2004 accounted for over half of the revenue increase compared to 2003 this increase was driven by strong performance in latin america particularly brazil due to an improved farm economy and heavy pest pressures and to a lesser extent improved performance in europe increased herbicide sales resulted from growth in brazil new labels in europe strong early season demand in north america and slightly improved conditions in asia favorable foreign currency effects primarily from the stronger euro and payments from thirdparty producers also contributed to revenue growth the increase in segment operating profit in 2004 compared to 2003 was due to higher sales lower production costs and improved product mix resulting from our focus on highervalue proprietary products 

  

specialty chemicals 

  

   

the biopolymer business drove most of the revenue increase in 2004 with higher sales in the pharmaceutical and food ingredients markets as well as the favorable impact of foreign currency translation primarily the euro revenue in the lithium business increased slightly in 2004 compared to 2003 as the benefits of increased sales into the battery market and favorable foreign currency translation were partially offset by lower sales into the pharmaceutical market 

  

segment operating profit was down 6 percent in 2004 versus 2003 due to the impact of higher raw material costs and spending on biopolymer growth initiatives which were partially offset by favorable foreign currency 

  

industrial chemicals 

  

   

the industrial chemicals revenue increase in 2004 was driven by improved foret sales our european industrial chemicals business which resulted from favorable foreign currency translation and higher selling prices in phosphates and peroxygens higher alkali sales in 2004 were driven by strong volume growth in export markets and improved domestic soda ash selling prices partially offset by lower net soda ash export prices in asia and latin america lower domestic peroxygen sales in 2004 resulted from an unfavorable product mix compared to 2003 and lower persulfate prices partially offset by improved volumes 

  

the increase in segment operating profit in 2004 compared to 2003 was due to higher sales and improved earnings at astaris these benefits were slightly offset by higher energy prices primarily natural gas and higher freight costs astaris earnings improved significantly in 2004 compared to 2003 as a result of its restructuring 

  

recently adopted and issued accounting pronouncements and regulatory items 

  

see note 3 to our consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

  

domestic credit agreement 

  

on june 21 2005 we executed a new 8500 million fiveyear credit agreement the “domestic credit agreement” which provides for a 6000 million revolving credit facility 2500 million of which is available for the issuance of letters of credit and a 2500 million term loan facility the initial borrowings under the domestic credit agreement which is unsecured were used to prepay all borrowings and terminate the previous 6000 million senior secured credit agreement the 2500 million term loan under the domestic credit agreement was prepaid on december 21 2005 with proceeds from the european credit agreement as described below 

  

obligations under the domestic credit agreement bear interest at a floating rate which is at our option either a base rate or a london interbank offered rate “libor” plus an applicable margin the applicable margin is subject to adjustment based on the rating assigned to the revolving credit facility by each of moody’s investors service inc “moody’s” and standard  poor’s corporation “sp” at december 31 2005 the applicable margin on liborbased loans was 075 percent at december 31 2005 if we had borrowings under our domestic credit agreement the then applicable rate would have been 514 percent per annum 

  

in connection with entering into the domestic credit agreement we wrote off 12 million of deferred financing fees associated with our previous credit agreement and 06 million of fees associated with the new agreement in addition with the prepayment in december 2005 of the term loan under the domestic credit agreement we wroteoff 01 million of fees associated with that facility these fees were previously included as a component of “other assets” in our consolidated balance sheet and were recorded as “loss on extinguishment of debt” in the consolidated statements of operations for the year ended december 31 2005 

  

european credit agreement 

  

on december 16 2005 our dutch finance subsidiary executed a new credit agreement the “european credit agreement” which provides for an unsecured revolving credit facility in the amount of €220000000 equivalent to approximately us260 million borrowings may be denominated in euros or us dollars fmc and our dutch finance subsidiary’s direct parent provide guarantees of amounts due under the european credit agreement 

  

loans under the european credit agreement bear interest at a eurocurrency base rate which for loans denominated in euros is the euro interbank offered rate and for loans denominated in dollars is libor in each case plus a margin the applicable margin under our european credit agreement is subject to adjustment based on the rating assigned to the facility or if the facility is not rated to fmc by each of moody’s and sp at december 31 2005 the applicable margin was 040 percent the applicable borrowing rate under the european credit agreement was 304 percent per annum 

  

among other restrictions the domestic credit agreement and the european credit agreement contain financial covenants applicable to fmc and its consolidated subsidiaries related to leverage measured as the ratio of debt to adjusted earnings and interest coverage measured as the ratio of adjusted earnings to interest expense we were in compliance with all covenants at december 31 2005 

  

1025 percent senior notes redemption 

  

on july 21 2005 using proceeds of borrowings under the domestic credit agreement and cash on hand we redeemed all of our 1025 percent senior notes due 2009 outstanding in the aggregate principal amount of 3550 million pursuant to the terms of the senior notes and the related indenture we paid a redemption premium of 440 million in connection with the redemption of our 1025 percent senior notes we wrote off 114 million of deferred financing fees these amounts along with the settlement of a related interest rate lock resulted in a “loss on the extinguishment of debt” of 566 million in the consolidated statements of operations for the year ended december 31 2005 

  

sweetwater county industrial revenue bond refunding 

  

on december 15 2005 we refinanced 900 million aggregate principal amount of sweetwater county wyoming industrial revenue bonds issued in 1994 through a new industrial revenue bond issue in the same principal amount we reduced our average interest cost from 695 percent per annum to 560 percent per annum and extended the maturity date by 11 years the 1994 bonds were legally defeased by deposit with the trustee of the proceeds of the new bond issue and other funds provided by fmc and the bonds were subsequently redeemed with a 1 percent redemption premium on january 17 2006 this refinancing resulted in a charge of 21 million that is also included in “loss on extinguishment of debt” for the year ended december 31 2005 

  

at december 31 2005 the european credit agreement was fully drawn we had no borrowings under our domestic credit agreement letters of credit outstanding under the domestic credit agreement totaled 1474 million at december 31 2005 resulting in availability of 4526 million

statement of cash flows 

  

cash provided by operating activities was 1996 million for 2005 compared to 2390 million for 2004 and 2267 million for 2003 the reduction in cash provided by operating activities in 2005 compared to 2004 was due to our reduction in the use of vendor finance guarantees coupled with a decrease in accounts payable partially offset by higher earnings during 2004 cash provided by operating activities reflected higher earnings which were offset by increased environmental spending 

  

cash provided by operating activities of discontinued operations was 174 million in 2005 compared to cash required of 283 million and 261 million in 2004 and 2003 respectively the improvement was primarily due to cash proceeds from the sale of a portion of our san jose property which was offset by increases in environmental spending the majority of the spending for our discontinued operations is for environmental remediation on discontinued sites discontinued environmental spending was 244 million in 2005 compared to 205 million in 2004 and 217 million in 2003 

  

cash required by investing activities was 64 million 1146 million and 1610 million for the years ended december 31 2005 2004 and 2003 respectively the improvement in 2005 was due to proceeds from the sale of our investment in sibelco and our portion of proceeds from the astaris asset sale the decrease in 2004 compared to 2003 was due to lower astaris keepwell payments cash contributions to astaris were 355 million and 628 million in 2004 and 2003 respectively no such cash contributions were made in 2005 

  

cash required by financing activities for 2005 was 2153 million compared to cash provided of 461 million in 2004 in 2003 cash required by financing activities was 821 million during 2005 we redeemed on

our total significant committed contracts that we believe will affect cash over the next four years and beyond are as follows 

  

        

contingencies 

  

when technologies was split from us in 2001 we entered into a tax sharing agreement with them wherein each company is obligated for those taxes associated with their respective businesses generally determined as if each company filed its own consolidated combined or unitary tax returns for any period where technologies is included in the consolidated combined or unitary tax return of us or our subsidiaries while the statute of limitations for 2001 does not close until june 30 2006 because the irs audit for 20002001 was concluded during 2005 and no questions regarding the spinoff were raised during the audit it appears that any liability for taxes if the spinoff of technologies were not tax free due to an action taken by technologies has been favorably resolved the tax sharing agreement continues to be in force with respect to certain items which we do not believe would have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

  

on june 30 1999 we acquired the assets of tg soda ash inc from arkema inc formerly known as elf atochem north america inc for approximately 510 million in cash and a contingent payment due at yearend 2003 based on the financial performance of the combined soda ash operations between 2001 and 2003 on december 31 2003 we made the required estimated payment in the amount of 324 million based upon contract requirements this payment was subject to final adjustments based upon the audited financial statements of the business and was settled during the fourth quarter of 2005 resulting in a gain of 19 million

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend   

our earnings cash flows and financial position are exposed to market risks relating to fluctuations in commodity prices interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates our policy is to minimize exposure to our cash flow over time caused by changes in commodity interest and currency exchange rates to accomplish this we have implemented a controlled program of risk management consisting of appropriate derivative contracts entered into with major financial institutions 

  

the analysis below presents the sensitivity of the market value of our financial instruments to selected changes in market rates and prices the range of changes chosen reflects our view of changes that are reasonably possible over a oneyear period marketvalue estimates are based on the present value of projected future cash flows considering the market rates and prices chosen we calculate the market value foreign currency risk using thirdparty software incorporating standard pricing models to determine the present value of the instruments based on market conditions spot and forward foreign exchange rates as of the valuation date we obtain estimates of the market value energy price risk from calculations performed internally and by a third party 

  

at december 31 2005 our net financial instrument position was a net asset of 232 million compared to a net liability of 54 million at december 31 2004 the change in the net financial instrument position was due to larger unrealized gains in our commodity portfolio 

  

commodity price risk 

  

energy costs are approximately 10 percent of our cost of sales and services and are well balanced among coal electricity and natural gas and to a lesser extent oil we attempt to mitigate our exposure to increasing energy costs by hedging the cost of natural gas and oil to analyze the effect of changing energy prices we have performed a sensitivity analysis in which we assume an instantaneous 10 percent change in energy market prices from their levels at december 31 2005 and december 31 2004 with all other variables including interest rates held constant a 10 percent increase in energy market prices would result in an increase of the net asset position of 165 million and 106 million at december 31 2005 and december 31 2004 respectively a 10 percent decrease in energy market prices would result in a decrease of 165 million in the net asset position at december 31 2005 at december 31 2004 a 10 percent decrease in energy market prices would have resulted in a decrease of 107 million in the net asset position and as a result would change the net asset position into a net liability position 

  

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

  

the primary currencies for which we have exchange rate exposure are the us dollar versus the euro the euro versus the norwegian krone the us dollar versus the japanese yen and the us dollar versus the brazilian real foreign currency debt and foreign exchange forward contracts are used in countries where we do business thereby reducing our net asset exposure foreign exchange forward contracts are also used to hedge firm and highly anticipated foreign currency cash flows 

  

to analyze the effects of changing foreign currency rates we have performed a sensitivity analysis in which we assume an instantaneous 10 percent change in the foreign currency exchange rates from their levels at december 31 2005 and december 31 2004 with all other variables including interest rates held constant a 10 percent strengthening of hedged currencies versus our functional currencies would have resulted in a decrease of 

  

93 million in the net asset position and as a result would have changed the net asset position into a net liability position at december 31 2005 a 10 percent strengthening of hedged currencies versus our functional currencies would have resulted in an increase of 199 million in the net liability position at december 31 2004 a 10 percent weakening of hedged currencies versus our functional currencies would have resulted in an increase of 79 million in the net asset position at december 31 2005 a 10 percent weakening of hedged currencies versus our functional currencies would have resulted in a decrease of 189 million in the net liability position and as a result would have changed the net liability position into a net asset position of the relevant financial instruments at december 31 2004 

  

interest rate risk 

  

one of the strategies that we use to manage interest rate exposure is to enter into interest rate swap agreements in these agreements we agree to exchange at specified intervals the difference between fixed and variable interest amounts calculated on an agreedupon notional principal amount in 2003 we entered into swaps with an aggregate notional value of 1000 million in 2005 we terminated these swaps at a net cost of 27 million and redeemed the underlying debt as of december 31 2005 we had no interest rate swap agreements 

  

our debt portfolio at december 31 2005 is composed of 47 percent fixedrate debt and 53 percent variablerate debt the variablerate component of our debt portfolio principally consists of foreign bank borrowings and variablerate industrial and pollution control revenue bonds and borrowings under our european credit agreement changes in interest rates affect different portions of our variablerate debt portfolio in different ways 

  

based on the variablerate debt in our debt portfolio at december 31 2005 a one percentage point increase or decrease in interest rates then in effect would have increased or decreased interest expense for 2005 by 38 million

 item 1 business tableend   

general 

  

we are a diversified global chemical company providing innovative solutions applications and marketleading products to a wide variety of end markets we operate in three distinct business segments agricultural products specialty chemicals and industrial chemicals agricultural products’ focus is on insecticides which are used in agriculture to enhance crop yield and quality by controlling a broad spectrum of pests and for pest control for nonagricultural applications and on herbicides which are used to reduce the need for manual or mechanical weeding by inhibiting or preventing weed growth specialty chemicals consists of our biopolymer and lithium businesses and focuses on food ingredients that are used to enhance texture structure and physical stability pharmaceutical additives for binding and disintegrant use and lithium specialties for pharmaceutical synthesis and energy storage our industrial chemicals segment manufactures a wide range of inorganic materials including soda ash hydrogen peroxide specialty peroxygens and phosphorus chemicals 

  

the following table shows the principal products produced by our three business segments and their raw materials and uses 

  

   

we have operations in many areas around the world north america represents our single largest geographic market generating approximately 43 percent of revenue in 2004 with our second largest market europe middle east and africa representing 29 percent and latin america our third largest representing 17 percent of 2004 revenue with a worldwide manufacturing and distribution infrastructure we are able to respond rapidly to global customer needs offset downward economic trends in one region with positive trends in another and better match revenues to local costs to mitigate the impact of currency volatility the charts below detail our sales and longlived assets by major geographic region 

  

  

our strategy 

  

our corporate strategy is balanced between driving growth and innovation within our specialty chemicals and agricultural products segments and generating strong cash flow in our industrial chemicals segment our longterm objectives are as follows 

  

realize the operating leverage inherent in our businesses we intend to maximize the benefits of an economic recovery by maintaining our market positions reducing costs and prudently managing our asset base in soda ash we continually strive to optimize our proprietary and lowcost solution mining and longwall mining techniques thereby reducing our production costs which we believe are already among the lowest in the industry in hydrogen peroxide we have mothballed higher cost production capacity to improve profitability in the phosphorous chemicals joint venture with solutia inc “solutia” astaris llc “astaris” a restructuring was implemented in 2003 and recently completed resulting in the elimination of approximately 40 million of total annual costs for the venture all of these initiatives will position our industrial chemicals business for a significant rebound in earnings as volumes increase with an economic recovery capacity utilizations improve and selling prices continue to move higher additionally in agricultural products we continue to reduce manufacturing costs by outsourcing production to third parties in mexico china and india and are already benefiting from additional savings from our efforts to streamline our supply chain and reduce logistics costs 

  

create greater financial flexibility we are committed to the goal of reestablishing our investmentgrade rating through improvements to our liquidity and a significant reduction in our indebtedness in 2003 we set a target of 300 million of free cash flow available for debt reduction during 2003 through 2006 we expect a strong sustained rebound in our operating profit and resulting cash provided by operating activities 

  

furthermore we expect capital expenditures to remain below depreciation and amortization as our businesses will meet future expected demand growth through a combination of debottlenecking current production restarting mothballed plants and outsourcing production to third parties in connection with astaris’ recent restructuring and subsequent refinancing completed in february 2005 we have eliminated any future keepwell obligations additionally we believe our spending in 2005 for the shutdown and remediation of the former elemental phosphorus facility in pocatello idaho will be consistent with 2004 levels and will be significantly reduced in 2006 and thereafter lastly we continue to explore asset divestiture opportunities such as the sale of our former defense system site at the san jose california from which we realized net proceeds of approximately 50 million on february 17 2005 out of an anticipated total net proceeds of approximately 80 million 

  

focus the portfolio on higher growth businesses our goal is to achieve the highest overall growth while continuing to generate returns above the cost of capital in this regard we will invest in specialty chemicals for growth focus our investment in agricultural products on product development manage industrial chemicals for cash and divest any business that cannot sustain a return above our cost of capital specifically within specialty chemicals we continue to invest in our leading biopolymer and lithium market positions in the pharmaceutical food ingredient and energy storage markets key strategies include developing new technologies leveraging our strategic supply position with branded multinational companies enhancing our technical support capabilities and acquiring new technologies in agricultural products we have focused our efforts on developing new applications for higher margin patented products acquiring complementary chemistries from other pesticide companies and on discovering novel insecticide compounds through our stateoftheart research program 

  

financial information about our business segments 

  

see note 18 to our consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k also see below for selected financial information related to our segments 

  

agricultural products 

  

financial information in millions 

  

  

overview 

  

our agricultural products segment which represents approximately 34 percent of our 2004 consolidated revenues discovers develops manufactures and sells a portfolio of crop protection structural pest control and turf and ornamental products around the world our product development efforts focus on developing environmentally compatible solutions that can effectively increase farmers’ yields and provide more costeffective alternatives to older chemistries to which insects may have developed resistance we believe that our focused stateoftheart discovery strategy will result in novel insecticides that enable farmers to enhance their crop yields we have also recently gained access to proprietary chemistries from third party pesticide producers these novel chemistries are complementary to our existing products and market focus we are encouraged by our progress and are optimistic that these efforts will result in sales and profit growth over the next few years 

  

products and markets 

  

  

agricultural products provides a wide range of proprietary branded products—based on both patented and offpatent technologies—for global agricultural and structural pest control markets product branding is a prevalent industry practice used to help maintain and grow market share by promoting consumer recognition and the reputation of the product and the supplier agricultural products enjoys relatively strong niche positions in crop and noncrop market segments in the americas and other parts of the world and derived approximately 65 of its revenue from outside north america in 2004 

  

in contrast to most other major crop protection companies insecticides dominate our agricultural products segment particularly pyrethroid and carbamate chemistries in which we maintain leading market positions based on revenues pyrethroids are a major class of insecticides whose low use rates and cost competitiveness are unique compared to most other classes of insecticides they are most effective against worm pests carbamates are a broad spectrum of insecticides used to control a wide variety of pests in both soil and foliage we also maintain niche positions in select herbicide markets we differentiate ourselves through a highly focused strategy in selected crops and regions and leverage our proprietary chemistries pestspecific research and development “rd” and selected technologies accessed from third party producers to develop and market new pesticides and new applications of our existing products 

  

the following table summarizes the principal product chemistries in agricultural products and the principal uses of each chemistry 

  

   

we have several agreements with ishihara sangyo kaisha ltd “isk” a leading japanese crop protection company under which we work together to market and distribute existing and new pesticide chemistries in various markets the new chemistries include flonicamid a unique insecticide for controlling sucking pests and a novel fungicide for crop and noncrop uses in the americas with the isk alliance we have expanded our distribution capabilities in japan we have significantly enhanced our market access capabilities in key european markets by jointly investing with isk in the belgianbased pesticide distribution company belchim benelux nv through these and other alliances along with our own targeted marketing efforts and access to novel technologies we expect to enhance our access to key agricultural and noncrop markets and develop new products that will help us continue to compete effectively 

  

we maintain competitive manufacturing cost positions through our strategy of sourcing intermediates and finished products from third parties in lowercost manufacturing regions such as china india and mexico this strategy has resulted in significant annual cost savings and lower capital spending and has reduced the fixed capital intensity of the business this initiative is expected to produce additional cost savings over the next several years 

  

growth 

  

over the near term we plan to grow by obtaining new and approved uses for existing product lines and accessing and selling complementary chemistries andor related technologies from third parties which should enhance our current product portfolio and our capabilities to effectively service our target markets and customers over the next several years growth is anticipated in our third generation pyrethroids proprietary herbicides and the newly accessed third party chemistries andor technologies for example over the past two years we obtained label expansions for zetacypermethrin in a number of key crops and the product is now one of the most widely labeled pyrethroids in north america in addition our carfentrazoneethyl herbicide has received recent registrations for use as a cotton defoliation agent and weed control on a number of specialty crop segments in north america and as a desiccant on potatoes and tiller control on vines in europe 

  

we also believe that growth will result from products andor technologies inlicensed from our network of alliance partners the flonicamid insecticide we are developing exclusively in the americas in conjunction with isk has a novel mode of action in controlling sucking pests in a broad range of crops as well as noncrop uses the chemistry is currently under review by the environmental protection agency “epa” and we expect our 

  

first registration in key agricultural crops during 2005 with commercial sales in late 2005 or 2006 we already have an epa registration for noncrop uses such as in nurseries and greenhouses in the fourth quarter of 2004 we signed an agreement for nonexclusive development and distribution rights to a novel isk fungicide we expect initial sales in 2005 in several crops and noncrop new and approved uses are expected over the next 1824 months in addition we recently gained exclusive access to acetamiprid a rapidly growing class of insecticide chemistry from nippon soda company ltd for use in the us termite and general household pest segments acetamiprid has demonstrated outstanding activity against an array of pests including termites ants and roaches 

  

over the longerterm our growth will come from our discovery pipeline our research program is capitalizing on a focused insecticide discovery strategy that combines whole insect screening with biochemical targetbased testing both approaches use stateoftheart technologies including genomics robotics and advanced computational software this enables us to successfully identify chemistries that control key agricultural pests while providing an early understanding of modes of action and safety multidisciplinary project teams have already moved several promising chemistries from initial discovery to global fieldtesting we expect to move at least one prospective novel insecticide chemistry from discovery into predevelopment in 2005 

  

industry overview 

  

the three principal categories of agricultural chemicals are herbicides representing approximately half of global industry revenue insecticides representing approximately a quarter of global industry revenue and fungicides representing the remaining portion of global industry revenue 

  

insecticides are used to control a wide range of insects including chewing pests such as caterpillars and sucking pests such as aphids insecticides are applied as sprays dusts or granules and are used on a wide variety of crops such as fruits vegetables cotton soybean maize and cereals there are several major classes of insecticide chemistries including organophosphates carbamates pyrethroids and neonicotinoids 

  

herbicides prevent or inhibit weed growth thereby reducing or eliminating the need for manual or mechanical weeding herbicides can be selective killing only specific unwanted foliage or nonselective killing all foliage and are also segmented by their time of application preplanting preemergent and postemergent 

  

the agrochemicals industry has undergone significant consolidation over the past several years the top crop protection companies syngenta ag bayer ag monsanto company basf ag the dow chemical company and e i du pont de nemours and company “dupont” currently represent more than three quarters of global sales four of these companies syngenta bayer basf and dow have all made significant acquisitions of other crop protection companies over the past few years a significant driver for this consolidation has been the advent of biotechnology particularly in herbicides employed in row crops and the resulting escalation of research and development costs 

  

the next tier agrochemical producers including fmc makteshimagan industries ltd sumitomo chemical company limited isk and nufarm limited generally employ strategies focusing on niche crops and markets several of these producers are generic competitors with little or no investment in new product discovery additionally there is a growing trend among these producers to partner with one another to gain economies of scale and competitive market access more comparable to larger competitors 

  

specialty chemicals

the following chart summarizes the major markets for various lithium products 

  

   

industry overview 

  

food ingredients 

  

our biopolymer business serves the texture structure and physical stability “tsps” ingredients market tsps ingredients impart physical properties to thicken and stabilize foods there are many types of tsps ingredients and a wide range of food groups served including bakery meats dairy and convenience products the industry is dispersed geographically with the majority of the sales in europe north america and asia 

  

trends driving growth include increasing consumer interest in healthier foods greater convenience and growth in per capita consumption of processed foods in emerging markets the industry’s revenue growth has moderated in recent years due to increased price pressure in most segments the trend toward health and convenience drives the need for more functional ingredients to impart desired food tastes and textures we believe carrageenan and mcc which address this need are growing faster than the overall tsps market the global customer base for tsps is relatively fragmented and includes large and small food processors consolidation among these customers has been a significant trend over the past several years mergers of large food companies have included slimfast foods companybestfoodsunilever plc nabisco group holdings corpkraft foods inc the pillsbury companygeneral mills inc and suiza foods corporationdean foods company in light of these conditions tsps ingredient suppliers such as us have focused on establishing alliances with market leaders with the goal of reducing costs leveraging technology and expanding product offerings with key accounts 

  

within the entire food ingredients market there are a relatively large number of suppliers due principally to the broad spectrum of chemistries employed segment leadership global position and investment in technology are key factors to sustaining profitability in addition larger suppliers may often provide a broader product line and a range of services to food companies including functional systems or blends the top suppliers of tsps ingredients include danisco as dupont jm huber kerry ingredients cargill incorporated sobel nv dgf stoess ag fmc degussa ag and tate  lyle plc 

  

pharmaceutical chemicals 

  

our biopolymer business sells into the formulation chemicals segment of the pharmaceutical market the major end markets for formulation chemicals include coatings and colors fillers binders sweeteners and flavors disintegrants and others 

  

competitors tend to be grouped by chemistry our principal mcc competitors in pharmaceuticals include j rettenmaier  sôhne gmbh ming tai chemical co ltd asahi kasei corporation and blanver farmoquimica ltda while pricing pressures from low cost producers is a common competitive dynamic companies like us offset that pressure by providing the most reliable and broadest range of products and services customers of excipients are pharmaceutical firms who depend upon reliable therapeutic performance of their drug products 

  

we also supply alginates and carrageenan into oral care cosmetics and health care markets highly refined extracts from selected seaweeds provide a broad range of alginate functionality including uses in antireflux disorders dental impressions control release of drugs and wound dressings special grades of carrageenan extracts are used in liquid cough medicines toothpaste and a variety of skin care products 

  

lithium specialties 

  

lithium is a highly versatile metal with diverse enduse markets including glassceramics aluminum production pharmaceuticals polymers and both rechargeable and disposable batteries 

  

we market a wide variety of lithiumbased products ranging from upstream commodity lithium carbonate to highly specialized downstream products such as organolithium compounds and cathodic materials for batteries in past years lithium carbonate experienced a significant price decline due largely to industry oversupply during 2004 market pricing improved as a result of a better balance of supply and demand for lithium carbonate 

  

there are only three integrated producers of lithium chemetall sa sociedad quimica y minera de chile sa and fmc all of which produce lithium carbonate only two chemetell and fmc produce specialty grades of lithium new entry into the specialty lithium markets is difficult due to the level of proprietary processes and product technology involved the markets for specialty lithium products tend to be concentrated in more developed regions including north america europe and asia 

  

industrial chemicals 

  

financial information in millions 

  

  

overview 

  

our industrial chemicals segment which represents 40 percent of our 2004 consolidated revenues has lowcost positions in highvolume inorganic chemicals including soda ash and hydrogen peroxide complemented by highvalue niche positions in specialty alkali phosphorus and peroxygen products 

  

products and markets 

  

  

industrial chemicals serves a diverse group of markets from economically sensitive industrial sectors to technologyintensive specialty markets we process and sell refined inorganic products that are sought by customers for their critical reactivity or specific functionality in markets such as paper pulp glass and detergents in addition we produce purify and market highervalue downstream derivatives into specialized and customerspecific applications these applications include dialysis rocket propulsion animal nutrition biocides semiconductors and even baking 

  

alkali 

  

our alkali chemical division produces natural soda ash soda ash is used by manufacturers in the glass chemical processing and detergent industries to a lesser degree we also produce sodium bicarbonate caustic soda and sodium sesquicarbonate the majority of our alkali sales are manufactured by and sold through fmc wyoming corporation which we manage as an integral part of our alkali business in which we own shares representing an 875 percent economic interest with the remaining shares held by two japanese companies 

  

we mine and produce natural soda ash using proprietary lowcost mining technologies such as longwall and solution mining which we believe gives us the lowest cost versus other suppliers our two production sites in green river wyoming have the capacity to produce approximately 49 million tons of soda ash annually though the business over the last several years has mothballed 13 million tons of capacity to improve cost structure and to respond to market conditions in 2004 the us soda ash industry was essentially sold out as a result of this condition in 2005 we plan on restarting 250000 tons of this mothballed capacity to meet the increase in demand driven by the growth in the export markets 

  

peroxygens 

  

we produce hydrogen peroxide worldwide with production facilities in the united states canada and mexico and in spain and the netherlands through foret as described below we also participate in a joint venture company in thailand we sell hydrogen peroxide into the pulp and paper industry and to a lesser extent 

  

in the chemical processing environmental electronics food and textiles industries we believe we are a leading north american producer of hydrogen peroxide due in part to our broad product line geographicallyadvantaged plant locations our stateoftheart processing technology and superior customer service hydrogen peroxide represents approximately 70 percent of our peroxygens sales 

  

our specialty peroxygens business supplies persulfate products primarily to polymer and printed circuit board markets and peracetic acid predominately to the food industry for biocidal applications typically we compete as a specialty player where we believe that we are differentiated by our strong technical expertise unique process technology and geographic location 

  

foret 

  

our european subsidiary fmc foret sa “foret” headquartered just outside of barcelona spain is a leader in providing chemical products to the detergent paper textile tanning and chemical industries foret is a large and diverse operation with seven manufacturing locations in europe foret has positions in phosphates hydrogen peroxide perborates percarbonates sulfur derivatives silicates zeolites and sodium sulfate foret’s sales efforts are focused in europe africa and the middle east 

  

astaris 

  

astaris our 50 percentowned unconsolidated joint venture with solutia is one of two large diversified phosphorus chemical suppliers in the americas astaris was formed as a separate company in 2000 with headquarters in st louis missouri astaris’ products are used in chemical processing baking beverage food processing detergent applications and fire suppressants astaris has diversified its raw material inputs to use both elemental phosphorus and purified phosphoric acid “ppa” 

  

in 2003 astaris initiated a restructuring plan to improve business financial performance the restructuring included the exit of the commodity sodium tripolyphosphate market the reduction of fixed costs through facility shut downs and the elimination of certain lowcontribution products the restructuring was successfully completed yielding a significantly improved cost position streamlined operations and better product mix which resulted in a return to operating profitability in 2004 

  

industry overview 

  

we primarily participate in three markets soda ash peroxygens and phosphorus chemicals these products are generally inorganicbased produced from minerals or air and are generally commodities which in many cases have few cost effective substitutes growth is typically a function of gdp or the rate of industrialization in key export markets pricing tends to reflect shortterm supply and demand as producers add or reduce capacity andor demand changes 

  

soda ash 

  

soda ash is a highly alkaline inorganic chemical essential in the production of glass and widely used in the production of chemicals soaps and detergents and many other products natural soda ash is generally produced from trona a natural form of sodium sesquicarbonate through mining and chemical processing soda ash may also be produced synthetically but this process requires a significant amount of energy and produces large quantities of waste byproducts making it much less costeffective than natural soda ash production 

  

because of the processing cost advantages of trona and the large natural reserves of trona in the us particularly in green river wyoming all us soda ash production is natural by contrast due to a lack of trona almost all of the soda ash that is manufactured in the rest of the world is produced synthetically other us producers are oci chemical corporation solvay sa the general chemical group inc and searles valley minerals 

  

approximately 40 percent of us natural soda ash production served export markets in 2004 with approximately 30 percent of us natural soda ash production exported through the american natural soda ash corporation “ansac” ansac is the foreign sales association of the significant us producers of soda ash established in 1983 under the webbpomerene act and subsequent legislation since its creation ansac has been successful in coordinating soda ash exports exploiting the natural cost benefits of us produced natural soda ash and leveraging its large scale of operations to the benefit of its member companies us exports of soda ash have risen significantly over the last twenty years 

  

peroxygens 

  

hydrogen peroxide is typically sold for use as a bleach or oxidizer as such it often competes with other chemicals capable of performing similar functions some of our specialty peroxygen derivatives eg persulfates perborates percarbonates also function as bleaching or oxidizing agents environmental regulations regional cost differences often due to transportation costs and technical differences in product performance enter into the decision to use hydrogen peroxide or one of its derivatives rather than another product since these considerations vary by region the consumption patterns vary in different parts of the world hydrogen peroxide is sold in aqueous solutions usually 35 percent 50 percent or 70 percent by weight 

  

the north american pulp and paper industry represents approximately 65 of domestic demand for hydrogen peroxide in this market hydrogen peroxide is used as an environmentally friendly bleaching agent to brighten chemical mechanical and recycled pulps as well as treat a wide range of mill pollutants in the waste stream the north american paper market is mature and new investment in pulp and paper capacity is mostly going into asia and south america as a result hydrogen peroxide demand growth has slowed to a 23 per year rate after rapid growth in the early to mid 1990’s industry capacity utilization has improved to the mid 90’s from as low as the mid70’s in 1998 prices have been gradually increasing since 2002 the other north american hydrogen peroxide producers are akzo nobel nv arkema degussa ag kemira ovj and solvay sa 

  

phosphorous chemicals 

  

phosphorous chemicals are used in many industrial applications in a wide array of chemical compounds overall growth in demand for phosphorous chemicals tends to correlate with gdp purified phosphoric acid ‘ppa” and phosphate salts eg sodium phosphates calcium phosphates potassium phosphates are sold into many markets including food beverage water treatment automotive metal cleaning detergents and fire suppressants 

  

the basic input material for making phosphates is now produced using two processes most industrial applications use the costeffective process that involves making ppa by the purification of fertilizergrade phosphoric acid thermal phosphoric acid long the industry standard is produced from elemental phosphorus but is more costly due to energy and environmental compliance costs and is now used mainly in limited applications although astaris our phosphorus joint venture ceased the production of elemental phosphorus in 2001 it is still produced by monsanto in the united states thermphos in the netherlands and in several other countries principally china 

  

worldwide demand for phosphorous chemicals declined in the early 1990s as detergents containing phosphates for homelaundry use were banned in north america and parts of europe beginning in the late 1990s reduced demand the shift in growth toward developing regions and the advent of new technology resulted in a significant restructuring of the phosphorus chemicals industry as producers consolidated or exited the business 

  

over the next few years industrial demand for phosphorous chemicals is expected to improve driven by growing demand in the detergent and food and beverage industries in newly industrializing nations and by the growth of food and beverage applications in the united states and europe 

  

in north america we participate in the phosphorus chemicals business through astaris in europe we participate in this business through foret major competitors include rhodia sa prayon rupel sa and the potash corporation of saskachewan inc 

  

source and availability of raw materials 

  

our raw material requirements vary by business segment and include mineralrelated natural resources trona ore and lithium brines processed chemicals seaweed specialty wood pulp and energy sources such as oil gas coal and electricity raw materials represented approximately 25 percent of our 2004 cost of sales and services and no one raw material represented more than 7 percent of our total raw material purchases 

  

ores used in industrial chemicals manufacturing processes such as trona are extracted from mines in the us on property held by us under longterm leases subject to periodic adjustment of royalty rates raw materials used by specialty chemicals include lithium carbonate the majority of which is obtained from a south american manufacturer under a longterm sourcing agreement various types of seaweed that are sourced on a global basis and specialty wood pulp which is mainly purchased from several north american producers raw materials used by agricultural products primarily processed chemicals are obtained from a variety of suppliers worldwide 

  

patents 

  

we own a number of us and foreign patents trademarks and licenses that are cumulatively important to its business we do not believe that the loss of any one or group of related patents trademarks or licenses would have a material adverse effect on the overall business of fmc the duration of our patents depends on their respective jurisdictions their expiration dates range through 2023 

  

seasonality 

  

the seasonal nature of the crop protection market and the geographic spread of the agricultural products business have historically resulted in stronger earnings in the second and third quarters agricultural products sold into the northern hemisphere north america europe and parts of asia serve seasonal agricultural markets from march through september while markets in the southern hemisphere latin america and parts of the asia pacific region including australia are served from july through february distributors in north america and brazil have been shifting more of their purchases closer towards the growing season which has more recently shifted sales to later periods within the year in addition the geographic spread of the agricultural products business has recently been impacted by the growth in brazil resulting in higher first quarter and fourth quarter earnings the remainder of our businesses is generally not subject to significant seasonal fluctuations 

  

competition 

  

we have a number one or number two market position in many of our product lines based on revenue either globally or in north america largely as a result of our proprietary technologies and with respect to industrial chemicals our position as a lowcost producer the following product lines accounted for the majority of our 2004 consolidated revenue market positions are based on the most recently available revenue data 

  

     

competitive conditions 

  

we encounter substantial competition in each of our three business segments this competition is expected to continue in both the united states and markets outside of the united states we market our products through our own sales organization and through independent distributors and sales representatives the number of our principal competitors varies from segment to segment in general we compete by operating in a costefficient manner and by leveraging our industry experience to provide advanced technology high product quality and reliability and quality customer and technical service 

  

our agricultural products segment competes primarily in the global crop protection market for insecticides and herbicides the industry is characterized by a relatively small number of large competitors and a large number of smaller often regional competitors such as fmc industry products include crop protection chemicals and for major competitors genetically engineered crop biotechnology products competition from generic producers has increased as a significant number of product patents have expired in the last decade in general we compete as a product innovator by focusing on insecticide discovery and development and by licensing products from alliance partners when the products complement our product portfolio and geographic focus we also differentiate ourselves by reacting quickly in key markets achieving global costcompetitiveness via our manufacturing strategies establishing effective product stewardship programs and developing strategic alliances which strengthen market access in key countries 

  

with significant positions in markets that include alginate carrageenan microcrystalline cellulose and lithiumbased products specialty chemicals competes on the basis of product differentiation customer service and price biopolymer competes with both direct suppliers of cellulose and seaweed extract as well as suppliers of other hydrocolloids which may provide similar functionality in specific applications in microcrystalline cellulose competitors are typically smaller than us while in seaweed extracts alginates we compete with other broadbased chemical companies we and each of our two most significant competitors in lithium extract the element from naturally occurring lithiumrich brines located in the andes mountains of argentina and chile which are believed to be the world’s most significant and lowest cost sources of lithium 

  

industrial chemicals serves the alkali peroxygens and phosphorus markets predominantly in the united states and to a lesser extent europe in north america the soda ash business competes with four domestic producers of natural soda ash three of which operate in the vicinity of our mine and processing facility in green river wyoming outside of north america and europe we sell soda ash through ansac internationally our natural soda ash competes with synthetic soda ash manufactured by numerous producers ranging from integrated multinational companies to smaller regional companies we maintain a leading position in the north american market for hydrogen peroxide there are currently five firms competing in the hydrogen peroxide market in north america the primary competitive factor affecting the sales of soda ash and hydrogen peroxide is price we seek to maintain our competitive position by employing low cost processing technology at foret we possess strong cost and market positions in phosphates perborates peroxygens zeolites and sulfur derivatives in each of these markets we face significant competition from a range of multinational and regional chemical producers we participate in the phosphorus chemicals business in the united states through the astaris joint venture competition in phosphorus chemicals is based primarily on price and to a lesser degree product differentiation 

  

research and development expense 

  

we perform product research and development in all of our segments with the majority of our efforts focused in the agricultural products segment the product development efforts in the agricultural products segment focus on developing environmentally sound solutions that costeffectively increase farmers’ yields and provide alternatives to insectresistant chemistries our research and development expenses in the last three years are set forth below 

  

   

environmental laws and regulations 

  

we are subject to various federal state local and foreign environmental laws and regulations that govern emissions of air pollutants discharges of water pollutants and the manufacture storage handling and disposal of hazardous substances hazardous wastes and other toxic materials and remediation of contaminated sites we are also subject to liabilities arising under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act “cercla” and similar state laws that impose responsibility on persons who arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances and on current and previous owners and operators of a facility for the cleanup of hazardous substances released from the facility into the environment in addition we are subject to liabilities under the resource conservation and recovery act “rcra” and analogous state laws that require owners and operators of facilities that treat store or dispose of hazardous waste to follow certain waste management practices and to clean up releases of hazardous waste into the environment associated with past or present practices 

  

we have been named a potentially responsible party or prp at 27 sites on the federal government’s national priority list in addition we also have received notice from the epa or other regulatory agencies that we may be a prp or prp equivalent at other sites including 48 sites at which we have determined that it is reasonably possible that we have an environmental liability in cooperation with appropriate government agencies we are currently participating in or have participated in a remedial investigationfeasibility study “rifs” or its equivalent at most of the identified sites with the status of each investigation varying from site to site at certain sites a rifs has only recently begun providing limited information if any relating to cost estimates timing or the involvement of other prps whereas at other sites the studies are complete remedial action plans have been chosen or a record of decision has “rod” been issued 

  

environmental liabilities include obligations relating to waste handling and the remediation andor study of sites at which we are alleged to have released or disposed of hazardous substances these sites include current operations previously operated sites and sites associated with discontinued operations we have provided reserves for potential environmental obligations that we consider probable and for which a reasonable estimate of the obligation could be made as of december 31 2004 our total environmental reserve after accounting for recoveries which represent the probable realization of claims from third parties which we estimate at 121 million was 1802 million compared to 1861 million at december 31 2003 after accounting for recoveries of 170 million in addition we have estimated that reasonably possible environmental loss contingencies may exceed this reserve by as much as 75 million at december 31 2004 

  

employees 

  

we employ approximately 5100 people with approximately 2700 people in our domestic operations and 2400 people in our foreign operations approximately 30 percent of our usbased employees and 45 percent of our foreignbased employees are represented by collective bargaining agreements we have successfully concluded virtually all of our recent contract negotiations without a work stoppage in those rare instances where a work stoppage has occurred there has been no material effect on consolidated sales and earnings we cannot predict however the outcome of future contract negotiations in 2005 we have six collectivebargaining agreements expiring these contracts affect approximately 25 percent of usbased employees and 13 percent of foreignbased employees

 item 3 legal proceedings tableend   

like hundreds of other industrial companies we have been named as one of many defendants in asbestosrelated personal injury litigation these cases most cases involve between 50 and 350 defendants allege personal injury or death resulting from exposure to asbestos in premises of fmc or to asbestoscontaining components installed in machinery or equipment manufactured or sold by discontinued operations the machinery and equipment businesses we owned or operated did not fabricate the asbestoscontaining component parts at issue in the litigation and to this day neither the us occupational safety and health administration nor the epa has banned the use of these components further the asbestoscontaining materials were housed inside of machinery and equipment and accessible only at the time of infrequent repair and maintenance therefore we believe that overall the claims against fmc are without merit and consider ourselves to be a peripheral defendant in these matters indeed the bulk of the claims against us to date have been dismissed without payment 

  

as of december 31 2004 there were approximately 38000 premises and product claims pending against fmc in several jurisdictions to date we have had discharged all before trial approximately 56000 claims against fmc the overwhelming majority of which have been dismissed without any payment to the plaintiff settlements to date have totaled approximately 5 million 

  

we intend to continue managing these cases in accordance with our historical experience we have established a reserve for this litigation and believe that the outcome of these cases will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated cash flows or financial condition 

  

in late june 2004 we were served in a lawsuit captioned “lewis et al v fmc corporation” which was filed in united states district court for the western district of new york the suit was brought by thirteen residents of middleport new york who allege that the company has violated certain state and federal environmental laws and seeks injunctive relief and monetary damages for personal injuries and property damage in connection with such alleged violations we believe this suit is without merit 

  

we are party to various other lawsuits both as defendant and plaintiff arising in the normal course of business in our opinion the disposition of these lawsuits are not expected to individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on our consolidated cash flows or financial condition

we are a diversified global chemical company providing innovative solutions and applications to a wide variety of end markets we operate in three business segments agricultural products specialty chemicals and industrial chemicals agricultural products’ principal focus is on insecticides which are used to enhance crop yield and quality by controlling a wide spectrum of pests and on herbicides which are used to reduce the need for manual or mechanical weeding by inhibiting or preventing weed growth specialty chemicals consists of our biopolymer and lithium businesses and focuses on food ingredients that are used to enhance texture structure and physical stability pharmaceutical additives for binding and disintegrant use and lithium specialties for pharmaceutical synthesis and energy storage our industrial chemicals segment manufactures a wide range of inorganic materials including soda ash peroxygens and phosphorus chemicals 

  

2004 highlights 

  

2004 was a year during which we experienced sales growth in all of our business segments we also had significant growth in income from continuing operations before income tax additionally we reduced our debt levels and refinanced our credit agreement 

  

consolidated revenue of 20512 million was up 7 percent from the prior year agricultural products specialty chemicals and industrial chemicals had revenue increases of 10 4 and 6 respectively sales across all segments benefited from higher volumes and favorable foreign currency translation additionally in agricultural products an improved farm economy especially in brazil contributed to sales growth 

  

income from continuing operations before income tax of 1311 million was up significantly from the prior year this was driven by a 44 and 69 increase in operating profit in agricultural products and industrial chemicals respectively and lower interest expense levels interest expense of 809 million for the year ended december 31 2004 decreased 16 from the prior year 

  

net income was 1602 million compared to 265 million in 2003 net income in 2004 included an aftertax benefit of 404 million due to tax adjustments offset by restructuring and other charges gains astaris restructuring expenses writeoff of deferred financing fees and charges to discontinued operations 

  

2005 outlook 

  

in 2005 we expect continued growth in our earnings we expect a significant recovery in our industrial chemicals segment to be the primary driver of that growth as well as reduced interest expense due to lower debt levels and reduced rates following our 2004 refinancing we expect that the improvement in industrial chemicals will be primarily driven by higher soda ash selling prices due to the tight supply conditions in the market lower debt levels and reduced interest rates are expected to lower our interest expense in 2005 as well as provide greater financial flexibility and liquidity 

  

critical accounting policies 

  

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of asset liabilities revenues and expenses we have described our accounting policies in note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k we have reviewed these accounting policies identifying those that we believe to be critical to the preparation and understanding of our consolidated financial statements we have reviewed with the audit committee those accounting policies that we have deemed critical these policies are central to our presentation of results of operations and financial condition and require management to make estimates and judgments on certain matters we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience current conditions and other reasonable factors 

  

environmental 

  

we provide for environmentalrelated obligations when they are probable and amounts can be reasonably estimated where the available information is sufficient to estimate the amount of liability that estimate has been used where the information is only sufficient to establish a range of probable liability and no point within the range is more likely than any other the lower end of the range has been used 

  

estimated obligations to remediate sites that involve oversight by the epa or similar government agencies are generally accrued no later than when a rod or equivalent is issued or upon completion of a rifs that is accepted by us and the appropriate government agency or agencies estimates are reviewed quarterly by our environmental remediation management as well as by financial and legal management and if necessary adjusted as additional information becomes available the estimates can change substantially as additional information becomes available regarding the nature or extent of site contamination required remediation methods and other actions by or against governmental agencies or private parties 

  

our environmental liabilities for continuing and discontinued operations are principally for costs associated with the remediation andor study of sites at which we are alleged to have disposed of hazardous substances such costs principally include among other items rifs site remediation costs of operation and maintenance of the remediation plan fees to outside law firms and consultants for work related to the environmental effort and future monitoring costs estimated site liabilities are determined based upon existing remediation laws and technologies specific site consultants’ engineering studies or by extrapolating experience with environmental issues at comparable sites 

  

provisions for environmental costs are reflected in income net of probable and estimable recoveries from named prps or other third parties such provisions incorporate inflation and are not discounted to their present values 

  

in calculating and evaluating the adequacy of our environmental reserves we have taken into account the joint and several liability imposed by cercla and the analogous state laws on all prps and have considered the identity and financial condition of each of the other prps at each site to the extent possible we have also considered the identity and financial condition of other third parties from whom recovery is anticipated as well as the status of our claims against such parties although we are unable to forecast the ultimate contributions of prps and other third parties with absolute certainty the degree of uncertainty with respect to each party is taken into account when determining the environmental reserve by adjusting the reserve to reflect the facts and circumstances on a sitebysite basis our liability includes management’s best estimate of the costs expected to be paid before the consideration of any potential recoveries from third parties we believe that any recorded recoveries related to prps are realizable in all material respects we have recorded recoveries representing probable realization of claims against insurance companies us government agencies and other third parties of 121 million and 170 million respectively at december 31 2004 and 2003 these recoveries are recorded as an offset to “environmental liabilities continuing and discontinued” cash recoveries for the years 2004 2003 and 2002 were 61 million 107 million and 162 million respectively in addition at december 31 2004 we have estimated that reasonably possible environmental loss contingencies may exceed amounts accrued by as much as 75 million we recorded total environmental provisions related to both operating and discontinued sites of 341 million 249 million and 102 million in 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively 

  

impairments and valuation of longlived assets 

  

our longlived assets include property plant and equipment and longterm investments goodwill and intangible assets we test for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the net book value of these assets may not be recoverable from the estimated undiscounted expected future cash flows expected to result from their use and eventual disposition in cases where the estimated undiscounted expected future cash 

  

flows are less than net book value an impairment loss is recognized equal to the amount by which the net book value exceeds the estimated fair value of assets which is based on discounted cash flows at the lowest level determinable the estimated cash flows reflect our assumptions about selling prices volumes costs and market conditions over a reasonable period of time 

  

we prepare an annual impairment test of goodwill the assumptions used to estimate fair value include our best estimate of future growth rates discount rates and market conditions over a reasonable period we performed this test in 2004 and determined that no impairment charge was required 

  

pensions and other postretirement benefits 

  

we provide qualified and nonqualified defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans as well as postretirement health care and life insurance benefit plans to our employees the costs or benefits and obligations related to these benefits reflect key assumptions related to general economic conditions including interest discount rates healthcare cost trend rates expected rates of return on plan assets and the rates of compensation increases for employees the costs or benefits and obligations for these benefit programs are also affected by other assumptions such as average retirement age mortality employee turnover and plan participation to the extent our plans’ actual experience as influenced by changing economic and financial market conditions or by changes to our own plans’ demographics differs from these assumptions the costs and obligations for providing these benefits as well as the plans’ funding requirements could increase or decrease when actual results differ from our assumptions the difference is typically recognized over future periods in addition the unrealized gains and losses related to our pension and postretirement benefit obligations may also affect periodic benefit costs in future periods 

  

we use certain calculated values of assets under methods both to estimate the expected rate of return on assets component of pension cost and to calculate our plans’ funding requirements the expected rate of return on plan assets is based on a marketrelated value of assets that recognizes investment gains and losses over a fiveyear period we use an actuarial value of assets to determine our plans’ funding requirements the actuarial value of assets must be within a certain range high or low of the actual market value of assets and is adjusted accordingly 

  

we recorded 92 million 77 million and 49 million of net annual pension and other postretirement benefit cost in 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively at december 31 2004 and 2003 859 million and 977 million respectively was recorded for pension and other postretirement benefit obligations the recorded amounts for pension benefit obligations include additional minimum pension liabilities of 531 million and 432 million at december 31 2004 and 2003 respectively which were recorded in the accumulated other comprehensive income section in stockholders’ equity 

  

we made voluntary cash contributions to our us qualified pension plan of 80 million and 70 million respectively for 2004 and 2003 in addition we paid nonqualified pension benefits from company assets of 48 million and 24 million for 2004 and 2003 respectively we paid other postretirement benefits net of participant contributions of 72 million and 66 million for 2004 and 2003 respectively our estimated cash contributions for 2005 include approximately 3 million in nonqualified pension benefits approximately 75 million in other postretirement benefits and we plan to make voluntary cash contributions to our us qualified pension plan of approximately 15 million 

  

we select the discount rate used to calculate pension and other postretirement obligations based on a review of available yields on highquality corporate bonds including moody’s investors’ service inc “moody’s” aarated corporate and industrial bond indices in selecting the discount rate for 2004 we placed particular emphasis on a portfolio of highquality aagraded bond investments constructed by our actuary to be used for this purpose 

  

in developing the expected longterm rate of return on asset assumption for our plan we take into consideration the technical analysis performed by our outside actuaries including historical market returns information on longterm real return expectations by asset class inflation assumptions and expectations for 

  

standard deviation related to these best estimates we also consider the historical performance of our own plan’s trust which has earned a compound annual rate of return of approximately 14 percent over the last 10 years which is in excess of comparable market indices for the same period as well as other factors the current asset allocation for our plan is approximately 70 percent equities us and nonus 25 percent fixedincome and 5 percent cash and other shortterm investments given an actively managed investment portfolio the expected annual rates of return by asset class for our portfolio using geometric averaging and after being adjusted for an estimated inflation rate of approximately three percent is between nine percent and eleven percent for both us and nonus equities and between five percent and seven percent for fixedincome investments which generates a total expected portfolio return that is in line with our rate of return assumption we continually monitor the appropriateness of this rate in light of current market conditions for the sensitivity of our pension costs to incremental changes in this assumption see our discussion below 

  

the other postretirement benefit obligations and net periodic other postretirement benefit costs noted above do not reflect the effects of the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of 2003 “medicare act” in september 2004 we elected not to recognize any of the potential accounting effects of the medicare act because the actuarial equivalence of our retiree medical plan was undeterminable as of september 30 2004 we required more information on how actuarial equivalence would be calculated that was not available in existing versions of the regulations in order to determine if our retiree medical plan met the threshold 

  

on january 21 2005 the centers for medicare  medicaid services cms released the final regulations on the medicare prescription drug benefit the final regulations provide comprehensive guidance on how the actuarial equivalence of retiree medical plans will be determined we are currently in the process of evaluating the final regulations to determine the estimated effects if any of the medicare act on our retiree medical plan and the other postretirement benefit liabilities and net annual other postretirement benefit costs reported in our consolidated financial statements 

  

sensitivity analysis related to key pension and postretirement benefit assumptions a onehalf percent increase in the assumed discount rate would have decreased pension and other postretirement benefit obligations by 510 million at december 31 2004 and 477 million at december 31 2003 and decreased pension and other postretirement benefit costs by 25 million 09 million and 12 million for 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively a onehalf percent decrease in the assumed discount rate would have increased pension and other postretirement benefit obligations by  541 million at december 31 2004 and 525 million at december 31 2003 and increased pension and other postretirement benefit net periodic benefit cost by 50 million 40 million and 10 million for 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively 

  

a onehalf percent increase in the assumed expected longterm rate of return on plan assets would have decreased pension costs by 32 million 32 million and 30 million for 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively a onehalf percent decrease in the assumed longterm rate of return on plan assets would have increased pension costs by 32 million 32 million and 30 million for 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively 

  

further details on our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and net periodic benefit costs are found in note 11 to our consolidated financial statements 

  

income taxes 

  

we have recorded a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized in assessing the need for this allowance we have considered a number of factors including future income the jurisdictions in which such income is earned and our ongoing tax planning strategies in the event that we determined that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period such determination was made similarly should we conclude that we would be able to realize certain deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase income in the period such determination was made at december 31 2004 and 2003 the valuation allowance was  550 million and 390 million respectively 

  

results of operations—2004 2003 and 2002 

  

overview 

  

     

see “segment results” for a detailed discussion of events affecting our results for 2004 2003 and 2002 

  

results of operations—2004 compared to 2003 

  

in the following discussion “year” refers to the year ending december 31 2004 and “prior year” refers to the year ending december 31 2003 all comparisons are between the periods unless otherwise noted 

  

revenue for the year ended december 31 2004 was 20512 million an increase of 7 percent compared to the 19214 million recorded in the prior year period this increase was driven by higher sales in all our segments which are discussed separately below 

  

restructuring and other charges gains totaled a loss of 35 million 22 million aftertax in 2004 compared to a gain of 51 million 48 million aftertax in 2003 

  

the beforetax loss of 35 million that we recorded in 2004 was primarily a result of severance costs that are expected to result in improved cost efficiencies agricultural products and specialty chemicals recorded 33 million and 03 million respectively of these severance costs severance costs in 2004 related to approximately 80 people most of whom separated from us in 2004 we also recorded 11 million of charges related to continuing environmental sites these charges were partially offset by noncash gains totaling 11 million in industrial chemicals and 01 million in corporate 

  

the beforetax gain of 51 million in 2003 was primarily a result of the gain on the sale of an office building in foret our spanish subsidiary offset by charges related to severance costs asset abandonments and environmental costs the detail of these charges by segment are explained further in our results of operations analysis—2003 compared to 2002 

  

equity in loss earnings of affiliates  equity in loss of affiliates was 21 million versus 686 million in the prior year in 2003 astaris began a restructuring plan to improve its financial performance the restructuring which included the exit of the commodity sodium tripolyphosphate “stpp” market reduced fixed costs through facility and selective product rationalizations and resulted in improvement in the venture’s position in food and technical phosphates the restructuring was completed in 2004 and included four facility closures and the consolidation of operations into the remaining three astaris sites our portion of astaris’ 2004 and 2003 restructuring charges which totaled 115 million 70 million after–tax and 533 million 325 million after–tax respectively were recorded in “equity in loss earnings of affiliates” astaris’ earnings improved during 2004 compared to the prior year due to the benefits of this restructuring 

  

interest expense net decreased to 784 million compared to 922 million in 2003 the decrease primarily reflects lower interest costs from the december 2003 and june 2004 term loan repricings lower debt levels in 2004 compared to the prior year and the effect of our debt refinancing in october 2004 see our discussion on liquidity and capital resources for further details on the 2004 refinancing 

  

writeoff of deferred financing fees in 2004 represents the unamortized fees from our 2002 financing that were written off when we refinanced our debt in october 2004 

  

provision benefit for income taxes was a benefit of 445 million in 2004 compared with a benefit of 18 million for 2003 reflecting effective tax rates of 340 and 47 respectively the change from 2004 to 2003 was due to tax adjustments recorded in 2004 the mix of domestic income compared to income earned outside of the us dividends received from foreign operations and valuation allowance adjustments 

  

2004 was affected by a tax benefit of 386 million resulting from an adjustment to income tax liabilities due to a december 2004 pronouncement from the internal revenue service a tax benefit of 311 million primarily related to valuation allowance adjustments and a tax benefit of 13 million resulting from a refund received from the internal revenue service 

  

the tax rate in 2003 was affected by a change in the mix of domestic income compared to income earned outside of the us income we earn outside of the us is typically taxed at rates lower than income earned domestically in addition dividends received from our foreign operations and valuation allowance adjustments further affected the benefit for income taxes in 2003 

  

discontinued operations  we recorded aftertax charges of 154 million in 2004 versus 133 million in 2003 2004 charges include environmental remediation costs at sites of discontinued businesses for which we are responsible for environmental compliance and legal reserves offset by gains related to tax adjustments for previously discontinued operations our environmental charges included amounts totaling 114 million aftertax to increase our reserves for environmental issues at two sites in new jersey and at our middleport new york site 2003 charges are primarily for environmental remediation costs at sites of discontinued businesses for which we are responsible for environmental compliance 

  

net income increased to 1602 million in 2004 compared with 265 million in 2003 reflecting higher earnings from our agricultural products and industrial chemicals segments and decreased interest expense somewhat offset by lower earnings in our specialty chemicals segment in addition net income for 2004 included restructuring and other charges charges related to the astaris restructuring writeoff of deferred financing fees charges in our discontinued operations and tax adjustments the sum of which totaled a benefit of 404 million aftertax or 108 per share on a diluted basis prioryear net income included aftertax restructuring and other charges gains astaris restructuring and charges in our discontinued operations the sum of which totaled a charge of 410 million aftertax or 115 per share on a diluted basis 

  

reclassifications and adjustments 

  

our results for the year ended december 31 2004 were unfavorably affected by 81 million 60 million aftertax or 016 per diluted share related to the elimination of intercompany profit in our inventory and the elimination of the recognition of revenue due to sales cutoff 

  

our results for the year ended december 31 2004 were favorably affected by a 80 million or 022 per diluted share benefit recorded to income taxes related to adjustments to deferred tax liabilities and income tax valuation allowance related to prior periods additionally our results for the year ended december 31 2004 were favorably affected by a 90 million aftertax or 024 per diluted share benefit recorded to discontinued operations due to adjustments to deferred tax liabilities related to previously discontinued operations further our stockholders’ equity was favorably affected by 108 million due to adjustments to deferred tax liabilities related to technologies we recorded this adjustment through retained earnings consistent with the accounting for the 2001 spinoff of technologies the adjustments to our income taxes discontinued operations and retained earnings were recorded as a result of a review of our deferred taxes and income tax valuation allowance in which balances were adjusted related to discontinued operations and to prior periods 

  

we believe that the effect of the above eliminations and adjustments are not material to our financial position or results of operations or liquidity for any prior period 

  

other financial data 

  

corporate expenses increased 8 percent to 403 million in 2004 from 373 million in the prior year due entirely to higher spending related to sarbanesoxley section 404 compliance 

  

other income and expense net is comprised primarily of lifo inventory adjustments pension expense and realized foreign currency gains and losses other income net increased to 46 million from 39 million in the prior year due to the impact of the lifo adjustment and other nonoperating items partially offset by an adjustment in pension expense 

  

segment results 2004 compared to 2003 

  

information about how each of these items relates to our businesses at the segment level and results by segment are discussed below and in note 18 to our consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k 

  

agricultural products 

  

   

higher insecticide sales accounted for over half of the revenue increase and were driven by strong performance in latin america particularly brazil due to an improved farm economy and heavy pest pressures and to a lesser extent improved performance in europe increased herbicide sales resulted from growth in brazil new labels in europe strong early season demand in north america and slightly improved conditions in asia favorable foreign currency effects primarily from the stronger euro and payments from thirdparty producers also contributed to revenue growth the increase in segment operating profit was due to higher sales lower production costs and improved product mix resulting from our focus on highervalue proprietary products 

  

in 2005 we believe that agricultural products sales will be flat as growth in new products and labels coupled with continued strong performance in brazil and europe offsets the impact of lower selling prices resulting from generic competition in north america earnings are also expected to be flat as lower manufacturing costs from sourcing initiatives are offset by higher energy raw materials and freight costs 

  

specialty chemicals 

  

   

the biopolymer business drove most of the revenue increase with higher sales in the pharmaceutical and food ingredients markets as well as the favorable impact of foreign currency translation primarily the euro revenue in the lithium business increased slightly from the priorperiod as the benefits of increased sales into the battery market and favorable foreign currency translation were partially offset by lower sales into the pharmaceutical market 

  

segment operating profit was down 6 percent versus the prior period due to the impact of higher raw material costs and spending on biopolymer growth initiatives partially offset by favorable foreign currency 

  

in 2005 we expect midsingle digit revenue growth driven by strong organic growth in both the biopolymer and lithium businesses full year earnings are expected to exceed the rate of sales growth driven by productivity improvements 

  

industrial chemicals 

  

   

the industrial chemicals revenue increase was driven by improved foret sales our european industrial chemicals business which resulted from favorable foreign currency translation and higher selling prices in phosphates and peroxygens higher alkali sales were driven by strong volume growth in export markets and improved domestic soda ash selling prices partially offset by lower net soda ash export prices in asia and latin america lower domestic peroxygen sales resulted from an unfavorable product mix and lower persulfate prices partially offset by improved volumes 

  

the increase in segment operating profit was due to higher sales and improved earnings at astaris these benefits were slightly offset by higher energy prices primarily natural gas and higher freight costs astaris earnings improved significantly as a result of its restructuring 

  

we expect midsingle digit growth in revenue in 2005 driven by higher selling prices particularly in soda ash we expect full year earnings growth of approximately 50 percent which will be driven by higher selling prices particularly in soda ash partially offset by higher energy raw material and transportation costs this outlook includes the impact of restarting 250000 short tons of mothballed soda ash capacity in connection with this restart we expect modest startup expenses of approximately 5 million and capital expenditures of approximately 2 million 

  

results of operations—2003 compared to 2002 

  

revenue for the year ended december 31 2003 was 19214 million up 4 percent compared with 18529 million in 2002 this increase was due to a stronger euro growth in specialty chemicals sales in the pharmaceutical market and increased agricultural products sales in latin america and europe 

  

restructuring and other charges gains totaled 51 million 48 million after tax in 2003 compared with 301 million 184 million after tax in 2002 

  

the before tax gain of 51 million we recorded in 2003 was the result of a gain on the sale of an office building in foret our spanish subsidiary offset by charges in all segments the gain on the building was 119 million net of related costs including severance severance costs were recorded in industrial chemicals and in both our agricultural products and specialty chemicals segments total 2003 severance charges including amounts recorded at foret were 57 million and related to approximately 80 people most of whom separated from fmc in late 2003 the remaining charges in the year included noncash charges totaling 28 million primarily for the abandonment of an asset in the specialty chemicals segment offset by the reversal of certain workforce related and facility shutdown reserves in corporate as shown in the table in note 5 to our consolidated financial statements in this form 10k resulting from our ability to meet certain obligations on more favorable terms than expected when the reserves were established the remaining other charges of 22 million in 2003 were related to environmental costs at operating sites largely in our industrial chemicals segment 

  

in 2002 restructuring and other charges of 301 million before tax consisted of charges related to each of our segments the details by segment are discussed below 

  

in an effort to mitigate the effects of the continued economic weakness in the markets served by our industrial chemicals business we undertook several cost saving initiatives that resulted in 124 million of restructuring charges included in this amount was a 57 million restructuring charge for the mothballing of the basic production line at our hydrogen peroxide facility in spring hill west virginia we also mothballed our granger facility in green river wyoming resulting in a 34 million restructuring charge the majority of this charge was for facility shutdown activities and severance all of which occurred in 2002 in addition we recorded a 33 million restructuring charge for costs related to reorganization efforts to reduce costs in our us phosphorus chemicals business alkali peroxygens and at foret there were 150 severances related to these restructurings all of which occurred in 2002 

  

in agricultural products we incurred 47 million of restructuring charges in 2002 of which 37 million related to the idling and reorganization of our sulfentrazone plant in baltimore in connection with our new herbicides strategy as we shifted our focus from soybeans to higher value crops a 10 million restructuring charge was recorded for reorganization costs to implement a new distribution strategy in europe which allows us to rely on certain strategic alliances to further penetrate and expand our european markets of the 108 severances related to these restructurings 57 occurred in 2002 

  

we recorded 13 million of restructuring charges in our specialty chemicals segment in 2002 in an effort to realign product divisions within biopolymer both domestically and internationally the majority of these costs resulted from the severance of 24 people which occurred in the first half of 2003 

  

reorganization costs of 30 million and other charges of 87 million were also recorded in 2002 these charges are discussed in note 5 to our consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k also of the 301 million of restructuring charges recorded in 2002 119 million was spent in 2002 

  

equity in earnings loss of affiliates was a loss of 686 million in 2003 versus earnings of 47 million in 2002 the loss in 2003 included charges totaling 533 million related to the restructuring program at astaris weaker affiliate earnings were primarily the result of the absence of a power resale contract which had a prior year pretax benefit of approximately 12 million and decreases in selling prices resulting from competitive pressure 

  

interest expense net increased by 29 percent to 922 million in 2003 compared to 716 million in 2002 reflecting higher interest costs in 2003 from our refinancing in the fourth quarter of 2002 

  

provision benefit for income taxes was a benefit of 18 million in 2003 compared with a provision of 174 million for 2002 reflecting tax rates of 47 and 201 respectively the tax rate in 2003 was affected by a change in the mix of domestic income compared to income earned outside of the us income we earn outside of the us is typically taxed at rates lower than income earned domestically in addition dividends received from our foreign operations and a change in the valuation allowance further contributed to the change in the provision benefit for income taxes from 2002 to 2003 in 2002 the tax rate resulted primarily from the effect of depletion and differing foreign tax rates see note 8 to our consolidated financial statements in this form 10k for further details 

  

discontinued operations we recorded aftertax charges of 133 million and 33 million in 2003 and 2002 respectively for environmental remediation costs at sites of discontinued businesses for which we are responsible for environmental compliance see “discontinued operations” note 3 to our consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k for further details 

  

net income decreased to 265 million in 2003 compared with 658 million in 2002 reflecting increased interest expense net and lower earnings from our industrial chemicals segment somewhat offset by higher earnings in our other segments in addition net income for 2003 included restructuring and other charges gains astaris restructuring and charges in our discontinued operations totaling 410 million aftertax or 115 per share on a diluted basis as noted in the table under “overview” above these charges related primarily to restructuring programs particularly at our astaris affiliate reported in “equity in earnings loss of affiliates” but also included a gain on the sale of an office building and an aftertax environmental charge to discontinued operations of 133 million prioryear net income included aftertax restructuring and other charges of 184 million also related to primarily in industrial chemicals and an aftertax environmental charge to discontinued operations of 33 million 

  

other financial data 

  

the following are line items from our segment profit and loss statement used to reconcile segment operating profit to consolidated income from continuing operations before income taxes and the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle see note 18 to our consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k 

  

corporate expenses increased to 373 million in 2003 from 356 million in 2002 primarily due to higher insurance costs 

  

other income and expense net is comprised primarily of realized foreign currency gains and losses lifo inventory adjustments and pension income or expense net other income was 43 million higher in 2003 than the 2002 loss of 04 million this variance is largely attributable to a lifo adjustment and the impact of foreign currency 

  

segment results 2003 compared to 2002 

  

agricultural products 

  

   

the increase in sales was driven by growth in all regions except north america and was largely achieved in the fourth quarter of 2003 latin america and europe showed the most significant growth at the end of 2003 sales in latin america particularly brazil were driven by improved market conditions and higher sales of proprietary herbicides and insecticides used on such crops as cotton and sugar cane stronger european sales resulted from a number of factors including a stronger euro new approved uses for propriety herbicides referred to as “new labels” and our overall efforts to focus on highervalue proprietary products these increases more than offset the decrease in north american insecticide sales into the crop protection market due to lowerthanaverage pest pressures our professional pest control and home and garden business also saw continued growth during 2003 because of this regional sales mix insecticides were essentially flat for the year while higher sales of herbicides resulted in most of the revenue increase in 2003 versus 2002 for 2003 our agricultural products revenues were made up of 75 percent insecticides 24 percent herbicides and 1 percent fungicides 

  

the segment operating profit improvement in 2003 compared to 2002 was a result of higher sales improved product mix related to our focus on highervalue proprietary products and lower production costs some of which was related to our outsourcing strategy in some product lines 

  

specialty chemicals 

  

   

biopolymer which generated 71 percent of 2003 segment revenues had sales increases of 4 percent compared to 2002 while sales in our lithium business which represents 29 percent of the segment increased by more than 10 percent compared with 2002 

  

segment sales increases in 2003 were driven by us and european growth in biopolymer’s mcc products in the pharmaceuticals market where mcc is used as a binder and disintegrant in tablets these increases were partially offset by lower biopolymer sales in our food business largely as a result of lower demand in the nutritional beverage market also contributing were strong lithium sales in the pharmaceutical synthesis market and in the energy storage market from military demand for rechargeable batteries in addition the favorable impact of foreign currency translation primarily the euro further contributed to the increase in revenue in 2003 

  

segment operating profit increased in 2003 compared to 2002 due to higher sales favorable foreign currency translation improved productivity and sales mix 

  

industrial chemicals 

  

   

industrial chemicals sales increased in 2003 due almost entirely to foret our european industrial chemicals business where favorable currency translation and higher peroxygen selling prices resulted in a 16 percent increase in sales compared with 2002 european prices for peroxygens were driven by higher capacity utilization levels coupled with strong demand the increased sales at foret were partially offset by decreased 

  

revenues in our largely north americanbased alkali and peroxygens hydrogen peroxides and active oxidants businesses where sales in 2003 decreased 2 percent and 4 percent respectively compared with the prior year the decrease in alkali was largely a result of lower export prices for soda ash alkali’s primary product due in part to recent capacity additions in china despite successful implementation of some selling price increases in 2003 peroxygen sales decreased due to weaker north american hydrogen peroxide volumes to the pulp market for 2003 our industrial chemicals segment revenue is made up of 46 percent alkali 34 percent foret and 19 percent peroxygens 

  

lower segment operating profit in 2003 was largely the result of significantly lower affiliate earnings from astaris and lower sales in our alkali and domestic peroxygen businesses weaker affiliate earnings from astaris were primarily the result of the absence of a power resale contract in 2003 which had a 2002 pretax benefit of approximately 12 million and decreases in selling prices resulting from competitive pressure 

  

in 2003 astaris began a restructuring plan to improve its financial performance the restructuring included the exit of the commodity sodium tripolyphosphate “stpp” market our portion of astaris’ 2003 restructuring charges which totaled 533 million before tax were recorded in “equity in earnings loss of affiliates”

liquidity and capital resources 

  

on october 29 2004 we executed an amended and restated 6000 million senior secured credit agreement the “2004 credit agreement” which provides for a 4000 million revolving credit facility 150 million of which is available for the issuance of letters of credit a 100 million term loan and a 100 million standalone letter of credit facility collectively the “credit facilities” the net proceeds from the initial borrowings under the credit facilities available cash and certain restricted cash released concurrently with the execution of the 2004 credit agreement were used to repay all borrowings under and terminate the former 2418 million term loan and to pay fees and expenses of approximately 40 million see note 9 of our consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k for a summary of the 2004 credit agreement terms 

  

in connection with entering into the 2004 credit agreement we wrote off approximately 99 million of deferred financing fees associated with the previous agreements these deferred financing fees were included as a component of other assets in our consolidated balance sheet which was recorded as “writeoff of deferred financing fees” in our consolidated statements of income 

  

among other restrictions the 2004 credit agreement contains financial covenants related to leverage measured as the ratio of debt to adjusted earnings and interest coverage measured as the ratio of adjusted earnings to interest expense we were in compliance with all covenants at december 31 2004 additional covenants in the 2004 credit agreement include among others restrictions on creation of liens limitations on acquisitions joint ventures and other investment limitations on restricted payments including a prohibition on the payment of dividends by fmc and restrictions on mergers sales of assets and other fundamental changes 

  

restricted cash was 97 million and 1369 million at december 31 2004 and december 31 2003 respectively at december 31 2003 the restricted cash shown on the consolidated balance sheet provided collateral assuring the payment of certain selfinsurance obligations environmental remediation activities future business commitments and reimbursement obligations under letters of credit supporting variablerate pollution control and industrial revenue bonds at or subsequent to the execution of the 2004 credit agreement the majority of the restricted cash providing collateral supporting our obligations was released certain obligations were replaced with letters of credit under the credit facilities 

  

at december 31 2004 we had term loan facility borrowings of 1000 million and no outstanding borrowings under our 4000 million revolving credit facility letters of credit outstanding totaled 1467 million of which 479 million were issued under our 400 million revolving credit facility and 988 million were issued under our 100 million standalone letter of credit facility revolving credit facility availability was 3521 million and standalone letter of credit availability was 12 million at december 31 2004 

  

at december 31 2003 we had term loan facility borrowings of 2475 million and no outstanding borrowings under our 2500 million revolving credit facility letters of credit outstanding under the revolving credit facility totaled 26 million resulting in availability under our revolving credit facility of 2474 million 

  

cash and cash equivalents excluding restricted cash at december 31 2004 compared to december 31 2003 were 2124 million and 570 million respectively the majority of cash and cash equivalents at december 31 2004 were held by our foreign subsidiaries we had total debt of 9232 million and 10502 million at december 31 2004 and 2003 respectively this included 8222 million and 10334 million of longterm debt excluding current portions of 708 million and 30 million at december 31 2004 and 2003 respectively shortterm debt which consists primarily of foreign borrowings increased to 302 million at december 31 2004 compared to 138 million at december 31 2003 the 1434 million decrease in total longterm debt at december 31 2004 from december 31 2003 was primarily due to the repayment of our term loan facility under the former agreement in 2003 we paid 1636 million including a premium of 03 million plus accrued interest to redeem all of outstanding 6375 percent senior notes due september 2003 and all of the 653 percent seriesb mediumterm notes due december 2003 the redemption of the notes was funded with 1443 million from restricted cash 

  

statement of cash flows 

  

cash provided by operating activities was 2387 million for 2004 compared to 2207 million for 2003 and 194 million for 2002 primarily reflecting higher earnings this was offset by increased environmental spending at pocatello in 2004 during 2003 higher cash provided by operating activities was due to lower restructuring spending of 193 million compared to 638 million in 2002 and changes in guarantees of vendor financing and accounts receivables sold because we are a global company with significant investment in the eurozone the 2004 and 2003 increase in the euro versus the us dollar had a significant effect on the amounts of our operating assets and liabilities as presented on the balance sheets for better comparability we exclude this effect in the section of the statement of cash flows entitled “change in operating assets and liabilities” 

  

cash required by discontinued operations for the years ended december 31 2004 2003 and 2002 was 283 million 261 million and 296 million respectively the majority of the spending for our discontinued operations is for environmental remediation on discontinued sites and postemployment benefits for former employees of discontinued businesses discontinued environmental spending was 205 million in 2004 compared to 217 million in 2003 and 168 million in 2002 contributing to the decline in 2003 was the absence of certain spending included in 2002 related to the spinoff of technologies 

  

cash required by investing activities was 1094 million 1578 million and 1108 million for the years ended december 31 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively the decrease in 2004 was due to lower astaris keepwell payments in addition in 2003 we made a 324 million payment to elf atochem for tg soda ash which was not repeated in 2004 the increase in 2003 from 2002 reflects an increase in financing commitments to astaris and to a lesser extent higher capital expenditures in 2003 cash contributions to astaris were 355 million 628 million and 296 million in 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively 

  

cash provided by financing activities for 2004 was 412 million compared to cash required of 793 million in 2003 in 2002 cash provided by financing activities was 1826 million contributing to the increase in cash provided by financing activities in 2004 was the increase in the number of stock options exercised and higher borrowings under our foreign credit lines in 2003 we paid 1636 million to redeem the entire 

  

outstanding balance of our 6375 percent senior notes due september 2003 plus accrued interest and to redeem at par all of the outstanding 653 percent seriesb mediumterm notes also contributing to the decrease in cash provided by financing activities as compared to 2002 was the completion of an equity offering in the second quarter of 2002 resulting in net proceeds of 1013 million which was not repeated in 2003 

  

for the year ended december 31 2004 we contributed approximately 136000 shares of treasury stock to our employee benefit plans having a cost of approximately 36 million 

  

commitments and other potential liquidity needs 

  

our cash needs for 2005 include operating cash requirements capital expenditures scheduled maturities of longterm debt environmental spending and restructuring we expect that with these needs our debt balances net of cash will be approximately 140 million less than at yearend 2004 we plan to meet our liquidity needs through available cash cash generated from operations and borrowings under our 4000 million committed revolving credit facility 

  

in connection with the finalization of astaris’ external financing arrangements during the third quarter of 2000 we entered into an agreement with astaris’ lenders under which we agreed to make payments “keepwell payments” sufficient to make up onehalf of the shortfall in astaris’ earnings below certain levels solutia which owns the other 50 percent of astaris provided a parallel agreement under which it agreed to make up the other half of any shortfall astaris’ earnings did not meet the agreed levels for the first half of 2004 and fullyear 2003 and 2002 we made keepwell payments of 355 million under this arrangement in 2004 compared to keepwell payments of 628 million in 2003 and 296 million in 2002 in each case keepwell payments were applied to reduce the debt of astaris 

  

as previously agreed with astaris’ lenders when the lenders’ commitments were reduced to 200 million in june 2004 we provided a 61 million letter of credit in lieu of a cash keepwell payment in that amount and in the third quarter of 2004 we provided a 39 million letter of credit solutia had provided a similar letter of credit in the amount of 100 million supporting its parallel obligation no further keepwell payments were made in 2004 

  

in the second half of 2003 astaris began to implement its restructuring plan and we recorded aftertax charges of 325 million primarily in connection with this plan we recorded additional aftertax charges of 70 million during 2004 related to the astaris restructuring in support of the astaris restructuring plan we and solutia agreed to defer until september 2005 a total of up to approximately 300 million each in payments anticipated from astaris as of december 31 2004 we had deferred 159 million in payments from astaris under this program 

  

in december 2003 to accommodate the financial effects on us of the astaris restructuring plan we were successful in obtaining favorable amendments to certain covenants in our 2002 credit facilities along with the favorable covenant amendments the lenders under our 2002 credit facilities agreed to reduce the applicable margin under the term loan facility by 225 percent per annum in june 2004 we received approval from our lenders for a further reduction of 075 percent per annum in the applicable margin under the term loan facility 

  

in february 2005 astaris refinanced its credit agreement and entered into a new 750 million revolving credit agreement with a group of lenders in connection with this refinancing all amounts due to us and solutia that had previously been deferred approximately 16 million each were repaid our obligation to make keepwell payments terminated and our letters of credit in the amount of 100 million previously delivered in support of this obligation were cancelled 

  

in connection with astaris’ new revolving credit agreement solutia and we consented subject to approval expected in march 2005 of solutia’s consent by the bankruptcy court overseeing solutia’s chapter 11 petition 

  

as described below to certain restrictions imposed by the revolving credit agreement on the ability of astaris to make certain payments to us and solutia these restrictions relate to the absence of a default by astaris achievement of a minimum ebitda threshold as defined in the astaris credit agreement for the most recent fourquarter period and minimum borrowing availability it is possible that these restrictions would delay some payments due to fmc from astaris although we do not anticipate that any deferrals in 2005 would exceed 10 million the previously agreed upon deferral agreement among astaris solutia and us in support of the astaris restructuring plan was terminated also subject to bankruptcy court approval 

  

in december 2003 solutia filed a petition in the southern district of new york under chapter 11 of the united states bankruptcy code since no plan of reorganization has been proposed as yet it is unclear what effect if any solutia’s filing will have on our interest in astaris astaris has reported to date that solutia has substantially fulfilled its contractual financial obligations to astaris however solutia astaris and we are parties to several agreements including those under which solutia manufactures certain phosphorus chemicals for astaris if solutia fails to perform its contractual obligations or seeks to reject these executory contracts with astaris astaris may have to seek alternate sources of supply under these circumstances astaris may have a damage claim against solutia there currently does not appear to be a need for future financial support by solutia to astaris however if in the future astaris requires additional support from both its owners that solutia could not fulfill this failure may in turn adversely affect astaris and our investment in the joint venture 

  

we provide guarantees to financial institutions on behalf of certain agricultural products customers principally in brazil for their seasonal borrowing amounts recorded on our consolidated balance sheets as guarantees of vendor financing for december 31 2004 and 2003 were 701 million and 443 million respectively 

  

on june 30 1999 we acquired the assets of tg soda ash inc from elf atochem north america inc “elf atochem” for approximately 510 million in cash and a contingent payment due at yearend 2003 based on the financial performance of the combined soda ash operations between 2001 and 2003 on december 31 2003 we made the required estimated payment in the amount of 324 million based upon contract requirements this payment is subject to final adjustments based upon the audited financial statements of the business we do not expect this adjustment to result in any additional material payments 

  

we continually evaluate our options for divesting real estate holdings and property plant and equipment that are no longer integral to any of our core operating businesses 

  

on february 17 2005 we completed the sale to the city of san jose california of approximately 52 acres of land at our former defense systems site there gross proceeds from the sale were 562 million and net proceeds after estimated offsets fees and expenses were approximately 50 million in the first quarter of 2005 we have an agreement with the city of san jose for the sale of the remaining approximately 23 acres we own there the city’s obligation to purchase the remaining land is subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions including a review by the california department of toxic substances control 

  

projected 2005 spending includes approximately 62 million of environmental remediation spending of which approximately 20 million relates to pocatello approximately 17 million relates to the settlement of npl sites in new jersey and approximately 25 million relates to other operating and discontinued business sites this spending does not include expected spending of approximately 17 million and 7 million in 2005 and 2006 respectively on capital projects relating to environmental control facilities also we expect to spend in the range of approximately 22 million to 23 million annually in 2005 and in 2006 for environmental compliance costs which are an operating cost of the company and are not covered by established reserves 

  

we agreed to guarantee the performance by technologies of certain obligations under several contracts debt instruments and reimbursement agreements associated with letters of credit see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements in this form 10k as of december 31 2004 these guaranteed obligations totaled 40 million compared to 68 million at december 31 2003 we also guarantee repayment of some of the borrowings of certain foreign equity method investments the other investment owners provided parallel agreements as of december 31 2004 these guarantees had maximum potential payments of 64 million 

  

at december 31 2004 and 2003 there was 410 million of principal amount outstanding of variablerate industrial and pollution control revenue bonds supported by 433 million in bank letters of credit in 2003 these letters of credit were fully collateralized with cash included as part of “restricted cash” on the consolidated balance sheet concurrently with the execution of the 2004 credit agreement the cash collateral was released 

  

shortterm debt consisted primarily of foreign credit lines at december 31 2004 and december 31 2003 we provide parentcompany guarantees to lending institutions providing credit to our foreign subsidiaries 

  

our total significant committed contracts that we believe will affect cash over the next four years and beyond are as follows 

  

       

contingencies 

  

during the second quarter of 2004 we reached agreement in principle with the epa and the doj to settle certain liabilities at two environmental remediation sites in new jersey these agreements will be effective upon negotiation and entry of a final consent decree 

  

on october 14 2003 solutia our joint venture partner in astaris see note 17 to the consolidated financial statements in the form 10k filed a lawsuit against us with the circuit court of st louis county missouri claiming that among other things we had breached our joint venture agreement due to the alleged failure of the ppa technology we contributed to astaris solutia dismissed this missouri lawsuit in february 2004 after it had filed a virtually identical lawsuit in the us bankruptcy court in the southern district of new york where its chapter 11 case is pending our motion to remove the lawsuit from bankruptcy court was granted on june 18 2004 and the matter is now pending in us district court for the southern district of new york 

  

on january 28 2005 we and our wholly owned subsidiary foret received a statement of objections from the european commission concerning alleged violations of competition law in the hydrogen peroxide business in europe during the period 1994 to 2001 all of the significant european hydrogen peroxide producers also received the statement of objections we also received a subpoena for documents from a grand jury sitting in the northern district of california which is investigating anticompetitive conduct in the hydrogen peroxide business in the united states during the period 1994 through 2003 at this time we do not believe the investigations are related in connection with these two matters in february 2005 punitive class action complaints were filed against all of the us hydrogen peroxide producers in various federal courts alleging violations of antitrust laws related cases were also filed in various state courts 

  

we are also party to another antitrust class action pending in federal court in the eastern district of pennsylvania as well as various related state court cases alleging violations of antitrust laws involving our microcrystalline cellulose product 

  

dividends 

  

we paid no cash dividends in 2004 2003 or 2002 and we do not expect to pay dividends in 2005

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend   

our earnings cash flows and financial position are exposed to market risks relating to fluctuations in commodity prices interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates our policy is to minimize exposure to our cash flow over time caused by changes in commodity interest and currency exchange rates to accomplish this we have implemented a controlled program of risk management consisting of appropriate derivative contracts entered into with major financial institutions 

  

the analysis below presents the sensitivity of the market value of our financial instruments to selected changes in market rates and prices the range of changes chosen reflects our view of changes that are reasonably possible over a oneyear period marketvalue estimates are based on the present value of projected future cash flows considering the market rates and prices chosen we calculate the market value foreign currency risk using thirdparty software incorporating standard pricing models to determine the present value of the instruments based on market conditions spot and forward foreign exchange rates as of the valuation date we obtain estimates of the market value energy price risk from calculations performed internally and by a third party 

  

at december 31 2004 our net financial instrument position of interest rate swaps and currency and energy hedges was a net liability of 54 million compared to a net asset of 11 million at december 31 2003 the change in the net financial instrument position was due to larger unrealized losses in our foreign currency portfolio 

  

commodity price risk 

  

energy costs are approximately 10 percent of our cost of sales and services and are well balanced among coal electricity and natural gas and to a lesser extent oil we attempt to mitigate our exposure to increasing energy costs by hedging the cost of natural gas and oil to analyze the effect of changing energy prices we have performed a sensitivity analysis in which we assume an instantaneous 10 percent change in energy market prices from their levels at december 31 2004 and december 31 2003 with all other variables including interest rates held constant a 10 percent increase in energy market prices would result in an increase of the net asset position of 106 million and 90 million at december 31 2004 and december 31 2003 respectively a 10 percent decrease in energy market prices would result in a decrease of 107 million and 85 million in the net asset position and as a result would change the net asset position into a net liability position at december 31 2004 and december 31 2003 respectively 

  

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

  

the primary currencies for which we have exchange rate exposure are the us dollar versus the euro the euro versus the norwegian krone the us dollar versus the japanese yen and the us dollar versus the brazilian real foreign currency debt and foreign exchange forward contracts are used in countries where we do business thereby reducing our net asset exposure foreign exchange forward contracts are also used to hedge firm and highly anticipated foreign currency cash flows 

  

to analyze the effects of changing foreign currency rates we have performed a sensitivity analysis in which we assume an instantaneous 10 percent change in the foreign currency exchange rates from their levels at december 31 2004 and december 31 2003 with all other variables including interest rates held constant a 10 percent strengthening of hedged currencies versus our functional currencies would result in an increase of 199 million and 162 million in the net liability position at december 31 2004 and december 31 2003 respectively a 10 percent weakening of hedged currencies versus our functional currencies would result in a decrease of 189 million and 156 million in the net liability position and as a result would change the net liability position into a net asset position of the relevant financial instruments at december 31 2004 and december 31 2003 respectively 

  

interest rate risk 

  

one of the strategies that we use to manage interest rate exposure is to enter into interest rate swap agreements in the agreements we agree to exchange at specified intervals the difference between fixed and variable interest amounts calculated on an agreedupon notional principal amount in the first quarter of 2003 we entered into swaps with an aggregate notional value of 1000 million these swaps in which we exchange net amounts based on making payments derived from a floatingrate index and receiving payments on a fixedrate basis are used to hedge our 1025 percent senior secured notes due 2009 

  

interest rate swaps that meet specific conditions under sfas no 133 are accounted for as fairvalue hedges the termination liability of these interest rate swap agreements at december 31 2004 was 12 million the net termination position was not material at december 31 2003 all existing fairvalue hedges are 100 percent effective as a result there is no effect on earnings from hedge ineffectiveness 

  

our debt portfolio including interest rate swap agreements at december 31 2004 is composed of 70 percent fixedrate debt and 30 percent variablerate debt compared to 62 percent fixedrate debt and 38 percent variablerate debt at december 31 2003 the variablerate component of our debt portfolio principally consists of bank borrowings variablerate industrial and pollution control revenue bonds and interest rate swap agreements entered into in the first quarter of 2003 with an aggregate notional principal amount of 1000 million changes in interest rates affect different portions of our variablerate debt portfolio in different ways 

  

based on the variablerate debt including interest rate swap agreements in our debt portfolio at december 31 2004 and 2003 a one percentage point increase or decrease in interest rates in 2004 and 2003 would increase or decrease net income by 27 million and 40 million respectively

recent history 

  

effective december 31 2001 we completed our split into two companies fmc retained the three chemical segments a separate company fmc technologies inc “technologies” operates the businesses that comprised the former energy systems and food and transportation systems segments our plan of separation was first announced on october 31 2000 on may 31 2001 we contributed the two nonchemical business segments to technologies which at the time was a whollyowned subsidiary of fmc we completed an initial public offering of approximately 17 percent of technologies’ stock in june 2001 and completed the separation on december 31 2001 by distributing all remaining shares of technologies owned by fmc as a taxfree dividend to stockholders 

  

our strategy 

  

our corporate strategy is balanced between driving growth and innovation within our specialty chemicals and agricultural products segments and generating strong cash flow in our industrial chemicals segment our longterm objectives are as follows 

  

realize the operating leverage inherent in our businesses we intend to maximize the benefits of an economic recovery by maintaining our market positions reducing costs and prudently managing our asset base in soda ash we continually strive to optimize our proprietary and lowcost solution mining and longwall mining techniques thereby reducing our production costs which we believe are already among the lowest in the industry in hydrogen peroxide we have mothballed higher cost production capacity to improve profitability in the phosphorous chemicals joint venture with solutia inc “solutia” astaris llc “astaris” a restructuring is now underway which should result in the elimination of 40 million to 50 million of total annual costs for the venture once fully implemented all of these initiatives will position our industrial chemicals business for a significant rebound in earnings as volumes increase with an economic recovery capacity utilizations improve and selling prices continue to move higher additionally in agricultural products we continue to reduce manufacturing costs by outsourcing production to third parties in mexico china and india and expect additional savings from our efforts to streamline our supply chain and reduce logistics costs 

  

create greater financial flexibility we are committed to the goal of reestablishing our investmentgrade rating through improvements to our liquidity and a significant reduction in our indebtedness in 2002 we set a target of 300 million of debt reduction by 2006 which we plan to achieve through several strategies first we expect a strong sustained rebound in our operating profit and resulting cash flow from operations second we expect capital expenditures to remain below depreciation and amortization as our businesses will meet future expected demand growth through a combination of debottlenecking current production restarting mothballed plants and outsourcing production to third parties third in connection with astaris’ recent restructuring we believe we have effectively capped future keepwell obligations and eliminated any further obligations going forward into 2005 fourth we believe that 2004 will be the last year of significant cash spending for the shutdown and remediation of the former elemental phosphorus facility in pocatello idaho lastly we continue to explore asset divestiture opportunities 

  

focus the portfolio on higher growth businesses our goal is to achieve the highest overall growth while continuing to generate returns above the cost of capital in this regard we will invest in specialty chemicals for growth focus our investment in agricultural products and manage industrial chemicals for cash within specialty chemicals we continue to invest in our leading biopolymer and lithium market positions in the pharmaceutical food ingredient and energy storage markets key strategies include developing new technologies leveraging our strategic supply position with branded multinational companies enhancing our technical support capabilities and acquiring new technologies in agricultural products we have focused our efforts on developing new applications for higher margin patented products acquiring complementary chemistries from other pesticide companies and on discovering novel insecticide compounds through our targetbased research program

see note 19 to our consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k also see below for selected financial information related to our segments 

  

agricultural products 

  

financial information in millions 

  

  

overview 

  

our agricultural products segment which represents approximately 33 percent of our 2003 consolidated revenues discovers develops manufactures and sells a portfolio of crop protection structural pest control and turf and ornamental products around the world our product development efforts focus on developing environmentally compatible solutions that can effectively increase farmers’ yields and provide more costeffective alternatives to older chemistries to which insects may have developed resistance we believe that our focused stateoftheart discovery strategy will identify novel insecticides that enable farmers to enhance their crop yields 

  

products and markets 

  

  

agricultural products provides a wide range of proprietary branded products—based on both patented and offpatent technologies—for global agricultural markets product branding is a prevalent industry practice used to help maintain and grow market share by promoting consumer recognition and the reputation of the product and the supplier while we enjoy a relatively strong position in north america we derived more than half of our agricultural products’ revenue from outside north america in 2003 

  

in contrast to most other major crop protection companies insecticides dominate our agricultural products segment particularly pyrethroid and carbamate chemistries in which we maintain leading market positions based on revenues pyrethroids are a major class of insecticides whose low use rates are unique compared to other classes of insecticides they are most effective against worm pests carbamates are a broad spectrum of insecticides used to control a wide variety of pests in both soil and foliage we also maintain niche positions in select herbicide markets we differentiate ourselves through a highly focused strategy in selected crops and regions and leverage our proprietary chemistries and pestspecific research and development “rd” to develop and market new insecticides and new applications of our existing products the following table summarizes the principal product chemistries in agricultural products and the principal uses of each chemistry 

  

   

we have several agreements with ishihara sangyo kaisha ltd “isk” a leading japanese crop protection company under which we work together to market and distribute existing and new insecticide and herbicide chemistries in various markets with the isk alliance we have expanded our distribution capabilities in japan and in europe by jointly investing with isk in the belgianbased pesticide distribution company belchim benelux nv through these alliances and our own targeted marketing efforts we expect to enhance our access to markets and develop new products that will help us continue to compete effectively 

  

research and development 

  

we plan to grow by obtaining new and approved uses for existing product lines as well as complementary chemistries from other pesticide companies our new labels for zetacypermethrin for use on corn rice alfalfa sugar cane and leafy vegetables bode well for the continued growth of this compound in addition our carfentrazoneethyl herbicide has received registrations for key potato and vine markets in europe and we anticipate profitable growth from these new labels 

  

in the intermediate term we believe the flonicamid insecticide we are developing exclusively in the americas in conjunction with isk is a significant opportunity because of its novel mode of action in addressing sucking pests as well as its favorable environmental profile it has already received approval for greenhouse use in the us and additional uses are under fast track review with the environmental protection agency “epa” 

  

our research program is capitalizing on a focused insecticide discovery strategy that combines direct insect screening with biochemical targetbased testing both approaches use stateoftheart technologies including genomics robotics and advanced computational software this enables us to successfully identify chemistries that control key agricultural pests while providing an early understanding of modes of action and safety multidisciplinary project teams have quickly moved these promising chemistries from initial discovery to global fieldtesting 

  

industry overview 

  

the three principal categories of agricultural chemicals are herbicides representing approximately half of global industry revenue insecticides representing approximately a quarter of global industry revenue and fungicides representing the remaining portion of global industry revenue we do not currently participate in the fungicide category 

  

insecticides are used to control a wide range of insects including chewing pests such as caterpillars and sucking pests such as aphids insecticides are applied as sprays dusts or granules and are used on a wide variety of crops such as fruits vegetables cotton soybean corn and cereals there are several major classes of insecticide chemistries including organophosphates carbamates and pyrethroids 

  

herbicides prevent or inhibit weed growth thereby reducing or eliminating the need for manual or mechanical weeding herbicides can be selective killing only specific unwanted foliage or nonselective killing all foliage and are also segmented by their time of application preplanting preemergent and postemergent 

  

the agrochemicals industry has undergone significant consolidation over the past several years the top crop protection companies syngenta ag bayer ag monsanto company basf ag the dow chemical company and e i du pont de nemours and company “dupont” currently represent more than three quarters of global sales while in 1996 the top six companies represented approximately 60 percent of global sales four of these companies syngenta bayer basf and dow have all made significant acquisitions of other crop protection companies over the past few years a significant driver for this consolidation has been the advent of biotechnology particularly in herbicides employed in row crops and the resulting escalation of research and development costs 

  

the next tier agrochemical producers including makteshimagan industries ltd sumitomo chemical company limited fmc isk and nufarm limited generally employ strategies focusing on niche markets additionally there is an emerging trend among these producers to partner with one another to gain economies of scale and competitive market access more comparable to larger competitors 

  

specialty chemicals 

  

financial information in millions 

  

  

overview 

  

our specialty chemicals segment which represents 27 percent of our 2003 consolidated revenues is focused on highperformance food ingredients pharmaceutical excipients and intermediates and lithium specialty products all of which enjoy solid customer bases and consistent growing demand the majority of specialty chemicals revenues are to customers in noncyclical end markets we believe that our future growth in this segment will continue to be based on the performance capabilities of these products and our research and development capabilities as well as on the alliances and the close working relationships we have developed with key global customers 

  

products and markets 

  

  

biopolymer is a supplier of microcrystalline cellulose “mcc” carrageenan and alginates—ingredients that have high valueadded applications in the production of food pharmaceutical and other specialty consumer and industrial products mcc processed from specialty grades of wood pulp provides binding and disintegrant properties for tablets and capsules and has unique functionality that improves the texture and stability of many food products carrageenan and alginates both processed from seaweed are used in a wide variety of food pharmaceutical and specialty areas novamatrix is a newly created business unit of biopolymer that produces and supplies specialty formulated alginates and serves the biomedical and advanced wound treatment markets 

  

biopolymer is organized around three major markets—food pharmaceutical and personal care—and is a key supplier to many companies in these markets many of biopolymer’s customers have come to rely on us for the majority of their supply requirements for these product lines we believe that such reliance is based on our innovative solutions and operational quality the following chart summarizes the major markets for biopolymer’s products and our chemistries in each market 

  

   

lithium 

  

lithium is a verticallyintegrated technology business based on both inorganic and organic lithium chemistries while lithium is sold into a variety of endmarkets we have focused our efforts on selected growth niches such as fine chemicals for pharmaceutical synthesis specialty polymers and energy storage 

  

the electrochemical properties of lithium make it an ideal material for portable energy storage in high performance applications including heart pacemakers cell phones camcorders personal computers and nextgeneration technologies that combine cellular and wireless capabilities into a single device lithium is also being developed as the enabling element in advanced batteries for use in hybrid electric vehicles 

  

organolithium products are sold to fine chemical and pharmaceutical customers who use lithium’s unique chemical properties to synthesize high valueadded products organolithiums are also highly valued in the specialty polymer markets as polymer initiators in the production of synthetic rubbers and elastomers based on our proprietary technology the lithium business is developing new highly specialized polymers for a variety of end uses such as rocket fuels industrial applications and automotive coatings 

  

the following chart summarizes the major markets for various lithium products 

  

   

industry overview 

  

food ingredients 

  

our biopolymer business serves the texture structure and physical stability “tsps” ingredients market tsps ingredients impart physical properties to thicken and stabilize foods there are many types of tsps ingredients and a wide range of food groups served including bakery meats dairy and convenience products the industry is dispersed geographically with the majority of the sales in europe north america and asia 

  

the industry has experienced steady revenue growth in recent years trends driving growth include increasing consumer interest in healthier foods greater convenience and growth in per capita consumption of processed foods in emerging markets the trend toward health and convenience drives the need for more functional ingredients to impart desired food tastes and textures we believe carrageenan and mcc which address this need are growing faster than the overall tsps market the global customer base for tsps is relatively fragmented and includes large and small food processors consolidation among these customers has been a significant trend over the past several years mergers of large food companies have included slimfast foods companybestfoodsunilever plc nabisco group holdings corpkraft foods inc the pillsbury companygeneral mills inc suiza foods corporationdean foods company we believe that such large consolidated companies tend to grow at twice the rate of smaller firms in light of these conditions tsps ingredient suppliers such as fmc have focused on establishing strategic alliances with market leaders with the goal of reducing costs leveraging technology and expanding product offerings with key accounts 

  

within the entire food ingredients market there are a relatively large number of suppliers due principally to the broad spectrum of chemistries employed segment leadership global position and investment in technology are key factors to sustaining profitability in addition larger suppliers may often provide a broader product line and a range of services to food companies including functional systems or blends the top suppliers of tsps 

  

ingredients include danisco as dupont cp kelco aps imperial chemical industries plc cargill incorporated sobel nv dgf stoess ag fmc degussa ag and tate  lyle plc 

  

pharmaceutical chemicals 

  

our biopolymer business sells into the formulation chemicals segment of the pharmaceutical market the major end markets for formulation chemicals include coatings and colors fillers binders sweeteners and flavors disintegrants and others 

  

competitors tend to be grouped by chemistry our principal mcc competitors in pharmaceuticals include j rettenmaier  sôhne gmbh ming tai chemical co ltd asahi kasei corporation and blanver farmoquimica ltda while pricing pressures from low cost producers is a common competitive dynamic companies like fmc offset that pressure by providing the most reliable and broadest range of products and services customers of excipients are pharmaceutical firms who depend upon reliable therapeutic performance of their drug products 

  

we also supply alginates into food and health care markets highly refined extracts from selected seaweeds provide a broad range of alginate functionality including uses in antireflux disorders dental impressions control release of drugs and wound dressings 

  

lithium specialties 

  

lithium is a highly versatile metal with diverse enduse markets including glassceramics aluminum production pharmaceuticals polymers and both rechargeable and disposable batteries 

  

we market a wide variety of lithiumbased products ranging from upstream commodity lithium carbonate to highly specialized downstream products such as organolithium compounds and cathodic materials for batteries in past years lithium carbonate experienced a significant price decline due largely to industry oversupply during 2003 market pricing stabilized as a result of a better balance of supply and demand for lithium carbonate 

  

there are only three integrated producers of lithium fmc chemetall sa and sociedad quimica y minera de chile sa all of which produce lithium carbonate only two fmc and chemetell produce specialty grades of lithium new entry into the specialty lithium markets is difficult due to the level of proprietary processes and product technology involved the markets for specialty lithium products tend to be concentrated in more developed regions including north america europe and asia 

  

industrial chemicals 

  

financial information in millions 

  

  

overview 

  

our industrial chemicals segment which represents 40 percent of our 2003 consolidated revenues has lowcost positions in highvolume inorganic chemicals including soda ash and hydrogen peroxide complemented by highvalue niche positions in specialty alkali phosphorus and peroxygen products 

  

products and markets 

  

  

industrial chemicals serves a diverse group of markets from economically sensitive industrial sectors to technologyintensive specialty markets we process and sell refined inorganic products that are sought by customers for their critical reactivity or specific functionality in markets such as paper pulp glass and detergents in addition we produce purify and market highervalue downstream derivatives into specialized and customerspecific applications these applications include dialysis rocket propulsion animal nutrition biocides semiconductors and even baking 

  

alkali 

  

our alkali chemical division produces natural soda ash soda ash is used by manufacturers in the glass chemical processing and detergent industries to a lesser degree we also produce sodium bicarbonate caustic soda and sodium sesquicarbonate our products are manufactured and sold through fmc wyoming corporation which we manage as an integral part of our alkali business in which we own shares representing an 875 percent economic interest with the remaining shares held by two japanese companies 

  

we mine and produce natural soda ash using proprietary lowcost mining technologies such as longwall and solution mining which we believe gives us the lowest cost versus other suppliers our two production sites in green river wyoming have the capacity to produce approximately 49 million tons of soda ash annually though the business over the last several years has mothballed 13 million tons of capacity to improve cost structure and to respond to market conditions 

  

peroxygens 

  

we produce hydrogen peroxide worldwide with production facilities in the united states canada and mexico and in spain and the netherlands through foret as described below we also participate in a joint venture company in thailand we sell hydrogen peroxide into the pulp and paper industry and to a lesser extent in the electronics chemical processing food and textiles industries we believe we are a leading north american producer of hydrogen peroxide due in part to our broad product line geographicallyadvantaged plant locations and our stateoftheart processing technology hydrogen peroxide represents approximately 70 percent of our peroxygens sales 

  

our specialty peroxygens business supplies persulfate products primarily to polymer and printed circuit board markets and peracetic acid predominately to the food industry for biocidal applications typically we compete as a specialty player where we believe that we are differentiated by our strong technical expertise unique process technology and geographic location 

  

foret 

  

our european subsidiary fmc foret sa “foret” headquartered just outside of barcelona spain is a leader in providing chemical products to the detergent paper textile tanning and chemical industries foret is a large and diverse operation with seven manufacturing locations in europe foret has positions in phosphates hydrogen peroxides perborates sulfur derivatives silicates and zeolites foret’s sales efforts are focused in southern europe africa and the middle east 

  

astaris 

  

astaris our 50 percentowned unconsolidated joint venture with solutia is one of two large diversified phosphorus chemical suppliers in the americas astaris was formed as a separate company in 2000 with headquarters in st louis missouri astaris’ products are used in chemical processing baking beverage food processing detergent applications and fire suppressants astaris has diversified its raw material inputs to use both elemental phosphorus and purified phosphoric acid “ppa” 

  

in 2003 astaris announced the approval of a restructuring plan to improve their financial performance the restructuring which includes the exit of the commodity sodium tripolyphosphate market is expected to reduce fixed costs through facility shut downs and the elimination of certain lowcontribution products in addition the restructuring is expected to result in improvement in the venture’s position in food and technical phosphates 

  

industry overview 

  

we primarily participate in three markets soda ash peroxygens and phosphorus chemicals these products are generally inorganicbased produced from minerals or air and are generally commodities which in many cases have few cost effective substitutes growth is typically a function of gdp or the rate of industrialization in key export markets pricing tends to reflect shortterm supply and demand as producers add or reduce capacity andor demand changes 

  

soda ash 

  

soda ash is a highly alkaline inorganic chemical essential in the production of glass and widely used in the production of chemicals soaps and detergents and many other products natural soda ash is generally produced from trona a natural form of sodium sesquicarbonate through mining and chemical processing soda ash may also be produced synthetically but this process requires a significant amount of energy and produces large quantities of waste byproducts making it much less costeffective than natural soda ash production 

  

because of the processing cost advantages of trona and the large natural reserves of trona in the us particularly in green river wyoming all us soda ash production is natural by contrast due to a lack of trona a large percentage of the soda ash that is manufactured in the rest of the world is produced synthetically other us producers are oci chemical corporation solvay sa the general chemical group inc and imc global inc 

  

approximately 40 percent of us natural soda ash production will serve export markets in 2004 with approximately 25 percent of us natural soda ash production exported through the american natural soda ash association “ansac” ansac is the foreign sales association of the significant us producers of soda ash and was established in 1983 under the webbpomerene act and subsequent legislation since its creation ansac has been successful in coordinating soda ash exports exploiting the natural cost benefits of us—produced natural soda ash and leveraging its large scale of operations to the benefit of its member companies us exports of soda ash have risen significantly over the last twenty years 

  

peroxygens 

  

hydrogen peroxide is typically sold in aqueous solutions for use as a bleach or oxidizer as such it often competes with other chemicals capable of performing similar functions some of our specialty peroxygen 

  

derivatives eg persulfates perborates percarbonates also function as bleaching or oxidizing agents environmental regulations regional cost differences often due to transportation costs and technical differences in product performance enter into the decision to use hydrogen peroxide or one of its derivatives rather than another product since these considerations vary by region the consumption patterns vary in different parts of the world hydrogen peroxide is sold in aqueous solutions usually 35 percent 50 percent or 70 percent by weight 

  

the us pulp and paper industry represents approximately 67 percent of domestic demand for hydrogen peroxide in this market hydrogen peroxide is used as an environmentally friendly bleaching agent to brighten chemical mechanical and recycled pulps as well as treat a wide range of mill pollutants in the waste stream during the 1990s the hydrogen peroxide market became increasingly cyclical dependent on the pulp industry which has recently experienced a general slowdown in addition demand growth for hydrogen peroxide has slowed as the conversion from elemental chlorine by the us pulp industry is largely complete in recent years these trends have had a negative effect on pricing but modest improvement in demand along with a reduction in effective capacity have resulted in slightly higher prices the other north american hydrogen peroxide producers are akzo nobel nv total sa degussa ag keminra oyj and solvay sa 

  

phosphorous chemicals 

  

phosphorous chemicals are used in many industrial applications in a wide array of chemical compounds overall growth in demand for phosphorous chemicals tends to correlate with gdp phosphoric acid and phosphate salts eg sodium phosphates calcium phosphates potassium phosphates are sold into many markets including food beverage water treatment automotive metal cleaning detergents and fire suppressants 

  

the basic feed for making phosphates is now produced using two processes most industrial applications use the costeffective process that involves making ppa by the purification of fertilizergrade phosphoric acid thermal phosphoric acid long the industry standard is produced from elemental phosphorus but is more costly due to energy and environmental compliance costs and is now used mainly in limited applications while astaris our phosphorus joint venture ceased the production of elemental phosphorus in 2001 it is still produced by monsanto in the united states thermphos in the netherlands and in several other countries principally china 

  

worldwide demand for phosphorous chemicals declined in the early 1990s as detergents containing phosphates for homelaundry use were banned in north america and parts of europe over the next few years industrial demand for phosphorous chemicals is expected to improve driven by growing demand in the detergents and food and beverage industries in newly industrializing nations and by the growth of food and beverage applications in the united states and europe 

  

beginning in the late 1990s reduced demand the shift in growth toward developing regions and the advent of new technology resulted in a significant restructuring of the phosphorus chemicals industry as producers consolidated or exited the business 

  

in north america we participate in the phosphorus chemicals business through astaris in europe we participate in this business through foret both astaris and foret use the ppa process major competitors include rhodia sa prayon rupel sa and the potash corporation of saskachewan inc 

  

source and availability of raw materials 

  

our raw material requirements vary by business segment and include mineralrelated natural resources trona ore lithium brines and phosphate rock processed chemicals seaweed specialty wood pulp and energy sources such as oil gas coal and electricity raw materials represented approximately 30 percent of our 2003 cost of sales and services and no one raw material represented more than 7 percent of our total raw material purchases 

  

ores used in industrial chemicals manufacturing processes such as trona are extracted from mines in the us on property held by fmc under longterm leases subject to periodic adjustment of royalty rates raw materials used by specialty chemicals include lithium carbonate which is currently obtained from a south american manufacturer under a longterm sourcing agreement various types of seaweed that are sourced on a global basis and wood pulp which is purchased from several north american producers raw materials used by agricultural products primarily processed chemicals are obtained from a variety of suppliers worldwide 

  

patents 

  

fmc owns a number of us and foreign patents trademarks and licenses that are cumulatively important to its business we do not believe that the loss of any one or group of related patents trademarks or licenses would have a material adverse effect on the overall business of fmc the duration of our patents depends on their respective jurisdictions their expiration dates range through 2021 

  

seasonality 

  

the seasonal nature of the crop protection market and the geographic spread of the agricultural products business generally produce weaker earnings in the first quarter of the year agricultural products sold into the northern hemisphere north america europe and parts of asia serve seasonal agricultural markets from march through september while markets in the southern hemisphere latin america and parts of the asia pacific region including australia are served from july through february the remainder of our businesses are generally not subject to significant seasonal fluctuations 

  

competition 

  

we have a number one or number two market position in many of our product lines based on revenue either globally or in north america largely as a result of our proprietary technologies and with respect to industrial chemicals our position as a lowcost producer the following product lines accounted for the majority of our 2003 consolidated revenue market positions are based on the most recently available revenue data 

  

    

   

competitive conditions 

  

we encounter substantial competition in each of our three business segments this competition is expected to continue in both the united states and markets outside of the united states we market our products through our own sales organization and through independent distributors and sales representatives the number of our principal competitors varies from segment to segment in general we compete by operating in a costefficient manner and by leveraging our industry experience to provide advanced technology high product quality and reliability and quality customer and technical service 

  

our agricultural products segment competes in the global crop protection market for insecticides and herbicides the industry is characterized by a small number of large competitors and a large number of smaller 

  

often regional competitors such as fmc industry products include crop protection chemicals and for major competitors genetically engineered crop biotechnology products competition from generic producers has increased as a significant number of product patents have expired in the last decade in general we compete as a product innovator by focusing on insecticide discovery and development and by licensing products from alliances when the products complement our product portfolio we also differentiate ourselves by reacting quickly in key markets establishing effective product stewardship programs and developing strategic alliances which strengthen market access in key countries 

  

with significant positions in markets that include alginate carrageenan microcrystalline cellulose and lithiumbased products specialty chemicals competes on the basis of product differentiation customer service and price biopolymer competes with both direct suppliers of cellulose and seaweed extract as well as suppliers of other hydrocolloids which may provide similar functionality in specific applications in microcrystalline cellulose competitors are typically smaller than fmc while in seaweed extracts alginates we compete with other broadbased chemical companies fmc and each of its two most significant competitors in lithium extract the element from naturally occurring lithiumrich brines located in the andes mountains of argentina and chile which are believed to be the world’s most significant and lowest cost sources of lithium 

  

industrial chemicals serves the alkali peroxygens and phosphorus markets predominantly in the united states and to a lesser extent europe in north america the soda ash business competes with four domestic producers of natural soda ash three of which operate in the vicinity of our mine and processing facility in green river wyoming outside of north america and europe fmc sells soda ash through ansac internationally our natural soda ash competes with synthetic soda ash manufactured by numerous producers ranging from integrated multinational companies to smaller regional companies we maintain a leading position in the north american market for hydrogen peroxide there are currently five firms competing in the hydrogen peroxide market in north america the primary competitive factor affecting the sales of soda ash and hydrogen peroxide is price we seek to maintain our competitive position by employing low cost processing technology at foret we possess a strong cost and market position in phosphates perborates peroxygens zeolites and sulfur derivatives in each of these markets we face significant competition from a range of multinational and regional chemical producers we participate in the phosphorus chemicals business in the united states through the astaris joint venture competition in phosphorus chemicals is based primarily on price and to a lesser degree product differentiation 

  

research and development expense 

  

we perform product research and development in all of our segments with the majority of our efforts focused in our agricultural products segment the product development efforts in our agricultural products segment focus on developing more environmentally compatible solutions that can costeffectively increase farmers’ yields and provide alternatives to insectresistant chemistries our research and development expenses in the last three years are set forth below 

  

   

environmental laws and regulations 

  

we are subject to various federal state local and foreign environmental laws and regulations that govern emissions of air pollutants discharges of water pollutants and the manufacture storage handling and disposal of 

  

hazardous substances hazardous wastes and other toxic materials and remediation of contaminated sites we are also subject to liabilities arising under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act “cercla” and similar state laws that impose responsibility on persons who arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances and on current and previous owners and operators of a facility for the cleanup of hazardous substances released from the facility into the environment in addition we are subject to liabilities under the resource conservation and recovery act “rcra” and analogous state laws that require owners and operators of facilities that treat store or dispose of hazardous waste to follow certain waste management practices and to clean up releases of hazardous waste into the environment associated with past or present practices 

  

we have been named a potentially responsible party or prp at 26 sites on the federal government’s national priority list in addition we also have received notice from the epa or other regulatory agencies that we may be a potentially responsible party “prp” or prp equivalent at other sites including 48 sites at which we have determined that it is reasonably possible that we have an environmental liability in cooperation with appropriate government agencies we are currently participating in or have participated in a remedial investigationfeasibility study “rifs” or its equivalent at most of the identified sites with the status of each investigation varying from site to site at certain sites a rifs has only recently begun providing limited information if any relating to cost estimates timing or the involvement of other prps whereas at other sites the studies are complete remedial action plans have been chosen or a record of decision has “rod” been issued 

  

environmental liabilities include obligations relating to waste handling and the remediation andor study of sites at which we are alleged to have disposed of regulated materials these sites include current operations previously operated sites and sites associated with discontinued operations we have provided reserves for potential environmental obligations that we consider probable and for which a reasonable estimate of the obligation could be made as of december 31 2003 our total environmental reserve after accounting for any potential recoveries from third parties which we estimate at 170 million was 1861 million compared to 1957 million at december 31 2002 after accounting for recoveries of 277 million in addition we have estimated that reasonably possible environmental loss contingencies may exceed this reserve by as much as 75 million at december 31 2003 

  

employees 

  

we employ approximately 5300 people with approximately 2900 people in our domestic operations and 2400 people in our foreign operations approximately 30 percent of our usbased employees and 45 percent of our foreignbased employees are represented by collective bargaining agreements we have successfully concluded virtually all of our recent contract negotiations without a work stoppage in those rare instances where a work stoppage has occurred there has been no material effect on consolidated sales and earnings we cannot predict however the outcome of future contract negotiations in 2004 we have three collectivebargaining agreements expiring these contracts affect approximately two percent of usbased employees and 22 percent of foreignbased employees

securities and exchange commission “sec” filings are available free of charge on our website wwwfmccom our annual reports on form 10k quarterly reports on form 10q current reports on form 8k and amendments to those reports are posted as soon as practicable after we furnish such materials to the sec 

  










 item 2 properties 

  

fmc leases executive offices in philadelphia and operates 37 manufacturing facilities and mines in 19 countries our major research and development facility is in princeton new jersey 

  

trona ore used for soda ash production in green river wyoming is mined primarily from property held under longterm leases we own the land and mineral rights to the salar del hombre muerto lithium reserves in argentina a number of our chemical plants require the basic raw materials which are provided by these fmcowned or leased mines without which other sources would have to be obtained with regard to our mining properties operated under longterm leases no single lease or related group of leases is material to our businesses or to our company as a whole 

  

most of our plant sites are owned with some under lease we believe our properties and facilities meet present requirements and are in good operating condition and that each of our significant manufacturing facilities is operating at a level consistent with capacity utilization prevalent in the industries in which it operates the number and location of our production properties for continuing operations are 

  

   




 item 3 legal proceedings 

  

like hundreds of other industrial companies we have been named as one of many defendants in asbestosrelated personal injury litigation these cases most cases involve between 50 and 350 defendants allege personal injury or death resulting from exposure to asbestos in premises of fmc or to asbestoscontaining components installed in machinery or equipment manufactured or sold by discontinued operations the machinery and equipment businesses we owned or operated did not fabricate the asbestoscontaining component parts at issue in the litigation and to this day neither the us occupational safety and health administration nor the epa has banned the use of these components further the asbestoscontaining materials were housed inside of machinery and equipment and accessible only at the time of infrequent repair and maintenance therefore we believe that overall the claims against fmc are without merit and consider ourselves to be a peripheral defendant in these matters indeed the bulk of the claims against us to date have been dismissed without payment 

  

as of december 31 2003 there were approximately 37000 premises and product claims pending against fmc in several jurisdictions to date we have had discharged all before trial approximately 52500 claims against fmc the overwhelming majority of which have been dismissed without any payment to the plaintiff the costs of all settlements to date have totaled approximately 4 million 

  

we intend to continue managing these cases in accordance with our historical experience we have established a reserve for this litigation and believe that the outcome of these cases will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated cash flows or financial condition 

  

we are party to various other lawsuits both as defendant and plaintiff arising in the normal course of business we believe that the disposition of these lawsuits will not individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on our consolidated cash flows or financial condition

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

  

our company 

  

we are a diversified global chemical company providing innovative solutions and applications to a wide variety of end markets we operate in three business segments agricultural products specialty chemicals and industrial chemicals agricultural products’ principal focus is on insecticides which are used to enhance crop yield and quality by controlling a wide spectrum of pests and on herbicides which are used to reduce the need for manual or mechanical weeding by inhibiting or preventing weed growth specialty chemicals consists of our biopolymer and lithium businesses and focuses on food ingredients that are used to enhance texture structure and physical stability pharmaceutical additives for binding and disintegrant use and lithium specialties for pharmaceutical synthesis and energy storage our industrial chemicals segment manufactures a wide range of inorganic materials including soda ash peroxygens and phosphorus chemicals 

  

agricultural products 

  

our agricultural products segment manufactures and sells proprietary branded insecticides and herbicides we have a strong position in two widelyused classes of insecticides pyrethroids and carbamates and possess a niche portfolio of proprietary herbicides these products are used for the protection of cotton corn rice cereals vegetables and other crops in addition in north america we sell into the professional pest control and home and garden markets we differentiate ourselves through a highlyfocused strategy in selected crops and regions and by leveraging proprietary chemistries and pestspecific research and development “rd” to develop and market new insecticides and new applications of our existing products we have also developed strategic alliances with companies such as ishihara sangyo kaisha ltd “isk” a japanese crop protection company to access new markets and develop new insecticides 

  

specialty chemicals 

  

our specialty chemicals segment is comprised of our biopolymer and lithium businesses biopolymer manufactures and sells microcrystalline cellulose carrageenan and alginates products that add texture structure and physical stability to a wide range of beverage dairy meat and bakery products andor that act as binders and disintegrants for tablets and capsules our lithium business is a technologybased business in which mined lithium is processed and sold for use in a broad array of specialty products including pharmaceuticals specialty polymers and energy storage devices the majority of specialty chemicals’ sales are to customers engaged in noncyclical end markets such as food and pharmaceuticals 

  

industrial chemicals 

  

our industrial chemicals segment manufactures soda ash peroxygens and phosphorus chemicals through our manufacturing facility in green river wyoming we process naturally occurring soda ash a commonly used ingredient in detergents and chemical processing and an essential ingredient in glass we produce hydrogen peroxide leveraging our geographically advantaged plant locations throughout north america to reach our customers we also market specialty grades of hydrogen peroxide and specialty peroxygens to the electronics polymers and food processing industries our european subsidiary fmc foret sa “foret” leverages its low production costs and strong brand name to manufacture and sell phosphorus chemicals peroxygens sulfur derivatives silicates zeolites and other products in europe africa and the middle east we are also a 50 percent owner with solutia inc “solutia” of astaris llc “astaris” a north american producer of phosphorus chemicals used in a wide array of markets including the detergent food agricultural and industrial markets we account for astaris as an equity investment the majority of industrial chemicals’ sales are to customers engaged in relatively cyclical end markets 

  

the reorganization of our company 

  

we implemented our plan to split fmc into separate chemical and machinery companies in 2001 through a twostep process the first step included an initial public offering “ipo” of 17 percent of fmc technologies inc “technologies” which took place in the second quarter of 2001 technologies consists of our former energy systems and food and transportation systems business segments subsequent to the ipo technologies made net payments of 4307 million to fmc in exchange for the net assets distributed to technologies on june 1 2001 which we used to retire shortterm and longterm debt the second step the distribution of our remaining 83 percent ownership in technologies the “spinoff” occurred on december 31 2001 total net assets distributed on december 31 2001 were 5095 million 

  

we believe that the spinoff of technologies has allowed us to focus our efforts in the chemical industry through improved customer orientation increased innovation and overall growth in certain businesses in an effort to align our business with our future growth plans we took various strategic measures in 2003 2002 and 2001 including the restructuring of businesses reduction of staff plant shut downs plant mothballing and the impairment of certain underperforming assets we believe these steps have increased our financial flexibility particularly as operating conditions change 

  

critical accounting policies 

  

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of asset liabilities revenues and expenses we have described our accounting policies in note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k we have reviewed these accounting policies identifying those that we believe to be critical to the preparation and understanding of our consolidated financial statements we have reviewed with the audit committee those accounting policies that we have deemed critical these policies are central to our presentation of results of operations and financial condition and require management to make estimates and judgments on certain matters we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience current conditions and other reasonable factors 

  

environmental 

  

we provide for environmentalrelated obligations when they are probable and amounts can be reasonably estimated where the available information is sufficient to estimate the amount of liability that estimate has been used where the information is only sufficient to establish a range of probable liability and no point within the range is more likely than any other the lower end of the range has been used 

  

estimated obligations to remediate sites that involve oversight by the epa or similar government agencies are generally accrued no later than when a rod or equivalent is issued or upon completion of a rifs that is accepted by us and the appropriate government agency or agencies estimates are reviewed quarterly by our environmental remediation management as well as by financial and legal management and if necessary adjusted as additional information becomes available the estimates can change substantially as additional information becomes available regarding the nature or extent of site contamination required remediation methods and other actions by or against governmental agencies or private parties 

  

our environmental liabilities for continuing and discontinued operations are principally for costs associated with the remediation andor study of sites at which we are alleged to have disposed of hazardous substances such costs principally include among other items rifs site remediation costs of operation and maintenance of the remediation plan fees to outside law firms and consultants for work related to the environmental effort and future monitoring costs estimated site liabilities are determined based upon existing remediation laws and technologies specific site consultants’ engineering studies or by extrapolating experience with environmental issues at comparable sites 

  

provisions for environmental costs are reflected in income net of probable and estimable recoveries from named prps or other third parties such provisions incorporate inflation and are not discounted to their present values 

  

in calculating and evaluating the adequacy of our environmental reserves we have taken into account the joint and several liability imposed by cercla and the analogous state laws on all prps and have considered the identity and financial condition of each of the other prps at each site to the extent possible we have also considered the identity and financial condition of other third parties from whom recovery is anticipated as well as the status of our claims against such parties although we are unable to forecast the ultimate contributions of prps and other third parties with absolute certainty the degree of uncertainty with respect to each party is taken into account when determining the environmental reserve by adjusting the reserve to reflect the facts and circumstances on a sitebysite basis our liability includes management’s best estimate of the costs expected to be paid before the consideration of any potential recoveries from third parties we believe that any recorded recoveries related to prps are realizable in all material respects we have recorded recoveries representing probable realization of claims against insurance companies us government agencies and other third parties of 170 million and 277 million respectively at december 31 2003 and 2002 these recoveries are recorded as an offset to “environmental liabilities continuing and discontinued” cash recoveries for the years 2003 2002 and 2001 were 107 million 162 million and 125 million respectively in addition at december 31 2003 we have estimated that reasonably possible environmental loss contingencies may exceed amounts accrued by as much as 750 million we recorded total environmental provisions related to both operating and discontinued sites of 249 million 102 million and 688 million in 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively 

  

impairments and valuation of longlived assets 

  

our longlived assets include property plant and equipment and longterm investments goodwill and intangible assets we test for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the net book value of these assets may not be recoverable from the estimated undiscounted expected future cash flows expected to result from their use and eventual disposition in cases where the estimated undiscounted expected future cash flows are less than net book value an impairment loss is recognized equal to the amount by which the net book value exceeds the estimated fair value of assets which is based on discounted cash flows at the lowest level determinable the estimated cash flows reflect our assumptions about selling prices volumes costs and market conditions over a reasonable period of time we recognized 3231 million in asset impairments in 2001 related to our industrial chemicals segment no such impairments were recognized in either 2002 or 2003 

  

we prepare an annual impairment test of goodwill and intangible assets based on estimated discounted cash flows the assumptions used to estimate fair value include our best estimate of future growth rates discount rates and market conditions over a reasonable period we performed this test in 2003 and determined that no impairment charge was required total goodwill as of december 31 2003 and 2002 was 1563 million and 1297 million respectively and is related to our specialty chemicals segment the change in goodwill is due to the effects of currency exchange 

  

depreciation for financial reporting is reported on a straightline basis over the estimated useful lives of the fixed asset estimated useful lives are based on historical usefullife trends as well as common industry practice useful lives are as follows 20 years—land improvements 20 to 50 years—buildings depending on location and use 3 to 18 years machinery and equipment depending on type and use depreciation expense totaled 1125 million 1052 million and 1122 million in 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively 

  

pensions and other postretirement benefits 

  

we provide qualified and nonqualified defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans as well as postretirement health care and life insurance benefit plans to our employees the costs or benefits and obligations related to these benefits reflect key assumptions related to general economic conditions including 

  

interest discount rates healthcare cost trend rates expected rates of return on plan assets and the rates of compensation increases for employees the costs or benefits and obligations for these benefit programs are also affected by other assumptions such as average retirement age mortality employee turnover and plan participation to the extent our plans’ actual experience as influenced by changing economic and financial market conditions or by changes to our own plans’ demographics differs from these assumptions the costs and obligations for providing these benefits as well as the plans’ funding requirements could increase or decrease when actual results differ from our assumptions the difference is typically recognized over future periods in addition the unrealized gains and losses related to our pension and postretirement benefit obligations may also affect periodic benefit costs in future periods 

  

we use certain calculated values of assets under methods both to estimate the expected rate of return on assets component of pension cost and to calculate our plans’ funding requirements the expected rate of return on plan assets is based on a marketrelated value of assets that recognizes investment gains and losses over a fiveyear period we use an actuarial value of assets to determine our plans’ funding requirements the actuarial value of assets must be within a certain range high or low of the actual market value of assets and is adjusted accordingly 

  

we recorded 77 million 49 million and 40 million of pension and other postretirement benefit cost in 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively at december 31 2003 and 2002 977 million and 1066 million respectively was recorded for pension and other postretirement benefit obligations the recorded amounts for pension benefit obligations include additional minimum pension liabilities of 432 million and 848 million at december 31 2003 and 2002 respectively which were recorded in the accumulated other comprehensive income section in stockholders’ equity 

  

we made voluntary cash contributions to our us qualified pension plan of 70 million and 28 million respectively for 2003 and 2002 in addition we paid nonqualified pension benefits from company assets of 24 million and 41 million for 2003 and 2002 respectively we paid postretirement benefits net of participant contributions of 66 million and 75 million for 2003 and 2002 respectively our estimated cash contributions for 2004 include approximately 4 million in nonqualified pension benefits approximately 7 million in postretirement benefits and we are considering making voluntary cash contributions to our us qualified pension plan of approximately 8 million 

  

we select the discount rate used to calculate pension and other postretirement obligations based on a review of highquality corporate bonds with particular focus on the moody’s investors service inc “moody’s” aarated corporate and industrial bond indices towards the end of each respective year bonds in these indices have remaining maturities of at least 20 years and the indices are constructed to have an average remaining maturity of approximately 30 years we selected a discount rate of 625 percent at december 31 2003 for pension and other postretirement benefit obligations 

  

the expected rate of return on plan assets is viewed as a longterm average rate of return to be earned on the assets invested or to be invested to provide for the benefits included in the projected benefit obligation in developing the expected longterm rate of return on asset assumption for our plan we take into consideration the technical analysis performed by our outside actuaries including historical market returns information on longterm real return expectations by asset class inflation assumptions and expectations for standard deviation related to these best estimates we also consider the historical performance of our own plan’s trust which has earned a compound annual rate of return of 125 percent over the last 10 years which is in excess of comparable market indices for the same period as well as other factors the current asset allocation for our plan is approximately 70 percent equities us and nonus and 30 percent fixedincome investments given an actively managed investment portfolio the expected returns by asset class for our portfolio using geometric averaging and after being adjusted for an estimated inflation rate of approximately three percent is between nine percent and eleven percent for both us and nonus equities and between five percent and seven percent for fixedincome 

  

investments which generates a total expected portfolio return that is in line with our rate of return assumption we continually monitor the appropriateness of this rate in light of current market conditions for the sensitivity of our pension costs to incremental changes in this assumption see our discussion below 

  

the other postretirement benefit obligations and net periodic other postretirement benefit costs noted above do not reflect the effects of the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of 2003 “medicare act” specific authoritative guidance on accounting for the subsidy included in the medicare act is still pending and once issued may require us to change previously reported information we have elected to defer the accounting for the effects of the medicare act 

  

sensitivity analysis related to key pension and postretirement benefit assumptions  a onehalf percent increase in the assumed discount rate would have decreased pension and other postretirement benefit obligations by 477 million at december 31 2003 and 476 million at december 31 2002 and decreased pension and other postretirement benefit costs by 09 million 12 million and 12 million for 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively a onehalf percent decrease in the assumed discount rate would have increased pension and other postretirement benefit obligations by 525 million at december 31 2003 and 505 million at december 31 2002 and increased pension and other postretirement benefit net periodic benefit cost by 40 million 10 million and 11 million for 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively 

  

a onehalf percent increase in the assumed expected longterm rate of return on plan assets would have decreased pension costs by 32 million 30 million and 29 million for 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively a onehalf percent decrease in the assumed longterm rate of return on plan assets would have increased pension costs by 32 million 30 million and 29 million for 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively 

  

further details on our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and net periodic benefit costs are found in note 12 to our consolidated financial statements 

  

income taxes 

  

we have recorded a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized in assessing the need for this allowance we have considered a number of factors including future taxable income the jurisdictions in which such income is earned and our ongoing tax planning strategies in the event that we determined that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period such determination was made similarly should we conclude that we would be able to realize certain deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase income in the period such determination was made at december 31 2003 and 2002 the valuation allowance was 390 million and 224 million respectively 

  

results of operations—2003 2002 and 2001 

  

overview 

  

all results discussed in this analysis address the continuing results of our chemical businesses the results of technologies which was spunoff on december 31 2001 have been reclassified to discontinued operations within our consolidated statement of income for the year ended december 31 2001 and consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended december 31 2001 see “the reorganization of our company” for an overview of our spinoff of technologies 

  

    

   

see “segment results” for a detailed discussion of events affecting our results for 2003 2002 and 2001 

  

results of operations—2003 compared to 2002 

  

in the following discussion “year” refers to the year ending december 31 2003 and “prior year” refers to the year ending december 31 2002 all comparisons are between these periods unless otherwise noted 

  

revenue for the year ended december 31 2003 was 19214 million up 4 percent compared with 18529 million in the prior year this increase was due to a stronger euro growth in specialty chemicals sales in the pharmaceutical market and increased agricultural products sales in latin america and europe 

  

restructuring and other charges gains totaled 51 million 48 million after tax in 2003 compared with 301 million 184 million after tax in 2002 

  

the before tax gain of 51 million we recorded in 2003 was the result of a gain on the sale of an office building in foret our spanish subsidiary offset by charges in all segments the gain on the building was 119 million net of related costs including severance severance costs were recorded in industrial chemicals and in both our agricultural products and specialty chemicals segments total 2003 severance charges including amounts recorded at foret were 57 million and related to approximately 80 people most of whom separated from fmc in late 2003 the remaining charges in the year included noncash charges totaling 28 million primarily for the abandonment of an asset in the specialty chemicals segment offset by the reversal of certain workforce related and facility shutdown reserves in corporate as shown in the table in note 6 to our consolidated financial statements in this form 10k resulting from our ability to meet certain obligations on more favorable terms than expected when the reserves were established the remaining other charges of 22 million were related to environmental costs at operating sites largely in our industrial chemicals segment 

  

in 2002 restructuring and other charges of 301 million before tax consisted of charges related to each of our segments the details by segment are discussed below 

  

in an effort to mitigate the effects of the continued economic weakness in the markets served by our industrial chemicals business we undertook several cost saving initiatives that resulted in 124 million of restructuring charges included in this amount was a 57 million restructuring charge for the mothballing of the basic production line at our hydrogen peroxide facility in spring hill west virginia we also mothballed our granger facility in green river wyoming resulting in a 34 million restructuring charge the majority of this charge was for facility shutdown activities and severance all of which occurred in 2002 in addition we recorded a 33 million restructuring charge for costs related to reorganization efforts to reduce costs in our us phosphorus chemicals business alkali peroxygens and at foret there were 150 severances related to these restructurings all of which occurred in 2002 

  

in agricultural products we incurred 47 million of restructuring charges in 2002 of which 37 million related to the idling and reorganization of our sulfentrazone plant in baltimore in connection with our new herbicides strategy see “segment results—2002 compared to 2001” a 10 million restructuring charge was recorded for reorganization costs to implement a new distribution strategy in europe which allows us to rely on certain strategic alliances to further penetrate and expand our european markets of the 108 severances related to these restructurings 57 occurred in 2002 

  

we recorded 13 million of restructuring charges in our specialty chemicals segment in 2002 in an effort to realign product divisions within biopolymer both domestically and internationally the majority of these costs resulted from the severance of 24 people which occurred in the first half of 2003 

  

reorganization costs of 30 million and other charges of 87 million were also recorded in 2002 these charges are discussed in note 6 to our consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k also of the 301 million of restructuring charges recorded in 2002 119 million was spent in 2002 

  

equity in earnings loss of affiliates was a loss of 686 million in 2003 versus earnings of 47 million in 2002 the loss in 2003 included charges totaling 533 million related to the previously announced restructuring program at astaris llp “astaris” our 5050 joint venture weaker affiliate earnings were primarily the result of the absence of a power resale contract which had a prior year pretax benefit of approximately 12 million and decreases in selling prices resulting from competitive pressure see note 4 to our consolidated financial statements in this form 10k for further details 

  

interest expense net increased by 29 percent to 922 million in 2003 compared to 716 million in 2002 reflecting higher interest costs in 2003 from our refinancing in the fourth quarter of 2002 see note 10 to our consolidated financial statements in this form 10k for further details on our refinancing and related 2003 amendment 

  

provisions benefit for income taxes were a benefit of 18 million in 2003 compared with a provision of 174 million for 2002 reflecting tax rates of 47 and 201 respectively the tax rate in 2003 was affected by a change in the mix of domestic income compared to income earned outside of the us income we earn outside of the us is typically taxed at rates lower than income earned domestically in addition dividends received from our foreign operations and a change in the valuation allowance further contributed to the change in the provision benefit for income taxes from 2002 to 2003 in 2002 the tax rate resulted primarily from the effect of depletion and differing foreign tax rates see note 9 to our consolidated financial statements in this form 10k for further details 

  

discontinued operations  we recorded aftertax charges of 133 million and 33 million in 2003 and 2002 respectively for environmental remediation costs at sites of discontinued businesses for which we are 

  

responsible for environmental compliance see “discontinued operations” note 3 to our consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k for further details 

  

net income decreased to 265 million in 2003 compared with 658 million in 2002 reflecting increased interest expense net and lower earnings from our industrial chemicals segment somewhat offset by higher earnings in our other segments in addition net income for 2003 included restructuring and other charges gains astaris restructuring and charges in our discontinued operations totaling 410 million aftertax or 115 per share on a diluted basis as noted in the table under “overview” above these charges related primarily to restructuring programs particularly at our astaris affiliate reported in “equity in earnings loss of affiliates” but also included a gain on the sale of an office building and an aftertax environmental charge to discontinued operations of 133 million prior year net income included aftertax restructuring and other charges of 184 million also related to primarily to restructuring in industrial chemicals and an aftertax environmental charge to discontinued operations of 33 million 

  

we expect net income to improve in 2004 compared to 2003 mostly through improvement in industrial chemicals particularly due to better performance from astaris as a result of their restructuring efforts continued growth in specialty chemicals and lower interest expense 

  

other financial data 

  

capital expenditures totaled 870 million in 2003 compared with 839 million in 2002 

  

the following are line items from our segment profit and loss statement used to reconcile segment operating profit to consolidated income from continuing operations before income taxes and the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle see note 19 to our consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k 

  

corporate expenses increased to 373 million from 356 million in 2002 primarily due to higher insurance costs 

  

other income and expense net is comprised primarily of realized foreign currency gains and losses lifo inventory adjustments and pension income or expense net other income was 43 million higher than the 2002 loss of 04 million this variance is largely attributable to a lifo adjustment and the impact of foreign currency 

  

segment results 2003 compared to 2002 

  

segment operating profit is presented before taxes asset impairments restructuring and other charges gains interest expense net and other income and expense net information about how each of these items relates to our businesses at the segment level and results by segment are discussed below and in note 19 to our consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k 

  

agricultural products 

  

   

the increase in sales was driven by growth in all regions except north america and was largely achieved in the fourth quarter of the year latin america and europe showed the most significant growth as the year 

  

closed sales in latin america particularly brazil were driven by improved market conditions and higher sales of proprietary herbicides and insecticides used on such crops as cotton and sugar cane stronger european sales resulted from a number of factors including a stronger euro new approved uses for propriety herbicides referred to as “new labels” and our overall efforts to focus on highervalue proprietary products these increases more than offset the decrease in north american insecticide sales into the crop protection market due to lowerthanaverage pest pressures our professional pest control and home and garden business also saw continued growth during 2003 because of this regional sales mix insecticides were essentially flat for the year while higher sales of herbicides resulted in most of the revenue increase versus 2002 for 2003 our agricultural products revenues are made up of 76 percent insecticides and 24 percent herbicides 

  

the segment earnings improvement was a result of higher sales improved product mix related to our focus on highervalue proprietary products and lower production costs some of which was related to our outsourcing strategy in some product lines also contributing to the improvement was lower selling general and administrative expenses 

  

we believe that agricultural products will continue to successfully execute its strategies in 2004 but expect revenue growth to be essentially flat this expectation is dependent on normal pest pressures in north america during 2004 

  

specialty chemicals 

  

   

biopolymer which generated 71 percent of 2003 segment revenues had sales increases of 4 percent while sales in our lithium business which represents 29 percent of the segment increased by more than 10 percent compared with 2002 

  

segment sales increases were driven by us and european growth in biopolymer’s mcc products in the pharmaceuticals market where mcc is used as a binder and disintegrant in tablets these increases were partially offset by lower biopolymer sales in our food business largely as a result of lower demand in the nutritional beverage market also contributing were strong lithium sales in the pharmaceutical synthesis market and in the energy storage market from military demand for rechargeable batteries in addition the favorable impact of foreign currency translation primarily the euro further contributed to the increase in revenue 

  

segment earnings increased due to higher sales favorable foreign currency translation improved productivity and sales mix 

  

in 2003 responding to changes in the food business biopolymer took actions to reduce costs within the business and exited certain end markets for 2004 we expect continued improvements in operating profit and middle single digit growth in sales 

  

industrial chemicals 

  

   

industrial chemicals sales increased due almost entirely to foret our european industrial chemicals business where favorable currency translation and higher peroxygen selling prices resulted in a 16 percent increase in sales compared with 2002 european prices for peroxygens were driven by higher capacity utilization levels coupled with strong demand the increased sales at foret were partially offset by decreased revenues in our largely north americanbased alkali and peroxygens hydrogen peroxides and active oxidants businesses where sales in 2003 decreased 2 percent and 4 percent respectively compared with the prior year the decrease in alkali was largely a result of lower export prices for soda ash alkali’s primary product due in part to recent capacity additions in china our international sales of soda ash are through the ansac a foreign sales corporation despite successful implementation of some selling price increases peroxygen sales decreased due to weaker north american hydrogen peroxide volumes to the pulp market for 2003 our industrial chemicals segment revenue is made up of 46 percent alkali 34 percent foret and 19 percent peroxygens 

  

lower segment earnings in 2003 were largely the result of significantly lower affiliate earnings from astaris and lower sales in our alkali and domestic peroxygen businesses weaker affiliate earnings from astaris were primarily the result of the absence of a power resale contract which had a prior year pretax benefit of approximately 12 million and decreases in selling prices resulting from competitive pressure 

  

in 2003 astaris began a restructuring plan to improve its financial performance the restructuring which includes the exit of the commodity sodium tripolyphosphate “stpp” market is expected to reduce fixed costs through facility and selective product rationalizations and result in improvement in the venture’s position in food and technical phosphates the restructuring is expected to be completed over the next six months and will include four facility closures and the consolidation of operations into the remaining three astaris sites our portion of astaris’ 2003 restructuring charges which totaled 533 million before tax were recorded in “equity in earnings loss of affiliates” 

  

results of operations—2002 compared to 2001 

  

revenue for the year ended december 31 2002 was 18529 million compared to 19430 million in 2001 down 5 percent lower revenue in 2002 compared to 2001 was principally attributable to lower revenue in our industrial chemicals and agricultural products segments our industrial chemicals segment saw generally lower selling prices and lower sales volumes due to unfavorable market conditions also affecting revenue were decreased agricultural products sales resulting from lower herbicide sales and unfavorable weather conditions in asia 

  

asset impairments there were no asset impairments in 2002 asset impairments totaled 3231 million 2338 million after tax in 2001 

  

based upon a comprehensive review of our longlived assets we recorded asset impairment charges in our industrial chemicals and specialty chemicals segments in 2001 industrial chemicals recorded impairment charges of 2242 million of which 123 million related to the impairment of assets in our sodium cyanide operations while 2119 million was for the impairments in our usbased phosphorus chemicals business 

  

a weakening market in our sodium cyanide business led us to impair the assets of this business in the second quarter of 2001 we subsequently exited this business in 2002 

  

our usbased phosphorus chemicals business is comprised of our 50 percent interest in astaris and the activities of our corporate phosphorus business which manages remediation and other environmental projects associated with the former astaris elemental phosphorus plant in pocatello idaho 

  

based upon a comprehensive review of our longlived assets we recorded asset impairment charges of 2119 million related to our usbased phosphorus business in the second quarter of 2001 the components of asset impairments related to this business include a 1710 million impairment of environmental assets built to 

  

comply with a resource conservation and recovery act “rcra” consent decree the “consent decree” at the pocatello idaho facility a further 44 million of other nonenvironmental phosphorus related fixed assets and a 365 million impairment charge for our investment in astaris driving these charges were a decline in market conditions the loss of a potential site on which to develop an economically viable second ppa plant and our agreement to pay into a fund for the shoshonebannock tribes the “tribal fund” resulting from an agreement to support a proposal to amend the consent decree which permitted the earlier closure of the largest remaining waste disposal pond at pocatello 

  

in addition we recorded an impairment charge of 989 million related to our specialty chemicals segment’s lithium operations in argentina we established this operation which includes a lithium mine and processing facilities approximately six years ago in a remote area of the andes mountains the entry of a south american manufacturer into this business resulted in decreased revenues in addition market conditions continued to be unfavorable as a result our lithium assets in argentina became impaired as the total capital invested was not expected to be recovered 

  

restructuring and other charges totaled 301 million 184 million after tax in 2002 compared to 2804 million 1721 million after tax in 2001 

  

in 2002 restructuring and other charges of 301 million before tax consisted of charges related to each of our segments the details by segment are discussed below 

  

in an effort to mitigate the effects of the continued economic weakness in the markets served by our industrial chemicals business we undertook several cost saving initiatives that resulted in 124 million of restructuring charges included in this amount was a 57 million restructuring charge for the mothballing of the basic production line at our hydrogen peroxide facility in spring hill west virginia we also mothballed our granger facility in green river wyoming resulting in a 34 million restructuring charge the majority of this charge was for facility shutdown activities and severance all of which occurred in 2002 in addition we recorded a 33 million restructuring charge for costs related to reorganization efforts to reduce costs in our us phosphorus chemicals business alkali peroxygens and at foret there were 150 severances related to these restructurings all of which occurred in 2002 

  

in agricultural products we incurred 47 million of restructuring charges in 2002 of which 37 million related to the idling and reorganization of our sulfentrazone plant in baltimore in connection with our new herbicides strategy see “segment results—2002 compared to 2001” a 10 million restructuring charge was recorded for reorganization costs to implement a new distribution strategy in europe which allows us to rely on certain strategic alliances to further penetrate and expand our european markets of the 108 severances related to these restructurings 57 occurred in 2002 

  

we recorded 13 million of restructuring charges in our specialty chemicals segment in 2002 in an effort to realign product divisions within biopolymer both domestically and internationally the majority of these costs resulted in the severance of 24 people these severances occurred in 2003 

  

reorganization costs of 30 million and other charges of 87 million were also recorded in the period these charges are discussed in note 6 to our consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k also of the 301 million of restructuring charges recorded in 2002 119 million was spent in 2002 

  

in 2001 a change in market conditions and the implementation of our overall corporate strategy resulted in restructuring and other charges of 2804 million detailed as follows 

  

      

industrial chemicals recorded restructuring and other charges of 2479 million in 2001 of which 62 million was for restructuring at several sites including 57 million for the mothballing of our granger wyoming soda ash facility and 2417 million was for our usbased phosphorus business there were 130 severances from the restructuring of industrial chemicals the majority of which occurred in 2001 with the remainder occurring in 2002 

  

in connection with the impairment of our usbased phosphorus chemicals business in the second quarter of 2001 we recorded other charges for a 687 million reserve for further required consent decree spending at the pocatello site related to environmental capital projects required to complete the construction of facilities to treat the sites waste streams 427 million for financing obligations to the astaris joint venture “keepwell” payments and a 400 million payment to the tribal fund for various tribe activities in order to permit capping of a specific waste disposal pond at pocatello 

  

subsequent to the recording of these charges in the second quarter of 2001 the astaris joint venture announced its plans in october 2001 to cease production at the pocatello idaho elemental phosphorus facility in december 2001 this decision reflected the shift in astaris’ sourcing strategy away from production of high cost elemental phosphorus to lower cost ppa and also reflected the availability of lowcost alternative feedstock materials projected higher future environmental compliance costs at pocatello and our desire to avoid additional capital spending on environmental compliance assets required under the consent decree in connection with the decision to shut down pocatello we recorded restructuring charges of 765 million in the fourth quarter of 2001 we spent 323 million and 09 million of these reserves in 2002 and 2001 respectively with the remaining reserves to be spent over the next 5 to 7 years as we manage the site’s decommissioning and environmental issues these charges included reserves for decontamination demolition and other shut down costs of 587 million environmental remediation requirements resulting from the decision to shut down the facility of 543 million and our 50 percent share of costs recorded by astaris for its obligations associated with the shutdown or 363 million offsetting these charges was a reversal in the amount of 345 million representing the unspent portion of the reserve recorded in the second quarter of 2001 for required consent decree spending at the pocatello site to build environmental compliance assets because the decision to shut down the site eliminated the need for further spending we also recorded as an offset to these charges a commitment from astaris to pay us 

  

365 million over the next 5 years reflecting the joint venture’s obligation to contribute to our costs for the shutdown and remediation of the site we received 37 million from astaris in 2002 related to this commitment 

  

also included in the 2417 million of restructuring and other charges related to the usbased phosphorus business was a charge of 120 million for other restructuring activities which were not directly related to the shutdown of pocatello included in this charge were restructuring activities related to severance and decommissioning of a coke facility as well as charges related to the shutdown of two furnaces at pocatello 

  

the decision to shut down pocatello was consistent with astaris’ plan to shift raw material supply for most products from high cost elemental phosphorus to lower cost ppa high energy operating and environmental costs of producing elemental phosphorus have reinforced the relative cost advantage of ppa the decision to shut down pocatello in the fourth quarter of 2001 has allowed us to avoid spending of 345 million for the remaining capital costs associated with completing the construction of environmental compliance assets and any startup costs for this plant which could have been significant further there also had been a concern that environmental compliance costs could escalate in future years and add further costs in addition estimated future costs at astaris were expected to include a need to refurbish furnaces at pocatello in 2004 at an estimated cost of 100 million 

  

in 2001 we recorded 125 million of severance and other costs related to our agricultural products segment as a result of our strategic refocusing on key geographic markets and crops and the realignment of our rd resources to our core strength in insecticides the majority of the spending related to these charges occurred in 2002 these charges have resulted in savings in both selling and administrative expenses and research and development costs the annualized savings from these restructurings were approximately 200 million there were 163 severances related to these charges the majority of which occurred in 2002 

  

of the remaining 2001 restructuring and other charges of 200 million approximately 175 million related to corporate reorganization costs due to the spinoff of technologies with remaining charges of 25 million related to restructuring in specialty chemicals the majority of the spending associated with these charges occurred in 2001 and in the first half of 2002 the benefit of the restructuring and other charges from our corporate reorganization and spinoff are not subject to reasonable estimation the benefits were directly related to improving stockholder value through creating a focused chemical company there were approximately 45 severances related to these charges the majority occurring in 2001 

  

net interest expense in 2002 was 716 million compared to 583 million in 2001 the increase in interest expense can largely be attributed to higher average debt levels and higher interest rates from our 2002 refinancing see “liquidity and capital resources” and note 10 to our consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k for further details on the refinancing and its effects on our results 

  

provisionbenefit for income taxes  we recorded an income tax provision of 174 million in 2002 compared to a benefit of 1666 million in 2001 resulting in effective tax rates of 20 percent and 35 percent respectively the 2001 tax benefit is a direct result of the significant restructuring and other charges and impairments recorded in 2001 the differences between the effective tax rates for these periods and the statutory us federal income tax rate relate primarily to differing foreign tax rates depletion the impairment of certain assets foreign sales corporation benefits and incremental state taxes 

  

discontinued operations  we recorded a loss from discontinued operations of 53 million 33 million after tax in 2002 for environmental remediation costs at sites of discontinued businesses for which we are responsible for environmental compliance see “environmental obligations” below and note 11 to our consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k for further details 

  

we recorded a loss from discontinued operations of 425 million 305 million after tax in 2001 included in this amount are earnings of technologies including interest expense of 112 million which was allocated to discontinued operations in accordance with accounting principles board statement no 30 “apb 30” and later 

  

relevant accounting guidance costs related to the spinoff and an additional income tax provision related to the reorganization of our worldwide entities in anticipation of the separation of technologies from fmc in addition we recorded a charge of 180 million for updated estimates of environmental remediation costs related to our other discontinued businesses 

  

net incomeloss  we recorded net income of 658 million in 2002 compared to a net loss of 3377 million for 2001 this variance reflects 3231 million of asset impairments and 2804 million of restructuring and other charges recorded in 2001 net income in 2002 compared to 2001 excluding asset impairments and restructuring and other charges was lower due to lower sales in agricultural products and industrial chemicals somewhat offset at the earnings level by lower costs through savings from our recent restructuring activities 

  

other financial data 

  

capital expenditures totaled 839 million in 2002 compared to 1456 million in 2001 lower capital expenditures are the result of the lack of requirements for capital expansions and our continued focus on essential valuecreating projects also reducing capital expenditures was the lack of spending related to environmental assets at pocatello the need for continued spending on these environmental assets was eliminated in the fourth quarter of 2001 with the shutdown of pocatello 

  

the following are line items from our segment profit and loss statement used to reconcile segmentoperating profit to consolidated income from continuing operations before income taxes and the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle see note 19 to our consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k 

  

corporate expenses were 356 million in 2002 and 363 million in 2001 corporate expense represents shared costs that cannot be reasonably allocated among the segments 

  

other income and expense  net is comprised primarily of lifo inventory adjustments and pension income or expense net other loss for the year was 04 million compared to a net other loss of 16 million in 2001 this variance is largely attributable to a lifo reserve adjustment offset by additional pension and postretirement expenses 

  

segment results—2002 compared to 2001 

  

agricultural products 

  

   

herbicide sales decreased to 1350 million in 2002 compared to 1636 million in 2001 mainly due to a planned reduction in sulfentrazone sales as we shifted our focus from soybeans to higher value crops and poor weather conditions in north america insecticide sales were down slightly at 4801 million in 2002 compared to 4895 million in 2001 mostly due to weaker insecticide demand in asia from drought conditions in australia and channel inventory reductions somewhat offset by the development of new labels and higher pest infestation levels on cotton in north america a stronger demand and new applications in our nonagricultural markets such as turf ornamental and household pests also favorably affected sales in 2002 

  

lower herbicide sales and the absence of a 200 million profit protection payment from ei du pont de nemours and company “dupont” were more than offset by lower selling administrative and research costs in 1998 we entered into an exclusive agreement with dupont to provide them sulfentrazone in north america for use in soybeans however the sale of formulated products incorporating sulfentrazone did not reach expectations 

  

and the contract purchases were cancelled in 2001 therefore dupont no longer has the exclusive rights to the product in north america 

  

earnings also reflected agricultural products’ continuing strategic refocusing on key geographic markets and crops and realignment of our rd resources to our core strengths in insecticides related to these refocusing efforts were restructuring charges in both 2002 and 2001 in 2002 we recorded 47 million of restructuring charges for the idling and reorganization of our sulfentrazone plant in baltimore and to implement our new distribution strategy in europe in the fourth quarter of 2001 we recorded a 125 million charge to eliminate all herbicide discovery research as well to reduce our direct sales and support staff to align resources to key geographic markets and crops restructuring charges are not included in the results of our business segments see restructuring and other charges under “results of operations—2002 compared to 2001” for further details 

  

specialty chemicals 

  

   

biopolymer revenue increased to 3552 million from 3412 million in 2001 reflecting a stronger pharmaceutical demand for microcrystalline cellulose for its use in binders and steady demand for carrageenan and microcrystalline cellulose in the food ingredients market partially offsetting increased revenue were lower alginate sales due to weaker industrial markets and an unfavorable carrageenan mix in food ingredients in lithium revenue performance was 1330 million in 2002 compared to 1308 million in 2001 a stronger organolithium performance in the pharmaceutical and specialty polymer markets and increased demand for energy storage materials for both rechargeable and nonrechargeable batteries were offset by lower exports of lithium salts to japan due to a weaker economy and the absence of a sale into the pharmaceutical markets which occurred in the fourth quarter of 2001 

  

higher earnings can be attributed to higher sales from overall biopolymer growth a decrease in manufacturing costs in lithium due largely to the devaluation of the argentine peso and the absence of a 42 million 28 million after tax charge from the required change in accounting for amortization related to goodwill specialty chemicals’ goodwill was the direct result of biopolymer’s 1999 acquisition of pronova biopolymer as lithium’s earnings were also favorably impacted by higher butyllithium sales in addition the large pharmaceutical sale in lithium discussed above delivered a high margin sale in 2001 that was not repeated in 2002 

  

during 2002 our biopolymer business experienced profit pressures within the industrial markets it serves principally with its alginate product line as a result in 2002 we initiated a restructuring to reduce headcount and streamline production costs we believe that this action will further focus biopolymer’s commercial efforts on core high value markets including pharmaceutical formulation food ingredients and personal care 

  

industrial chemicals 

  

   

alkali revenue decreased to 3680 million in 2002 from 4025 million in 2001 due to lower overall volumes lower soda ash export prices and the first quarter 2002 sale of our sodium cyanide business a portion of the decline in soda ash revenues was attributable to the substitution by some of our industrial customers of caustic soda for soda ash which occurs when caustic prices decline substantially as they did in the first quarter of 2002 furthermore we experienced lower international sales volumes through ansac foret saw a decrease in revenue to 2225 million in 2002 compared to 2438 million in 2001 reflecting lower phosphate sales due in part to the loss of a major european detergent customer and generally lower volumes and lower prices throughout its product lines somewhat offsetting decreased revenue at foret was the favorable translation effect of a stronger euro peroxygens revenue decreased to 1629 million in 2002 from 1757 million in 2001 due to generally lower selling prices and lower persulfate volumes reflecting a depressed printed circuit board market increased hydrogen peroxide volumes in nonpulp markets along with stronger sales into the pulp markets in the second half of 2002 somewhat offset lower average selling prices and lower persulfate volumes 

  

overall earnings levels of 716 million in 2002 compared to 726 in the prior year relatively flat earnings on lower sales reflected lower material costs significant cost savings from our 2002 and 2001 restructuring efforts and lower operating costs related to reduced environmental compliance spending at pocatello 

  

reacting to market weakness in industrial chemicals in 2002 we recorded restructuring charges of 124 million to improve our cost position through reorganization changes and mothballing significant parts of our granger caustic facility and spring hill west virginia hydrogen peroxide facility during 2001 we recorded significant charges to impair and subsequently restructure our usbased phosphorus chemicals business total charges for 2001 included an impairment charge of 2242 million and restructuring and other charges of 2479 million segment earnings do not include these charges asset impairments and restructuring and other charges are not included in our business segment results see “asset impairments” and “restructuring and other charges” above and notes 5 and 6 to our consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k 

  

the restructuring of our usbased phosphorus chemicals business in late 2001 has allowed us to continue to improve our cost structure and competitive position as we move away from the production and sourcing of elemental phosphorus our usbased phosphorus chemicals business’s cost position has improved as its ppa sourcing has increased the shutdown of pocatello also allowed fmc to eliminate capital spending on the environmental projects in 2002 and avoid significant startup and certain ongoing operating costs for environmental compliance issues at the site the restructuring activities in 2002 should improve our cost and competitive position in hydrogen peroxide from the mothballing at spring hill 

  

lower joint venture earnings at astaris and lower volumes and price throughout the segment offset the cost savings from our restructuring activities lower earnings from astaris were due to a 8 percent decrease in sales to 4457 million in 2002 from 4862 million in the prior year a decreased benefit from the former power resale contract with idaho power and higher than expected startup costs at astaris’ ppa plant were somewhat offset by lower sourcing costs the total resale power benefit to astaris in 2002 was approximately 12 million compared to approximately 34 million in 2001 this benefit did not continue in 2003 

  

recently adopted accounting standards 

  

in december 2003 the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 104 “revenue recognition” “sab no 104” effective december 17 2003 sab 104 updates portions of the interpretive guidance included in topic 13 of the codification of sabs to make this interpretive guidance consistent with current authoritative accounting and auditing guidance and sec rules and regulations related to revenue recognition we believe our revenue recognition policies are in compliance with sab 104

new accounting standards 

  

in december 2003 the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of 2003 “medicare act” became law in the united states the medicare act introduces a prescription drug benefit under medicare as well as a federal subsidy to sponsors of retiree health care benefit plans that provide a benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to the medicare benefit in accordance with fasb staff position fas 1061 “accounting and disclosure requirements related to the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of 2003” we have elected to defer recognition of the effects of the medicare act in any measures of the benefit obligation or cost specific authoritative guidance on the accounting for federal subsidy is pending and that guidance when issued could require us to change previously reported information the measurement date used to determine pension and other postretirement benefit measures for the pension plan and the postretirement benefit plan is december 31

environmental obligations 

  

our company like other industrial manufacturers is involved with a variety of environmental matters in the ordinary course of conducting its business and is subject to federal state and local environmental laws we believe strongly that we have a responsibility to protect the environment public health and employee safety this responsibility includes cooperating with other parties to resolve issues created by past and present handling of wastes 

  

when issues arise including notices from the epa or other government agencies identifying our company as a prp our environmental remediation management assesses and manages the issues when necessary we use multifunctional teams composed of environmental legal financial and communications personnel to ensure that our actions are consistent with our responsibilities to the environment and public health as well as to our employees and shareholders 

  

we provided environmental provisions totaling 249 million in 2003 of which 22 million related to operating sites and 227 million related to discontinued sites we provided environmental provisions totaling 102 million in 2002 this included charges related to environmental sites of discontinued businesses and continuing operating sites in 2001 we provided 688 million of environmental provisions related to operating and discontinued sites of which 474 million was for additional remediation related to the shutdown of pocatello 

  

additional information regarding our environmental accounting policies and environmental liabilities is included in “application of critical accounting policies” and notes 1 and 11 respectively to our consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k information regarding environmental obligations associated with our discontinued operations is included in note 11 to our consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k estimates of 2004 environmental spending are included in “liquidity and capital resources” 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

  

during 2003 we paid 1636 million including a premium of 03 million plus accrued interest to redeem all of the outstanding 6375 percent senior notes due september 2003 and all of the 653 percent seriesb mediumterm notes due december 2003 the redemption of the notes was largely funded from “restricted cash” which was 1369 million and 2746 million at december 31 2003 and 2002 respectively restricted cash shown on the consolidated balance sheets was set aside as a part of the 2002 financing transactions discussed below to provide substantial cash for collateral assuring the payment of certain selfinsurance obligations environmental remediation activities future business commitments cash to collateralize letters of credit supporting variablerate pollution control and industrial revenue bonds and cash to redeem longterm debt maturing before december 31 2003 

  

among other restrictions our credit facilities which are described in detail in note 10 to our consolidated financial statements contain financial covenants related to leverage measured as the ratio of adjusted earnings to debt interest coverage measured as the ratio of interest expense to adjusted earnings consolidated net worth and capital spending we were in compliance with all covenants at december 31 2003 and december 31 2002 

  

in october 2003 the astaris affiliate began implementation of a restructuring plan and in connection with this plan we expect to make additional payments recorded as capital contributions to astaris of approximately 40 million in 2004 and to defer until september 2005 a total of approximately 30 million of payments anticipated from astaris 

  

in december 2003 to accommodate the financial effects on us of the astaris restructuring plan we were successful in achieving favorable amendments in our credit facilities among these amendments were favorable changes in the maximum leverage covenant defined as the ratio of debt to adjusted earnings and the maintenance of net worth covenant along with the favorable covenant amendments we obtained the agreement of the lenders under our credit facilities to reduce the applicable margin under the term loan facility by 225 percent per annum we expect net interest expense in 2004 to be approximately 10 million below net interest expense in 2003 primarily from lower rates for borrowings under the term loan facility lower outstanding total debt and lower average cash balances 

  

under our credit facilities we had term loan facility borrowings of 2475 million and 2500 million at december 31 2003 and 2002 respectively the 2500 million revolving credit facility had no outstanding borrowings at december 31 2003 letters of credit outstanding under the revolving credit facility totaled 26 million at december 31 2003 which together with the lack of outstanding borrowings resulted in 2474 million of remaining availability there were no outstanding letters of credit and no outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility at december 31 2002 

  

cash and cash equivalents excluding restricted cash at december 31 2003 compared to december 31 2002 were 570 million and 896 million respectively the majority of cash and cash equivalents at december 31 2003 was held by our foreign subsidiaries we had total debt of 10502 million and 12670 million at 

  

december 31 2003 and 2002 respectively this included 10334 million and 10359 million of longterm debt excluding current portions of 30 million and 1668 million at december 31 2003 and 2002 respectively shortterm debt which consists primarily of foreign borrowings decreased to 138 million at december 31 2003 compared to 643 million at december 31 2002 the 1663 million decrease in total longterm debt at december 31 2003 from december 31 2002 was largely the result of the redemption and repayment of our 6375 percent senior notes due september 2003 and 653 percent seriesb mediumterm notes due december 2003 in 2003 we paid 1443 million including a premium of 03 million to redeem the entire outstanding balance of our 6375 percent senior notes plus accrued interest in december 2003 we paid 200 million plus accrued interest to redeem at par all of the outstanding 653 percent seriesb mediumterm notes 

  

cash provided by operating activities was 1946 million for 2003 compared to 1362 million for 2002 and cash required by operating activities of 529 million in 2001 primarily reflecting improved working capital management also contributing to higher cash provided by operating activities during 2003 is lower restructuring spending of 193 million compared to 638 million in 2002 and 865 million in 2001 included in our operating cash activities in 2002 is 638 million for spending on restructuring and other activities including 323 million for the shutdown of pocatello in 2003 the spending against restructuring reserves related to the pocatello shutdown was 60 million spending against restructuring reserves related to the pocatello shutdown is expected to be approximately 35 million in 2004 and is then expected to drop significantly in 2005 through its completion accounts payable and accrued liabilities decreased significantly in 2002 compared to 2001 reflecting lower business activity including lower inventory in 2002 than in 2001 also in 2002 cash provided by operating activities improved as a result of collections of accounts receivable especially within agricultural products particularly in latin america because we are a global company with significant investment in the eurozone the 2003 increase in the euro versus the us dollar had a significant effect on the amounts of our operating assets and liabilities as presented on the balance sheets for better comparability we exclude this effect in the section of the statement of cash flows entitled “change in operating assets and liabilities” 

  

cash required by discontinued operations for the years ended december 31 2003 2002 and 2001 was 261 million 296 million and 1119 million respectively the majority of the spending for our discontinued operations is for environmental remediation on discontinued sites and postemployment benefits for former employees of discontinued businesses discontinued environmental spending was 217 million in 2003 compared to 168 million in 2002 and 233 million in 2001 also contributing to the decline in 2003 was the absence of certain spending included in 2002 related to the spinoff of technologies in the first quarter of 2001 we made an 800 million payment for the settlement of litigation related to our discontinued defense systems business 

  

cash required by investing activities was 1578 million 1108 million and 1696 million for the years ended december 31 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively the increase in 2003 reflects an increase in financing commitments to astaris and to a lesser extent higher capital expenditures in 2003 compared to 2002 cash contributions to astaris were 628 million 296 million and 313 million in 2003 2002 and 2001 respectively a planned reduction in capital spending in 2002 compared to 2001 contributed to the decline in cash required by investing activities in 2002 additionally 2001 included approximately 43 million for spending on environmental remediation assets at pocatello pocatello was shut down in the fourth quarter of 2001 which curtailed this spending 

  

cash required by financing activities for 2003 was 532 million compared to cash provided by financing activities of 658 million for 2002 and 3467 million in 2001 in 2003 we paid 1636 million including a premium of 03 million to redeem the entire outstanding balance of our 6375 percent senior notes due september 2003 plus accrued interest and to redeem at par all of the outstanding 653 percent seriesb mediumterm notes the redemption of these notes was funded with 1443 million of restricted cash also contributing to the decrease in cash provided by financing activities as compared to 2002 was the completion of an equity offering in the second quarter of 2002 resulting in net proceeds of 1013 million which was not repeated in 2003 

  

cash provided by financing activities for 2002 of 658 million decreased by 2809 million when compared to cash provided by financing activities of 3467 million in 2001 our 2002 financing activities included a net increase in longterm debt of 3841 million from net proceeds of our refinancing of 5955 million activity in 2002 also reflected 1812 million paid to redeem longterm debt a 378 million decrease in our vendor financing program and 650 million paid to terminate our accounts receivable securitization program in october 2002 this program had an outstanding balance of 790 million at december 31 2001 our longterm debt repayments in 2002 included payment of 1349 million for scheduled maturities the redemption of 171 million aggregate principal amount of our 6375 percent senior notes due september 2003 and several other minor maturities in 2002 we also made payments of 325 million to redeem all outstanding 675 percent exchangeable senior subordinated debentures financing sources included 1013 million net of issuance costs from the issuance of 325 million shares of common stock in the second quarter of 2002 which was used to reduce outstanding borrowings under our former 2400 million revolving credit facility which was terminated upon the completion of our refinancing in october 2002 our 2001 financing activities included 4307 million from the ipo of technologies net of contributions to technologies to support their operating cash needs 

  

2002 financing transactions 

  

during 2002 we strengthened our liquidity position and obtained adequate capital resources for planned business operations by completing a series of financing transactions in june 2002 we issued 325 million shares of common stock and used the net proceeds of 1013 million to reduce amounts borrowed under our 2400 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility following this offering moody’s lowered its rating of our longterm debt from baa3 to ba1 moody’s rating of baa3 is the tenth level from the top of its ratings scale comprised of twenty longterm debt ratings moody’s also lowered its rating of our shortterm debt from p3 to np the fourth level from the top of its fivelevel shortterm debt ratings scale subsequent to these actions we ceased offerings under our commercial paper program and repaid maturities through borrowings under our 2400 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility 

  

in october 2002 we completed a significant refinancing in which we issued 3550 million aggregate principal amount of 1025 percent senior secured notes due 2009 simultaneously we entered into a new 5000 million senior secured credit agreement which provided for a 2500 million revolving credit facility and a 2500 million term loan facility and obtained a 400 million supplemental secured standby letter of credit facility 

  

further details on the 2002 refinancing are found in note 10 to our consolidated financial statements 

  

commitments and other potential liquidity needs 

  

our cash needs for 2004 include operating cash requirements capital expenditures scheduled maturities of longterm debt keepwell payments supporting astaris as described below environmental spending and restructuring spending we plan to meet our liquidity needs through cash generated from operations and borrowings under our 2500 million committed revolving credit facility 

  

in connection with the finalization of astaris’ external financing arrangements during the third quarter of 2000 we entered into an agreement with astaris’ lenders under which we agreed to make payments “keepwell payments” sufficient to make up onehalf of the shortfall in astaris’ earnings below certain levels solutia which owns the other 50 percent of astaris provided a parallel agreement under which it makes up the other half of any shortfall astaris’ earnings did not meet the agreed levels for 2003 2002 and 2001 and we do not expect that such earnings will meet the levels agreed for 2004 we made keepwell payments of 628 million under this arrangement in 2003 compared to keepwell payments of 296 million in 2002 and 313 million in 2001 we expect our total keepwell payments for 2004 depending on the financial performance of astaris to be approximately 40 million 

  

astaris’ credit facility and our agreement under which we make keepwell payments incorporate financial covenants contained in our principal credit facility and astaris’ credit facility contains customary default provisions related to our financial condition results and solvency in the fourth quarter of 2003 astaris’ lenders agreed to accept a bank letter of credit furnished on behalf of solutia in the amount of 67 million in exchange for a release of a security interest held by the lenders in certain of solutia’s assets and removal of solutia’s financial covenants and solvency as grounds for default under astaris’ credit facility 

  

at december 31 2003 astaris’ credit facility obligations which fmc’s and solutia’s keepwell payments are intended to support included outstanding borrowings of 709 million and letters of credit of 92 million compared to 1679 million of outstanding borrowings and 91 million of letters of credit at december 31 2002 

  

we provide guarantees to financial institutions on behalf of certain agricultural products customers principally in brazil for their seasonal borrowing a significant portion of the customers’ obligations to repay us for any amounts paid under the guarantees is secured by liens on their crops past losses under this program have been minimal amounts recorded as guarantees of vendor financing for december 31 2003 and 2002 were 443 million and 182 million at december 31 2003 and 2002 respectively in 2002 we also provided guarantees to financial institutions on behalf of certain agricultural product customers in brazil to support their importation of thirdparty agricultural products these guarantees totaled 45 million at december 31 2002 

  

on june 30 1999 we acquired the assets of tg soda ash inc from elf atochem north america inc “elf atochem” for approximately 510 million in cash and a contingent payment due at yearend 2003 based on the financial performance of the combined soda ash operations between 2001 and 2003 on december 31 2003 we made the required contingent payment in the amount of 324 million subject to a 90day review period we do not expect this review to result in any additional material payments 

  

projected 2004 spending also includes approximately 50 million of environmental remediation spending of which approximately 20 million relates to pocatello and 30 million relates to other operating and discontinued business sites this spending does not include expected spending of approximately 12 million and 9 million in 2004 and 2005 respectively on capital projects relating to environmental control facilities also we expect to spend in the range of approximately 23 million to 22 million annually in 2004 and in 2005 for environmental compliance costs which are an operating cost of the company and are not covered by established reserves 

  

other commitments that could affect our liquidity include the following 

  

we agreed to guarantee the performance by technologies of certain obligations under several contracts debt instruments and reimbursement agreements associated with letters of credit see note 2 and note 17 to the consolidated financial statements in this form 10k as of december 31 2003 these guaranteed obligations totaled 68 million compared to 145 million at december 31 2002 

  

at december 31 2003 and 2002 there was 410 million principal amount outstanding of variablerate industrial and pollution control revenue bonds supported by 433 million in bank letters of credit which are fully collateralized with cash which is a component of “restricted cash” as shown on the consolidated balance sheets of this form 10k 

  

we provide parentcompany guarantees to lending institutions providing credit to our foreign subsidiaries the outstanding amounts of guaranteed debt included in “shortterm debt” on our consolidated balance sheets of this form 10k were 138 million and 643 million respectively at december 31 2003 and 2002 

  

our total significant committed contracts that we believe will affect cash over the next five years and beyond are as follows 

  

      

dividends 

  

on november 29 2001 our board of directors approved the spinoff of the remaining 83 percent of technologies making it an independent publicly traded company the spinoff qualified as a taxfree distribution to us stockholders stockholders of record as of december 31 2001 received approximately 172 shares of common stock of the new company for every 10 share of our stock fractional shares were paid in cash to stockholders in lieu of fractional shares on december 31 2001 

  

we paid no cash dividends in 2003 or 2002 and we do not expect to pay dividends in 2004 we paid no cash dividends in 2001 other than amounts paid in lieu of fractional shares as discussed above

 item 7a quantitative   and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend   

our earnings cash flows and financial position are exposed to market risks relating to fluctuations in commodity prices interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates our policy is to minimize exposure to our cash flow over time caused by changes in currency interest and exchange rates to accomplish this we have implemented a controlled program of risk management consisting of appropriate derivative contracts entered into with major financial institutions 

  

the analysis below presents the sensitivity of the market value of our financial instruments to selected changes in market rates and prices the range of changes chosen reflects our view of changes that are reasonably possible over a oneyear period marketvalue estimates are based on the present value of projected future cash flows considering the market rates and prices chosen we calculate the market value foreign currency risk using thirdparty software incorporating standard pricing models to determine the present value of the instruments based on market conditions spot and forward foreign exchange rates as of the valuation date we obtain estimates of the market value energy price risk from calculations performed internally and by a third party 

  

at december 31 2003 our net financial instrument position of interest rate swaps and currency and energy hedges was a net asset of 11 million compared to a net liability of 47 million at december 31 2002 the change in the net financial instrument position was due to larger unrealized gains in our energy hedges 

  

commodity price risk 

  

energy costs are approximately 9 percent of our cost of sales and services and are well balanced among coal electricity and natural gas we attempt to mitigate our exposure to increasing energy costs by hedging the 

  

cost of natural gas to analyze the effect of changing energy prices we have performed a sensitivity analysis in which we assume an instantaneous 10 percent change in energy market prices from their levels at december 31 2003 and december 31 2002 with all other variables including interest rates held constant a 10 percent increase in energy market prices would result in an increase of the net asset position of 90 million at december 31 2003 and a decrease of 62 million in the net liability position of the relevant financial instruments into a net asset position at december 31 2002 a 10 percent decrease in energy market prices would result in a decrease of 85 million in the net asset position into a net liability position at december 31 2003 at december 31 2002 a 10 percent decrease in energy market prices would have resulted in an increase of 43 million in the net liability position 

  

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

  

the primary currencies for which we have exchange rate exposure are the us dollar versus the euro the euro versus the norwegian krone the us dollar versus the japanese yen and the us dollar versus the brazilian real foreign currency debt and foreign exchange forward contracts are used in countries where we do business thereby reducing our net asset exposure foreign exchange forward contracts are also used to hedge firm and highly anticipated foreign currency cash flows 

  

to analyze the effects of changing foreign currency rates we have performed a sensitivity analysis in which we assume an instantaneous 10 percent change in the foreign currency exchange rates from their levels at december 31 2003 and december 31 2002 with all other variables including interest rates held constant a 10 percent strengthening of hedged currencies versus our functional currencies would result in an increase of 162 million and 128 million in the net liability position at december 31 2003 and 2002 respectively a 10 percent weakening of hedged currencies versus our functional currencies would result in a decrease of 156 million and 116 million in the net liability position into a net asset position of the relevant financial instruments at december 31 2003 and 2002 respectively 

  

interest rate risk 

  

one of the strategies that we use to manage interest rate exposure is to enter into interest rate swap agreements in the agreements we agree to exchange at specified intervals the difference between fixed and variable interest amounts calculated on an agreedupon notional principal amount in the first quarter of 2003 we entered into swaps with an aggregate notional value of 1000 million these swaps in which we exchange net amounts based on making payments derived from a floatingrate index and receiving payments on a fixedrate basis are used to hedge our 1025 percent senior secured notes due 2009 

  

interest rate swaps that meet specific conditions under sfas no 133 are accounted for as fairvalue hedges the net position of these interest rate swap agreements is not material at december 31 2003 all existing fairvalue hedges are 100 percent effective as a result there is no effect on earnings from hedge ineffectiveness 

  

our debt portfolio including interest rate swap agreements at december 31 2003 is composed of 62 percent fixedrate debt and 38 percent variablerate debt compared to 72 percent fixedrate debt and 28 percent variablerate debt at december 31 2002 the variablerate component of our debt portfolio principally consists of bank borrowings variablerate industrial and pollution control revenue bonds and interest rate swap agreements entered into in the first quarter of 2003 with an aggregate notional principal amount of 1000 million changes in interest rates affect different portions of our variablerate debt portfolio in different ways 

  

based on the variablerate debt including interest rate swap agreements in our debt portfolio at december 31 2003 and 2002 a one percentage point increase or decrease in interest rates in 2003 and 2002 would increase or decrease net income by 10 million and 07 million respectively

we have operations in many areas around the world north america represents our single largest geographic market generating approximately 48 percent of revenue in 2002 with our second largest market europe the middle east and africa representing 25 percent and latin america our third largest representing 15 percent of 2002 revenue with a worldwide manufacturing and distribution infrastructure we are able to respond rapidly to global customer needs offset downward economic trends in one region with positive trends in another and better match revenues to local costs in order to mitigate the impact of currency volatility the charts below detail our sales and longterm assets by major geographic region 

  

   

effective december 31 2001 we completed our plan to split into two companies fmc has retained the three chemical segments a separate company fmc technologies inc “technologies” operates the businesses that comprised the former energy systems and food and transportation systems segments our plan of separation was first announced on october 31 2000 on may 31 2001 we contributed the two nonchemical business segments to technologies which at the time was a whollyowned subsidiary of fmc we completed an initial public offering of approximately 17 percent of technologies’ stock in june 2001 and completed the separation on december 31 2001 by distributing all remaining shares of technologies owned by fmc as a taxfree dividend to stockholders 

  

our strategy 

  

our strategy is balanced between driving growth and innovation within our specialty chemicals and agricultural products segments and maintaining market shares through lowcost positions in our industrial chemicals segment our financial focus is on maximizing cash flow and reducing debt principally through continuing to reduce our costs and prudently managing capital expenditures and working capital 

  

we have a strategic objective toward concentrating our focus on areas with the greatest growth potential in that regard we are exploring opportunities for divestitures and acquisitions 

  

develop new technologies and products we have refocused our agricultural products segment on the development and marketing of new insecticides and new applications for our existing products including expanding the range of approved applications for our proprietary insecticides and herbicides also known as “label expansions” we are also developing strategic alliances in agricultural products to accelerate market penetration in certain geographic regions and to access and develop new technologies in this regard we have obtained exclusive rights from ishihara songyo kaisha ltd “isk” a leading japanese crop protection company to develop and market industryleading research that applies knowledge of gene functions to identify biological targets and to distribute new insecticides additionally we are accelerating discovery of new insecticides through 

  

our socalled “genomicsbased” research and related screening program in our specialty chemicals segment we continue to enhance our product portfolio and grow market share through strategic alliances with large pharmaceutical and food customers to develop innovative drugs and new food products we have shifted our lithium product mix from commodity lithium applications to higher margin enduses such as pharmaceuticals and lithium ion battery products 

  

manage industrial chemicals for cash we intend to maintain our market positions and lowcost structure by continually developing improved mining and manufacturing processes and prudently managing our asset base for example in soda ash we continually strive to optimize our proprietary and lowcost solution mining and longwall mining techniques thereby reducing our production costs which we believe are already among the lowest in the industry our phosphorus chemicals joint venture with solutia inc “solutia” astaris llc “astaris” recently shifted from an elemental phosphorus manufacturing process to a lower cost process based on purified phosphoric acid “ppa” also we are focusing our marketing and technical resources within highvalue niche applications in the food processing environmental and electronics markets 

  

continue to reduce costs we aggressively seek ways to continue to reduce costs in each of our business segments we have achieved our 2002 goal of reducing our cost structure and will continue to review all of our businesses for additional cost saving opportunities 

  

reduce debt and reestablish an investmentgrade rating we are committed to the goal of reestablishing our investmentgrade rating through debt reduction and the execution of our business strategies 

  

financial information about our business segments 

  

see note 18 to our consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k also see below for selected financial information related to our segments 

  

agricultural products 

  

financial information in millions 

  

   

overview 

  

our agricultural products segment which represents approximately 33 percent of our consolidated revenues manufactures and sells a portfolio of crop protection structural pest control and turf and ornamental products around the globe our product development efforts focus on developing more environmentally compatible solutions that can costeffectively increase farmers’ yields and provide more costeffective alternatives to older chemistries to which insects may have developed resistance we believe that our genomicsbased discovery strategy will identify novel new insecticides that enable farmers to enhance their crop yields 

  

  

products and markets 

  

   

agricultural products provides a wide range of proprietary branded products—based on both patented and offpatent technologies—for worldwide markets product branding is a prevalent industry practice used to help maintain and grow market share by promoting consumer recognition and the reputation of the product and the supplier while our position is particularly strong in north america we derived more than half of agricultural products’ revenue from outside north america in 2002 

  

in contrast to most other major crop protection companies insecticides dominate our agricultural products segment particularly pyrethroid and carbamate chemistries in which we maintain leading global positions based on revenues pyrethroids are a major class of insecticides whose low spread rates are unique compared to other classes of insecticides they are most effective against worm pests carbamates are a broad spectrum of insecticides used to control a wide variety of pests in both soil and foliage we also maintain niche positions in the herbicide market we differentiate ourselves through a highlyfocused strategy in selected crops and regions and leverage our proprietary chemistries and pestspecific rd to develop and market new insecticides and new applications of our existing products the following table summarizes the principal product chemistries in agricultural products and the principal uses of each chemistry 

  

   

  

recently we entered into several agreements with isk under which we will work together to market and distribute existing and new insecticide chemistries in various markets with the isk alliance we have expanded our distribution capabilities in japan and in europe by jointly investing with isk in the belgianbased pesticide distribution company belchim benelux nv through these alliances and our own targeted marketing efforts we expect to continue to enhance our access to markets and develop new products that will help us continue to compete effectively 

  

research and development 

  

we plan to grow by obtaining new and approved uses for existing product lines as well as complementary chemistries from other pesticide companies we have recently obtained new labels for zetacypermethrin for use on corn rice alfalfa sugar cane and leafy vegetable crops meanwhile our carfentrazone herbicide has been approved for cotton defoliation in north america in addition we continue to develop new applications for sulfentrazone and clomazone herbicides 

  

in the next few years we expect to launch on an exclusive basis in the americas a novel sucking pest insecticide discovered by isk the epa has prioritized this patented new chemistry for registration in certain applications as an organophosphate alternative the epa is encouraging the development of alternative products for organophosphates currently the number one class of insecticides in terms of worldwide demand 

  

we are among the first agrochemicals companies to pursue a predominantly genomicsbased approach in our longterm discovery efforts to identify compounds with a specific biological function on agricultural pests we believe this approach which is used extensively in the pharmaceutical industry will enable a more rapid and costeffective way to discover new insecticide chemistries that target unique mechanisms of action in economically important insects 

  

industry overview 

  

the three principal categories of agricultural chemicals are herbicides representing approximately half of global industry revenue insecticides representing approximately a quarter of global industry revenue and fungicides representing the remaining portion of global industry revenue we do not participate in the fungicide category 

  

insecticides are used to control a wide range of insects including chewing pests such as caterpillars and sucking pests such as aphids insecticides are applied as sprays dusts or granules and are used on a wide variety of crops such as fruits vegetables cotton soybean corn and cereal crops there are several major classes of insecticide chemistries including organophosphates carbamates and pyrethroids 

  

herbicides prevent or inhibit weed growth thereby reducing or eliminating the need for manual or mechanical weeding herbicides can be selective killing only specific unwanted foliage or nonselective killing all foliage and are also segmented by their time of application preplanting preemergent and postemergent 

  

the agrochemicals industry has recently undergone significant consolidation based on sales and giving effect to recent acquisitions the top crop protection companies syngenta ag bayer ag monsanto company basf ag the dow chemical company and e i du pont de nemours and company “dupont” currently represent more than three quarters of global sales while in 1995 the top six companies represented approximately half of global sales four of the these companies syngenta bayer basf and dow have all made significant acquisitions of other crop protection companies over the past few years a significant driver for this consolidation has been the advent of biotechnology and the resulting escalation of research and development costs particularly in herbicides employed in row crops 

  

the next tier agrochemical producers including makhteshimagan industries ltd sumitomo chemical company limited fmc and nufarm limited generally employ strategies focusing on niche crops and markets 

  

ie fruits vegetables household plants turf and ornamental markets andor generic products additionally there is an emerging trend among these producers to partner with one another to gain economies of scale more comparable to larger competitors 

  

specialty chemicals 

  

financial information in millions 

  

   

overview 

  

our specialty chemicals segment which represents 26 percent of our consolidated revenues is focused on highperformance food ingredients pharmaceutical excipients and intermediates and lithium specialty products that enjoy solid customer bases and consistent growing demand the majority of specialty chemicals revenues are to customers in noncyclical end markets we believe that our future growth in this segment will continue to be based on the performance capabilities of these products and our research and development capabilities as well as on the alliances and close working relationships developed with key global customers

the industry has experienced steady revenue growth over the last five years trends driving growth include increasing consumer interest in healthier foods greater convenience and growth in per capita consumption of processed foods in emerging markets the trend toward health and convenience drive the need for more functional ingredients to impart desired food tastes and textures carrageenan and microcrystalline cellulose “mcc” which address this need are growing faster than the overall tsps market the global customer base for tsps is relatively fragmented and includes large and small food processors consolidation among these customers has been a significant trend over the past several years large companies have merged with other large market participants notably slimfast foods companybestfoodsunilever plc nabisco group holdings corpkraft foods inc the pillsbury companygeneral mills inc suiza foods corporationdean foods company and have grown at twice the rate of smaller firms in light of these conditions tsps ingredient suppliers such as fmc have focused on establishing strategic alliances with market leaders with the goal of reducing costs leveraging technology and expanding product offerings with key accounts 

  

within the entire food ingredients market there are a relatively large number of suppliers due principally to the broad spectrum of chemistries employed segment leadership global position and investment in technology are key factors to sustaining profitability in addition larger suppliers may often provide a broader product line and a range of services including functional systems or blends the top suppliers of tsps ingredients include danisco as dupont cp kelco aps imperial chemical industries plc cargill incorporated sobel nv dgf stoess ag fmc degussa ag and tate  lyle plc 

  

  

pharmaceutical chemicals 

  

our biopolymers business sells into the formulation chemicals segment of the pharmaceutical market the major end markets for formulation chemicals include coatings and colors fillers binders sweeteners and flavors disintegrants and others 

  

competitors tend to be grouped by chemistry our principal mcc competitors in pharmaceuticals include j rettenmaier  sôhne gmbh ming tai chemical co ltd asahi kasei corporation and blanver farmoquimica ltda while pricing pressures from low cost producers is a common competitive dynamic companies like fmc offset that pressure by providing the most reliable and broadest range of products and services customers of excipients are pharmaceutical firms who depend upon reliable therapeutic performance of their drug products 

  

we also supply alginates into food and health care markets highly refined extracts from selected seaweeds provide a broad range of alginate functionality including uses in antireflux disorders dental impressions control release of drugs and wound dressings as well as food texture management 

  

lithium specialties 

  

lithium is a highly versatile metal with diverse enduse markets including glassceramics aluminum production pharmaceuticals polymers and both rechargeable and disposable batteries 

  

we market a wide variety of lithiumbased products ranging from upstream commodity lithium carbonate to highly specialized downstream products such as organolithium compounds and cathodic materials for batteries in recent years lithium carbonate has experienced a significant price decline due largely to industry oversupply 

  

new entry into the specialty lithium markets is difficult due to the level of proprietary process and product technology involved three major companies fmc chemetall sa and sociedad quimica y minera de chile sa produce lithium carbonate the markets for specialty lithium products tend to be concentrated in more developed regions including north america europe and asia 

  

industrial chemicals 

  

financial information in millions 

  

   

  

overview 

  

our industrial chemicals segment which represents 41 percent of our consolidated revenues has lowcost positions in highvolume inorganic chemicals including soda ash phosphorus chemicals and hydrogen peroxide complemented by highvalue niche positions in specialty alkali phosphorus and peroxygen products 

  

products and markets 

  

   

industrial chemicals serves a diverse group of markets from economically sensitive industrial sectors to technologyintensive specialty markets we process and sell refined inorganic products that are sought by customers for their critical reactivity or specific functionality in addition we produce purify and market highervalue downstream derivatives into specialized and customerspecific applications these applications include dialysis rocket propulsion animal nutrition biocides semiconductors and baking 

  

alkali 

  

our alkali chemical division produces natural soda ash soda ash is used by manufacturers in the glass chemical processing and detergent industries to a lesser degree we also produce sodium bicarbonate caustic soda and sodium sesquicarbonate our products are manufactured and sold through fmc wyoming corporation which we manage as an integral part of our alkali business in which we own shares representing an 875 percent economic interest with the remaining shares held by two japanese companies 

  

we mine and produce natural soda ash using proprietary lowcost mining technologies such as longwall and solution mining which we believe gives fmc the lowest cost versus other suppliers our two production sites in green river wyoming have the capacity to produce approximately 49 million tons of soda ash annually though the business over the last several years has mothballed 13 million tons of capacity to improve cost structure and to respond to market conditions 

  

peroxygens 

  

we produce hydrogen peroxide worldwide with production facilities in the united states canada and mexico through foret in spain and the netherlands and through a joint venture company in thailand we sell hydrogen peroxide into the pulp and paper industry and to a lesser extent in the electronics chemical processing food and textiles industries we believe we are a leading north american producer of hydrogen peroxide due in part to our broad product line geographicallyadvantaged plant locations and our stateoftheart processing technology hydrogen peroxide represents three quarters of our peroxygens sales 

  

our specialty peroxygens business supplies persulfate products primarily to polymer and printed circuit board markets and peracetic acid predominately to the food industry for biocidal applications typically we compete as a specialty player where we believe that we are differentiated by our strong technical expertise unique process technology and geographic location 

  

  

foret 

  

our european subsidiary foret headquartered in barcelona spain is a leader in providing chemical products to the detergent paper textile tanning and chemical industries foret is a large and diverse operation with seven manufacturing locations in europe foret has positions in phosphates hydrogen peroxides perborates sulfur derivatives silicates and zeolites foret’s sales efforts are focused in southern europe africa and the middle east 

  

astaris 

  

astaris our 50 percentowned unconsolidated joint venture with solutia is one of two large diversified phosphorus chemical suppliers in the western hemisphere astaris was formed as a separate company in 2000 with headquarters in st louis missouri astaris’s products are used in chemical processing baking food processing detergent applications and fire suppressants 

  

astaris is shifting its manufacturing process to take advantage of lowercost sourcing of phosphorus we believe that the move from a manufacturing strategy based on elemental phosphorus to one based on purified phosphoric acid “ppa” feedstock will eliminate the high environmental compliance and energy costs that adversely affected our pocatello elemental phosphorus facility and unfavorably impacted our earnings in recent years 

  

industry overview 

  

we primarily participate in three markets soda ash peroxygens and phosphorus chemicals these products are generally inorganicbased produced from minerals or air and are generally commodities which in many cases have few cost effective substitutes growth is typically a function of gdp or the rate of industrialization in key export markets pricing tends to reflect shortterm supply and demand as producers add or reduce capacity and demand changes 

  

soda ash 

  

soda ash is a highly alkaline inorganic chemical essential in the production of glass and widely used in the production of chemicals soaps and detergents and many other products natural soda ash is generally produced from trona a natural form of sodium sesquicarbonate through mining and chemical processing soda ash may also be produced synthetically using the process developed in the 19th century by ernest solvay which uses salt ammonia carbon dioxide and limestone as raw materials the solvay process requires a significant amount of heat energy and produces large quantities of waste byproducts making it much less costeffective than natural soda ash production 

  

because of the processing cost advantages of trona and the large natural reserves of trona in the us particularly in green river wyoming all us soda ash production is natural by contrast due to a lack of trona a large percentage of the soda ash that is manufactured in the rest of the world is produced synthetically other us producers are oci chemical corporation solvay sa the general chemical group inc imc global inc and american soda llp 

  

approximately 30 percent to 35 percent of us natural soda ash production is exported through the american natural soda ash association “ansac” ansac is the foreign sales association of all us producers of soda ash and was established in 1983 under the webbpomerene act and subsequent legislation since its creation ansac has been successful in coordinating soda ash exports exploiting the natural cost benefits of usproduced natural soda ash and leveraging its large scale of operations to the benefit of its member companies us exports of soda ash have risen significantly over the last twenty years 

  

peroxygens 

  

hydrogen peroxide is typically sold in aqueous solutions for use as a bleach or oxidizer as such it often competes with other chemicals capable of performing similar functions some of our specialty peroxygen 

  

derivatives eg perborates also function as bleaching or oxidizing agents environmental regulations regional cost differences often due to transportation costs and technical differences in product performance enter into the decision to use hydrogen peroxide or one of its derivatives rather than another product since these considerations vary by region the consumption patterns vary in different parts of the world hydrogen peroxide is sold in aqueous solutions usually 35 percent 50 percent or 70 percent by weight 

  

the us pulp and paper industry represents approximately 65 percent of domestic demand for hydrogen peroxide in this market hydrogen peroxide is used as an environmentally friendly bleaching agent to brighten chemical mechanical and recycled pulps as well as treat a wide range of mill pollutants in the waste stream during the 1990s the hydrogen peroxide market became increasingly cyclical dependent on the pulp industry which has recently experienced a general slowdown in addition demand growth for hydrogen peroxide has slowed as the conversion from elemental chlorine by the us pulp industry is largely complete these trends have had a negative effect on pricing the other north american hydrogen peroxide producers are akzo nobel nv atofina chemicals inc degussa ag kemira oyj and solvay 

  

phosphorus chemicals 

  

phosphorus chemicals are used in many industrial applications in a wide array of chemical compounds overall growth in demand for phosphorus chemicals tends to correlate with gdp phosphoric acid and phosphate salts eg sodium phosphates calcium phosphates potassium phosphates are sold into many markets including food beverage water treatment automotive metal cleaning detergents specialty agricultural and fire suppressants 

  

the basic feed for making phosphorus chemicals is now produced using two processes most industrial applications use the costeffective process which involves making ppa by the purification of fertilizergrade phosphoric acid thermal phosphoric acid long the industry standard is produced from elemental phosphorus but is far more costly due to energy and environmental compliance costs and is now used mainly in limited applications while astaris ceased the production of elemental phosphorus in 2001 it is still produced by monsanto in the united states thermphos in the netherlands and in several other countries principally china 

  

worldwide demand for phosphorus chemicals declined in the early 1990s as detergents containing phosphates for homelaundry use were banned in north america and parts of europe though not projected to occur in 2003 over the next few years industrial demand for phosphorus chemicals is expected to improve driven by growing demand in the detergents and food and beverage industries in newly industrializing nations and by the growth of food and beverage applications in the united states and europe 

  

beginning in the 1990s reduced demand the shift in growth toward developing regions and the advent of new technology resulted in a significant restructuring of the phosphorus chemicals industry as producers consolidated or exited the business 

  

in north america we participate in the industrial phosphate business through our astaris joint venture in europe we participate in this business through foret both astaris and foret use the ppa process major competitors include rhodia sa potash corporation of saskachewan inc prayon rupel sa and rotem amfer  negev ltd 

  

source and availability of raw materials 

  

our raw material requirements vary by business segment and include mineralrelated natural resources trona ore lithium brines and phosphate rock processed chemicals seaweed specialty wood pulp and energy sources such as oil gas coal and electricity raw materials represented approximately 30 percent of our 2002 cost of sales and services and no one raw material represented more than 7 percent of our total raw material purchases 

  

  

ores used in industrial chemicals manufacturing processes such as trona are extracted from mines in the us on property held by fmc under longterm leases subject to periodic adjustment of royalty rates raw materials used by specialty chemicals include lithium carbonate which is currently obtained from a south american manufacturer under a longterm sourcing agreement various types of seaweed that are sourced on a global basis and wood pulp which is purchased from several north american producers raw materials used by agricultural products primarily processed chemicals are obtained from a variety of suppliers worldwide 

  

patents 

  

fmc owns a number of us and foreign patents trademarks and licenses that are cumulatively important to its business we do not believe that the loss of any one or group of related patents trademarks or licenses would have a material adverse effect on the overall business of fmc the duration of our patents depends on their respective jurisdictions their expiration dates range through 2020 

  

seasonality 

  

the seasonal nature of the crop protection market and the geographic spread of the agricultural products business generally produce stronger earnings in the second and third quarters agricultural products sold into the northern hemisphere north america europe and parts of asia serve seasonal agricultural markets from march through september while markets in the southern hemisphere latin america and parts of the asia pacific region including australia are served from july through february the remainder of our businesses are generally not subject to significant seasonal fluctuations 

  

competition 

  

we have a number one or number two market position in many of our product lines based on revenue either globally or in north america largely as a result of our proprietary technologies and with respect to industrial chemicals our position as a lowcost producer the following product lines accounted for approximately 77 percent of our 2002 consolidated revenue 

  

      

competitive conditions 

  

we encounter substantial competition in each of our three business segments this competition is expected to continue in both the united states and markets outside the united states we market our products through our own sales organization and through independent distributors and sales representatives the number of our principal competitors varies from segment to segment in general we compete by operating in a costefficient manner and by leveraging our industry experience to provide advanced technology high product quality and reliability and quality customer and technical service 

  

our agricultural products segment competes in the global crop protection market for insecticides and herbicides the industry is characterized by a small number of large competitors and a large number of smaller 

  

often regional competitors such as fmc industry products include crop protection chemicals and for major competitors genetically engineered crop biotechnology products competition from generic producers has increased as a significant number of product patents have expired in the last decade in general we compete as a product innovator by focusing on insecticide discovery and development and licensing products from alliances when the products complement our product portfolio we also differentiate ourselves by reacting quickly in key markets establishing effective product stewardship programs and developing strategic alliances which strengthen market access in key countries 

  

with significant positions in markets that include alginate carrageenan microcrystalline cellulose and lithiumbased products specialty chemicals competes on the basis of product differentiation customer service and price biopolymer competes with both direct suppliers of cellulose and seaweed extract as well as suppliers of other hydrocolloids which may provide similar functionality in specific applications in microcrystalline cellulose competitors are typically smaller than fmc while in seaweed extracts alginates we compete with other broadbased chemical companies fmc and each of its two most significant competitors in lithium extract the element from naturally occurring lithiumrich brines located in the andes mountains of argentina and chile which are believed to be the world’s most significant and lowest cost sources of lithium 

  

industrial chemicals serves the alkali peroxygens and phosphorus markets predominantly in the united states and to a lesser extent europe in north america the soda ash business competes with five domestic producers of natural soda ash three of which operate in the vicinity of our mine and processing facility in green river wyoming outside of north america and europe fmc sells soda ash through ansac internationally fmc’s natural soda ash competes with synthetic soda ash manufactured by numerous producers ranging from integrated multinational companies to smaller regional players hydrogen peroxide maintains a leading position in the north american market for hydrogen peroxide there are currently five firms competing in the hydrogen peroxide market in north america the primary competitive factor affecting the sales of soda ash and hydrogen peroxide is price we seek to maintain our competitive position by employing low cost processing technology at foret we possess a strong cost and market position in phosphates perborates peroxygens zeolites and sulfur derivatives in each of these markets we face significant competition from a range of multinational and regional chemical producers we participate in the phosphorus chemicals business in the united states through astaris competition in phosphorus chemicals is based primarily on both product differentiation and price 

  

research and development expense 

  

we perform product research and development in all of our segments with the majority of our efforts focused in our agricultural products segment the product development efforts in our agricultural products segment focus on developing more environmentally compatible solutions that can costeffectively increase farmers’ yields and provide alternatives to insectresistant chemistries our research and development expenses in the last three years are set forth below 

  

   

environmental laws and regulations 

  

we are subject to various federal state local and foreign environmental laws and regulations that govern emissions of air pollutants discharges of water pollutants and the manufacture storage handling and disposal of 

  

hazardous substances hazardous wastes and other toxic materials and remediation of contaminated sites we are also subject to liabilities arising under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act “cercla” and similar state laws that impose responsibility on persons who arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances and on current and previous owners and operators of a facility for the cleanup of hazardous substances released from the facility into the environment in addition we are subject to liabilities under the resource conservation and recovery act “rcra” and analogous state laws that require owners and operators of facilities that treat store or dispose of hazardous waste to follow certain waste management practices and to clean up releases of hazardous waste into the environment associated with past or present practices 

  

we have been named a potentially responsible party or prp at 26 sites on the federal government’s national priority list in addition we also have received notice from the environmental protection agency “epa” or other regulatory agencies that we may be a potentially responsible party “prp” or prp equivalent at other sites including 43 sites at which we have determined that it is reasonably possible that we have an environmental liability in cooperation with appropriate government agencies we are currently participating in or have participated in a remedial investigationfeasibility study “rifs” or its equivalent at most of the identified sites with the status of each investigation varying from site to site at certain sites a rifs has only recently begun providing limited information if any relating to cost estimates timing or the involvement of other prps whereas at other sites the studies are complete remedial action plans have been chosen or a record of decision has “rod” been issued 

  

environmental liabilities include obligations relating to waste handling and the remediation andor study of sites at which we are alleged to have disposed of regulated materials these sites include current operations previously operated sites and sites associated with discontinued operations we have provided reserves for potential environmental obligations that management considers probable and for which a reasonable estimate of the obligation could be made as of december 31 2002 our total environmental reserve after accounting for any potential recoveries from third parties which we estimate at 277 million was 1957 million compared to 2189 million at december 31 2001 after accounting for recoveries of 415 million in addition we have estimated that reasonably possible environmental loss contingencies may exceed this reserve by as much as 800 million at december 31 2002 

  

employees 

  

we employ approximately 5500 people with approximately 3000 people in our domestic operations and approximately 2500 people in our foreign operations approximately 30 percent of our usbased employees and approximately 40 percent of our foreignbased employees are represented by collective bargaining agreements we have successfully concluded virtually all of our recent negotiations without a work stoppage in those rare instances where a work stoppage has occurred there has been no material effect on consolidated sales and earnings we cannot predict however the outcome of future contract negotiations 

  

item 2 properties 

  

fmc leases executive offices in philadelphia and subleases administrative offices from technologies in chicago we operate 37 manufacturing facilities and mines in 19 countries our major research and development facility is in princeton new jersey 

  

trona ore used for soda ash production in green river wyoming is mined primarily from property held under longterm leases we own the land and mineral rights to the salar del hombre muerto lithium reserves in argentina a number of our chemical plants require the basic raw materials which are provided by these fmcowned or leased mines without which other sources would have to be obtained with regard to our mining properties operated under longterm leases no single lease or related group of leases is material to our businesses or to our company as a whole 

  

  

most of our plant sites are owned with some under lease we believe our properties and facilities meet present requirements and are in good operating condition and that each of our significant manufacturing facilities is operating at a level consistent with capacity utilization prevalent in the industries in which it operates the number and location of our production properties for continuing operations are

item 3 legal proceedings 

  

like hundreds of other industrial companies we have been named as one of many defendants in asbestosrelated personal injury litigation these cases most cases involve between 50 and 350 defendants allege personal injury or death resulting from exposure to asbestos in premises of fmc or to asbestoscontaining components installed in machinery or equipment manufactured or sold by discontinued operations the machinery and equipment businesses we owned or operated did not fabricate the asbestoscontaining component parts at issue in the litigation and to this day neither the us occupational safety and health administration nor the epa has banned the use of these components further the asbestoscontaining materials were housed inside of machinery and equipment and accessible only at the time of infrequent repair and maintenance therefore we believe that overall the claims against fmc are without merit and consider ourselves to be a peripheral defendant in these matters indeed the bulk of the claims against us to date have been dismissed without payment 

  

as of december 31 2002 there were approximately 26000 premises and product claims pending against fmc in several jurisdictions to date we have had discharged all before trial approximately 51000 claims against fmc the overwhelming majority of which have been dismissed without any payment to the plaintiff the costs of all settlements to date have totaled approximately 3 million 

  

we intend to continue managing these cases in accordance with our historical experience we have established a reserve for this litigation and believe that the outcome of these cases will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations cash flows or financial condition 

  

we are party to various other lawsuits both as defendant and plaintiff arising in the normal course of business we believe that the disposition of these lawsuits will not individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations cash flows or financial condition 

  

see note 1 “principal accounting policies—environmental obligations” note 11 “environmental obligations” and note 17 “commitments and contingent liabilities” in the company’s consolidated financial statements beginning on page 51 page 72 and page 85 respectively to our consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k

industrial chemicals 

  

our industrial chemicals segment manufactures soda ash peroxygens and phosphorus chemicals through our manufacturing facility in green river wyoming we process naturally occurring soda ash a commonly used ingredient in detergents and chemical processing and an essential ingredient in glass we produce hydrogen peroxide leveraging our geographically advantaged plant locations throughout north america to reach our customers we also market specialty grades of hydrogen peroxide and specialty peroxygens to the electronics polymers and food processing industries our european subsidiary fmc foret sa “foret” leverages its low production costs and strong brand name to manufacture and sell phosphorus chemicals peroxygens sulfur derivatives silicates zeolites and other products in europe africa and the middle east we are also a 50 percent owner with solutia inc “solutia” of astaris llc “astaris” a north american producer of phosphorus chemicals used in a wide array of markets including the detergent food agricultural and industrial markets we account for astaris as an equity investment the majority of industrial chemicals’ sales are to customers engaged in relatively noncyclical end markets 

  

the reorganization of our company 

  

we implemented our plan to split fmc into separate chemical and machinery companies in 2001 through a twostep process the first step included an initial public offering “ipo” of 17 percent of fmc technologies 

  

inc “technologies” which took place in the second quarter of 2001 technologies consists of our former energy systems and food and transportation systems business segments subsequent to the ipo technologies made net payments of 4307 million to fmc in exchange for the net assets distributed to technologies on june 1 2001 which we used to retire shortterm and longterm debt the second step the distribution of our remaining 83 percent ownership in technologies the “spinoff” occurred on december 31 2001 total net assets distributed on december 31 2001 were 5095 million 

  

we believe that the spinoff of technologies has allowed us to focus our efforts in the chemical industry through improved customer orientation increased innovation and overall growth in certain businesses in an effort to align our business with our future growth plans we took various strategic measures in 2002 2001 and 2000 including the restructuring of businesses reduction of staff plant shut downs plant mothballing and the impairment of certain underperforming assets we believe these steps will increase our financial flexibility as operating conditions change 

  

application of critical accounting policies 

  

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states the preparation of our financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of asset liabilities revenues and expenses we have described our accounting policies in note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k we have reviewed these accounting policies identifying those which we believe to be critical to the preparation and understanding of our consolidated financial statements we have reviewed with the audit committee those accounting policies that we have deemed critical critical accounting policies are central to our presentation of results of operations and financial condition and require management to make estimates and judgments on certain matters we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience current conditions and other reasonable factors 

  

environmental 

  

we provide for environmentalrelated obligations when they are probable and amounts can be reasonably estimated where the available information is sufficient to estimate the amount of liability that estimate has been used where the information is only sufficient to establish a range of probable liability and no point within the range is more likely than any other the lower end of the range has been used 

  

estimated obligations to remediate sites that involve oversight by the us environmental protection agency “epa” or similar government agencies are generally accrued no later than when a record of decision “rod” or equivalent is issued or upon completion of a remedial investigationfeasibility study “rifs” that is accepted by fmc and the appropriate government agency or agencies estimates are reviewed quarterly by our environmental remediation management as well as by our financial and legal management and if necessary adjusted as additional information becomes available the estimates can change substantially as additional information becomes available regarding the nature or extent of site contamination required remediation methods and other actions by or against governmental agencies or private parties 

  

our liabilities for continuing and discontinued operations are principally for costs associated with the remediation andor study of sites at which our company is alleged to have disposed of hazardous substances such costs principally include among other items rifs site remediation costs of operation and maintenance of the remediation plan fees to outside law firms and consultants for work related to the environmental effort and future monitoring costs estimated site liabilities are determined based upon existing remediation laws and technologies specific site consultants’ engineering studies or by extrapolating experience with environmental issues at comparable sites 

  

provisions for environmental costs are reflected in income net of probable and estimable recoveries from named potentially responsible parties “prps” or other third parties such provisions incorporate inflation and are not discounted to their present values 

  

  

in calculating and evaluating the adequacy of its environmental reserves the company has taken into account the joint and several liability imposed by the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act “cercla” and the analogous state laws on all prps and has considered the identity and financial condition of each of the other prps at each site to the extent possible we also considered the identity and financial condition of other third parties from whom recovery is anticipated as well as the status of our claims against such parties although we are unable to forecast the ultimate contributions of prps and other third parties with absolute certainty the degree of uncertainty with respect to each party is taken into account when determining the environmental reserve by adjusting the reserve to reflect the facts and circumstances on a sitebysite basis our liability includes management’s best estimate of the costs expected to be paid before its consideration of any potential recoveries from third parties we believe that any recorded recoveries related to prps are realizable in all material respects we have recorded recoveries in “environmental reserves continuing and discontinued” representing probable realization of claims against insurance companies us government agencies and other third parties of 277 million and 415 million respectively at december 31 2002 and 2001 these recoveries are recorded as an offset to the “environmental reserve continuing and discontinued” cash recoveries for the years 2002 2001 and 2000 were 162 million 125 million and 142 million respectively we expect to continue to receive payments for recoveries in the future our total environmental reserves before recoveries totaled 2234 million and 2604 million at december 31 2002 and 2001 respectively in addition at december 31 2002 we have estimated that reasonably possible environmental loss contingencies may exceed amounts accrued by as much as 80 million 

  

impairments and valuation of longlived assets 

  

our longlived assets include property plant and equipment and longterm investments goodwill and intangible assets we review the carrying value of these assets for impairment in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard “sfas” no 144 “accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets” the standard requires that we test for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the net book value of these assets may not be recoverable from the estimated undiscounted expected future cash flows expected to result from their use and eventual disposition in cases where the estimated undiscounted expected future cash flows are less than net book value an impairment loss is recognized equal to the amount by which the net book value exceeds the estimated fair value of assets the fair value of longlived assets is based on discounted cash flows at the lowest level determinable the estimated cash flows reflect our assumptions about selling prices volumes costs and market conditions over a reasonable period of time we recognized 3231 million and 101 million in asset impairments in 2001 and 2000 respectively related to our industrial chemicals and specialty chemicals segments 

  

we also prepare an annual impairment test of goodwill in accordance with sfas no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” the fair value of goodwill and intangible assets is based on estimated discounted cash flows the assumptions used to estimate fair value include management’s best estimate of future growth rates discount rates and market conditions over a reasonable period we performed this test in 2002 and determined that no impairment charge was required total goodwill as of december 31 2002 and 2001 was 1297 million and 1135 million respectively 

  

depreciation for financial reporting is reported on a straightline basis over the estimated useful lives of the fixed asset estimated useful lives are based on historical usefullife trends as well as common industry practice useful lives are as follows 20 years—land improvements 20 to 50 years—buildings depending on location and use 3 to 18 years machinery and equipment depending on type and use depreciation expense totaled 1052 million 1122 million and 1163 million in 2002 2001 and 2000 respectively 

  

pension and other postretirement benefits 

  

we provide qualified and nonqualified defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans as well as other postretirement health care and life insurance benefit plans to our employees the costs or benefits and 

  

obligations related to these benefits reflect our key assumptions related to general economic conditions including interest discount rates healthcare cost trend rates expected rates of return on plan assets and the rates of compensation increases for employees the costs or benefits and obligations for these benefit programs are also affected by other assumptions including things such as the average retirement age mortality tables employee turnover and plan participation to the extent our plans’ actual experience as influenced by changing economic and financial market conditions or by changes to our own plans’ demographics differs from these assumptions the costs and obligations for providing these benefits as well as the plans’ funding requirements could increase or decrease when actual results differ from our assumptions the difference is typically recognized over future periods 

  

we use certain calculated values of assets under methods permitted under sfas no 87 “employer’s accounting for pensions” “sfas 87” both to estimate the expected rate of return on assets component of pension cost and to calculate our plans’ funding requirements the expected rate of return on plan assets is based on a marketrelated value of assets that recognizes investment gains and losses over a fiveyear period we use an actuarial value of assets to determine our plans’ funding requirements the actuarial value of assets must be within a certain range high or low of the actual market value of assets and is adjusted accordingly 

  

the unrealized gains and losses related to our pension and postretirement benefit obligations may affect periodic benefit costs in future periods however we do not expect this to have a significant impact in 2003 

  

we recorded 49 million and 40 million of pension and other postretirement benefit cost in 2002 and 2001 respectively and a 51 million credit in pension and other postretirement benefit cost in 2000 we expect pension and other postretirement benefit costs to increase in 2003 due to a combination of factors including changes in key assumptions such as the discount rate and an increase in the amortization of prior service cost at december 31 2002 and 2001 1066 million and 1167 million respectively was recorded for pension and other postretirement benefit obligations the recorded amounts for pension benefit obligations include additional minimum pension liabilities of 848 million and 83 million at december 31 2002 and 2001 respectively which were recorded as other comprehensive losses in stockholders’ equity the company’s operating cash flows for 2002 included a 28 million voluntary cash contribution to the us qualified pension plan although we are not required to make any cash contributions to this plan in 2003 we are considering making voluntary cash contributions of approximately 5 million 

  

we select the discount rate used to calculate pension and other postretirement obligations based on a review of highquality corporate bonds with particular focus on the moody’s investors service inc “moody’s” aarated corporate and industrial bond indices at the end of each respective year bonds in these indices have remaining maturities of at least 20 years and the indices are constructed to have an average remaining maturity of approximately 30 years we selected a discount rate of 65 percent at december 31 2002 for pension and other postretirement benefit obligations 

  

as described within sfas 87 the expected rate of return on plan assets is viewed as a longterm average rate of return to be earned on the assets invested or to be invested to provide for the benefits included in the projected benefit obligation in developing the expected longterm rate of return on asset assumption for our plan we take into consideration the technical analysis using a geometric average performed by our outside actuaries including historical market returns information on longterm real return expectations by asset class inflation assumptions and expectations for standard deviation related to these best estimates we also consider the historical performance of our own plan’s trust which has averaged 123 percent over the last 10 years in excess of comparable market indices for the same period as well as other factors the current asset allocation for our plan is approximately 70 percent equities us and nonus and 30 percent fixedincome investments given an actively managed investment portfolio the expected returns by asset class for our portfolio using a geometric average and after being adjusted for an estimated inflation rate of approximately three percent are between nine and eleven percent for both us and nonus equities and between five and seven percent for fixedincome 

  

investments which generates a total expected portfolio return in excess of 925 percent we continually monitor the appropriateness of this rate in light of current market conditions for the sensitivity of our pension costs to incremental changes in this assumption see our discussion below 

  

sensitivity analysis related to key pension and postretirement benefit assumptions  a onehalf percent increase in the assumed discount rate would have decreased pension and other postretirement benefit obligations by 476 million at december 31 2002 and 437 million at december 31 2001 and decreased pension and other postretirement benefit costs by 12 million 12 million and 26 million for 2002 2001 and 2000 respectively a onehalf percent decrease in the assumed discount rate would have increased pension and other postretirement benefit obligations by 505 million at december 31 2002 and 464 million at december 31 2001 and increased pension and other postretirement benefit by 10 million 11 million and 27 million for 2002 2001 and 2000 respectively 

  

a onehalf percent increase in the assumed expected longterm rate of return on plan assets would have decreased pension costs by 30 million 29 million and 40 million for 2002 2001 and 2000 respectively a onehalf percent decrease in the assumed longterm rate of return on assets would have increased pension costs by 30 million 29 million and 40 million for 2002 2001 and 2000 respectively 

  

income taxes 

  

we have recorded a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized in assessing the need for this allowance we have considered future taxable income and our ongoing tax planning strategies in the event that we determined that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period such determination was made similarly should we conclude that we would be able to realize certain deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase income in the period such determination was made at december 31 2002 and 2001 the valuation allowance was 224 million and 180 million respectively 

  

results of operations—2002 2001 and 2000 

  

overview 

  

our consolidated revenue for the years ended december 31 2002 2001 and 2000 was 18529 million 19430 million and 20503 million respectively in 2002 our first full year as an independent pureplay chemical company we earned net income of 658 million compared to a net loss of 3377 million in 2001 and net income of 1106 million in 2000 diluted earnings per common share for the year was 192 compared to a diluted loss per common share of 1086 in 2001 and diluted earnings per common share of 350 in 2000 net income for 2002 included restructuring and other charges and a discontinued operations’ loss totaling 217 million after tax or 063 per common share on a diluted basis in 2001 net income included restructuring and other charges asset impairments and a discontinued operations’ loss totaling 4361 after tax or 1396 per common share on a diluted basis in 2000 net income included restructuring and other charges asset impairments and a discontinued operations’ loss totaling 429 million after tax or 136 per common share on a diluted basis see “results of operations” and “segment results” for a detailed discussion of events affecting our results for 2002 2001 and 2000 

  

all results discussed in this analysis address the continuing results of our chemical businesses the results of technologies which was spunoff on december 31 2001 have been reclassified to discontinued operations within our consolidated statement of income for the years ended december 31 2001 and 2000 and consolidated statement of cash flow for the years ended december 31 2001 and 2000 see “the reorganization of our company” for an overview of our spinoff of technologies 

  

  

results of operations—2002 compared to 2001 

  

in the following discussion “year” refers to the year ending december 31 2002 and “prior year” refers to the year ending december 31 2001 all comparisons are between these periods unless otherwise noted 

  

revenue for the year ended december 31 2002 was 18529 million compared to 19430 million in 2001 down 5 percent lower revenue in 2002 compared to 2001 was principally attributable to lower revenue in our industrial chemicals and agricultural products segments our industrial chemicals segment saw generally lower selling prices and lower sales volumes due to unfavorable market conditions also affecting revenue were decreased agricultural products sales resulting from lower herbicide sales and unfavorable weather conditions in asia in 2003 we expect increased revenue from our specialty chemicals and agricultural products segments as well as improved domestic markets served by industrial chemicals 

  

asset impairments there were no asset impairments in 2002 asset impairments totaled 3231 million 2338 million after tax in 2001 

  

based upon a comprehensive review of our longlived assets we recorded asset impairment charges in our industrial chemicals and specialty chemicals segments in 2001 industrial chemicals recorded impairment charges of 2242 million of which 123 million related to the impairment of assets in our sodium cyanide operations while 2119 million was for the impairments in our usbased phosphorus chemicals business 

  

a weakening market in our sodium cyanide business led us to impair the assets of this business in the second quarter of 2001 we subsequently exited this business in 2002 

  

our usbased phosphorus chemicals business is comprised of our 50 percent interest in astaris and the activities of our corporate phosphorus division which manages remediation and other environmental projects associated with the former astaris elemental phosphorus plant in pocatello idaho 

  

based upon a comprehensive review of our longlived assets we recorded asset impairment charges of 2119 million related to our usbased phosphorus business in the second quarter of 2001 the components of asset impairments related to this business include a 1710 million impairment of environmental assets built to comply with a resource conservation and recovery act “rcra” consent decree the “consent decree” at the pocatello idaho facility a further 44 million of other nonenvironmental phosphorus related fixed assets and a 365 million impairment charge for our investment in astaris driving these charges were a decline in market conditions the loss of a potential site on which to develop an economically viable second purified phosphoric acid “ppa” plant and our agreement to pay into a fund for the shoshonebannock tribes the “tribal fund” resulting from an agreement to support a proposal to amend the consent decree which permitted the earlier closure of the largest remaining waste disposal pond at pocatello 

  

in addition we recorded an impairment charge of 989 million related to our specialty chemicals segment’s lithium operations in argentina we established this operation which includes a lithium mine and processing facilities approximately six years ago in a remote area of the andes mountains the entry of a south american manufacturer into this business resulted in decreased revenues in addition market conditions continued to be unfavorable as a result our lithium assets in argentina became impaired as the total capital invested is not expected to be recovered 

  

restructuring and other charges totaled 301 million 184 million after tax in 2002 compared to 2804 million 1721 million after tax in 2001 

  

in an effort to mitigate the effects of the continued economic weakness in the markets served by our industrial chemicals business we undertook several key reorganization and cost saving initiatives that resulted in 124 million of restructuring charges in 2002 included in this amount was a 57 million restructuring charge for the mothballing of the basic production line at our hydrogen peroxide facility in spring hill west virginia of the 16 severances incurred related to the spring hill mothballing the majority will occur in the first half of 2003 we also mothballed our granger caustic facility in green river wyoming resulting in a 34 million restructuring charge the majority of this charge was for facility shutdown activities and 110 severances all of 

  

which occurred in 2002 in addition we recorded a 33 million restructuring charge for severance costs related to reorganization efforts to reduce costs in our us phosphorus chemicals division alkali peroxygens and at foret the majority of these charges were for 38 severances all of which occurred in 2002 we estimate that our industrial chemicals’ restructuring activities will result in approximately 13 million of combined annual cost savings and cost avoidance 

  

in agricultural products we incurred 47 million of restructuring charges in 2002 of which 37 million related to the idling and reorganization of our sulfentrazone plant in baltimore in connection with our new herbicides strategy see segment results—2002 compared to 2001 a 10 million restructuring charge was recorded for reorganization costs to implement a new distribution strategy in europe which will allow us to rely on certain strategic alliances to further penetrate and expand our european markets of the 108 severances related to these restructurings 57 occurred in 2002 we estimate that the restructuring activities will result in approximately 20 million of combined annual cost savings and cost avoidance 

  

we recorded 13 million of restructuring charges in our specialty chemicals segment in 2002 in an effort to realign product divisions within biopolymer both domestically and internationally the majority of these costs resulted in the severance of 24 people these severances are expected to occur in the first half of 2003 we estimated that our specialty chemicals’ restructuring activities will result in approximately 2 million of combined annual cost savings and cost avoidance 

  

reorganization costs of 30 million and other charges of 87 million were also recorded in the period these charges are discussed in note 6 to our consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k also of the 301 million of restructuring charges recorded in 2002 119 million was spent in 2002 we expect the remainder to be spent in 2003 

  

in 2001 a change in market conditions and the implementation of our overall corporate strategy resulted in restructuring and other charges of 2804 million detailed as follows 

  

      

industrial chemicals recorded restructuring and other charges of 2479 million in 2001 of which 62 million was for restructuring at several sites including 57 million for the mothballing of our granger wyoming soda ash facility and 2417 million was for our usbased phosphorus business there were 130 severances from the restructuring of industrial chemicals the majority of which occurred in 2001 with the remainder occurring in 2002 

  

in connection with the impairment of our usbased phosphorus chemicals business in the second quarter of 2001 we recorded other charges for a 687 million reserve for further required consent decree spending at the pocatello site related to environmental capital projects required to complete the construction of facilities to treat the sites waste streams 427 million for financing obligations to the astaris joint venture “keepwell” payments and a 400 million payment to the tribal fund for various tribe activities in order to permit capping of a specific waste disposal pond at pocatello 

  

  

subsequent to the recording of these charges in the second quarter of 2001 the astaris joint venture announced its plans in october 2001 to cease production at the pocatello idaho elemental phosphorus facility in december 2001 this decision reflected the shift in astaris’s sourcing strategy away from production of high cost elemental phosphorus to lower cost ppa and also reflected the availability of lowcost alternative feedstock materials projected higher future environmental compliance costs at pocatello and our desire to avoid additional capital spending on environmental compliance assets required under the consent decree in connection with the decision to shut down pocatello we recorded restructuring charges of 765 million in the fourth quarter of 2001 we spent 323 million and 09 million of these reserves in 2002 and 2001 respectively with the remaining reserves to be spent over the next 5 to 7 years as we manage the site’s decommissioning and environmental issues these charges included reserves for decontamination demolition and other shut down costs of 587 million environmental remediation requirements resulting from the decision to shut down the facility of 543 million and our 50 percent share of costs recorded by astaris for its obligations associated with the shutdown or 363 million offsetting these charges was a reversal in the amount of 345 million representing the unspent portion of the reserve recorded in the second quarter of 2001 for required consent decree spending at the pocatello site to build environmental compliance assets because the decision to shut down the site eliminated the need for further spending we also recorded as an offset to these charges a commitment from astaris to pay us 365 million over the next 5 years reflecting the joint venture’s obligation to contribute to our costs for the shutdown and remediation of the site we received 37 million from astaris in 2002 related to this commitment and expect future payments to be funded from astaris’s savings from the shutdown 

  

also included in the 2417 million of restructuring and other charges related to the usbased phosphorus business was a charge of 120 million for other restructuring activities which were not directly related to the shutdown of pocatello included in this charge were restructuring activities related to severance and decommissioning of a coke facility as well as charges related to the shutdown of two furnaces at pocatello 

  

the decision to shut down pocatello was consistent with astaris’s plan to shift raw material supply for most products from high cost elemental phosphorus to lower cost ppa high energy operating and environmental costs of producing elemental phosphorus have reinforced the relative cost advantage of ppa over time we expected to shift our supply chain to ppa at an annual cost savings of approximately 25 million to astaris in addition astaris was able to avoid estimated future costs of 90 million per year associated with operating the environmental compliance assets related to the consent decree the decision to shut down pocatello in the fourth quarter of 2001 has allowed us to avoid spending of 345 million for the remaining capital costs associated with completing the construction of environmental compliance assets and any startup costs for this plant which could have been significant further there also had been a concern that environmental compliance costs could escalate in future years and add further costs in addition estimated future costs at astaris were expected to include a need to refurbish furnaces at pocatello in 2004 at an estimated cost of 100 million 

  

in 2001 we recorded 125 million of severance and other costs related to our agricultural products segment as a result of our strategic refocusing on key geographic markets and crops and the realignment of our rd resources to our core strength in insecticides the majority of the spending related to these charges occurred in 2002 these charges will result in future savings in both selling and administrative expenses and research and development costs the annualized savings from these restructurings were approximately 200 million there were 163 severances related to these charges the majority of which occurred in 2002 

  

of the remaining 2001 restructuring and other charges of 200 million approximately 175 million related to corporate reorganization costs due to the spinoff of technologies with remaining charges of 25 million related to restructuring in specialty chemicals the majority of the spending associated with these charges occurred in 2001 and in the first half of 2002 the benefit of the restructuring and other charges from our corporate reorganization and spinoff are not subject to reasonable estimation the benefits were directly related to improving stockholder value through creating a focused chemical company there were approximately 45 severances related to these charges the majority occurring in 2001 

  

net interest expense in 2002 was 716 million compared to 583 million in 2001 the increase in interest expense can largely be attributed to higher average debt levels and higher interest rates from our 2002 

  

refinancing see “liquidity and capital resources” and note 10 to our consolidated financial statement included in this form 10k for further details on the refinancing and its effects on our results 

  

provisionbenefit for income taxes we recorded an income tax provision of 174 million in 2002 compared to a benefit of 1666 million in 2001 resulting in effective tax rates of 20 percent and 35 percent respectively the 2001 tax benefit is a direct result of the significant restructuring and other charges and impairments recorded in 2001 the differences between the effective tax rates for these periods and the statutory us federal income taxes rate relate primarily to differing foreign tax rates depletion the impairment of certain assets foreign sales corporation benefits and incremental state taxes 

  

discontinued operations  we recorded a loss from discontinued operations of 53 million 33 million after tax in 2002 for environmental remediation costs at sites of discontinued businesses for which we are responsible for environmental compliance see “environmental obligations” below and note 11 to our consolidated financial statement included in this form 10k for further details 

  

we recorded a loss from discontinued operations of 425 million 305 million after tax in 2001 included in this amount are earnings of technologies including interest expense of 112 million which was allocated to discontinued operations in accordance with accounting principles board statement no 30 “apb 30” and later relevant accounting guidance costs related to the spinoff and an additional income tax provision related to the reorganization of our worldwide entities in anticipation of the separation of technologies from fmc in addition we recorded a charge of 180 million for updated estimates of environmental remediation costs related to our other discontinued businesses 

  

net incomeloss we recorded net income of 658 million in 2002 compared to a net loss of 3377 million for 2001 this variance reflects 3231 million of asset impairments and 2804 million of restructuring and other charges recorded in 2001 net income in 2002 compared to 2001 excluding asset impairments and restructuring and other charges was lower due to lower sales in agricultural products and industrial chemicals somewhat offset at the earnings level by lower costs through savings from our recent restructuring activities we expect net income to be lower in 2003 compared to 2002 mostly due to increased interest expense as a result of our recent refinancing and poorer performance from astaris in a difficult phosphorus market see “liquidity and capital resources” 

  

other financial data 

  

capital expenditures totaled 839 million in 2002 compared to 1456 million in 2001 lower capital expenditures are the result of the lack of requirements for capital expansions and our continued focus on essential valuecreating projects also reducing capital expenditures was the lack of spending related to environmental assets at pocatello the need for continued spending on these environmental assets was eliminated in the fourth quarter of 2001 with the shutdown of pocatello 

  

the following are line items from our segment profit and loss statement used to reconcile segmentoperating profit to consolidated income from continuing operations before income taxes and the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle see note 18 to our consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k 

  

corporate expenses were 356 million in 2002 and 363 million in 2001 corporate expense represents shared costs that cannot be reasonably allocated among the segments 

  

other income and expense net is comprised primarily of lifo inventory adjustments and pension income or expense net other loss for the year was 04 million compared to a net other loss of 16 million in 2001 this variance is largely attributable to a lifo reserve adjustment offset by additional pension and postretirement expenses

agricultural products 

  

agricultural products revenue for the year ended december 31 2002 was 6151 million down 6 percent compared to 6531 million for the year ended december 31 2001 herbicide sales decreased to 1350 million in 2002 compared to 1636 million in 2001 mainly due to a planned reduction in sulfentrazone sales as we shift our focus from soybeans to higher value crops and poor weather conditions in north america insecticide sales were down slightly at 4801 million in 2002 compared to 4895 million in 2001 mostly due to weaker insecticide demand in asia from drought conditions in australia and channel inventory reductions somewhat offset by the development of new applications socalled “new labels” and higher pest infestation levels on cotton in north america a stronger demand and new applications in our nonagricultural markets such as turf ornamental and household pests also favorably affected sales in 2002 

  

earnings for the year ended december 31 2002 were 695 million compared to 728 million in the prior year lower herbicide sales and the absence of a 200 million profit protection payment from ei du pont de nemours and company “dupont” were more than offset by lower selling administrative and research costs see agricultural products under “segment results—2001 compared to 2000” 

  

earnings also reflect agricultural products’ continuing strategic refocusing on key geographic markets and crops and to realign our rd resources to our core strengths in insecticides related to these refocusing efforts were restructuring charges in both 2002 and 2001 in 2002 we recorded 47 million of restructuring charges for the idling and reorganization of our sulfentrazone plant in baltimore and to implement our new distribution strategy in europe in the fourth quarter of 2001 we recorded a 125 million charge to eliminate all herbicide discovery research as well to reduce our direct sales and support staff to align resources to key geographic markets and crops restructuring charges are not included in the results of our business segments see restructuring and other charges under “results of operations—december 31 2002 compare to december 31 2001” for further details 

  

we believe our agricultural products segment will continue to show improvement in 2003 through new labels sales growth from global alliances continued cost savings and our refocus strategy 

  

specialty chemicals 

  

specialty chemicals’ revenue for the year ended december 31 2002 was 4882 million up 3 percent from 4720 million in 2002 biopolymer revenue increased to 3552 million from 3412 million in 2001 reflecting a stronger pharmaceutical demand for microcrystalline cellulose for its use in binders and steady demand for carrageenan and microcrystalline cellulose in the food ingredients market partially offsetting increased revenue were lower alginate sales due to weaker industrial markets and an unfavorable carrageenan mix in food ingredients in lithium revenue performance was 1330 million in 2002 compared to 1308 million in 2001 a stronger organolithium performance in the pharmaceutical and specialty polymer markets and increased demand for energy storage materials for both rechargeable and nonrechargeable batteries were offset by lower exports of lithium salts to japan due to a weaker economy and the absence of a sale into the pharmaceutical markets which occurred the fourth quarter of 2001 

  

earnings of 898 million for the year ended december 31 2002 were 3 percent higher compared to 875 million for 2001 higher earnings can be attributed to higher sales from overall biopolymer growth a decrease in manufacturing costs in lithium due largely to the devaluation of the argentine peso and the absence of a 42 million 28 million after tax charge from the required change in accounting for amortization related to goodwill specialty chemicals’ goodwill was the direct result of biopolymer’s 1999 acquisition of pronova biopolymer as lithium’s earnings were also favorably impacted by higher butyllithium sales in addition the large pharmaceutical sale in lithium discussed above delivered a high margin sale in 2001 that was not repeated in 2002 

  

  

during 2002 our biopolymer business experienced profit pressures within the industrial markets it serves principally with its alginate product line as a result in 2002 we initiated a restructuring to reduce headcount and streamline production costs we believe that this action will further focus biopolymer’s commercial efforts on core high value markets including pharmaceutical formulation food ingredients and personal care we will focus our efforts on improving alginates profitability in 2003 by concentrating on higher value markets

industrial chemicals’ revenue was 7534 million for the year ended december 31 2002 down 8 percent compared to 8220 million in 2001 alkali revenue decreased to 3680 million in 2002 from 4025 million in 2001 due to lower overall volumes lower soda ash export prices and the first quarter 2002 sale of our sodium cyanide business a portion of the decline in soda ash revenues is attributable to the substitution by some of our industrial customers of caustic soda for soda ash which occurs when caustic prices decline substantially as they did in the first quarter of 2002 furthermore we experienced lower international sales volumes through the american natural soda ash association “ansac” a foreign sales association for us soda ash foret saw a decrease in revenue to 2225 million in the current year compared to 2438 million in 2001 reflecting lower phosphate sales due in part to the loss of a major european detergent customer and generally lower volumes and lower prices throughout its product lines somewhat offsetting decreased revenue at foret was the favorable translation effect of a stronger euro peroxygens hydrogen peroxide and active oxidants revenue decreased to 1629 million in 2002 from 1757 million in 2001 due to generally lower selling prices and lower persulfate volumes reflecting a depressed printed circuit board market increased hydrogen peroxide volumes in nonpulp markets along with stronger sales into the pulp markets in the second half of 2002 somewhat offset lower average selling prices and lower persulfate volumes 

  

overall we have maintained earnings levels recording 716 million of earnings in 2002 compared to 726 in the prior year relatively flat earnings on lower sales reflected lower material costs significant cost savings from our 2002 and 2001 restructuring efforts and lower operating costs related to reduced environmental compliance spending at pocatello 

  

reacting to market weakness in industrial chemicals in 2002 we recorded restructuring charges of 124 million to improve our cost position through reorganization changes and mothballing significant parts of our granger caustic facility and spring hill west virginia hydrogen peroxide facility during 2001 we recorded significant charges to impair and subsequently restructure our usbased phosphorus chemicals business total charges for 2001 included an impairment charge of 2242 million and restructuring and other charges of 2479 million segment earnings do not include these charges asset impairments and restructuring and other charges are not included in our business segment results see asset impairments and restructuring and other charges above and notes 5 and 6 to our consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k 

  

the restructuring of our usbased phosphorus chemicals business in late 2001 has allowed us to continue to improve our cost structure and competitive position as we move away from the production and sourcing of elemental phosphorus our usbased phosphorus chemicals business’s cost position should continue to improve as its ppa production increases the shutdown of pocatello also allowed fmc to eliminate capital spending on the environmental projects in 2002 and avoid significant startup and certain ongoing operating costs for environmental compliance issues at the site the restructuring activities in 2002 should improve our cost and competitive position in hydrogen peroxide from the mothballing at spring hill 

  

lower joint venture earnings at astaris and lower volumes and price throughout the segment offset the cost savings from our restructuring activities lower earnings from astaris were due to a 8 percent decrease in sales to 4457 million in 2002 from 4862 million in the prior year a decreased benefit from the former power resale contract with idaho power and higher than expected startup costs at astaris’s ppa plant were somewhat offset by lower sourcing costs the total resale power benefit to astaris in 2002 was approximately 12 million compared to approximately 34 million in 2001 this benefit will not continue in 2003 

  

we generally foresee minimal improvement in economic and competitive conditions within industrial chemicals in 2003 because of a deterioration at astaris resulting from increased competitive rivalry at astaris 

  

and the lack of any benefit from the power resale we expect that equity losses from this joint venture will offset the anticipated improved profit performance of other products in our industrial chemicals segment in 2003 furthermore we expect to make keepwell payments based on astaris’s 2003 performance 

  

results of operations—2001 compared to 2000 

  

revenue was 19430 million in 2001 down 5 percent from 20503 million in 2000 reflecting weaker demand from the industrial markets served by our industrial chemicals business segment and lower sulfentrazone sales in our agricultural products business segment 

  

asset impairments totaled 3231 million 2338 million after tax for 2001 compared to 101 million 62 million after tax in 2000 

  

industrial chemicals recorded an impairment charge of 2242 million in 2001 a charge of 123 million was for the impairment of assets in our sodium cyanide operations and 2119 million was for the impairment of our usbased phosphorus business 

  

we recorded an impairment charge of 989 million related to our specialty chemicals segment’s lithium operations in argentina we established this operation which includes a lithium mine and processing facilities approximately five years ago in a remote area of the andes mountains see asset impairments under “results of operations—2002 compared to 2001” above for further details related to these charges 

  

during 2000 we recorded asset impairments of 101 million 62 million after tax impairments of 90 million were recognized because of the formation of astaris including the writedown of certain phosphorus assets retained by our company and the accrual of costs related to our planned closure of two phosphorus facilities other asset impairments were due to the impact of underlying changes within the specialty chemicals segment 

  

restructuring and other charges a change in market conditions and in our corporate strategy resulted in restructuring and other charges of 2804 million 1721 million after tax in 2001 a charge of 352 million 217 million after tax was recorded in 2000 

  

industrial chemicals recorded restructuring and other charges of 2479 million in 2001 the majority of this charge 2417 million was for restructuring and other charges associated with our usbased phosphorus operation the balance of this charge 62 million was for restructuring activities at several sites including 57 million for the mothballing of our granger soda ash facility 

  

also in 2001 we recorded 125 million of severance and other costs related to our agricultural products segment as a result of our decision to refocus certain rd activities the majority of the spending related to these charges occurred in 2002 

  

of the remaining 2001 charges 200 million related to corporate reorganization costs due to the spinoff of technologies and to several minor reorganization costs in our specialty chemicals segment the majority of the spending related to these charges occurred in 2001 and the first half of 2002 

  

we reduced our workforce by approximately 320 people in connection with our 2001 restructuring activities the majority of which occurred within the same year 

  

during 2000 we recorded restructuring and other charges of 352 million 217 million after tax restructuring charges of 206 million were attributable to the formation of astaris and the concurrent reorganization of our industrial chemicals sales marketing and support organizations the reduction of office space requirements in our philadelphia chemical headquarters and pension expense related to the separation of phosphorus personnel from our company in addition we recorded 125 million of environmental charges from increased cost estimates for ongoing remediation of several phosphorus properties other restructuring charges included 21 million for other projects of the approximately 350 employee severances that were expected to occur through the completion of these programs in 2000 281 occurred at december 31 2000 while the remainder occurred in 2001 

  

  

interest expense net in 2001 was 583 million compared to 618 million in 2000 the decrease in net interest expense in 2001 was primarily the result of lower average debt levels during the year 

  

incomeloss from continuing operations was a loss of 3063 million in 2001 compared to income of 1256 million in 2000 most of the decline can be attributed to asset impairments and restructuring and other charges of 6035 million 4059 million after tax in 2001 compared to charges of 453 million 279 million after tax in 2000 also contributing to the decline were poor economic conditions affecting the chemical industry worldwide 

  

provisionbenefit for income taxes we recorded an income tax benefit of 1666 million in 2001 resulting in an effective tax rate of 352 percent compared to income tax expense of 330 million and an effective tax rate of 208 percent in 2000 

  

discontinued operations we recorded a loss from discontinued operations of 425 million 305 million after tax in 2001 included in this amount is a loss from technologies of 196 million and a charge of 180 million for updated estimates of environmental remediation costs related to our other discontinued businesses 

  

during 2000 we recorded a loss from discontinued operations of 177 million 150 million after tax of this amount 640 million were from the earnings of the spunoff technologies offset by an 800 million loss for a settlement of litigation related to our discontinued defense systems business 

  

net incomeloss we recorded a net loss of 3377 million for 2001 compared to net income of 1106 million in 2000 this variance reflects the effect of significant asset impairments and restructuring and other charges recorded in 2001 

  

other financial data 

  

capital expenditures were 1456 million in 2001 compared to 1973 million in 2000 decreased capital expenditures in 2001 reflected lower spending related to environmental assets at pocatello the need for these environmental assets was eliminated in the fourth quarter of 2001 with the shutdown of pocatello 

  

the following are line items from our segment profit and loss statement used to reconcile segmentoperating profit to income from continuing operations before income taxes and the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle see note 18 to our consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k 

  

corporate expenses were 363 million in 2001 and 362 million in 2000 corporate expense represents shared costs of the segments that cannot be reasonably allocated 

  

other income and expense net is comprised primarily of lifo inventory adjustments and pension income or expense net other expense for the year was 16 million compared to net other income of 96 million in 2000 this variance is largely attributable to increased pension costs and lower amortization of a deferred pension asset 

  

segment results—2001 compared to 2000 

  

segment operating profit is presented before income taxes asset impairments restructuring and other charges interest expense net and other income and expense net information about how each of these items relates to our businesses at the segment level and results by segment are discussed below and in note 18 to our consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k 

  

agricultural products 

  

agricultural products revenue decreased to 6531 million in 2001 from 6647 million in 2000 agricultural products segment operating profit declined to 728 million down 17 percent from 2000 

  

herbicides revenue decreased 7 percent to 1636 million in 2001 compared to 1759 million in 2000 reflecting the lack of sulfentrazone sales to dupont in 2001 herbicide sales were down reflecting these lower sulfentrazone sales however earnings in 2001 included a onetime profit protection payment from dupont of 20 million see below excluding this payment segment operating profit decreased 40 percent in 2001 total 

  

sulfentrazone sales to dupont were 162 million in 2000 insecticide revenue totaled 4895 million in 2001 compared to 4888 million in 2000 the insecticide revenue decrease was mostly due to weakness in asian and latin american markets 

  

in 1998 we entered into an exclusive agreement with dupont to provide them sulfentrazone in north america for use on soybeans however the sale of formulated products incorporating sulfentrazone did not reach expectations and the contract purchases were cancelled in 2001 dupont no longer has exclusive rights to the use of sulfentrazone on soybeans in north america we began developing new markets in 2001 expanding our sulfentrazone sales including sales into the north america soybean market we believe that we have recovered approximately one third of the sulfentrazone volumes lost from the absence of dupont’s purchases 

  

during the fourth quarter of 2001 agricultural products began a restructuring of its operations to focus on key markets and products a restructuring charge of 125 million 78 million after tax was taken in 2001 to support these plans 

  

specialty chemicals 

  

specialty chemicals revenue was 4720 million in 2001 down from 4888 million in 2000 due to lower revenue in both biopolymer and lithium specialty chemicals segment operating profit declined to 875 million or 5 percent from 924 million in the prior year biopolymer revenue decreased to 3412 million in 2001 compared to 3508 million in 2000 due to a combination of a weaker euro weaker demand from customer inventory corrections and lower selling prices for alginates and carrageenan in specialty markets lithium revenue decreased to 1308 million in 2001 from 1380 million in 2000 resulting from our strategic exit from the commodity lithium carbonate market and slower industrial markets particularly in europe 

  

industrial chemicals 

  

industrial chemicals revenue decreased to 8220 million in 2001 down 9 percent compared to 9056 million in 2000 industrial chemicals’ segment operating profit declined by 366 percent to 726 million in 2001 from 1145 million in 2000 

  

alkali revenue was relatively flat in 2001 at 4025 million compared to 4020 million in the prior year peroxygens revenue hydrogen peroxide and active oxidants of 1757 million in 2001 compared to 1892 million in 2000 was down despite the price increases initiated in late 2000 and the application of an energy surcharge in early 2001 foret our spanish operation recorded revenue of 2438 million compared to 2352 million in 2000 reflecting strong phosphate and zeolite markets 

  

the 2001 and 2000 revenue comparison was further affected by the inclusion of sales from our usbased phosphorus chemicals business in the first three months of 2000 which totaled 792 million subsequent to march of 2000 us phosphorus chemical sales have been deconsolidated and reflected through our equity investment in astaris 

  

lower operating profit reflected economic weakness during the year increased power costs consent decree spending at pocatello and the ppa plant startup costs 

  

during 2001 we continued to execute our business plan for our industrial chemicals business segment which included significant restructuring activities as well as our continued review of longterm assets for impairment the goal was to mitigate the future effects of the anticipated economic slowdown as well as prepare the business for longterm growth while maximizing cash generation asset impairments totaled 2242 million and restructuring and other charges related to these activities totaled 2479 million in 2001 restructuring and other charges included 965 million for restructuring activities in our usbased phosphorus chemicals and cyanide businesses and 1514 million of other charges related to our usbased phosphorus chemicals business 

  

new accounting standards adopted 

  

on january 1 2002 we adopted sfas no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” for further discussion of the effect of this recently adopted standard see note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k

new accounting standards 

  

in june 2001 the fasb issued sfas no 143 “accounting for asset retirement obligations” sfas no 143 addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible longlived assets and the associated asset retirement costs we expect to adopt the provisions of this pronouncement in 2003 as required the effects of adoption if any are currently being evaluated

environmental obligations 

  

our company like other industrial manufacturers is involved with a variety of environmental matters in the ordinary course of conducting its business and is subject to federal state and local environmental laws we believe strongly that we have a responsibility to protect the environment public health and employee safety this responsibility includes cooperating with other parties to resolve issues created by past and present handling of wastes 

  

when issues arise including notices from the epa or other government agencies identifying our company as a prp our environmental remediation management assesses and manages the issues when necessary we use multifunctional teams composed of environmental legal financial and communications personnel to ensure that our actions are consistent with our responsibilities to the environment and public health as well as to our employees and shareholders 

  

we provided environmental provisions totaling 102 million in 2002 this included charges related to environmental sites of discontinued businesses and continuing operating sights in 2001 we provided 688 million of environmental provisions related to operating and discontinued sites of which 474 million was for additional remediation related to the shutdown of pocatello in the second quarter of 2000 we provided environmental provisions totaling 125 million related to ongoing remediation of several phosphorus properties 

  

additional information regarding our environmental accounting policies and environmental liabilities is included in “application of critical accounting policies” and notes 1 and 11 respectively to our consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k information regarding environmental obligations associated with our discontinued operations is included in note 11 to our consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k estimates of 2002 environmental spending are included in “liquidity and capital resources” 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

  

during 2002 we strengthened our liquidity position and obtained adequate capital resources for planned business operations by completing a series of financing transactions 

  

on june 12 2002 we issued 325 million shares of common stock and used the net proceeds of 1013 million to reduce amounts borrowed under our 2400 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility this was the first step in a refinancing plan in which we intended subsequently to issue unsecured bonds and renew and extend the maturity of our 2400 million revolving credit facility 

  

in june 2003 subsequent to the completion of our common stock offering moody’s lowered its rating of our longterm debt from baa3 to ba1 moody’s rating of baa3 is the tenth level from the top of its ratings scale comprised of twenty longterm debt ratings its downgrade of our longterm debt rating by one level to ba1 or the eleventh of twenty ratings was from its lowest investmentgrade rating to the highest level of the noninvestmentgrade category moody’s also lowered its rating of our shortterm debt from p3 to np the fourth level from the top of its fivelevel shortterm debt ratings scale subsequent to these actions by moody’s we ceased offerings under our commercial paper program and repaid maturities through borrowings under our 2400 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility also resulting from the downgrade in our credit ratings availability decreased under our former accounts receivable securitization program which was offset by increased borrowings under our 2400 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility the ratings downgrades resulted in several changes to our refinancing plan 

  

  

on october 21 2002 we completed a refinancing in which we issued 3550 million aggregate principal amount of 1025 percent senior secured notes due 2009 the “notes” at a discount of 44 million simultaneously we entered into a new 5000 million senior secured credit agreement the “credit agreement” which provides for a 2500 million revolving credit facility and a 2500 million term loan facility and obtained a 400 million supplemental secured standby letter of credit facility the “supplemental letter of credit facility” and together with the credit agreement the “credit facilities” on october 21 2002 we obtained 2449 million net of discounts from the credit agreement’s term loan facility the net proceeds from the sale of the notes and borrowings under the credit agreement totaling 5955 million were used to 

  

   

   

   

   

the supplemental letter of credit facility was utilized in connection with our refinancing to provide letters of credit totaling 399 million in support of selfinsurance programs and environmental obligations 

  

among other restrictions the credit facilities contain financial covenants related to leverage measured as the ratio of adjusted earnings to debt interest coverage measured as the ratio of interest expense to adjusted earnings consolidated net worth and capital spending we were in compliance with all debt covenants at december 31 2002 see note 10 of our consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k for a summary of the terms for both the notes and the new credit facilities 

  

prior to the completion of our refinancing we obtained funding through an accounts receivable securitization program we sold receivables without recourse through our wholly owned bankruptcyremote subsidiary fmc funding corporation which then sold the receivables to an unrelated finance company the sold receivables and repurchase obligations related to the securitization program were not recorded on our consolidated balance sheet the accounting for our former accounts receivable securitization program was in accordance with the requirements of sfas no 140 “accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishment of liabilities” the transfer of accounts receivable qualified as a sale under the provisions of sfas no 140 as a result of our surrender of control of these financial assets without recourse in exchange for cash accordingly we recorded a reduction of accounts receivable equal to the total amount of cash received from fmc funding corporation in connection with the transaction the downgrade of our longterm debt rating by moody’s in june 2002 reduced the funds available to us from this program funds from the accounts receivable securitization totaled 790 million at december 31 2001 on october 21 2002 we terminated our accounts receivable securitization program with proceeds from our new financing 

  

we maintained a 2400 million committed revolving credit facility that was scheduled to expire in december 2002 the total amount outstanding under this facility at december 31 2001 was 680 million in january 2002 we obtained a supplemental 500 million committed credit facility to meet shortterm seasonal financing needs in august 2002 this supplemental credit facility was amended to reduce its availability to 250 million and to extend its maturity to october 31 2002 upon completion of our refinancing we repaid 

  

outstanding borrowings of 1361 million and terminated the 2400 million revolving credit facility with the proceeds from our refinancing we also terminated the supplemental credit facility under which there were no outstanding borrowings when terminated 

  

at december 31 2002 we had total debt of 12670 million compared to debt of 9235 million as of december 31 2001 this included 643 million of shortterm debt at december 31 2002 comprised almost entirely of foreign borrowings compared to 1365 million at december 31 2001 there were no revolving credit borrowings outstanding under our new credit agreement at december 31 2002 

  

during 2002 significant events affecting our liquidity included 

  

spending against restructuring and other reserves of 918 million including paying 323 million for the shutdown and remediation our pocatello plant paying 1316 million for scheduled maturities and for redemptions of longterm debt paying 325 million to redeem all of the outstanding 675 percent exchangeable senior subordinated debentures redeeming 171 million of our 6375 percent debentures due september 2003 and issuing 325 million shares of common stock with net proceeds of 1013 million 

  

cash and cash equivalents at december 31 2002 and december 31 2001 were 896 million and 234 million respectively 

  

cash provided by operating activities was 1362 million for the year ended december 31 2002 compared to cash required by operating activities of 529 million in 2001 and cash provided by operating activities of 2724 million in 2000 historically cash flows from operating activities have funded a substantial portion of our cash requirements in 2002 and 2001 cash from operating activities was reduced by the net cash impact of spending related to our restructuring and other charges included in our operating cash activities in 2002 is 638 million for spending on restructuring and other activities including 323 million for the shutdown and remediation of pocatello the future spending against restructuring reserves related to the pocatello shutdown of 530 million at december 2002 is expected to continue through 2007 with progressively less spent in each of the future years accounts payable and accrued liabilities decreased significantly in 2002 reflecting lower business activity including lower inventory in 2002 than in 2001 also favorably affecting our 2002 cash provided by operating activities was improved collections of accounts receivable especially within agricultural products particularly in latin america 

  

cash required by discontinued operations for the twelve months ended december 31 2002 2001 and 2000 was 296 million 1119 million and 501 million respectively the majority of the spending for our discontinued operations is for environmental remediation on discontinued sites and postemployment benefits for former employees of discontinued businesses in the first quarter of 2001 the company made an 800 million payment for the settlement of litigation related to our discontinued defense systems business 

  

cash required by investing activities was 1108 million 1696 million and 974 million for the years ended december 31 2002 2001 and 2000 respectively the majority of this spending related to capital additions to our property plant and equipment to maintain operating standards and comply with environmental health and safety regulations also included in investing activities are keepwells to astaris of 296 million and 313 million for 2002 and 2001 respectively a planned reduction in capital spending in 2002 compared to 2001 contributed to the decline in cash required by investing activities additionally 2001 included approximately 43 million for spending on environmental remediation assets at pocatello the fourth quarter 2001 decision to shut down pocatello enabled us to curtail this spending cash required by investing activities in 2000 was reduced by a net cash distribution by astaris to fmc of 888 million 

  

cash provided by financing activities for 2002 of 658 million decreased by 2713 million when compared to cash provided by financing activities of 3467 million in 2001 our 2002 financing activities included a net increase in longterm debt of 3841 million from net proceeds of our refinancing of 5955 million the current year’s activity also reflects 1812 million paid to redeem longterm debt a 378 million decrease in our vendor 

  

financing and 650 million paid to terminate our accounts receivable securitization program in october 2002 this program had an outstanding balance of 790 million at december 31 2001 our longterm debt repayments included payments of 104 million 250 million and 995 million respectively in the first second and fourth quarters of 2002 for scheduled maturities the redemption of 171 million aggregate principal amount of our 637 percent debentures due september 2003 and several other minor maturities we also made payments of 325 million to redeem all outstanding 675 percent exchangeable senior subordinated debentures financing sources included 1013 million net of issuance costs from the issuance of 325 million shares of common stock in the second quarter of 2002 which was used to reduce outstanding borrowings under our former 2400 million revolving credit facility which was terminated upon the completion of our refinancing in october 2002 our 2001 financing activities included 4307 million from the ipo of technologies net of contributions to technologies to support their operating cash needs 

  

commitments and other potential liquidity needs 

  

our 2003 cash needs include operating cash requirements capital expenditures scheduled maturities of longterm debt equity contributions to astaris an expected contingent payment due at yearend 2003 related to the acquisition of tg soda ash environmental spending and restructuring spending we plan to meet these liquidity needs through cash generated from operations and borrowings under the new credit agreement 

  

we have provided an agreement to lenders of astaris under which we have agreed to make equity contributions to astaris sufficient to make up onehalf of shortfalls in astaris’s earnings below certain levels astaris’s earnings did not meet the agreed levels for 2002 and 2001 and we do not expect that such earnings will meet the levels agreed for 2003 we contributed 296 million to astaris under this arrangement in 2002 and 313 million in 2001 we expect our equity contributions to astaris in 2003 to be between 35 million and 50 million the proportional amount of astaris’s indebtedness subject to this agreement from fmc was approximately 840 million at december 31 2002 in 2002 certain amendments to the agreement under which fmc makes equity contributions to astaris that were necessary to complete our refinancing were obtained from astaris’s lenders 

  

on june 30 1999 we acquired tg soda ash inc from elf atochem north america inc for approximately 510 million in cash and a contingent payment due at yearend 2003 the contingent payment amount which will be based on the financial performance of the combined soda ash operations between 2001 and 2003 cannot currently be determined precisely but is expected to be in the range of 400 million to 450 million 

  

projected 2003 spending also includes approximately 50 million of environmental remediation spending of which 25 million relates to pocatello and 25 million for other operating and discontinued business sites this spending does not include expected spending of approximately 7 million and 9 million in 2003 and 2004 respectively on capital projects relating to environmental control facilities also we expect to spend in the range of approximately 20 million to 25 million annually in 2003 and in 2004 for environmental compliance costs which are an operating cost of the company and are not covered by established reserves 

  

other commitments that could affect our liquidity include the following 

  

in connection with the spinoff of technologies we retained liability for various contingent obligations totaling 2890 million at december 31 2001 contractual releases obtained by fmc have reduced this amount to 145 million at december 31 2002 we expect this amount to decline further in 2003 contingent obligations include guarantees of the performance of technologies under various customer contracts reimbursements on behalf of technologies under letters of credit and guarantees of indebtedness of technologies we have a guaranty agreement from technologies providing for reimbursement to us if we are ever called upon to satisfy these obligations because of our expectation that the underlying obligations will be met and the existence of the guarantee from technologies we believe it is unlikely that we would have to pay any of these contingent obligations 

  

  

in the ordinary course of business we provide credit enhancements to governmental agencies insurance companies and others for our environmental obligations selfinsurance programs and other future business commitments as part of our refinancing we funded 1308 million into a restricted cash collateral account to provide for future cash collateralization of a portion of these obligations additionally we obtained 399 million of standby letters of credit under our supplemental letter of credit facility 

  

at december 31 2002 there was 410 million principal amount outstanding of variable rate industrial and pollution control revenue bonds supported by 434 million in bank letters of credit subsequent to december 31 2002 as part of our refinancing we obtained sufficient cash to collateralize fully these letters of credit 

  

we provide parent guarantees to lending institutions providing credit to our foreign subsidiaries the outstanding amounts of debt guaranteed were 643 million and 685 million respectively at december 31 2002 and 2001 

  

we provide guarantees to financial institutions on behalf of certain agricultural products customers in brazil for their seasonal borrowing needs the customers’ obligations to us are largely secured by liens on their crops the total of these guarantees at december 31 2002 was 182 million compared to 560 million at december 31 2001 we also provide guarantees to financial institutions on behalf of certain agricultural products customers in brazil to support their importation of thirdparty agricultural products these guarantees totaled 45 million and 100 million december 31 2002 and at december 31 2001 respectively 

  

our total significant committed contracts that we believe will affect cash over the next five years and beyond are as follows 

  

       

dividends 

  

on november 29 2001 our board of directors approved the spinoff of the remaining 83 percent of technologies making it an independent publicly traded company the spinoff qualified as a taxfree distribution to us stockholders stockholders of record as of december 31 2001 received approximately 172 shares of common stock of the new company for every 10 share of our stock fractional shares were paid in cash to stockholders in lieu of fractional shares on december 31 2001 

  

no cash dividends were paid in 2002 no cash dividends were paid in 2001 other than amounts paid in lieu of fractional shares as discussed above no cash dividends were paid in 2000 no cash dividends are expected to be paid in 2003 

  

  

item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

our earnings cash flows and financial position are exposed to market risks relating to fluctuations in commodity prices and foreign currency exchange rates it is our policy to minimize cash flow exposure to changes in currency and exchange rates through a controlled program of risk management by entering into derivative contracts with major financial institutions 

  

the analysis below presents the sensitivity of the market value of our financial instruments to selected changes in market rates and prices the range of changes chosen reflects our view of changes which are reasonably possible over a oneyear period market values are the present value of projected future cash flows based on the market rates and prices chosen the market value foreign currency risk is calculated by us using a thirdparty software model which uses standard pricing models to determine the present value of the instruments based on market conditions spot and forward exchange rates as of the valuation date the market value energy price risk is calculated by a third party 

  

at december 31 2002 and december 31 2001 our net financial instrument position was a net liability of 57 million and 259 million respectively the change in the net financial instrument position was due to improved positions in our natural gas forward contracts due to increased energy prices somewhat offset by favorable foreign currency forward contracts against a strengthening euro 

  

interest rate risk 

  

our debt portfolio at december 31 2002 is composed of 74 percent fixedrate debt and 26 percent variablerate debt the largest portion of our variable rate debt is from our 2500 million term loan facility which was outstanding for approximately two months in 2002 the majority of our debt portfolio at december 31 2001 was composed of fixedrate debt changes in interest rates have different impacts on the variablerate portions of our debt portfolio a change in interest rates on the variable portion of the debt portfolio impacts the interest incurred and cash flows but does not impact the net financial instrument position 

  

based on the variablerate debt included in our debt portfolio as of december 31 2002 and 2001 a 100 basis point increase or decrease in


 interest rates would not significantly affect net income in either year 

  

commodity price risk 

  

energy costs are approximately 8 percent of our cost of sales and services we attempt to mitigate our exposure to increasing energy costs by hedging the cost of natural gas below is a sensitivity analysis reflecting the effect of changing energy prices 

  

the sensitivity analysis assumes an instantaneous 10 percent change in natural gas prices from their levels at december 31 2002 and december 31 2001 with all other variables including interest rates held constant a 10 percent increase in new york mercantile exchange “nymx” prices would result in a decrease of 62 million in the net liability position of the relevant financial instruments into a net asset position at december 31 2002 and decrease of 52 million in the net liability position of the relevant financial instruments at december 31 2001 a 10 percent decrease in nymx prices would result in increases of 43 million and 75 million in the net liability position of the relevant financial instruments at december 31 2002 and december 31 2001 respectively 

  

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

  

the primary currencies for which we have exchange rate exposure are the us dollar versus the euro the euro versus the norwegian krone the us dollar versus the japanese yen and the us dollar versus the brazilian real foreign currency debt and foreign exchangeforward contracts are used in countries where we do business thereby reducing our net asset exposure foreign exchange forward contracts are also used to hedge firm and highly anticipated foreign currency cash flows below is a sensitivity analysis reflecting the effect of changing foreign currency rates 

  

the sensitivity analysis assumes an instantaneous 10 percent change in the foreign currency exchange rates from their levels at december 31 2002 and december 31 2001 with all other variables including interest rates held constant a 10 percent strengthening of hedged currencies versus our functional currencies would result in a increase of 86 million in the net liability position and a decrease of 75 million in the net asset position into a net liability of the relevant financial instruments at december 31 2002 and december 31 2001 respectively a 10 percent weakening of hedged currencies versus our functional currencies would result in a decrease of 82 million in the net liability position into a net asset position of the relevant financial instruments at december 31 2002 and an increase of 80 million in the net asset position of the relevant financial instruments at december 31 2002 and december 31 2001

at the time was a whollyowned subsidiary of fmc the company completed an
initial public offering of approximately 17 of technologies stock in june
2001 and completed the separation on december 31 2001 by distributing all
remaining shares of technologies owned by fmc as a taxfree dividend to its
stockholders the majority of historical data in this report regarding the
companys financial condition or results of operations have been reclassified
to reflect the separation of technologies businesses

financial information about industry segments

   see note 20 in the companys 2001 consolidated financial statements at pages
64 through 66 of this report which is incorporated herein by reference

general description of the business segments

   the following is a description of the companys three business segments

  agricultural products

   the majority of agricultural product sales are from insecticide chemistries
including carbamates and pyrethroids the remaining sales are from herbicides
including clomazone and the newer chemistries of sulfentrazone and
carfentrazone key crops for fmc include cotton corn fruits rice and
vegetables this segment has a leading global position in pyrethroid chemistry
and a portfolio of commercialized herbicides with growth opportunities

worldwide market conditions direct distribution in key markets solid product
stewardship programs and focused research and development rd

                                      2

page

   agricultural products is a business characterized by rd innovation in order
to both grow and maintain share in an increasingly competitive market the
development of innovative rd and market access programs has been and will
continue to be essential fmc has a focused strategy to

    gain near term growth through label expansions in carfentrazone and newer
     generation pyrethroids

    develop novel insecticide chemistry in a strategic alliance with ishihara
     sangyo kaisha ltd isk for use on certain pests in the americas

    expand a leading genomicsbased research program in a strategic alliance
     with devgen to identify target specific insect sites and chemistries and

    focus our sales and marketing organization in the americas and expand
     market access abroad through regional alliances in europe and asia

  specialty chemicals

   biopolymer and lithiumbased operations make up the specialty chemicals
segments biopolymer provides products that add structure texture and taste to
a wide range of beverage dairy meat and lowfat products as well as act as
binders and disintegrants for dry tablet drugs lithium is a technologybased
business in which mined lithium is refined into many end uses including
pharmaceutical synthesis and energy storage in batteries

   specialty chemicals has leading or significant positions in alginates
carrageenan microcrystalline cellulose and lithiumbased products this
segments customers consist primarily of industrial companies engaged in the
food pharmaceutical and specialty additives businesses remaining sales are to
the personal care dental industrial and energy storage markets

   the ongoing strength of specialty chemicals is the development of
customerfocused solutions and new product concepts key elements include plans
to

    grow market share with large food and pharmaceutical firms as their
     partner for developing new food categories and innovative drugs

    explore complementary technologies that could further enhance the product
     offering of the food and pharmaceutical franchises

    focus on high valueadded applications for lithium specialties and
     continue to exit more commoditylike markets and

    invest in large market potential opportunities for lithium including
     hybrid electric vehicles and concrete restoration

  industrial chemicals

   industrial chemicals sales comprise several products soda ash peroxygens
hydrogen peroxide and active oxidants and phosphorus fmcs alkali chemicals
division manufactures soda ash and related derivatives for the us and asian
glass detergents and chemicals markets fmc is the largest producer in the
world of natural soda ash and has enjoyed strong growth outside the us based
upon the superior cost economics of naturally occurring soda ash from green
river wyoming versus synthetic soda ash produced abroad

   sales of peroxygens including hydrogen peroxide and specialty derivatives
make up approximately 25 of industrial chemicals sales fmc is the market
leader in the us for hydrogen peroxide and is the worldwide leader in the
specialty markets for persulfates and peracetic acid the array of enduse
markets served includes pulp and paper polymers electronics and food

   fmc is a 50 owner of a joint venture with solutia inc in phosphorus
chemicals astaris llc astaris astaris offers a wide range of phosphorus
compounds for markets ranging from agriculture to detergents during late 2001
astaris undertook significant restructuring of its supply chain to move away
from production of elemental phosphorus to lower cost purified phosphoric acid

                                      3

page

   fmcs european industrial chemicals subsidiary foret leverages its strong
brand name in southern europe to provide sulfur derivatives peroxygens and
phosphorus products to europe africa and the middle east

   the focus of industrial chemicals is toward maximizing cash generation
through cost reduction initiatives and prudent capital management the segment
has three key strategies

    focus on the development of new and innovative process and mining
     technologies to continue to lower unit production costs

    manage capacity effectively in order to keep utilization rates high and
     control fixed costs and

    shift commercial resources towards the development of specialty niches
     that have few competitive alternatives and higher corresponding margins

source and availability of raw materials

   fmcs raw material requirements vary by business segment and include mineral
related natural resources processed chemicals seaweed and energy sources
such as oil gas coal and electricity generated by hydroelectric and nuclear
power

   ores used in industrial chemicals manufacturing processes such as trona
are extracted from mines in the united states on property held by fmc under
longterm leases subject to periodic adjustment of royalty rates raw materials
used by specialty chemicals include lithium carbonate which is obtained from a
south american manufacturer under a longterm sourcing agreement alginates and
carrageenan which are derived from various types of seaweed that are sourced
by the company on a global basis and wood pulp which is purchased from several
north american producers raw materials used by agricultural products
primarily processed chemicals are obtained from worldwide sources

   the company does not use single source suppliers for the majority of its raw
material purchases and believes the available supplies of raw materials are
adequate

patents

   fmc owns a number of us and foreign patents trademarks and licenses that
are cumulatively important to its business fmc does not believe that the loss
of any one or group of related patents trademarks or licenses would have a
material adverse effect on the overall business of fmc

seasonality

   the seasonal nature of the crop protection market and the geographic spread
of the agricultural products business generally produce stronger earnings in
the second and third quarters agricultural products sold into the northern
hemisphere north america europe and parts of asia serve seasonal
agricultural markets from march through september while markets in the
southern hemisphere latin america parts of asia and australia are served
from july through december

   the remainder of fmcs businesses is generally not subject to significant
seasonal fluctuations

competitive conditions

   fmc encounters substantial competition in each of its three business
segments this competition is expected to continue in both the united states
and markets outside the united states fmc markets its products through its own
sales organization and through independent distributors and sales
representatives the number of the companys principal competitors varies from
segment to segment in general fmc competes by operating in a costefficient
manner and by leveraging its industry experience to provide advanced
technology high product quality and reliability and quality customer and
technical service

                                      4

   fmcs agricultural products segment competes in the global crop protection
market for insecticides and herbicides the industry is characterized by a
small number of large competitors and a large number of smaller often regional
competitors such as fmc industry products include crop protection chemicals
and for major competitors genetically engineered crop biotechnology
products competition from generic producers has increased as a significant
number of product patents have expired in the last decade in general fmc
competes as a product innovator by focusing on insecticide discovery and
development and licensing products from alliance partners when the products
complement fmcs product portfolio fmc also differentiates itself by reacting
quickly in key markets establishing effective product stewardship programs
and developing strategic alliances which strengthen market access in key
countries

   with leading or significant positions in markets that include alginate
carrageenan microcrystalline cellulose and lithiumbased products specialty
chemicals competes on the basis of product differentiation customer service
and price biopolymer competes with both direct suppliers of cellulose and
seaweed extract as well as suppliers of other hydrocolloids which may provide
similar functionality in specific applications in cellulose competitors are
typically smaller than fmc while in seaweed extracts fmc competes with other
broadbased chemical companies both of fmcs two most significant competitors
in lithium each extract the element from naturally occurring lithiumrich
brines located in the andes mountains of argentina and chile which are believed
to be the worlds most significant and lowest cost sources of lithium

   industrial chemicals serves the alkali hydrogen peroxide and phosphorus
markets predominantly in the united states and to a lesser extent europe the
alkali chemicals division is the worlds largest producer of natural soda ash
in north america the soda ash business competes with five domestic producers
of natural soda ash three of which operate in the vicinity of our mine and
processing facility in green river wyoming outside of north america and
europe fmc sells soda ash through american natural soda ash corporation
ansac a foreign sales association organized under the webbpomerene act
internationally fmcs natural soda ash competes with synthetic soda ash
manufactured by numerous producers ranging from integrated multinational
companies to smaller regional players the hydrogen peroxide division maintains
a leading position in the north american market for hydrogen peroxide there
are currently five firms competing in the hydrogen peroxide market in north
america the primary competitive factor affecting the sales of soda ash and
hydrogen peroxide is price fmc seeks to maintain its competitive position by
employing low cost processing technology at foret fmc possesses a strong cost
and market position in phosphates perborates peroxygens zeolites and sulfur
derivatives in each of these markets fmc faces significant competition from a
range of multinational and regional chemical producers fmc participates in the
phosphorus business in the united states through astaris fmcs joint venture
with solutia inc astaris competes primarily with rhodia which is the only
other global producer competing with astaris across a wide variety of
phosphorus chemicals in the north american market competition in phosphorus is
based primarily on price and product differentiation through customer service

item 7  managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and
         results of operations

the reorganization of our company

   we implemented our plan to split fmc into separate chemical and machinery
companies in 2001 through a twostep process the first step included an
initial public offering ipo of 17 percent of our machinery businesses
named fmc technologies inc technologies which took place in the second
quarter of 2001 technologies consists of our former energy systems and food
and transportation systems business segments subsequent to the ipo
technologies made payments of 4801 million to our company in exchange for the
net assets distributed to technologies on june 1 2001 which we used to retire
shortterm and longterm debt the second step the distribution of our
remaining 83 percent ownership in technologies the spinoff occurred on
december 31 2001 total net assets distributed on december 31 2001 were
5095 million

   we believe that the spinoff of technologies will allow our company to focus
its efforts in the chemical industry through improved customer orientation
increased innovation and overall growth in an effort to align our business
with our future growth plans we took various strategic measures including the
restructuring of businesses reduction of staff plant shutdowns and the
writedown of certain underperforming assets we believe these steps will
increase our companys financial flexibility as market conditions change

risk and our significant accounting policies

   as would be expected these changes in our company have altered our overall
risk environment as described below and elsewhere in this report

   in addition to risk factors we have also identified and reviewed our
significant accounting policies all of which are described in note 1 to our
consolidated financial statements while noting that the preparation of
financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and
assumptions that require judgment these estimates and assumptions can
significantly affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and
expenses at the date of our financial statements and for the reporting periods
shown our disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our
financial statements are similarly affected by estimates and assumptions

                                      10

page

   some of these accounting estimates and assumptions are particularly
sensitive because of their significance to our consolidated financial
statements and because of the possibility that future events affecting them may
differ markedly from what had been assumed when the financial statements were
prepared

   for example we provide for environmental related obligations when they are
believed to be probable and amounts can be reasonably estimated also we
review the recoverability of the net book values of our investments in
affiliates and our fixed and intangible assets whenever events or
circumstances suggest that the net book value of these assets may not be
recoverable when this is the case we record an impairment loss we also
continually assess the return on our business segments which sometimes results
in a plan to restructure the operations of a business when such a plan is
final we record an accrual for severance and other contractual commitments and
obligations finally our reserves for discontinued operations consist of
obligations for discontinued operations for environmental remediation and
study obligations from some of our former chemical plant sites and product
liabilities and other potential claims including those related to retiree
medical and life insurance benefits see a further discussion on all of the
policies in notes 1 3 6 7 11 12 and 13 to our consolidated financial
statements

results of operations

  general

   all results discussed in this analysis address the continuing operations of
our chemical businesses technologies results have been reclassified to
discontinued operations within our consolidated statements of income and
consolidated statements of cash flows for the periods ended december 31 2001
2000 and 1999 accordingly the results of the energy systems and food and
transportation systems business segments will not be included in the results of
operations discussion and analysis

   our loss from continuing operations for the year ended december 31 2001
was 3063 million compared to income of 1256 million and 1587 million in
2000 and 1999 respectively income from continuing operations before
cumulative effect of change in accounting principle excluding special items
defined below for the year ended december 31 2001 was 996 million compared
to 1535 million and 1320 million in 2000 and 1999 respectively special
items in 2001 consisted of asset impairments and restructuring and other
charges totaling 6035 million 4059 million after tax special items in
2000 consisted of asset impairments and restructuring and other charges
totaling 453 million 279 million after tax special items in 1999
consisted of asset impairments restructuring and other charges and gains on
divestitures of businesses totaling a gain of 213 million 267 million
after tax

results of operations2001 compared to 2000

   in the following discussion year refers to the year ending december 31
2001 and prior year refers to the year ending december 31 2000 all
comparisons are between these periods unless otherwise noted

   revenue was 19430 million in 2001 down from 20503 million in 2000
revenue in the united states decreased 86 percent compared with 2000 while
revenue outside the united states including exports decreased 22 percent
from 2000 sales in the united states represented 454 percent of our 2001
revenue slightly less than in 2000

   income from continuing operations before the cumulative effect of change in
accounting principle net of income taxes excluding asset impairments and
restructuring and other charges was 996 million in 2001 compared to 1535
million in 2000 this decline can be attributed to an overall economic downturn
impacting the chemical industry worldwide and other factors discussed under
segment results below

   asset impairments totaled 3231 million 2338 million after tax for 2001
compared to 101 million 62 million after tax in 2000

   based upon a comprehensive review of our longlived assets we recorded asset
impairment charges of 2119 million related to our us based phosphorus
business the components of asset impairments related to this business include
a 1710 million impairment of environmental assets built to comply with a
resource conservation and recovery act rcra consent decree consent
decree at the pocatello idaho facility and a 365 million impairment charge
for our investment in astaris llc astaris our phosphorus joint venture
with solutia inc solutia see notes 4 and 13 to our consolidated
financial statements driving these charges were a decline in market
conditions the loss of a potential site on which to develop an economically
viable second purified phosphoric acid ppa plant and our agreement to pay
into a fund for the shoshonebannock tribes as a result of an agreement to
support a proposal to amend the consent decree permitting the earlier closure
of the largest remaining waste disposal pond at pocatello in addition we
recorded an impairment charge of 989 million related to our specialty
chemicals segments lithium operations in argentina we established this
operation which includes a lithium mine and processing facilities
approximately five years ago in a remote area of the andes mountains with the
entry of a south american manufacturer into this business resulting in
decreased revenues and following the continuation of other unfavorable market
conditions our lithium assets in argentina became impaired as the total
capital invested is not expected to be recovered an additional 123 million
of charges related to the impairment of assets in our cyanide operations

   during the second quarter of 2000 we recorded asset impairments of 101
million 62 million after tax impairments of 90 million were recognized
because of the formation of astaris see note 4 to our consolidated financial
statements including the write down of certain phosphorus assets retained by
our company and the accrual of costs related to our planned closure of two
phosphorus facilities other asset impairments were due to the impact of
underlying changes within the specialty chemicals segment

   see note 1 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion
on our accounting policies related to asset impairments

   restructuring and other charges  a change in market conditions and in our
corporate strategy resulted in restructuring and other charges of 2804
million 1721 million after tax in the year a charge of 352 million
217 million after tax was recorded in 2000

   we believe that the restructuring and other charges recorded in 2001 have
enabled us to engage in longterm growth opportunities for all of our business
segments see note 1 to our consolidated financial statements for further
discussion on our accounting policies related to restructuring and other
charges

   we had several minor restructuring activities related to corporate
reorganization in the first quarter of 2001 totaling approximately 10 million

                                      12

page

   during the second quarter of 2001 we recorded 1750 million in
restructuring and other charges including 1600 million related to our
industrial chemicals segments us based phosphorus business the components
included in restructuring and other charges related to the phosphorus business
were as follows a 687 million reserve for further required consent decree
spending at the pocatello site 427 million of financing obligations to the
astaris joint venture and other related costs and a 400 million reserve for
payments to the shoshonebannock tribes and 86 million of other related
charges in addition restructuring charges for the quarter included 80
million related to our corporate reorganization the remaining charges of 70
million were for the restructuring of two smaller chemical facilities we
reduced our workforce by approximately 135 people in connection with these
restructuring activities

   during the third quarter of the year we recorded restructuring charges of
85 million these charges were largely for reorganization costs and corporate
restructuring activities including severance and contract commitment costs
see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements

   we recorded restructuring and other charges of 959 million in the fourth
quarter of 2001 most of these charges related to our decision to shutdown
operations at pocatello these charges include 363 million for our share of
astaris shutdown costs including environmental cleanup waste removal and other
activities also included are 446 million of pocatello costs related to plant
demolition plant shutdown severance and other activities in addition 125
million of severance and other costs related to the agricultural products
segment were recorded primarily as a result of our decision to refocus certain
research and development activities the remaining charges reflected
restructuring initiatives in our specialty chemicals segment and in corporate

   we reduced our workforce by approximately 182 people in connection with the
third and fourth quarter restructuring activities

   during 2000 we recorded restructuring and other charges of 352 million
217 million after tax restructuring charges of 206 million were
attributable to the formation of astaris and the concurrent reorganization of
our industrial chemicals sales marketing and support organizations the
reduction of office space requirements in our philadelphia chemical
headquarters and pension expense related to the separation of phosphorus
personnel from our company in addition we recorded environmental accruals of
125 million because of increased cost estimates for ongoing remediation of
several phosphorus properties other restructuring charges included 21
million for other projects of the approximately 350 employee severances that
were expected to occur through the completion of these programs in 2000 281
occurred at december 31 2000 while the remainder occurred in 2001

   income loss from continuing operations was a loss of 3063 million in
2001 compared to income of 1256 million in 2000 most of the decline can be
attributed to aftertax asset impairments and restructuring and other charges
of 4059 million in 2001 compared to aftertax charges of 279 million in
2000 also contributing to the decline were poor economic conditions affecting
the chemical industry worldwide

   corporate expenses excluding restructuring and other charges in 2001 and
2000 were 363 million in 2001 and 362 million in 2000

   other income and expense net is comprised primarily of lifo inventory
adjustments and pension income or expense net other expense for the year was
16 million compared to net other income of 96 million in 2000 this
variance is largely attributable to increased pension costs and lower
amortization of a deferred pension asset

   net interest expense in 2001 was 583 million compared to 618 million in
2000 the decrease in net interest expense in 2001 was primarily the result of
lower average debt levels during the year

                                      13

   provision benefit for income taxes  we recorded an income tax benefit of
1666 million in 2001 resulting in an effective tax rate of 352 percent
compared to income tax expense of 330 million and an effective tax rate of
208 percent in 2000 the differences between the effective tax rates for these
periods and the statutory us federal income tax rate relate primarily to
differing foreign tax rates the impairment of certain argentina assets
foreign sales corporation benefits incremental state taxes and nondeductible
goodwill amortization

   discontinued operations  we recorded a loss from discontinued operations of
425 million 305 million after tax in 2001 included in this amount are
earnings of technologies including interest expense of 112 million which
was allocated to discontinued operations in accordance with accounting
principles board statement no 30 apb 30 and later relevant accounting
guidance costs related to the spinoff and additional income tax provision
related to the reorganization of our worldwide entities in anticipation of the
separation of technologies from fmc in addition we recorded a charge of 180
million for updated estimates of environmental remediation costs related to our
other discontinued businesses

   during 2000 we recorded a net loss from discontinued operations of 177
million 150 million after tax of this amount 640 million are earnings
of the spunoff technologies business including allocated interest expense of
309 million also included are a 800 million loss for a settlement of
litigation related to our discontinued defense systems business and a charge of
17 million for interest charges on postretirement benefit obligations

   net income loss  we recorded a net loss of 3377 million for 2001
compared to net income of 1106 million in 2000 this variance reflects the
effect of significant asset impairments and restructuring and other charges
recorded in 2001

   additional information regarding discontinued operations and the related
accounting policies can be found in notes 1 3 and 20 to our consolidated
financial statements

segment results2001 compared to 2000

   see note 20 to our consolidated financial statements for detailed segment
results

   segment operating profit is presented before taxes asset impairments and
restructuring and other charges information about how each of these items
relates to our businesses at the segment level is discussed below and in note
20 to our consolidated financial statements

  agricultural products

   agricultural products revenue decreased to 6531 million in 2001 from
6647 million in 2000 agricultural products segment operating profit declined
to 728 million down 171 percent from the prior year

   the decrease in agricultural products revenues was largely due to a lack of
sulfentrazone sales to ei du pont de nemours and company dupont in 2001
in 1998 we entered into an exclusive agreement with dupont to provide them
sulfentrazone in north america for use on soybeans however the sale of
formulated products incorporating sulfentrazone did not reach expectations and
the contract purchases were cancelled in 2001 dupont no longer has exclusive
rights to the use of sulfentrazone on soybeans in north america we began
developing new markets in 2001 expanding our sulfentrazone sales including
sales into the soybean market in north america we believe that we have
recovered approximately one third of the sulfentrazone volumes lost from the
absence of duponts purchases somewhat offsetting the sulfentrazone sales
decline in north america was an increase in carfentrazone sales into the rice
and cotton defoliation markets as a result of new product registrations we
believe that sulfentrazone sales will increase slightly in 2002 however we
will idle our production facility early in 2002 to allow product inventories to
align with expected sales volumes

                                      14

   agricultural products sales were also affected by weakened asian markets due
to depressed crop prices unfavorable climatic conditions and lower pricing in
some asian markets due to weaker exchange rates asian revenue shortfalls were
offset by stronger demand for herbicides in latin and south america due mainly
to the introduction of several new herbicide registrations in 2001

   agricultural products operating profit declined to 728 million from 878
million as a result of a decline in operating margins to 111 percent in 2001
from 132 percent in 2000 this lower profitability reflects reduced volumes of
sulfentrazone weaker pricing due to lower crop prices and weaker currencies
in asia and brazil the adverse impact of the lower sulfentrazone volumes in
north america was significantly offset by a one time contract penalty payment
from dupont of 200 million which was paid in the first half of 2001
additionally agricultural products incurred higher selling costs in north
america in 2001 as it pursued new sulfentrazone markets through direct selling
instead of through duponts sales channels

   during the fourth quarter of 2001 agricultural products began a
restructuring of its operations to focus on key markets and products we will
concentrate our future research and development rd activities on our core
strength of insecticides and reduce all work on herbicides while continuing
our efforts to maximize the market potential of already commercialized
herbicide chemistries including clomazone carfentrazone and sulfentrazone
additionally we have reduced our direct sales and support staffs outside
north south and latin america relying instead on new and expanded strategic
alliances with ishihara sangyo kaisha ltd isk in asia and belchim in
europe a restructuring charge of 125 million 78 million after tax was
taken in the fourth quarter to implement these plans this restructuring should
be complete by the end of the first quarter 2002

   we believe that agricultural products will have a challenging year in 2002
but the actions we have taken to expand product labels improve market access
and reduce costs should allow us to recover the earnings decline that resulted
from the loss of duponts sulfentrazone business

  specialty chemicals

   specialty chemicals revenue was 4720 million in 2001 down from 4888
million in 2000 due to lower revenue in both the fmc biopolymer as
biopolymer and lithium businesses specialty chemicals segment operating
profit declined to 875 million or 53 percent from 924 million in the
prior year

   biopolymer revenue decreases resulted from a combination of weaker demand
and lower selling prices for alginate and carrageenan in specialty markets
partially offset by strong growth from microcrystalline cellulose in the
pharmaceutical and food ingredients markets specialty markets which include
pet food textiles and household products experienced the impacts of a slowing
economy and lower competitor pricing customer inventory corrections and a weak
euro also drove sales lower

   lithium revenue decreases resulted from our strategic exit from the
commodity lithium carbonate market and slower industrial markets particularly
in europe the lithium carbonate market has experienced substantially lower
prices since the entry of a new competitor in 1997 which resulted in our
decision to exit the market these sales declines were offset by continued
growth in lithium specialty products

   specialty chemicals operating profit decreased to 875 million in 2001 from
924 million in 2000 despite relatively flat operating margins as compared to
2000 the decrease in operating profit can be attributed to a decrease in
biopolymer volumes and prices in the pet food textile and household products
markets offset in part by lower operating costs and an improved mix in
lithium a weaker euro compared to the prior year also unfavorably impacted
earnings

                                      15

  industrial chemicals

   industrial chemicals revenue decreased to 8220 million in 2001 compared
to 9056 million in 2000 industrial chemical segment operating profit
declined by 366 percent to 726 million in 2001 from 1145 million in 2000

   revenue decreases reflected weaker demand in most markets for industrial
chemicals weaker endmarket demand for glass and the entry of a new competitor
resulted in lower soda ash volumes and revenue compared to the prior year
price increases announced in the late summer of 2001 are not expected to have
any material effect on revenues until 2002 in hydrogen peroxide weakness in
the pulp and textile markets resulted in decreased revenues despite the price
increases initiated in late 2000 and the application of an energy surcharge in
early 2001 softer demand in the polymer and electronics endmarkets also
resulted in lower volumes for specialty peroxygens

   foret our spainbased operation recorded increases in sales that reflected
strong phosphate and zeolite markets phosphate volumes improved as a result of
a recovery in their export markets particularly in the middle east and north
africa zeolite sales increased as a result of an acquisition in the third
quarter of 2001 and stronger sales to new and existing customers conversely
peroxygen sales declined on lower export sales forets increase in sales was
offset by unfavorable translation due to a weaker euro in 2001

   these revenue comparisons were further affected by the inclusion of the
sales of our us based phosphorus business in the first three months of 2000
subsequent us phosphorus sales have been deconsolidated and recorded in
earnings from equity investments as part of astaris which was formed effective
april 1 2000 see note 4 to our consolidated financial statements we account
for astaris on an equity basis for industrial chemicals and therefore the
sales of astaris are not reflected in our consolidated revenues after march
2000

   industrial chemicals operating profit net of minority interests decreased
366 percent to 726 million in 2001 from 1145 million in 2000 driving the
industrial chemicals segments profit decreases were lower sales volumes in
hydrogen peroxide soda ash and active oxidants and reduced earnings from
astaris as discussed below additionally during 2000 we hedged our natural
gas requirements for 2001 which due to the forward pricing in the market at
that time resulted in generally higher gas costs in 2001 versus the prior
year offsetting these unfavorable factors were increased pricing in several
products

   our us based phosphorus business is comprised of our 50 percent interest
in astaris for the manufacture and sale of our phosphorusbased products and
the activities of our corporate phosphorus division which manages remediation
and other environmental projects associated with the astaris elemental
phosphorus plant in pocatello idaho astaris has experienced a difficult
business environment as a result of the economic slowdown and significant
changes in its manufacturing and sourcing strategy during the first quarter of
2001 astaris was asked by its electric power provider idaho power company to
assist in combating the energy crisis in the state of idaho historically the
astaris elemental phosphorus facility has been the largest consumer of power in
the state astaris agreed to work with idaho power and signed a twoyear
agreement to resell 50 megawatts of power to idaho power at rates below the
then current market prices but above the rate paid by astaris under its power
contract the gross economic value of the power contract in the nine months of
2001 during which the contract was in effect was 680 million of which half
or 340 million is reflected in fmcs earnings in astaris however this
decision required astaris to shutdown one of the two remaining operating
furnaces in pocatello and to source raw materials including purified phosphoric
acid and other products from thirdparty suppliers at an additional cost to
astaris of approximately 600 million 300 million is reflected in fmcs
earnings in astaris this significant restructuring of the supply chain also
adversely impacted astaris sales sales declined due to the intentional
reduction of volume capacity and astaris inability to meet customer material
needs in december 2001 the idaho public utility commission ipuc was
petitioned by its staff to reduce the future amounts to be paid to astaris
under the power resale contract this petition is subject to the approval of
the full ipuc which is expected to make a decision later in 2002 any adverse
decision would be subject to appeal

                                      16

   additionally the startup of the new astaris ppa plant in soda springs
idaho in the second half of the year added costs in 2001 startup costs for
this plant are expected to continue until early 2002

   our corporate phosphorus division also affected segment operating profit in
2001 working with the epa and the shoshonebannock tribes we agreed to amend
the july 1999 consent decree to permit the capping of a specific waste disposal
pond at the pocatello site as part of this settlement fmc agreed to
contribute 400 million to a fund for the tribes to support various tribal
activities 300 million was paid during 2001 this agreement enabled
astaris to shutdown the pocatello operation in december 2001

   we expect the results of our us based phosphorus operations to improve in
2002 the new astaris ppa plant in idaho should be fully operational in early
2002 and startup expenses experienced in 2001 should be significantly less in
2002 in addition spending by the corporate phosphorus division will be lower
in 2002 compared with 2001 due to lower spending on projects under the consent
decree we believe the shutdown of the elemental phosphorus production at
pocatello will enable astaris to lower its costs by increasing the share of the
supplies it obtains from lower cost purified phosphoric acid

   following this challenging year we believe that results in the industrial
chemicals segment will improve in 2002 we will continue to focus on lowering
the cost of production and we expect to benefit from the 2001 restructuring of
our us phosphorus business however market demand is expected to continue to
be weak through most of 2002 partially offsetting the improvements in our us
phosphorus business

results of operations  2000 compared to 1999

   revenue was 20503 million in 2000 down from 23205 million in 1999
revenue in the united states decreased 173 percent compared with 1999 while
revenue outside the united states including exports decreased by less than
59 percent when compared to 1999 sales in the united states represented 471
percent of our 2000 revenue compared to 503 percent in 1999

   revenue  lower revenue in 2000 when compared with 1999 was principally
attributable to the contribution of our phosphorus operations to a joint
venture and to divestitures of other businesses and was offset by revenue from
a specialty chemicals business acquired in 1999 beginning april 1 2000 sales
of phosphorus chemicals were recorded by astaris and are not reflected as
revenue in our consolidated financial statements our interest in astaris is
accounted for under the equity method and our share of astaris operating
earnings is included in operating profit for our industrial chemicals segment
see note 4 to our consolidated financial statements

   income from continuing operations before the cumulative effect of change in
accounting principle net of income taxes excluding asset impairments and
restructuring and other charges in 2000 and 1999 and gains on divestitures of
businesses in 1999 was 1535 million in 2000 compared with 1320 million in
1999 this increase reflects the performance of our business segments discussed
more fully below and in note 20 to our consolidated financial statements

   gains on divestitures of businesses  on july 9 1999 we completed the sale
of our bioproducts business to cambrex corporation for 382 million in cash
resulting in a pretax gain of 201 million our bioproducts business was
included in our specialty chemicals segment and had 1999 revenue of 133
million through the date of divestiture

   on july 31 1999 we completed the sale of our process additives business to
great lakes chemical corporation for 1611 million in cash resulting in a
gain of 354 million on both a pretax and aftertax basis our process
additives business was included in our specialty chemicals segment and had 1999
revenue of 985 million through the date of divestiture

                                      17

   asset impairments recorded by the company amounted to 101 million 62
million after tax and 231 million 141 million after tax for the years
ended december 31 2000 and 1999 respectively

   during the second quarter of 2000 we recorded asset impairments of 101
million impairments of 90 million were recognized as a result of the
formation of astaris see note 4 to our consolidated financial statements
including the writedown of certain phosphorus assets retained by our company
and the accrual of costs related to the planned closure of two phosphorus
facilities other impairments were due to the impact of underlying changes
within the specialty chemicals segment

   in the third quarter of 1999 we recorded asset impairments of 231
million asset impairments of 147 million were required to write off the
remaining net book values of two us lithium facilities both facilities were
constructed to run pilot and development quantities for new lithiumbased
products during the third quarter of 1999 management determined that it would
not be feasible to use the facilities as configured additionally an
impairment charge of 84 million was required to write off the remaining net
book value of a caustic soda facility in green river wyoming estimated future
cash flows related to this facility indicated that an impairment of the full
value had occurred

   restructuring and other charges  total restructuring and other charges of
352 million 217 million after tax were recorded in 2000 compared to 111
million 68 million after tax in 1999

   restructuring charges of 206 million were attributable to the astaris
formation and the concurrent reorganization of our industrial chemicals sales
marketing and support organizations the reduction of office space requirements
in our philadelphia chemical headquarters and pension expense related to the
separation of phosphorus personnel from our company in addition we recorded
environmental accruals of 125 million because of increased cost estimates for
ongoing remediation of several phosphorus properties other restructuring
charges included 21 million for several smaller projects

   in the third quarter of 1999 we recorded restructuring and other charges of
111 million 68 million after tax restructuring and other charges of 92
million resulted primarily from strategic decisions to divest or restructure a
number of businesses and support departments including certain agricultural
products and corporate and shared service support departments the remaining
charge related to actions including headcount reductions required to achieve
planned synergies from acquisitions of businesses in specialty chemicals

   income loss from continuing operations of 1256 million in 2000 was lower
when compared with 1587 million in 1999 primarily resulting from gains on
divestitures of businesses in 1999 and higher restructuring and other charges
recorded in 2000

   corporate expenses excluding restructuring and other charges in 2000 and
1999 of 362 million in 2000 reflected a decrease of 51 million from 1999
the companys cost reduction efforts are responsible for this trend

   net interest expense was 618 million and 764 million during 2000 and
1999 respectively the decrease in 2000 was the result of lower average debt
levels when compared with 1999

   other income and expense net is comprised primarily of lifo inventory
adjustments and pension and postretirement plan adjustments other income of
96 million remained relatively flat when compared to 93 million recorded in
1999

   discontinued operations  during 2000 we recorded a net loss from
discontinued operations of 177 million 150 million after tax of this
amount 640 million represents the earnings of the spunoff technologies
business including interest expense of 309 million allocated to discontinued
operations in accordance with apb 30 and later relevant accounting guidance
also included is a 800 million loss for a settlement of litigation related to
our discontinued defense systems business and a charge of 17 million for
interest charges on postretirement benefit obligations

                                      18

   we recorded net income from discontinued operations of 735 million 539
million after tax in 1999 of this amount 792 million related to the
earnings of the spunoff technologies businesses including allocated interest
expense of 303 million results of discontinued operations in 1999 included
gains of 537 million from the sale of properties in california that were
formerly used by our divested defense business as discussed below in
addition in the fourth quarter of 1999 we provided 594 million in response
to updated estimates of environmental remediation costs primarily at our
former defense systems sites and increased estimates of our liabilities for
general liability workers compensation postretirement benefit obligations
legal defense property maintenance and other costs

   during the year ended december 31 1999 we sold several real estate
properties formerly used by united defense lp and our defense systems
operations divested by our company in 1997 in the second quarter of 1999 we
received 335 million in cash recognizing a gain of 295 million and in the
fourth quarter of 1999 we received 310 million in cash recognizing a gain
of 242 million related to property sales

   net income in 2000 was 1106 million compared to 2126 million in 1999
contributing to this decrease was a onetime gain of 555 million related to
the divestiture of a specialty chemicals business in 1999 offset by a charge of
667 million to discontinued operations in 2000 related to our former defense
systems business segment

segment results  2000 compared to 1999

  agricultural products

   agricultural products revenue increased to 6647 million in 2000 compared
to 6324 million in 1999 operating profits increased to 878 million in 2000
compared to 643 million in 1999

   agricultural products revenue increased because of stronger sales in latin
and north america which more than offset lower sales in asia north american
revenue improved after a return to more normal pest pressures following 1999s
unusually low levels latin american sales improved due to a rapid recovery
from the devaluation of the brazilian real in 1999 a new distribution
agreement for thirdparty products in brazil and a stronger mexican market
increased revenue in 2000 also reflected higher volumes for herbicides and
pyrethroids offset by lower sales of carbamates

   operating profits in our agricultural products segment increased to 878
million in 2000 from 643 million in 1999 on increased volumes and lower
costs partially offset by higher research and development spending to develop
a new herbicide and to fund our strategic alliance with devgen a belgian
biotechnology company to support the companys insecticide discovery program

  specialty chemicals

   specialty chemicals revenue was 4888 million in 2000 down from 5645
million in 1999 operating profit was 924 million compared to 735 million

   lower revenue in 2000 reflected our divestitures of the process additives
and bioproducts businesses both of which occurred in the third quarter of
1999 and the effect of unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates partially
offsetting this decrease in 2000 was revenue from pronova biopolymer as an
alginate business acquired in mid1999 the pronova biopolymer operation was
combined with certain carrageenan and microcrystalline cellulose businesses and
renamed fmc biopolymer as biopolymers revenue reflected a strong market for
pharmaceutical and foodgrade microcrystalline cellulose along with growth in
sales to latin america and asia but was partially offset by the impact of
foreign currency translation of the euro to the us dollar

                                      19

page

   sales of lithium products were up slightly in 2000 increased revenue
reflected higher volumes of butyllithium to the polymer and pharmaceutical
markets lithium volume increases were offset by lower pricing primarily the
result of weak european currencies

   specialty chemicals operating profit in 2000 increased to 924 million
from 735 million in 1999 biopolymers increased profitability was based on
lower manufacturing costs in 2000 for carrageenan and realized synergies
associated with the acquisition of the alginate product line when compared with
1999 lithiums improved operating profitability in 2000 when compared with
1999 was a result of higher sales and the successful implementation of
manufacturing cost reduction initiatives

  industrial chemicals

   industrial chemicals revenue decreased to 9056 million in 2000 from
11413 million in 1999 operating profit net of minority interests declined
to 1145 million in 2000 from 1444 million in 1999

   lower revenue was primarily the result of the contribution of the phosphorus
business to the newly formed astaris joint venture effective april 1 2000
after that date phosphorus revenue was no longer consolidated with our
revenue phosphorus revenue of 3270 million through december 31 1999 is
included in 1999 segment revenue while revenue in 2000 before the joint
venture formation amounted to 792 million subsequent to the first quarter of
2000 our equity share of astaris earnings was included in segment operating
profit for industrial chemicals

   other factors contributing to reduced revenue were the translation impact of
the weaker euro and competitive pressures both at spainbased fmc foret and at
astaris partially offsetting the decline in revenue were increased sales of
hydrogen peroxide reflecting both volume and price increases compared with
1999 and soda ash a result of the tg soda ash acquisition in mid1999

   reduced profitability for industrial chemicals to 1145 million in 2000 was
primarily the result of increased energy costs for all businesses but
especially at astaris while foreign currency translation losses negatively
affected reported operating profitability at foret in addition segment
profits were down due to phosphorus environmental compliance costs retained by
our company for design implementation and depreciation of capital assets in
pocatello idaho in connection with the consent decree

   offsetting these declines in profitability were higher earnings for soda ash
and hydrogen peroxide soda ash profitability increased in 2000 reflecting the
tg soda ash acquisition and reduced costs despite significant increases in
energy prices hydrogen peroxides favorable operating profits were largely the
result of a strong pulp and paper market in addition our share of astaris
results reflected the cost reduction benefits of the joint ventures
rationalization and restructuring programs

taxes

   although our domestic earnings losses are generally subject to tax expense
benefit at the statutory rate of 350 percent many factors alter our
consolidated tax rate these factors include nondeductible or nontaxable
transactions related to goodwill or other items differing foreign tax rates
state tax increments depletion extraterritorial income exclusion and other
permanent differences our effective tax rate of 352 percent on income from
continuing operations in 2001 also includes the beneficial impact of deductible
restructuring and impairment charges recorded during the year see notes 6 7
and 10 to our consolidated financial statements

new accounting standards adopted

   on january 1 2001 we adopted statement of financial accounting standards
sfas no 133 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging
activities and sfas no 138 accounting for certain

                                      20

page

derivative instruments and certain hedging activities an amendment of sfas
no 133 these statements establish accounting and reporting standards that
require every derivative instrument to be recorded on the consolidated balance
sheet as either an asset or a liability measured at its fair value sfas no
133 as amended requires the transition adjustment resulting from adopting
these statements to be reported in net income or accumulated other
comprehensive income as appropriate as the cumulative effect of change in
accounting principle on january 1 2001 we recorded the fair value of all
outstanding derivative instruments as assets or liabilities on the consolidated
balance sheet the transition adjustment was a 09 million aftertax loss to
earnings and a 164 million aftertax gain to accumulated other comprehensive
income loss both components of the adjustment were recorded as a cumulative
effect of change in accounting principle

new accounting pronouncements

   in june 2001 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas
no 141 business combinations sfas no 141 requires that all business
combinations be accounted for by the purchase method and adds disclosure
requirements related to business combination transactions sfas no 141 also
establishes criteria for the recognition of intangible assets apart from
goodwill this statement applies to all business combinations for which the
acquisition date was july 1 2001 or later we had no significant acquisitions
during 2001 we intend to implement the provisions of sfas no 141 in any of
our future business combinations

   on june 30 2001 the fasb issued sfas no 142 goodwill and other
intangible assets which establishes guidelines for the financial accounting
and reporting of acquired goodwill and other intangible assets with the
adoption of sfas no 142 goodwill is no longer subject to amortization
rather it will be subject to at least an annual assessment for impairment by
applying a fair value based test we are required to adopt the provisions of
this pronouncement no later than the beginning of 2002 however goodwill and
other intangible assets acquired after june 30 2001 are subject immediately
to the amortization provisions of this statement we had no material
acquisitions of goodwill or other intangibles in the second half of 2001 we
will adopt the amortization provisions of sfas no 142 beginning in the first
quarter of 2002 during 2001 2000 and 1999 goodwill and other intangible
amortization pretax and after discontinued operations was 194 million
135 million and 120 million respectively we believe adopting sfas no 142
will result in approximately a 40 million pretax benefit to earnings in 2002

   in june 2001 the fasb issued sfas no 143 accounting for asset retirement
obligations sfas no 143 addresses financial accounting and reporting for
obligations associated with the retirement of tangible longlived assets and
the associated asset retirement costs we are required to adopt the provisions
of this pronouncement no later than the beginning of 2003 and are evaluating
the potential impact of adopting sfas no 143

   in august 2001 the fasb issued sfas no 144 accounting for the impairment
or disposal of longlived assets the statement supersedes sfas no 121
accounting for the impairment of longlived assets and for longlived assets
to be disposed of the statement also supersedes apb no 30 provisions related
to the accounting and reporting for the disposal of a segment of a business
this statement establishes a single accounting model based on the framework
established in sfas no 121 for longlived assets to be disposed of by sale
the statement retains most of the requirements in sfas no 121 related to the
recognition of impairment of longlived assets to be held and used the
statement is effective for years beginning after december 15 2001 we are
evaluating the potential impact of adopting sfas no 144

environmental obligations

   our company like other industrial manufacturers is involved with a variety
of environmental matters in the ordinary course of conducting its business and
is subject to federal state and local environmental laws we believe strongly
that we have a responsibility to protect the environment public health and
employee safety this responsibility includes cooperating with other parties to
resolve issues created by past and present handling of wastes

                                      21

page

   when issues arise including notices from the environmental protection
agency or other government agencies identifying our company as a potentially
responsible party prp our environmental remediation management assesses
and manages the issues when necessary we use multifunctional teams composed
of environmental legal financial and communications personnel to ensure that
our actions are consistent with our responsibilities to the environment and
public health as well as to our employees and shareholders

   environmental provisions totaling 688 million 420 million after tax
were recorded this year these provisions largely related to the remediation of
the pocatello site as discussed in note 13 of our consolidated financial
statements also included were costs related to continued cleanup of certain
discontinued manufacturing operations from previous years this provision and
those made in 2000 and 1999 and our accounting policies on environmental
remediation are more fully described in notes 1 and 13 to our consolidated
financial statements

   in the second quarter of 2000 we provided environmental reserves totaling
125 million related to ongoing remediation of several phosphorus
manufacturing properties as part of the restructuring and other charges
described previously

   additional information regarding our environmental accounting policies and
environmental liabilities is included in notes 1 and 13 respectively to our
consolidated financial statements information regarding environmental
obligations associated with our discontinued operations is included in note 3
to our consolidated financial statements estimates of 2002 environmental
spending are included in the section below entitled cash flow analysis

liquidity and capital resources

   in 2001 we experienced the net cash impact of significant special items
recorded in the year and spending related to the spinoff of technologies this
spending was somewhat offset by the cash proceeds received in the ipo of
technologies cash from operations supplemented with proceeds from the ipo and
a new credit facility provided funding for our capital spending program debt
pay down and interest payments throughout 2001

   capital expenditures totaling 1456 million in 2001 which included 412
million of required pocatello consent decree spending were down 262 percent
from 2000 we believe capital expenditures will be reduced in 2002 largely
because of the absence of this consent decree spending principal categories of
capital spending in 2002 include replacement of existing plant equipment and
compliance spending related to environmental and safety standards

   we retired 1283 million of longterm debt in 2001 in part with a portion
of the proceeds from the ipo of technologies cash paid for interest in 2001
was 791 million compared with 1016 million in 2000 this decrease can be
attributed to lower average debt levels in 2001 compared to 2000

   future cash needs include the scheduled repayment of several significant
financings over the next two years operating cash requirements and capital
expenditures we plan to meet these liquidity needs through cash generated from
operations commercial paper borrowings accounts receivable securitization
borrowings under bank credit facilities and if necessary the issuance of
additional longterm debt we maintain a universal shelf registration under
which at december 31 2001 3450 million of securities could be issued

   we currently maintain a commercial paper financing program with outstanding
borrowings at december 31 2001 of 330 million compared to 168 million at
december 31 2000

   our fiveyear nonamortizing committed revolving credit agreement expired
in december 2001 there were no outstanding balances under this agreement at
the due date at the same time we entered into a new 2400 million committed
revolving credit facility to meet certain operating cash needs capital
expenditures and commercial paper demands this credit facility will expire in
december 2002 the total amount outstanding under this facility at december 31
2001 was 680 million which was used to pay down outstanding commercial
paper the credit agreement contains financial covenants related to leverage
measured as the ratio of debt to adjusted earnings interest coverage
measured as the ratio of interest expense to adjusted earnings and
consolidated net worth we were in compliance with the covenants as of december
31 2001 we expect to renew or replace this credit facility prior to its
expiration in january 2002 we arranged a supplemental 500 million committed
credit facility to meet shortterm seasonal financing needs this credit
facility expires on august 31 2002

   we also obtain financing through an accounts receivable securitization we
sell receivables without recourse through our wholly owned bankruptcyremote
subsidiary fmc funding corporation which then sells the receivables to an
unrelated finance company the sold receivables and repurchase obligations
related to the financing are not recorded on our consolidated balance sheets
because we have limited risk to repurchase the receivables the financing from
the securitization totaled 790 million at december 31 2001 compared to
1130 million on december 31 2000 the agreement for the sale of accounts
receivable provides for the continuation of the program on a revolving basis
through november 2002 we expect to renew or replace this financing prior to
its expiration

   at december 31 2001 longterm debt included 288 million of 675 percent
exchangeable senior subordinated debentures due 2005 see note 11 to our
consolidated financial statements these debentures are callable by fmc at par
plus accrued interest upon at least 30 days prior notice these debentures are
exchangeable by the holders at any time into the common stock of meridian gold
inc nyse mdg the successor to a former subsidiary of fmc at an exchange
price of 15125 per share subject to adjustment fmc may elect to pay the
holders in cash an amount equivalent to the value of the meridian gold common
stock into which the holders could exchange their debentures at december 31
2001 fmc did not hold any shares of meridian gold common stock on february
19 2002 the closing price of meridian gold common stock on the new york stock
exchange was 1316 if the price goes above 15125 it is reasonably likely
that during 2002 the holders would exercise their exchange rights

   longterm debt also includes 443 million of variable rate industrial and
pollution control revenue bonds that are supported by bank letters of credit
the letters of credit generally have a term of thirteen months and extend each
month for an additional month unless and until the bank sends us a letter of
nonrenewal at december 31 2001 no notice of nonrenewal had been received

   our future liquidity could be affected by certain letters of credit
commitments and guarantees we provide to vendors customers and others for
which we are contingently liable in connection with the spinoff of
technologies we retained liability for various contingent obligations totaling
2890 million at december 31 2001 contingent obligations include guarantees
of the performance of technologies under various customer contracts
reimbursements on behalf of technologies under letters of credit and surety
bonds and guarantees of indebtedness of technologies we have a guarantee from
technologies providing for reimbursement to us if we are ever called upon to
satisfy these obligations technologies has obtained contractual releases of
fmc reducing the level of liabilities for which we are contingently liable to
1750 million at february 12 2002 because our expectation that the
underlying obligations will be met and the existence of the guarantee from
technologies we believe it is unlikely that we would have to pay any of these
contingent obligations and expect this contingent liability to continue to be
reduced throughout 2002 the majority of these obligations will expire before
the end of 2003

   we have provided an agreement to lenders of astaris under which we have
agreed to make equity contributions to astaris sufficient to make up one half
of any shortfall in astaris earnings below certain levels astaris earnings
did not meet the agreed levels for 2001 and we do not expect that such earnings
will meet the levels agreed for 2002 we contributed 313 million to astaris
under this arrangement in 2001 and expect to contribute a similar amount in
2002 the proportional amount of astaris indebtedness subject to this agreement
from fmc at december 31 2001 was 1119 million our estimates of future
contributions are based on astaris forecasts and are subject to some
uncertainty

   we provide guarantees to financial institutions on behalf of certain
agricultural products customers for their seasonal borrowing the customers
obligations to us are largely secured by liens on their crops the total of
these guarantees at december 31 2001 was 560 million see note 19 to our
consolidated financial statements

   on june 30 1999 fmc acquired the assets of tg soda ash inc tgsa from
elf atochem north america inc for approximately 510 million in cash and a
contingent payment due at yearend 2003 the contingent payment amount which
will be based on the financial performance of the combined soda ash operations
between 2001 and 2003 cannot currently be determined but could be as much as
750 million

   our ability to pay the principal and interest on our indebtedness as it
comes due will depend upon our current and future performance our performance
is affected by general economic conditions and by financial competitive
political business and other factors many of these factors are beyond our
control we believe that the cash generated from our businesses coupled with
our ability to obtain financing will be sufficient to enable us

                                      24

to make our debt payments as they become due we also actively evaluate
opportunities to refinance our existing obligations when financing is available
on attractive terms if however we do not generate sufficient cash or
complete such financings on a timely basis we may be required to seek
additional financing or sell equity on terms which may not be as favorable as
we could have otherwise obtained no assurance can be given that any
refinancing additional borrowing or sale of equity will be possible when
needed or that we will be able to negotiate acceptable terms in addition our
access to capital is affected by prevailing conditions in the financial and
equity capital markets as well as our own financial condition

cash flow analysis

   cash and cash equivalents at december 31 2001 and december 31 2000 were
234 million and 73 million respectively we had total borrowings of 9235
million and 10075 million as of december 31 2001 and 2000 respectively

   operating working capital which includes trade receivables net
inventories other current assets accounts payable accrued payroll other
current liabilities and the current portion of accrued pension and other
postretirement benefits increased 670 million to 248 million at december
31 2001 from an unfavorable 422 million at december 31 2000 factors
contributing to the increase in operating working capital at yearend 2001 when
compared with 2000 include increased accounts receivable and inventory amounts

   cash required by operating activities of 900 million for the year ended
december 31 2001 decreased from 2983 million of cash provided by operations
in 2000 primarily as a result of increased restructuring spending accompanied
by higher inventory and accounts receivable balances also contributing to the
variance was a decrease in our accounts receivable financing balance in 2001
compared to the prior year

   cash required by investing activities of 1549 million in 2001 increased
from the 2000 requirement of 974 million reflecting the impact of a prior
year distribution from astaris which was not repeated in the current year
capital spending excluding acquisitions of 1456 million for the year ended
december 31 2001 decreased when compared with 2000 lower spending on
significant capital projects was due to lower consent decree spending at
pocatello

   cash provided by financing activities in 2001 of 3765 million was higher
than the 2000 requirement of 1620 million primarily due to the contribution
related to the distribution of technologies assets and an increase in longterm
debt offset by longterm debt paydowns of 1283 million

   projected 2002 spending also includes approximately 103 million for
environmental compliance at current operating sites which is an operating
expense of the company plus approximately 355 million of remediation
spending and 112 million for environmental study costs at current operating
previously operated and other sites which have been accrued in prior periods

dividends

   on november 29 2001 our board of directors approved the spinoff of the
remaining 83 percent of technologies making it an independent publicly traded
company the spinoff qualified as a taxfree distribution to us
stockholders stockholders of record as of december 31 2001 received
approximately 172 shares of common stock of the new company for every 10
share of our stock fractional shares were paid in cash to stockholders in lieu
of fractional shares on december 31 2001

   no cash dividends were paid in 2001 other than amounts paid in lieu of
fractional shares as discussed above no cash dividends were paid in 2000 no
cash dividends are expected to be paid in 2002

item 7a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk


   our primary financial market risks include changes in foreign currency
exchange rates interest rates and commodity pricing in managing our exposure
to these risks we may use derivative financial instruments in accordance with
established policies and procedures we account for these derivatives in
accordance with sfas no 133 see new accounting standards adopted and note 1
to our consolidated financial statements we do not use derivative financial
instruments for trading purposes at december 31 2001 our derivative holdings
consisted primarily of foreign currency forward contracts and natural gas
forward contracts

   when we or one of our subsidiaries sells or purchases products or services
outside the united states transactions are frequently denominated in
currencies other than the us dollar exposure to variability in currency
exchange rates is mitigated when possible with natural hedges whereby
purchases and sales in the same foreign currency and with similar maturity
dates offset one another

   a significant portion of our business is conducted in currencies other than
the us dollar which is our reporting currency we recognize foreign currency
gains and losses arising from our operations in the period incurred as a
result currency fluctuations among the us dollar and the currencies in which
we do business have caused and will continue to cause foreign currency
transaction gains and losses which could be material due to the weakness of
the euro in the period from 1999 through 2001 our business results have been
adversely affected by unfavorable us dollar translation of earnings of our
operations in europe we cannot predict the effects of exchange rate
fluctuations upon our future operating results because of the number of
currencies involved the variability of currency exposures and the potential
volatility of currency exchange rates we take actions to manage our foreign
currency exposure such as entering into forwards and swaps where available
but we cannot ensure that our strategies will adequately protect our operating
results from the effects of exchange rate fluctuations

   additionally we initiate hedging activities by entering into foreign
exchange forward or option contracts with third parties when natural hedges do
not exist the maturity dates of the currency exchange agreements that provide
hedge coverage are consistent with those of the underlying purchase or sales
commitments

   to monitor our currency exchange rate risks we use a sensitivity analysis
which measures the impact on earnings of an immediate 10 percent devaluation of
the foreign currencies to which it has exposure based on a sensitivity
analysis at december 31 2001 fluctuations in currency exchange rates in the
near term would not materially affect our consolidated operating results
financial position or cash flows we believe that our hedging activities have
been effective in reducing our risks related to currency exchange rate
fluctuations

   we are exposed to changes in interest rates because of our financing and
cash management activities which include long and shortterm debt to maintain
liquidity and fund our business operations in managing interest rate risk our
strategic policy is to monitor the ratio of our fixed to floatingrate debt
we may from time to time use interest rate swaps to manage our exposure to
changes in interest rates we did not enter into any material interest rate
swaps in 2001 or 2000

   to address our exposure to risks from changes in commodity prices we enter
into forward or swap contracts relating to energy purchases used in our
manufacturing processes the forward energy contracts qualifying as hedges are
accounted for in accordance with sfas no 133 the gains or losses on these
contracts are included as an adjustment to the cost of sales or services when
the contracts are settled

   for more information on derivative financial instruments and related
accounting policies see notes 1 and 17 to our consolidated financial
statements
