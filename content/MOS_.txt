business developments during 2021 

• during the second quarter of 2021 due to increased brine inflows we made the decision to accelerate the timing of the shutdown of our k1 and k2 mine shafts at our esterhazy saskatchewan potash mine closing the k1 and k2 shafts are key pieces of the transition to the k3 shaft but the timeline for the closure was accelerated by approximately nine months we recognized pretax costs of 1581 million related to the permanent closure of these facilities in the third quarter of 2021 we resumed production at our previously idled colonsay potash mine to offset a portion of the production lost by the early closure of the k1 and k2 shafts at esterhazy in december 2021 the k3 shaft became fully operational and is expected to reach full operating capacity in the first quarter of 2022 the closure of the k1 and k2 shafts will eliminate future brine management expenses at these sites 

• in august 2021 we entered into a new unsecured fiveyear credit facility of up to 25 billion with a maturity date of august 19 2026 which replaces our prior 22 billion line of credit this increase in size provides additional security and flexibility and reflects the growth in our business 

• in august 2021 we prepaid the outstanding balance of 450 million on our 375 senior notes due november 15 2021 without premium or penalty 

• during the third quarter of 2021 our board of directors approved a new 1 billion share repurchase authorization the “ 2021 repurchase program ” replacing our previous 15 billion authorization the “ 2015 repurchase program ” that had 700 million remaining this new expanded authorization reflects our unchanged commitment to a balanced deployment of excess capital that includes returning capital to stockholders during 2021 we repurchased 11200371 shares of common stock including 8544144 shares that we purchased in an underwritten secondary offering by vale sa at an average price of 3669 for a total of approximately 4109 million 

• in november 2021 vale sa sold its 34176574 shares of common stock of mosaic in an underwritten secondary offering vale sa no longer holds any shares of mosaic common stock 

• in the fourth quarter of 2021 our board of directors approved a 50 increase in our annual dividend to 045 per share beginning in 2022 

• in 2020 we filed petitions with the us department of commerce  “ doc ”  and the us international trade commission  “ itc ”  that requested the initiation of countervailing duty investigations into imports of phosphate fertilizers from morocco and russia the purpose of the petitions was to remedy the distortions that we believe foreign subsidies have caused or are causing in the us market for phosphate fertilizers and thereby restore fair competition during the first quarter of 2021 the doc made final affirmative determinations that countervailable subsidies were being provided by those governments and the itc made final affirmative determinations that the us 

phosphate fertilizer industry is materially injured by reason of subsidized phosphate fertilizer imports from morocco and russia as a result of these determinations the doc issued countervailing duty orders on phosphate fertilizer imports from russia and morocco which are scheduled to remain in place for at least five years currently the cash deposit rates for such imports are approximately 20 percent for moroccan producer ocp 9 percent and 47 percent for russian producers phosagro and eurochem respectively and 17 percent for all other russian producers the final determinations in the doc and itc investigations are subject to possible challenges before us federal courts and the world trade organization and mosaic has initiated actions at the us court of international trade contesting certain aspects of the doc’s final determinations that we believe failed to capture the full extent of moroccan and russian phosphate fertilizer subsidies moroccan and russian producers have also initiated us court of international trade actions seeking lower cash deposit rates and revocation of the countervailing duty orders further the cash deposit rates and the amount of countervailing duties owed by importers on such imports could change based on the results of the doc’s annual administrative review proceedings 

• in response to covid19 we continued to implement measures in 2021 that were intended to provide for the immediate health and safety of our employees including working remotely and alternating work schedules in order to minimize the number of employees at a single location businesses have been impacted by shortterm labor shortages due to illness transportation issues such as trucking delays and port congestion which are slowing delivery of inputs to facilities and products to end customers at this time we have experienced limited adverse financial or operational impacts related to covid19 

subsequent to december 31 2021 we expect to enter into an accelerated share repurchase “ asr ” of 400 million which would be initiated in february 2022 following the completion of the current authorization our board of directors has approved the establishment of a new 1 billion share repurchase authorization which will go into effect following completion of this asr the board of directors has also approved a regular dividend increase to 060 per share annually from 045 beginning with the second quarter 2022 payment

phosphates segment 

our phosphates business segment owns and operates mines and production facilities in florida which produce concentrated phosphate crop nutrients and phosphatebased animal feed ingredients and processing plants in louisiana which produce concentrated phosphate crop nutrients we have a 75 economic interest in the miski mayo phosphate mine in peru “ miski mayo mine ”  which is included in the results of our phosphates segment o n june 18 2019 we permanently closed our plant city florida production facility on september 24 2019 mosaic entered into a longterm lease agreement with anuvia plant nutrition to lease certain assets at that location 

the following map shows the locations of each of our phosphate concentrates plants in the united states and each of our active temporarily idled and planned phosphate mine locations including beneficiation plants in florida the reserves associated with our ona location have been allocated to other active mines based on our future mining plans 

us phosphate crop nutrients and animal feed ingredients 

our us phosphates operations have capacity to produce approximately 45 million tonnes of phosphoric acid “ p 2 o 5 ” per year or about 7 of world annual capacity and about 60 of north american annual capacity p 2 o 5 is produced by reacting finely ground phosphate rock with sulfuric acid p 2 o 5 is the key building block for the production of high analysis or concentrated phosphate crop nutrients and animal feed products and is the most comprehensive measure of phosphate capacity and production and a commonly used benchmark in our industry our us p 2 o 5 production totaled approximately 34 million tonnes during 2021 our us operations account for approximately 7 of estimated global annual production and 51 of estimated north american annual output 

our phosphate crop nutrient products are marketed worldwide to crop nutrient manufacturers distributors retailers and farmers our principal phosphate crop nutrient products are 

• diammonium phosphate 18460 diammonium phosphate “ dap ” is the most widely used highanalysis phosphate crop nutrient worldwide dap is produced by first combining phosphoric acid with anhydrous ammonia in a reaction vessel this initial reaction creates a slurry that is then pumped into a granulation plant where it is reacted with additional ammonia to produce dap dap is a solid granular product that is applied directly or blended with other solid plant nutrient products such as urea and potash 

• monoammonium phosphate 11520 monoammonium phosphate “ map ” is the second most widely used highanalysis phosphate crop nutrient and the fastest growing phosphate product worldwide map is also produced by first combining phosphoric acid with anhydrous ammonia in a reaction vessel the resulting slurry is then pumped into the granulation plant where it is reacted with additional p 2 o 5 to produce map map is a solid granular product that is applied directly or blended with other solid plant nutrient products 

• microessentials ® is a valueadded ammoniated phosphate product that is enhanced through a patented process that creates very thin platelets of sulfur and other micronutrients such as zinc on the granulated product the patented process incorporates both the sulfate and elemental forms of sulfur providing seasonlong availability to crops 

production of our animal feed ingredients products is located at our new wales florida facility we market our feed phosphate primarily under the leading brand names of biofos ® and nexfos ®  

annual capacity by plant as of december 31 2021 and production volumes by plant for 2021 are listed below 



 

a our ability to produce processed phosphates has been less than our annual operational capacity stated in the table above except to the extent we purchase p 2 o 5  factors affecting actual production are described in note c below 

b operational capacity is our estimated longterm capacity based on an average amount of scheduled down time including maintenance and scheduled turnaround time and product mix and no significant modifications to operating conditions equipment or facilities 

c actual production varies from annual operational capacity shown in the above table due to factors that include among others the level of demand for our products maintenance and turnaround time accidents mechanical failure product mix and other operating conditions 

d our louisiana facilities experienced lower production as a result of downtime from sulfur supply constraints and damage from hurricane ida 

the p 2 o 5 produced at uncle sam is shipped to faustina where it is used to produce dap map and microessentials ® our faustina plant also manufactures ammonia that is mostly consumed in our concentrate plants 

we produced approximately 69 million tonnes of concentrated phosphate crop nutrients during 2021 and accounted for approximately 70 of estimated north american annual production 

phosphate rock 

phosphate rock is the key mineral used to produce phosphate crop nutrients and feed phosphate our florida phosphate rock mines produced approximately 122 million tonnes in 2021 and accounted for approximately 51 of estimated north american annual production we are the world’s second largest miner of phosphate rock excluding china and currently operate four mines in north america with a combined annual capacity of approximately 180 million tonnes additionally we own 75 of the miski mayo mine in peru which has an annual capacity of 40 million tonnes production of one tonne of dap requires between 16 and 17 tonnes of phosphate rock 

all of our wholly owned phosphate mines and related mining operations in north america are located in central florida during 2021 we operated three active mines in florida four corners south fort meade and wingate we plan to explore and develop the desoto property and the south pasture property which was previously idled to offset future depletion at our florida properties we have a 75 economic interest in the miski mayo mine in peru which allows us to supplement our other produced rock to meet our overall fertilizer production needs and is the primary source of rock for our louisiana operations we have the right to use or sell to third parties 75 of miski mayo’s annual production 

see item 2 “properties” for a discussion of our phosphate mining properties including processing methods facilities production and summaries of our mineral resources and reserves both in the aggregate and for our individual material phosphate mining properties 

investment in ma’aden wa’ad al shamal phosphate company “mwspc”  

we own a 25 interest in mwspc and in connection with our equity share we are entitled to market approximately 25 of mwspc’s production mwspc consists of a mine and two chemical complexes the “ project ” that produce phosphate fertilizers and other downstream phosphates products in the kingdom of saudi arabia the greenfield project was built in the northern region of saudi arabia at wa’ad al shamal minerals industrial city and included further expansion of processing plants in ras al khair minerals industrial city which is located on the east coast of saudi arabia ammonia operations commenced in late 2016 and on december 1 2018 mwspc commenced commercial operations of the phosphate plant thereby bringing the entire project to the commercial production phase phosphate production will gradually rampup until it reaches an expected 30 million tonnes in annual production capacity actual phosphate production was 24 million tonnes in 2021 the project benefits from the availability of key raw nutrients from sources within saudi arabia 

our cash investment in the project was 770 million at december 31 2021 our obligation to contribute additional equity was eliminated as part of the project debt refinancing in 2020 

sulfur 

we use molten sulfur at our phosphates concentrates plants to produce sulfuric acid primarily for use in our production of p 2 o 5  we purchased approximately 37 million long tons of sulfur during 2021 we purchase the majority of this sulfur from north american oil and natural gas refiners who are required to remove or recover sulfur during the refining process production of one tonne of dap requires approximately 040 long tons of sulfur we procure our sulfur from multiple sources and receive it by truck rail barge and vessel either directly at our phosphate plants or have it sent for gathering to terminals that are located on the us gulf coast in addition we use formed sulfur received through tampa florida ports which are delivered by truck to our new wales facility and melted through our sulfur melter 

we own and operate a sulfur terminal in riverview florida we also lease terminal space in tampa florida and galveston and beaumont texas we have longterm time charters on two oceangoing tugsbarges and one oceangoing vessel that transports molten sulfur from the texas terminals to tampa we then further transport by truck to our florida phosphate plants in addition we own a 50 equity interest in gulf sulphur services ltd lllp “ gulf sulphur services ” which is operated by our joint venture partner gulf sulphur services has a sulfur transportation and terminaling business in the gulf 

of mexico and handles these functions for a substantial portion of our florida sulfur volume our sulfur logistic assets also include a large fleet of leased railcars that supplement our marine sulfur logistic system our louisiana operations are served by truck from nearby refineries 

although sulfur is readily available from many different suppliers and can be transported to our phosphate facilities by a variety of means sulfur is an important raw material used in our business that has in the past been and may in the future be the subject of volatile pricing and availability alternative transportation and terminaling facilities might not have sufficient capacity to fully serve all of our facilities in the event of a disruption to current transportation or terminaling facilities changes in the price of sulfur or disruptions to sulfur transportation or terminaling facilities could have a material impact on our business we have included a discussion of sulfur prices in our management’s analysis 

ammonia 

we use ammonia together with p 2 o 5 to produce dap map and microessentials ® we consumed approximately 11 million tonnes of ammonia during 2021 production of one tonne of dap requires approximately 023 tonnes of ammonia we purchase approximately onethird of our ammonia from various suppliers in the spot market with the remaining twothirds either purchased through our ammonia supply agreement the “ cf ammonia supply agreement ” with an affiliate of cf industries inc “ cf ” or produced internally at our faustina louisiana location 

our florida ammonia needs are currently supplied under multiyear contracts with both domestic and offshore producers ammonia for our bartow and riverview plants is terminaled through owned ammonia facilities at the port of tampa and port sutton florida ammonia for our new wales plant is terminaled through another ammonia facility owned and operated by a third party at port sutton florida pursuant to an agreement that provides for service through 2022 with automatic renewal for an additional twoyear period unless either party terminates as provided in the agreement ammonia is transported by pipeline from the terminals to our production facilities we have service agreements with the operators of the pipelines for bartow new wales and riverview which provide service through june 30 2022 with annual autorenewal provisions unless either party objects 

under the cf ammonia supply agreement mosaic agreed to purchase approximately 523000 to 725000 metric tonnes of ammonia per year during a term that commenced in 2017 and may extend until december 31 2032 at a price tied to the prevailing price of us natural gas the contract provides for early termination at certain dates for 2021 our minimum purchase obligation was approximately 523000 metric tonnes and actual purchases were 580000 metric tonnes a specialized tug and barge unit transports ammonia for mosaic between a load location at donaldsonville louisiana and a discharge location at tampa florida additional information about this chartered unit and its financing is provided in note 23 of our consolidated financial statements we expect a majority of the ammonia purchased under the cf ammonia supply agreement to be received by barge at the port of tampa and delivered to our florida facilities as described in the preceding paragraph while the market prices of natural gas and ammonia have changed since we executed the cf ammonia supply agreement in 2013 and will continue to change we expect that the agreement will provide us a competitive advantage over its term including by providing a reliable longterm ammonia supply 

we produce ammonia at faustina louisiana primarily for our own consumption our annual capacity is approximately 530000 tonnes from time to time we sell surplus ammonia to unrelated parties andor may transport surplus ammonia to the port of tampa in addition under certain circumstances we are permitted to receive ammonia at faustina under the cf ammonia supply agreement 

although ammonia is readily available from many different suppliers and can be transported to our phosphates facilities by a variety of means ammonia is an important raw material used in our business that has in the past been and may in the future be the subject of volatile pricing in addition alternative transportation and terminaling facilities might not have sufficient capacity to fully serve all of our facilities in the event of a disruption to existing transportation or terminaling facilities changes in the price of ammonia or disruptions to ammonia transportation or terminaling could have a material impact on our business we have included a discussion of ammonia prices in our management’s analysis 

natural gas for phosphates 

natural gas is the primary raw material used to manufacture ammonia at our faustina facility ammonia is manufactured on site the majority of natural gas is purchased through firm delivery contracts based on published indexbased prices and is sourced from texas and louisiana via pipelines interconnected to the henry hub we use overthecounter swap andor 

option contracts to forward price portions of future natural gas purchases we typically purchase approximately 113 million mm btu of natural gas per year for use in ammonia production at faustina 

our ammonia requirements for our florida operations are purchased rather than manufactured on site therefore while we typically purchase approximately 25 million mm btu of natural gas per year in florida it is only used as a thermal fuel for various phosphate production processes 

florida land holdings 

we are a significant landowner in the state of florida which has in the past been considered one of the fastest areas of population growth in the united states we own land comprising over 317000 acres held in fee simple title in central florida and have the right to mine additional properties which contain phosphate rock reserves some of our land holdings are needed to operate our phosphates business while a portion of our land assets such as certain reclaimed properties are no longer required for our ongoing operations as a general matter more of our reclaimed property becomes available for uses other than for phosphate operations each year our real property assets are generally comprised of concentrates plants port facilities phosphate mines and other property which we have acquired through our presence in florida our longterm future land use strategy is to optimize the value of our land assets for example we developed streamsong resort ® the “ resort ” a destination resort and conference center in an area of previously mined land as part of our longterm business strategy to maximize the value and utility of our extensive land holdings in florida in addition to the hotel and conference center the resort includes three golf courses a clubhouse and ancillary facilities 

potash segment 

we are one of the leading potash producers in the world we mine and process potash in canada and the united states and sell potash in north america and internationally the term “potash” applies generally to the common salts of potassium muriate of potash “ mop ” is the primary source of potassium for the crop nutrient industry red mop has traces of iron oxide the granular and standard grade red mop products are well suited for direct fertilizer application and bulk blending white mop has a higher percent potassium oxide “ k 2 o ” white mop besides being well suited for the agricultural market is used in many industrial applications we also produce a double sulfate of potash magnesia product which we market under our brand name kmag ®  at our carlsbad new mexico facility 

our potash products are marketed worldwide to crop nutrient manufacturers distributors and retailers and are also used in the manufacturing of mixed crop nutrients and to a lesser extent in animal feed ingredients we also sell potash to customers for industrial use in addition our potash products are used for deicing and as a water softener regenerant 

in the first half of 2021 we operated two potash mines in canada including one shaft mine with a total of three production shafts and one solution mine as well as one potash shaft mine in the united states during the second quarter of 2021 due to increased brine inflows we made the decision to accelerate the timing of the shutdown of our k1 and k2 mine shafts at our esterhazy saskatchewan mine by approximately nine months in the third quarter we resumed production at our previously idled colonsay potash mine to offset a portion of the production lost by the early closure of the k1 and k2 shafts in december the k3 shaft became fully operational currently work is underway to decommission the k1 and k2 underground mines due to this closure we have eliminated future brine management costs at these locations we own related mills or refineries at our mines 

we also own a greenfield potash project in kronau saskatchewan approximately 27 kilometers southeast of regina saskatchewan in addition mosaic leases approximately 291500 acres of mineral rights from the government of saskatchewan and approximately 99700 acres of freehold mineral rights in the kronauregina area which have not been developed 

we pay canadian resource taxes consisting of the potash production tax and resource surcharge the potash production tax is a saskatchewan provincial tax on potash production and consists of a base payment and a profits tax we also pay a percentage of the value of resource sales from our saskatchewan mines in addition to the canadian resource taxes royalties are payable to the mineral owners in respect of potash reserves or production of potash we have included a further discussion of the canadian resource taxes and royalties in our management’s analysis 

the map below shows the location of each of our potash properties 

our north american potash annualized operational capacity totals 112 million tonnes of product per year and accounts for approximately 14 of world annual capacity and 32 of north american annual capacity production during 2021 totaled 82 million tonnes we account for approximately 12 of estimated world annual production and 33 of estimated north american annual production 

the following table shows for each of our potash mines annual capacity as of december 31 2021 and finished product output for 2021 

 

a finished product 

b actual production varies from annual operational capacity shown in the above table due to factors that include among others the level of demand for our products maintenance and turnaround time the quality of the reserves and the nature of the geologic formations we are mining at any particular time accidents mechanical failure product mix and other operating conditions 

c represents full capacity assuming no turnaround or maintenance time 

d the annualized proven peaking capacity shown above is the capacity currently used to determine our share of canpotex limited “ canpotex ” sales canpotex members’ respective shares of canpotex sales are based upon the members’ respective proven peaking capacities for producing potash when a canpotex member expands its production capacity the new capacity is added to that member’s proven peaking capacity based on a proving run at the maximum production level alternatively after january 2017 canpotex members may elect to rely on an independent engineering firm and approved protocols to calculate their proven peaking capacity the annual operational capacity reported in the table above can exceed the annualized proven peaking capacity until the proving run has been completed our entitlement percentage of canpotex is 362 in 2021 our realized percentage was 33 due to lower shipments as a result of the early closure of the k1 and k2 mine shafts at esterhazy 

e annual operational capacity is our estimated longterm potash capacity based on the quality of reserves and the nature of the geologic formations expected to be mined milled andor processed over the long term average amount of scheduled down time including maintenance and scheduled turnaround time and product mix and no significant modifications to operating conditions equipment or facilities operational capacities will continue to be updated to the extent new production results impact ore grades assumptions 

f we have the ability to reach an annual operating capacity of 21 million tonnes over time by increasing our staffing levels and investment in mine development activities in august 2019 we indefinitely idled our colonsay saskatchewan mine in the third quarter of 2021 we restarted operations at colonsay to offset a portion of the production lost by the early closure of k1 and k2 

g in june 2021 we permanently ceased operations at the k1 and k2 mine shafts the annual operational capacity of esterhazy has remained consistent following the k1 and k2 closures based on the accelerated rampup in capacity from the k3 mine shafts 

h kmag ® is a specialty product that we produce at our carlsbad facility 

see item 2 “properties” for a discussion of our potash mining properties including processing methods facilities production and summaries of our mineral resources and reserves both in the aggregate and for our individual material potash mining properties 

natural gas 

natural gas is used at our belle plaine solution mine as a fuel to produce steam and to dry potash products the steam is used to generate electricity and provide thermal energy to the evaporation crystallization and solution mining processes the belle plaine solution mine typically accounts for approximately 80 of our potash segment’s total natural gas requirements for potash production at our shaft mines natural gas is used as a fuel to heat fresh air supplied to the shaft mines and for drying potash products combined natural gas usage for both the solution and shaft mines totaled 17 million mm btu during 2021 we purchase our natural gas requirements on firm delivery index pricebased physical contracts and on shortterm spotpriced physical contracts our canadian operations purchase physical natural gas from alberta and saskatchewan using aeco price indices references and transport the gas to our plants via the transgas pipeline system the us potash operation in new mexico purchases physical gas in the southwest respective regional market using the el paso san juan basin market pricing reference we use financial derivative contracts to manage the pricing on portions of our natural gas

mosaic fertilizantes segment 

our mosaic fertilizantes segment owns and operates mines chemical plants crop nutrient blending and bagging facilities port terminals and warehouses in brazil and paraguay which produce and sell concentrated phosphates crop nutrients phosphatebased animal feed ingredients and pot a sh fertilizer the following map shows the locations of our operations in brazil and paraguay 

we are the largest producer and one of the largest distributors of blended crop nutrients for agricultural use in brazil we produce and sell phosphateand potashbased crop nutrients and animal feed ingredients through our operations our operations in brazil include five phosphate mines four chemical plants and a potash mine we own and operate ten blending plants in brazil and one blending plant and port in paraguay in addition we lease several other warehouses and blending units depending on sales and production levels we also have a 62 ownership interest in fospar sa “ fospar ” fospar owns and operates an ssp defined below granulation plant which produces approximately 05 million tonnes of ssp per year and a deepwater port and throughput warehouse terminal facility in paranagua brazil the port facility at paranagua handles approximately 36 million tonnes of imported crop nutrients in 2021 mosaic fertilizantes sold approximately 101 million tonnes of crop nutrient products and accounted for approximately 20 of fertilizer shipments in brazil 

we have the capability to annually produce approximately 44 million tonnes of phosphateand potashbased crop nutrients and animal feed ingredients crop nutrient products produced are marketed to crop nutrient manufacturers distributors retailers and farmers 

in addition to producing crop nutrients mosaic fertilizantes purchases phosphates potash and nitrogen products which are either used to produce blended crop nutrients “ blends ” or for resale in 2021 mosaic fertilizantes purchased 21 million 

tonnes of phosphatebased products primarily microessentials ®  from our phosphates segment and 25 million tonnes of potash products from our potash segment and canpotex 

phosphate crop nutrients and animal feed ingredients 

our brazilian phosphates operations have capacity to produce approximately 11 million tonnes of p 2 o 5 per year or about 69 of brazilian annual capacity phosphoric acid is produced by reacting ground phosphate rock with sulfuric acid p 2 o 5 is the key building block for the production of high analysis or concentrated phosphate crop nutrients and animal feed products and is the most comprehensive measure of phosphate capacity and production and a commonly used benchmark in our industry our brazilian p 2 o 5 production totaled approximately 10 million tonnes in 2021 and accounted for approximately 90 of brazilian annual output 

our principal phosphate crop nutrient products are 

• monoammonium phosphate 11520  “ map ”  map is a crop nutrient composed of two macronutrients nitrogen and phosphoric acid this slurry is added inside a rotary drum type granulator with ammonia to complete the neutralization reaction and produce map 

• triple superphosphate  “ tsp ”  tsp is a highly concentrated phosphate crop nutrient tsp is produced from the phosphate rock reaction with phosphoric acid in a kuhlmann type reactor the process for the production of tsp in brazil is run of pile where the product undergoes a curing process of approximately seven days for later granulation 

• single superphosphate  “ ssp ”  ssp is a crop nutrient with a low concentration of phosphorus that is used in agriculture because of the sulfur content in its formulation ssp is produced from mixing phosphate rock with sulfuric acid in a kuhlmann or malaxador type reactor after the reaction the product goes to the curing process and then feeds the granulation units 

• dicalcium phosphate  “ dcp ”  dicalcium phosphate is produced by the reaction of desulphurized phosphoric acid with limestone at uberaba it is produced from the reaction of concentrated phosphoric acid with limestone slurry at cajati the phosphoric acid is diluted with dry limestone the reaction of the dcp occurs in a kuhlmann or spinden type reactor 

our primary mines and chemical plants are located in the states of minas gerais são paulo and goias production of our animal feed ingredients products is located at our uberaba minas gerais and cajati são paulo facilities we market our feed phosphate primarily under the brand name foscálcio 

annual capacity and production volume by plant as of december 31 2021 are listed below 

 

a our ability to produce processed phosphates has been less than our annual operational capacity as stated in the table above except to the extent we purchase phosphoric acid factors affecting actual production are described in note c below 

b the annual production capacity was calculated using the hourly capacity days stopped for annual maintenance and oee historical utilization factor and capacity factor 

c actual production varies from annual operational capacity shown in the table above due to factors that include among others the level of demand for our products maintenance and turnaround time accidents and mechanical failure 

the phosphoric acid produced at cajati is used to produce dcp the phosphoric acid produced at uberaba is used to produce map tsp and dcp 

we produced approximately 29 million tonnes of concentrated phosphate crop nutrients during 2021 which accounted for approximately 51 of estimated brazilian annual production

phosphate rock is the key mineral used to produce phosphate crop nutrients and animal feed product our phosphate rock production in brazil totaled approximately 40 million tonnes in 2021 which accounted for approximately 73 of estimated brazilian annual production we are the largest producer of phosphate rock in brazil and currently operate five properties with a combined annual capacity of approximately 46 million tonnes production of one tonne of map requires 16 to 17 tonnes of phosphate rock production of one tonne of ssp requires between 06 to 07 tonnes of phosphate rock production of one tonne of tsp requires 14 tonnes of phosphate rock 

during 2021 we operated five properties araxá patrocínio and tapira in the state of minas gerais catalão in the state of goiás and cajati in the state of são paulo 

see item 2 “properties” for a discussion of our brazilian mining properties including processing methods facilities production and summaries of our mineral resources and reserves both in the aggregate and for our individually material brazilian properties 

we are required to pay royalties to mineral owners and resource taxes to the brazilian government for phosphate and potash production the resource taxes known as compensação financeira pela exploração de recursos minerais or cfem  are regulated by the national mining agency in 2021 we paid royalties and resource taxes of approximately 93 million 

sulfur 

we use molten sulfur at our phosphates concentrates plants to produce sulfuric acid one of the key components used in the production of phosphoric acid we consumed approximately 12 million long tons of sulfur for our own production during 2021 we purchase approximately 26 of the volume under annual supply agreements from oil and natural gas refiners who are required to remove or recover sulfur during the refining process the remaining 74 is purchased in the spot market sulfur is imported through the tiplam port and transported by rail to the uberaba plant and by truck to the araxá and cajati locations 

although sulfur is readily available from many different suppliers and can be transported to our phosphate facilities by a variety of means sulfur is an important raw material used in our business that has in the past been and could in the future be subject to volatile pricing and availability alternative transportation and terminaling facilities might not have sufficient capacity to fully serve all of our facilities in the event of a disruption to current transportation or terminaling facilities changes in the price of sulfur or disruptions or sulfur transportation or terminaling facilities could have a material impact on our business 

ammonia 

we use ammonia together with phosphoric acid to produce map and to a lesser extent for ssp production we consumed approximately 133507 tonnes of ammonia during 2021 production of one tonne of map requires approximately 0137 tonnes of ammonia we purchase all of our ammonia under a longterm supply agreement with two suppliers ammonia is imported through the tiplam port and transported by truck to uberaba araxá and catalão 

we own approximately 1 of the tiplam terminal in santos são paulo our ownership percentage along with a contractual agreement guarantee us unloading priority for ammonia and also provide us unloading capacity for rock sulfur and crop nutrients 

although ammonia is readily available from many different suppliers and can be transported to our phosphates facilities by a variety of means ammonia is an important raw material used in our business that has in the past been and in the future could be subject to volatile pricing alternative transportation and terminaling facilities might not have sufficient capacity to fully serve all of our facilities in the event of a disruption to existing transportation or terminaling facilities changes in the price of ammonia or disruptions to ammonia transportation of terminaling could have a material impact on our business 

brazilian potash 

we conduct potash operations through the leased taquarivassouras shaft mine which is the only potash mine in brazil located in rosário do catete in the brazilian state of sergipe we also own a related refinery at the site we produce and sell potash product domestically mop is the primary source of potassium for the crop nutrient industry in brazil red mop has traces of iron oxide the granular and standard grade red mop products are wellsuited for direct fertilizer application and bulk blending our potash product is marketed in brazil to crop nutrient manufacturers distributors and retailers and is also used in the manufacturing of crop nutrients 

in 2021 we paid royalties of approximately 7 million related to the leasing of potash assets and mining rights for taquari 

land holdings 

mosaic fertilizantes owns properties and the surface rights of certain additional rural lands comprising over 35000 hectares 86500 acres in the states of são paulo minas gerais goiás paraná mato grosso santa catarina bahia and sergipe and has the right to mine additional properties which contain phosphate rock or potash reserves most of our land holdings are needed to operate our phosphate and potash production and fertilizer distribution businesses a portion of our land assets may no longer be required for our current operations and may be leased to third parties for agricultural or other purposes or may be set aside for mineral or environmental conservation our real property assets are generally comprised of concentrates plants port facilities and phosphate and potash mines crop nutrient blending and bagging facilities and other properties which we have acquired through our presence in brazil 

india and china distribution businesses 

our china and india distribution businesses market phosphate potash and nitrogenbased crop nutrients and provide other ancillary services to wholesalers cooperatives independent retailers and farmers in the asiapacific regions these operations provide our phosphates and potash segments access to key markets outside of north and south america and serve as a marketing agent for our phosphates segment in 2021 the india and china operations purchased 294729 tonnes of phosphatebased products from our phosphates segment and mwspc and 1105257 tonnes of potash products from our potash segment and canpotex they also purchase phosphates potash and nitrogen products from unrelated third parties which we either use to produce blended crop nutrients or for resale 

in china we own two 300000tonne per year capacity blending plants in 2021 we sold approximately 175000 tonnes of blends and distributed another 815000 tonnes of phosphate and potash crop nutrients in china 

in india we have distribution facilities to import and sell crop nutrients in 2021 we distributed approximately 635000 tonnes of phosphate and potash crop nutrient products in india 

sales and distribution activities 

united states and canada 

we have a united states and canada sales and marketing team that serves our business segments we sell to wholesale distributors retail chains cooperatives independent retailers and national accounts 

customer service and the ability to effectively minimize the overall supply chain costs are key competitive factors in the crop nutrient and animal feed ingredients businesses in addition to our production facilities to service the needs of our customers we own or have contractual throughput or other arrangements at strategically located distribution warehouses along or near the mississippi and ohio rivers as well as in other key agricultural regions of the united states and canada from these facilities we distribute mosaicproduced phosphate and potash products for customers who in turn resell the product into the distribution channel or directly to farmers in the united states and canada 

we own port facilities in tampa florida which have deep water berth capabilities providing access to the gulf of mexico we also own warehouse distribution facilities in savage minnesota rosemount minnesota pekin illinois and henderson kentucky the savage minnesota facility has been idled awaiting decisions on future use or sale 

in addition to the facilities that we own our us distribution operations also include leased distribution space or contractual throughput agreements in other key geographical areas including california florida illinois indiana iowa kentucky louisiana minnesota missouri nebraska north dakota ohio oklahoma texas and wisconsin 

our canadian customers include independent dealers and national accounts we also lease or own warehouse facilities in saskatchewan ontario quebec and manitoba in canada 

international 

outside of the united states and canada we market our phosphates segment’s products through our mosaic fertilizantes segment and our china and india distribution businesses as well as a salesforce focused on geographies outside of north america the countries that account for the largest amount of our phosphates sales outside the united states by volume are brazil canada colombia and mexico 

our sales outside of the united states and canada of potash products are made through canpotex canpotex sales are allocated between its members based on peaking capacity in 2021 our entitlement percentage of canpotex is 362 

our potash exports from carlsbad are sold through our own sales force we also market our potash segment’s products through our mosaic fertilizantes segment and our china and india distribution businesses which acquire potash primarily through canpotex the countries that account for the largest amount of international potash sales by volume are brazil china indonesia india and malaysia 

to service the needs of our customers our mosaic fertilizantes segment includes a network of strategically located sales offices crop nutrient blending and bagging facilities port terminals and warehouse distribution facilities that we own and operate the blending and bagging facilities primarily produce blends from phosphate potash and nitrogen the average product mix in our blends by volume contains approximately 18 nitrogen 50 phosphate and 32 potash although this mix differs based on seasonal and other factors all of our production in brazil is consumed within the country 

our india and china distribution businesses also includes a network of strategically located sales offices crop nutrient blending and bagging facilities port terminals and warehouse distribution facilities these businesses serve primarily as a sales outlet for our north american phosphates production as well as additional phosphate production we market from our mwspc joint venture both for resale and as an input for blends our potash segment also has historically furnished the majority of the raw materials needs for the production of blends primarily via canpotex and is expected to continue to do so in the future 

other products 

with a strong brand position in a multibillion dollar animal feed ingredients global market our phosphates segment supplies animal feed ingredients for poultry and livestock to customers in north america latin america and asia our potash sales to nonagricultural users are primarily to large industrial accounts and the animal feed industry additionally in north america we sell potash for deicing and as a water softener regenerant in brazil we also sell phosphogypsum 

competition 

because crop nutrients are global commodities available from numerous sources crop nutrition companies compete primarily on the basis of delivered price other competitive factors include product quality cost and availability of raw materials customer service plant efficiency and availability of product as a result markets for our products are highly competitive we compete with a broad range of domestic and international producers including farmer cooperatives subsidiaries of larger companies and independent crop nutrient companies foreign competitors may have access to cheaper raw materials may not have to comply with as stringent regulatory requirements or are owned or subsidized by governments and as a result may have cost advantages over north american companies we believe that our extensive north american and international production and distribution system provides us with a competitive advantage by allowing us to achieve economies of scale transportation and storage efficiencies and obtain market intelligence also we believe our performance products such as microessentials ®  provide us a competitive advantage with customers in north and south america 

unlike many of our competitors we have our own distribution system to sell phosphate and potashbased crop nutrients and animal feed ingredients whether produced by us or by other third parties around the globe in north america we have one of the largest and most strategically located distribution systems for crop nutrients including warehouse facilities in key agricultural regions we also have an extensive network of distribution facilities internationally including in the key growth regions of south america and asia with port terminals warehouses and blending plants in brazil paraguay china and india our global presence allows us to efficiently serve customers in approximately 40 countries 

phosphates segment 

our phosphates segment operates in a highly competitive global market among the competitors in the global phosphate industry are domestic and foreign companies as well as foreign governmentsupported producers in asia and north africa phosphate producers compete primarily based on price as well as product quality service and innovation major integrated producers of feed phosphates are located in the united states europe and china many smaller producers are located in emerging markets around the world many of these smaller producers are not miners of phosphate rock or manufacturers of phosphoric acid and are required to purchase this material on the open market 

we believe that we are a lowcost integrated producer of phosphatebased crop nutrients due in part to our scale vertical integration and strategic network of production and distribution facilities as the world’s second largest producer of concentrated phosphates as well as the second largest miner of phosphate rock in the world and the largest in the united states we maintain an advantage over some competitors as the scale of operations effectively reduces production costs per unit we are also vertically integrated to captively supply one of our key inputs phosphate rock to our phosphate production facilities we believe that our position as an integrated producer of phosphate rock provides us with a significant cost advantage over competitors that are nonintegrated phosphate producers in addition our ownership in the miski mayo mine allows us to supplement our overall phosphate rock needs we also sell approximately 25 of miski mayo production to third parties mwspc enables us to not only further diversify our sources of phosphates but also improve our access to key agricultural countries in asia and the middle east 

we produce ammonia at our faustina louisiana concentrates plant in quantities sufficient to meet approximately one third of our total ammonia needs in north america we do not have ammonia production capacity within florida to serve our florida operations but we have capacity to supply a portion of our requirements by transporting produced ammonia from louisiana to florida we purchase additional ammonia from world markets and thus are subject to significant volatility in our purchase price of ammonia the cf ammonia supply agreement provides us with a longterm supply of a substantial volume of ammonia at prices based on the price of natural gas 

with our dedicated sulfur transportation barges and tugs and our 50 ownership interest in gulf sulphur services we are also wellpositioned to source an adequate flexible and costeffective supply of sulfur our third key input to our florida and louisiana phosphate production facilities we believe that our investments in sulfur logistical and melting assets continue to afford us a competitive advantage compared to other producers in cost and access to sulfur 

with facilities in both central florida and louisiana we are logistically well positioned to fulfill our material needs at very competitive prices those multiple production points also afford us the flexibility to optimally balance supply and demand 

potash segment 

potash is a commodity available from several geographical regions around the world and consequently the market is highly competitive through our participation in canpotex we compete outside of north america against various independent and stateowned potash producers canpotex has substantial expertise and logistical resources for the international distribution of potash including strategically located export assets in portland oregon st john new brunswick and vancouver british columbia our principal methods of competition with respect to the sale of potash include product pricing and offering consistent highquality products and superior service we believe that our potash cost structure is competitive in the industry and should improve as we continue to complete our potash expansion projects 

mosaic fertilizantes 

the mosaic fertilizantes segment operates in a highly competitive market in brazil we compete with a broad range of domestic and international producers including farmer cooperatives subsidiaries of larger companies and independent crop nutrient companies we believe that having a vertically integrated business internationally but also in brazil provides us with a competitive advantage by allowing us to achieve economies of scale transportation and storage efficiencies and obtain market intelligence 

mosaic fertilizantes has a wide variety of customers including farmers blenders and other local distributors we compete with local businesses that offer a wide variety of products that are available from many sources we believe the strategic location of our mines and chemical plants in close proximity to our customers and the benefit of our own distribution network gives us an advantage over most of our competitors the vertical integration of our whollyowned production along with our distribution network as well as our focus on product innovation and customer solutions position us with an 

advantage over many of our competitors we have a strong brand in brazil in addition to having access to our own production our distribution activities have the capability to supply a wide variety of crop nutrients to our dealerfarmer customer base 

factors affecting demand 

our results of operations historically have reflected the effects of several external factors which are beyond our control and have in the past produced significant downward and upward swings in operating results revenues are highly dependent upon conditions in the agriculture industry and can be affected by among other factors crop conditions changes in agricultural production practices worldwide economic conditions including the increasing world population household incomes and demand for more proteinrich food particularly in developing regions such as china india and latin america changing demand for biofuels variability in commodity pricing governmental policies the level of inventories in the crop nutrient distribution channels customer expectations about farmer economics future crop nutrient prices and availability and transportation costs among other matters market trends in raw material costs market prices for crop nutrients and weather furthermore our crop nutrients business is seasonal to the extent farmers and agricultural enterprises in the markets in which we compete purchase more crop nutrient products during the spring and fall the international scope of our business spanning the northern and southern hemispheres reduces to some extent the seasonal impact on our business the degree of seasonality of our business can change significantly from year to year due to conditions in the agricultural industry and other factors the seasonal nature of our businesses requires significant working capital for inventory in advance of the planting seasons 

we sell products throughout the world unfavorable changes in trade protection laws policies and measures government policies and other regulatory requirements affecting trade unexpected changes in tax and trade treaties and strengthening or weakening of foreign economies as well as political relations with the united states may cause sales trends to customers in one or more foreign countries to differ from sales trends in the united states 

our international operations are subject to risks from changes in foreign currencies or government policy which can affect local farmer economics

 item 1a risk factors  

our business financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of the risks and uncertainties described below 

operational risks 

the covid19 pandemic may materially adversely affect our business operations and financial condition 

the covid19 pandemic continues to impact the global economy and could significantly disrupt our operations key suppliers or thirdparty logistics providers customers and ultimate endusers due to the spread of the virus shelter in place orders quarantines or other measures implemented to prevent the spread of the virus in some instances the pandemic has impacted our business as part of government mandates our patrocinio operations in brazil and miski mayo operations in peru were temporarily suspended at the onset of the pandemic but have since resumed operations businesses have been impacted by shortterm labor shortages due to illness transportation issues such as trucking delays and port congestion which are slowing delivery of inputs to facilities and products to end customers at this time the company has only experienced limited adverse financial and operational covid19 related conditions 

an increase in severity to our employees customers vendors or supply chain or governmental mandates could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition andor results of operations the extent to which the covid19 pandemic impacts our operations and financial results will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain including new information concerning the severity of the virus and variants and the cost time and actions taken to contain its impact 

other cascading effects of the covid19 pandemic that are not currently foreseeable could materially increase our costs negatively impact our revenue andor adversely impact our results of operations and liquidity possibly to a significant degree we cannot predict the severity or duration of any such impacts the covid19 pandemic could also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this item 1a of this 10k report 

our operating results are highly dependent upon and fluctuate based upon business and economic conditions and governmental policies affecting the agricultural industry in which we or our customers operate these factors are outside of our control and may significantly affect our profitability 

the most important of these factors are 

• weather and field conditions particularly during periods of traditionally high crop nutrients consumption 

• quantities of crop nutrients imported and exported 

• current and projected inventories and prices which are heavily influenced by us exports and worldwide markets and 

• governmental policies including farm and biofuel policies which may directly or indirectly influence the number of acres planted the level of inventories the mix of crops planted or crop prices or otherwise negatively affect our operating results 

international market conditions which are also outside of our control may also significantly influence our operating results the international market for crop nutrients is influenced by such factors as the relative value of the us dollar and its impact upon the cost of importing crop nutrients foreign agricultural policies including subsidy policies the existence of or changes in import or foreign currency exchange barriers in certain foreign markets changes in the hard currency demands of certain countries and other regulatory policies of foreign governments as well as the laws and policies of the united states affecting foreign trade and investment including use of tariffs in 2020 we filed petitions with the doc and itc that requested the initiation of countervailing duty investigations into imports of phosphate fertilizers from morocco and russia the purpose of the petitions was to remedy the distortions that we believe foreign subsidies have caused or are causing in the us market for phosphate fertilizers and thereby restore fair competition during the first quarter of 2021 the doc made final affirmative determinations that countervailable subsidies were being provided by those governments and the itc made final affirmative determinations that the us phosphate fertilizer industry is materially injured by reason of subsidized phosphate fertilizer imports from morocco and russia as a result of these determinations the doc issued countervailing duty orders on phosphate fertilizer imports from russia and morocco which are scheduled to remain in place for at least five years currently the cash deposit rates for such imports are approximately 20 percent for moroccan producer ocp 9 percent and 47 percent for russian producers phosagro and eurochem respectively and 17 percent for all other russian producers the final determinations in the doc and itc investigations are subject to possible challenges before us federal courts and the world trade organization and mosaic has initiated actions at the us court of international trade contesting certain aspects of the doc’s final determinations that we believe failed to capture the full extent of moroccan and russian phosphate fertilizer subsidies moroccan and russian producers have also initiated us court of international trade actions seeking lower cash deposit rates and revocation of the countervailing duty orders further the cash deposit rates and the amount of countervailing duties owed by importers on such imports could change based on the results of the doc’s annual administrative review proceedings if the final determinations are challenged and subsequently reversed the results could have an adverse effect on our business andor our financial condition or operating results 

our crop nutrient business is seasonal and varies based on application rates which may result in carrying significant amounts of inventory and seasonal variations in working capital and our inability to predict future seasonal crop nutrient demand accurately may result in excess inventory or product shortages 

the use of crop nutrients is seasonal and varies based on application rates farmers tend to apply crop nutrients during two short application periods the strongest one in the spring before planting and the other in the fall after harvest as a result the strongest demand for our products typically occurs during the spring planting season with a second period of strong demand following the fall harvest in contrast we and other crop nutrient producers generally produce our products throughout the year as a result we andor our customers generally build inventories during the low demand periods of the year in order to ensure timely product availability during the peak sales seasons the seasonality of crop nutrient demand results in our sales volumes and net sales typically being the highest during the north american spring season and our working capital requirements typically being the highest just prior to the start of the spring season our quarterly financial results can vary significantly from one year to the next due to weatherrelated shifts in planting schedules and purchasing patterns 

if seasonal demand exceeds our projections we will not have enough product and our customers may acquire products from our competitors which would negatively impact our profitability if seasonal demand is less than we expect we will be left with excess inventory and higher working capital and liquidity requirements the degree of seasonality of our business can change significantly from year to year due to conditions in the agricultural industry and other factors 

changes in transportation costs can affect our sales volumes and selling prices 

the cost of delivery is a significant factor in the total cost to customers and farmers of crop nutrients as a result changes in transportation costs or in customer expectations about them can affect our sales volumes and prices 

a disruption to our production distribution or terminaling facilities could have a material adverse impact on our business the risk of material disruption increases when demand for our products results in high operating rates at our facilities 

we conduct our operations through a limited number of key production distribution and terminaling facilities these facilities include our phosphate mines and concentrates plants our potash mines and the ports and other distribution facilities through which we canpotex and the other joint ventures in which we participate conduct our respective businesses as well as other commercial arrangements with unrelated third parties any disruption of operations at any one of these facilities has the possibility of significantly negatively affecting our production or our ability to distribute our products 

examples of the types of events that could result in a disruption at one of these facilities include adverse weather strikes or other work stoppages civil unrest deliberate malicious acts including acts of terrorism and armed conflict political or economic instability cyberattacks changes in permitting financial assurance or certain environmental health and safety laws or other changes in the regulatory environment in which we operate legal and regulatory proceedings our relationships with the other member of canpotex and the other joint ventures in which we participate and their or our exit from participation in such joint ventures other changes in our commercial arrangements with unrelated third parties brine inflows at our esterhazy saskatchewan mine or our other shaft mines mechanical failure and accidents or other failures occurring in the course of operating activities including at our gypstacks clay settling areas and tailing dams accidents occurring in the course of operating activities lack of truck rail barge or ship transportation and other factors 

reduced oil refinery operating rates in the united states could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition or operating results 

reduced oil refinery operating rates in the us and canada could result in decreased availability of molten sulfur which could increase costs of sulfur procurement or decrease availability of sulfur needed in our phosphate fertilizer production operations we have not yet become subject to such results in the sulfur procurement markets if it becomes necessary to procure sulfur at higher costs and if we are unable to pass those costs on in our product prices or if we are unable to procure sulfur at volumes necessary for our operations such events could have a material adverse effect on our phosphate business andor our financial condition or operating results 

important raw materials and energy used in our businesses in the past have been and may in the future be the subject of volatile pricing changes in the price of our raw materials have had and could again have a material adverse impact on our businesses 

natural gas ammonia and sulfur are key raw materials used in the manufacture of phosphate crop nutrient products natural gas is used as both a chemical feedstock and a fuel to produce anhydrous ammonia which is a raw material used in the production of concentrated phosphate products natural gas is also a significant energy source used in the potash solution mining process from time to time our profitability has been and may in the future be adversely impacted by the price and availability of these raw materials and other energy costs because most of our products are commodities there can be no assurance that we will be able to pass through increased costs to our customers a significant increase in the price of natural gas ammonia sulfur or energy costs that is not recovered through an increase in the price of our related crop nutrients products could have a material adverse impact on our business in addition under our longterm cf ammonia supply agreement we have agreed to purchase approximately 545000 to 725000 tonnes of ammonia per year during a term that may extend until december 31 2032 and at a price to be determined by a formula based on the prevailing price of us natural gas if the price of natural gas rises or the market price for ammonia falls outside of the range anticipated at execution of this agreement we may not realize a cost benefit from the natural gasbased pricing over the term of the agreement or the 

cost of our ammonia under the agreement could become a competitive disadvantage at times we have paid considerably more for ammonia under the agreement than what we would have paid had we purchased it in the spot market 

we are subject to risks associated with our international sales and operations which could negatively affect our sales to customers in foreign countries as well as our operations and assets in foreign countries some of these factors may also make it less attractive to distribute cash generated by our operations outside the united states to our stockholders or to utilize cash generated by our operations in one country to fund our operations or repayments of indebtedness in another country or to support other corporate purposes 

for 2021 we derived approximately 68 of our net sales from customers located outside of the united states as a result we are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties relating to international sales and operations including 

• difficulties and costs associated with complying with a wide variety of complex laws treaties and regulations 

• unexpected changes in regulatory environments 

• increased government ownership and regulation of the economy in the countries we serve 

• political and economic instability including the possibility for terrorism armed conflict  civil unrest inflation and adverse economic conditions resulting from governmental attempts to reduce inflation such as imposition of higher interest rates and wage and price controls 

• unpredictable tax audit practices of various governments 

• nationalization of properties by foreign governments 

• the imposition of tariffs exchange controls trade barriers or other restrictions or governmentimposed increases in the cost of resources and materials necessary for the conduct of our operations or the completion of strategic initiatives including with respect to our joint ventures and 

• currency exchange rate fluctuations between the us dollar and foreign currencies particularly the brazilian real and the canadian dollar 

the occurrence of any of the above in the countries in which we operate or elsewhere could jeopardize or affect our ability to transact business there and could adversely affect our revenues and operating results and the value of our assets located outside of the united states 

in addition tax regulations and tax audit practices currency exchange controls and other restrictions may also make it economically unattractive to 

• distribute cash generated by our operations outside the united states to our stockholders or 

• utilize cash generated by our operations in one country to fund our operations or repayments of indebtedness in another country or to support other corporate purposes 

our assets outside of north america are located in countries with volatile conditions which could subject us and our assets to significant risks 

we are a global business with substantial assets located outside of the united states and canada our operations in brazil china india and paraguay are a fundamental part of our business we have a majority interest in the joint venture entity operating the miski mayo mine in peru that supplies phosphate rock to us we also have a minority joint venture investment in mwspc which operates a mine and chemical complexes that produce phosphate fertilizers and other downstream products in the kingdom of saudi arabia volatile economic market and political conditions may have a negative impact on our operations operating results and financial condition in addition unfavorable changes in trade protection laws policies and measures or governmental actions and policies and other regulatory requirements affecting trade and the pricing and sourcing of our raw materials may also have a negative impact on our operations operating results and financial condition 

natural resource extraction is an important part of the economy in peru and in the past there have been protests against other natural resource operations in peru there remain numerous social conflicts that exist within the natural resource sector in peru as a result there is potential for active protests against natural resource companies if the government of peru’s proactive efforts to address the social and environmental issues surrounding natural resource activities are not successful protests could extend to or impact the miski mayo mine and adversely affect our interest in the miski mayo joint venture or the supply of phosphate rock to us from the mine 

adverse weather conditions including the impact of hurricanes and excess heat cold snow rainfall and drought have in the past and may in the future adversely affect our operations and result in increased costs decreased sales or production and potential liabilities 

adverse weather conditions including the impact of hurricanes and excess heat cold snow rainfall and drought have in the past and may in the future adversely affect our operations particularly our phosphates business in the past hurricanes have resulted in physical damage to our facilities in florida and louisiana 

additionally water treatment costs due to high water balances tend to increase significantly following excess rainfall from hurricanes or other adverse weather some of our florida and louisiana facilities have had and others could have high water levels that have required or may require treatment high water balances in the past at phosphate facilities in florida also led the florida department of environmental protection “ fdep ” to adopt rules requiring phosphate production facilities to meet more stringent process water management objectives for phosphogypsum stack systems in addition to the fdep the usepa and the ldeq also have similar requirements for water management objectives as outlined in our rcrc cd ’ s 

if excess rainfall or hurricanes occur in coming years our facilities may be required to take additional measures to manage process water to comply with existing or future requirements and these measures could potentially have a material effect on our business and financial condition 

adverse weather may also cause a loss of production and may disrupt our supply chain or adversely affect delivery of our products to our customers for example oil refineries that supply sulfur to us may suspend operations as a result of a hurricane and incoming shipments of ammonia can be delayed disrupting production at our florida or louisiana facilities and delivery of our products in the second half of 2021 we experienced production impacts related to hurricane ida 

excess rainfall and drought have in the past and may in the future adversely affect us for example in 2019 we experienced the wettest year in north america in nearly 50 years which reduced fertilizer applications by farmers excess rainfall also resulted in higher river levels which adversely affected delivery of our products drought can reduce farmers’ crop yields and the uptake of phosphates and potash reducing the need for application of additional phosphates and potash for the next planting season drought can also lower river levels adversely affecting delivery of our products to our customers 

we do not own a controlling equity interest in our nonconsolidated companies some of which are foreign companies and therefore our operating results and cash flow may be materially affected by how the governing boards and majority owners operate such businesses there may also be limitations on monetary distributions from these companies that are outside of our control together these factors may lower our equity earnings or cash flow from such businesses and negatively impact our results of operations 

in 2013 we entered into an agreement to form mwspc a joint venture in which we hold a 25 interest to develop a mine and chemical complexes for an estimated 80 billion that produces phosphate fertilizers and other downstream products in the kingdom of saudi arabia the success of mwspc will depend on among other matters the completion of development and full commencement of operations of production facilities in the kingdom of saudi arabia the future success of current plans for completion of the development and for the operation of mwspc including the availability and affordability of necessary resources and materials and access to appropriate infrastructure and any future changes in those plans as well as the general economic and political stability of the region 

we also hold minority ownership interests in other companies that are not controlled by us we expect that the operations and results of mwspc will be and the operations or results of some of the other companies are significant to us and their operations can affect our earnings because we do not control these companies either at the board or stockholder levels and because local laws in foreign jurisdictions and contractual obligations may place restrictions on monetary distributions by these companies we cannot ensure that these companies will operate efficiently pay dividends or generally follow the desires of our management by virtue of our board or stockholder representation as a result these companies may contribute less than anticipated to our earnings and cash flow negatively impacting our results of operations and liquidity 

strikes or other forms of work stoppage or slowdown could disrupt our business and lead to increased costs 

our financial performance is dependent on a reliable and productive work force a significant portion of our workforce and that of the joint ventures in which we participate is covered by collective bargaining agreements with unions unsuccessful contract negotiations or adverse labor relations could result in strikes or slowdowns any disruption may decrease our 

production and sales or impose additional costs to resolve disputes the risk of adverse labor relations may increase as our profitability increases because labor unions’ expectations and demands generally rise at those times 

our underground potash shaft mines are subject to risks of water inflows 

over the past century several potash mines experiencing water inflow problems have flooded since december 1985 we have had inflows of salt saturated brine water into our esterhazy saskatchewan k1 and k2 potash mines due to an acceleration of brine inflows on june 4 2021 the company announced a closure of our k1 and k2 potash mine shafts eliminating the risk of brine inflows our potash mines at colonsay saskatchewan carlsbad new mexico and our esterhazy saskatchewan k3 mine though not contiguous with the k1k2 underground inflow region are also subject to risks from the inflow of water as a result of our underground shaft mining operations though minor inflows are regularly managed it is possible that significant water inflows could occur which may present risks to our employees and our operations and which may require us to incur brine management costs change our mining processes or abandon our operating mines  

see the “key factors that can affect results of operations and financial condition” and “potash net sales and gross margin” sections of our management’s analysis in this form 10k report and the esterhazy closure costs in note 25 of this report which sections are incorporated herein by reference for a discussion of costs risks and other information relating to the brine inflows 

accidents or equipment failures occurring in the course of our operating activities could result in significant liabilities interruptions or shutdowns of facilities or the need for significant safety or other expenditures 

we engage in mining and industrial activities that can result in serious accidents or experience equipment failures if our procedures are not effective or if an accident or equipment failure were to occur we could be subject to liabilities arising out of property damage personal injuries or death our operations could be interrupted and we might have to shut down or abandon affected facilities accidents could cause us to expend significant amounts to remediate safety issues or to repair damaged facilities and could result in significant liabilities andor impact on the financial performance of the company including material adverse effects on our results of operations liquidity or financial condition for example 

• some of our facilities are subject to potential damage from seismic activity 

the excavation of mines in some parts of the world can result in potential seismic events or can increase the likelihood or potential severity of a seismic event our esterhazy mine and southern louisiana facilities have experienced minor seismic events from time to time a significant seismic event at one our facilities or mines could result in serious injuries or death or damage to or flooding of operations or damage to adjoining properties or facilities of unrelated third parties 

• our underground potash shaft mines are subject to risk from fire in addition fire at one of our underground shaft mines could halt our operations at the affected mine while we investigate the origin of the fire or for longer periods for remedial work or otherwise 

our underground potash shaft mines at esterhazy and colonsay saskatchewan carlsbad new mexico and taquarivassouras brazil are subject to risk from fire in the event of a fire if our emergency procedures are not successful we could have significant injuries or deaths or shutdowns of our facilities or could cause us to expend significant amounts to remediate safety issues or repair damaged facilities 

• we handle significant quantities of ammonia at several of our facilities if our safety procedures are not effective an accident involving our ammonia operations could result in serious injuries or death or result in the shutdown of our facilities 

we produce ammonia at our faustina louisiana phosphate concentrates plant use ammonia in significant quantities at all of our florida and louisiana phosphates concentrates plants and store ammonia at some of our distribution facilities in florida ammonia is received at terminals in tampa and transported by pipelines and trucks to our facilities we also use ammonia in our brazil phosphate operations our ammonia is generally stored and transported at high pressures or cryogenically 

• we also use or produce other hazardous or volatile chemicals at some of our facilities if our safety procedures are not effective an accident involving these other hazardous or volatile chemicals could result in serious injuries or death or result in the shutdown of our facilities 

we use sulfuric acid in the production of concentrated phosphates in our florida and louisiana us operations and our brazil operations we also use or produce other hazardous or volatile chemicals at some of our facilities an accident involving any of these chemicals could result in serious injuries or death or evacuation of areas near an accident an accident could also result in property damage or shutdown of our facilities or cause us to expend significant amounts to remediate safety issues or to repair damaged facilities 

regulatory risks 

the environmental health and safety regulations and permitting requirements to which we are subject may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are subject to numerous environmental health and safety laws and regulations in the us canada china brazil and other countries in which we operate these laws and regulations govern a wide range of matters including environmental controls land reclamation discharges to air and water remediation of hazardous substance releases permitting requirements and in some cases demonstration of financial assurance they significantly affect our operating activities as well as the level of our operating costs and capital expenditures in some jurisdictions environmental laws change frequently and it may be difficult for us to determine if we are in compliance with all material environmental laws at any given time if we are not in compliance we may be subject to enforcement or thirdparty claims and may require new investment in our business in those circumstances our financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected 

the us comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act “ cercla ” imposes liability including for cleanup costs without regard to fault or to the legality of a party’s conduct on certain categories of persons including current and former owners and operators of a site and parties who are considered to have contributed to the release of “hazardous substances” into the environment under cercla or various us state analogues a party may under certain circumstances be required to bear more than its proportional share of cleanup costs at a site where it has liability if payments cannot be obtained from other responsible parties as a crop nutrient company producing and managing chemicals we periodically have incurred and may incur liabilities and cleanup costs under cercla and other environmental laws with regard to our current or former facilities adjacent or nearby thirdparty facilities or offsite disposal locations 

our operations including our mines are dependent on having the required permits and approvals from governmental authorities denial or delay by a government agency in issuing modifying or renewing any of our permits and approvals or imposition of restrictive or cost prohibitive conditions on us with respect to these permits and approvals may impair our business and operations and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

we have included additional discussion about permitting for our phosphate mines in florida under “environmental health safety and security matters – operating requirements and impacts – permitting” in our management’s analysis 

we are and may in the future be involved in legal and regulatory proceedings that could be material to us 

we have in the past been are currently and in the future may be subject to legal and regulatory proceedings that could be material to our business results of operations liquidity or financial condition joint ventures in which we participate could also become subject to these sorts of proceedings these proceedings may be brought by the government or private parties and may arise out of a variety of matters including 

• allegations that we have violated environmental health and safety laws and regulations or that we are responsible for nuisance or other conditions on nearby properties we are currently involved in proceedings alleging that or to review whether we have violated environmental laws in the united states and brazil 

• allegations by private parties that our operations have resulted in personal injury property damage or damage to business operations 

• antitrust commercial tax including tax audits and other disputes 

the legal and regulatory proceedings to which we are currently or may in the future be subject may depending on the circumstances result in monetary damage awards fines penalties other liabilities injunctions or other court or 

administrative rulings that interrupt impede or otherwise materially affect our business operations or criminal sanctions 

we have included additional information with respect to pending legal and regulatory proceedings in note 22 of our notes to consolidated financial statements and in this form 10k report in part i item 3 “legal proceedings” 

environmental health and safety and food and crop laws and regulations to which we are subject may become more stringent over time this could increase the effects on us of these laws and regulations and the increased effects could be materially adverse to our business operations liquidity andor results of operations 

heightened regulation on food and crop inputs including crop nutrients and environmental health and safety issues in the united states canada china brazil paraguay and other countries where we operate can be expected to result in requirements that apply to us and our operations that may be more stringent than those described elsewhere in this report these requirements may include 

• increased levels of future investments and expenditures for environmental controls at ongoing operations which will be charged against income from future operations increased levels of the financial assurance requirements to which we are subject and increased efforts or costs to obtain permits or denial of permits 

• new or interpretations of existing statutes or regulations that impose new or more stringent standards restrictions or liabilities related to elevated levels of naturallyoccurring radiation that arise on formerly mined land and other matters that could increase our expenses capital requirements or liabilities or adversely affect our business liquidity or financial condition 

in addition to the extent restrictions imposed in countries where our competitors operate such as china india former soviet union countries or morocco are less stringent than in the countries where we operate our competitors could gain cost or other competitive advantages over us these effects could be material 

we are subject to financial assurance requirements as part of our routine business operations if we were unable to satisfy financial assurance requirements we might not be able to obtain or maintain permits we need to operate our business as we have in the past in addition our compliance with these requirements could materially affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

in many cases as a condition to obtaining or maintaining permits and approvals or otherwise we are required to comply with financial assurance requirements of governmental authorities the purpose of these requirements is to provide comfort to the government that sufficient funds will be available for the ultimate closure postclosure care or reclamation of our facilities 

in some cases we are able to comply through the satisfaction of applicable state financial strength tests but if we are unable to do so we must utilize alternative methods of complying with these requirements if we do not we would be prevented from continuing our operations and also could be subject to enforcement proceedings brought by relevant government agencies potential alternative methods of compliance include providing credit support in the form of cash escrows or trusts surety bonds from surety or insurance companies letters of credit from banks or other forms of financial instruments or collateral to satisfy the financial assurance requirements in addition we could negotiate a consent agreement that establishes a different form of financial assurance use of alternative means of financial assurance imposes additional expense on us some of them such as letters of credit also use a portion of our available liquidity other alternative means of financial assurance such as surety bonds generally require us to obtain a discharge of the bonds or to post additional collateral typically in the form of cash or letters of credit at the request of the issuer of the bonds collateral that is required may be in forms that utilize a portion of our available liquidity or in the form of assets such as real estate which reduces our flexibility to manage or sell assets 

we have included additional discussion about financial assurance requirements under “offbalance sheet arrangements and obligations – other commercial commitments” in our management’s analysis 

regulatory restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions and climate change regulations in the united states canada or elsewhere could adversely affect us and these effects could be material 

various governmental initiatives to limit greenhouse gas emissions are under way or under consideration around the world these initiatives could restrict our operating activities require us to make changes in our operating activities that would increase our operating costs reduce our efficiency or limit our output require us to make capital improvements to our 

facilities increase our energy raw material and transportation costs or limit their availability or otherwise adversely affect our results of operations liquidity or capital resources and these effects could be material to us 

governmental greenhouse gas emission initiatives include among others the december 2015 agreement the “ paris agreement ” which was the outcome of the 21 st session of the conference of the parties under the united nations framework convention on climate change “ unfccc ”  the paris agreement which was signed by nearly 200 nations including the united states and canada entered into force in late 2016 and sets out a goal of limiting the average rise in temperatures for this century to below 2 degrees celsius each signatory is expected to develop its own plan referred to as a nationally determined contribution or “ ndc ” for reaching that goal 

in may 2017 the united states president announced that the united states would withdraw from the paris agreement on january 20 2021 the united states rejoined the paris agreement which was effective february 19 2021 previously  the us had submitted an ndc aiming to achieve by 2025 an economywide target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 2628 below its 2005 level the ndc also aims to use best efforts to reduce emissions by 28 the us target covers all greenhouse gases that were a part of the 2014 inventory of greenhouse gas emissions and sinks while the extent of the us ’ s involvement in the paris agreement and the status of this ndc is unclear various legislative or regulatory initiatives relating to greenhouse gases have been adopted or considered by the us congress the environmental protection agency “ epa ”  or various states and those initiatives already adopted may be used to implement a us ndc additionally more stringent laws and regulations may be enacted to accomplish the goals set out in the ndc 

brazil ratified the paris agreement on september 21 2016 committing to an ndc that includes an economywide target of 13 gtco2e by 2025 and 12 gtco2e by 2030 in 2020 brazil submitted a new ndc which reaffirms the country’s commitment to reducing total net greenhouse gas emissions by 37 in 2025 and by 43 in 2030 the ndc further commits to achieving climate neutrality in 2060 complete details surrounding brazil’s plan for achieving the greenhouse gas emissions reductions and climate neutrality are uncertain the government of brazil may intervene with new or different policy instruments to meet the goals set out in the 2020 ndc 

canada’s intended ndc aims to achieve by 2030 an economywide target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 4045 below 2005 levels the canadian federal government has also introduced legislation establishing a longterm target of “netzero” greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 more stringent laws and regulations may be enacted to accomplish the goals set out in canada’s ndc and canada’s own longterm emissions reduction targets 

it is possible that future legislation or regulation addressing climate change including in response to the paris agreement or any new international agreements could adversely affect our operating activities energy raw material and transportation costs results of operations liquidity or capital resources and these effects could be material or adversely impact our competitive advantage in addition to the extent climate change restrictions imposed in countries where our competitors operate such as india former soviet union countries or morocco are less stringent than in the united states canada or brazil our competitors could gain cost or other competitive advantages over us 

future climate change could adversely affect us 

the prospective impact of climate change on our operations and those of our customers and farmers remains uncertain scientists have hypothesized that the impacts of climate change could include changes in rainfall patterns water shortages changing sea levels changing storm patterns and intensities and changing temperature levels and that these changes could be severe these impacts could vary by geographic location severe climate change could impact our costs and operating activities the location and cost of global grain and oilseed production and the supply and demand for grains and oilseeds at the present time we cannot predict the prospective impact of climate change on our results of operations liquidity or capital resources or whether any such effects could be material to us 

we use tailings sediments and water dams to manage residual materials generated by our brazilian mining operations if our safety procedures are not effective an accident involving these impoundments could result in serious injuries or death damage to property or the environment or result in the shutdown of our facilities any of which could materially adversely affect our results of operations in brazil 

mining and processing of potash and phosphate generate residual materials that must be managed both during the operation of the facility and upon facility closure potash tailings consisting primarily of salt and clay are stored in surface disposal sites phosphate residuals from mining are deposited in large tailing dams in brazil and in clay settling areas and 

phosphogypsum stacks in the united states they are regularly monitored to evaluate structural stability and for leaks the failure of or a breach at any of our tailings dams and other impoundments at any of our operations could cause severe property and environmental damage and loss of life could result in the shut down or idling of our facilities and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

legislation at both brazilian federal and state levels has introduced new rules regarding tailings dam safety construction licensing and operations we cannot predict the full impact of these legislative or potentially related judicial actions or future actions or whether or how it would affect our brazilian operations or customers 

any accident involving our tailings or other dams or any shut down or idling of our related mines could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

competitive risks 

our competitive position could be adversely affected if we are unable to participate in continuing industry consolidation 

most of our products are readily available from a number of competitors and price and other competition in the crop nutrient industry is intense in addition crop nutrient production facilities and distribution activities frequently benefit from economies of scale as a result particularly during pronounced cyclical troughs the crop nutrient industry has a long history of consolidation mosaic itself is the result of a number of industry consolidations we expect consolidation among crop nutrient producers could continue our competitive position could suffer to the extent we are not able to expand our own resources either through consolidations acquisitions joint ventures or partnerships in the future we may not be able to find suitable companies to combine with assets to purchase or joint venture or partnership opportunities to pursue even if we are able to locate desirable opportunities we may not be able to enter into transactions on economically acceptable terms if we do not successfully participate in continuing industry consolidation our ability to compete successfully could be adversely affected and result in the loss of customers or an uncompetitive cost structure which could adversely affect our sales and profitability 

our strategy for managing market and interest rate risk may not be effective 

our businesses are affected by fluctuations in market prices for our products the purchase price of natural gas ammonia and sulfur consumed in operations freight and shipping costs foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates we periodically enter into derivatives and forward purchase contracts to mitigate some of these risks however our strategy may not be successful in minimizing our exposure to these fluctuations see “market risk” in our management’s analysis and note 14 of our notes to consolidated financial statements that is incorporated by reference in this report in part ii item 8 

a shortage or unavailability of railcars tugs barges and ships for carrying our products and the raw materials we use in our business could result in customer dissatisfaction loss of production or sales and higher transportation or equipment costs 

we rely heavily upon truck rail tug barge and ocean freight transportation to obtain the raw materials we need to distribute raw materials between our mines and concentrates facilities and to deliver our products to our customers in addition the cost of transportation is an important part of the final sale price of our products finding affordable and dependable transportation is important in obtaining our raw materials and to supply our customers higher costs for these transportation services or an interruption or slowdown due to factors including high demand high fuel prices labor disputes layoffs or other factors affecting the availability of qualified transportation workers adverse weather or other environmental events or changes to rail barge or ocean freight systems could negatively affect our ability to produce our products or deliver them to our customers which could affect our performance and results of operations 

strong demand for grain and other products and a strong world economy increase the demand for and reduce the availability of transportation both domestically and internationally shortages of railcars barges and ocean transport for carrying product and increased transit time may result in customer dissatisfaction loss of sales and higher equipment and transportation costs in addition during periods when the shipping industry has a shortage of ships the substantial time needed to build new ships prevents rapid market response delays and missed shipments due to transportation shortages including vessels barges railcars and trucks could result in customer dissatisfaction or loss of sales potential which could negatively affect our performance and results of operations 

our success will continue to depend on our ability to attract and retain highly qualified and motivated employees 

we believe our continued success depends on the collective abilities and efforts of our employees like many businesses a significant number of our employees including some of our most highly skilled employees with specialized expertise in general corporate matters potash and phosphates operations will be approaching retirement age throughout the next decade and beyond in addition we compete for a talented workforce with other businesses particularly within the mining and chemicals industries in general and the crop nutrients industry in particular our expansion plans are highly dependent on our ability to attract retain and train highly qualified and motivated employees who are essential to the success of our ongoing operations as well as to our expansion plans if we were to be unsuccessful in attracting retaining and training the employees we require our ongoing operations and expansion plans could be materially and adversely affected 

our most important products are global commodities and we face intense global competition from other crop nutrient producers that can affect our prices and volumes 

our most important products are concentrated phosphate crop nutrients including diammonium phosphate or dap monoammonium phosphate or map microessentials ® and muriate of potash or mop we sell most of our dap map and mop in the form of global commodities our sales of these products face intense global competition from other crop nutrient producers 

changes in competitors’ production or shifts in their marketing focus have in the past significantly affected both the prices at which we sell our products and the volumes that we sell and are likely to continue to do so in the future increases in the global supply of dap map and mop or competitors’ increased sales into regions in which we have significant sales could adversely affect our prices and volumes 

competitors and new entrants in the markets for both concentrated phosphate crop nutrients and potash have in recent years expanded capacity or begun or announced plans to expand capacity or build new facilities the extent to which current global or local economic and financial conditions changes in global or local economic and financial conditions or other factors may cause delays or cancellation of some of these ongoing or planned projects or result in the acceleration of existing or new projects is unclear in addition certain of our products sold to china may be subject to additional tariffs due to ongoing trade tensions between china and the united states the level of exports by chinese producers of concentrated phosphate crop nutrients depends to a significant extent on chinese government actions to curb exports through among other measures prohibitive export taxes at times when the government believes it desirable to assure ample domestic supplies of concentrated phosphate crop nutrients to stimulate grain and oilseed production 

in addition the other member of canpotex is among our competitors who may in the future i ndependently expand its potash production capacity at a time when each canpotex member’s respective shares of canpotex sales is based upon that member’s respective proven peaking capacity for producing potash when a canpotex member expands its production capacity the new capacity is added to that member’s proven peaking capacity based on a proving run at the maximum production level alternatively canpotex members may elect to rely on an independent engineering firm and approved protocols to calculate their proven peaking capacity antitrust and competition laws prohibit the members of canpotex from coordinating their production decisions including the timing of their respective proving runs worldwide potash production levels could exceed thencurrent market demand resulting in an oversupply of potash and lower potash prices 

all of the foregoing events are beyond our control the effects of any of these events occurring could be materially adverse to our results of operations 

some of our competitors and potential competitors have greater resources than we do which may place us at a competitive disadvantage and adversely affect our sales and profitability these competitors include stateowned and governmentsubsidized entities in other countries 

we compete with a number of producers throughout the world including stateowned and governmentsubsidized entities some of these entities have greater total resources than we do and may be less dependent on earnings from crop nutrients sales than we are in addition some of these entities have access to lower cost or governmentsubsidized natural gas supplies mining rights and reserves financing transportation and tax incentives placing us at a competitive disadvantage furthermore certain governments as owners of some of our competitors may be willing to accept lower prices and profitability on their products in order to support domestic employment or other political or social goals to the extent other 

producers of crop nutrients enjoy competitive advantages or are willing to accept lower profit levels the price of our products our sales volumes and our profits may be adversely affected 

industry risks 

future product or technological innovation could affect our business 

future product or technological innovations by third parties such as the development of seeds that require less crop nutrients the development of substitutes for our products or developments in the application of crop nutrients if they occur could have the potential to adversely affect the demand for our products and our results of operations liquidity and capital resources 

the success of our strategic initiatives depends on our ability to effectively manage these initiatives and to successfully integrate and grow acquired businesses 

we have significant ongoing strategic initiatives including our plans to expand the annual production capacity of our potash business and mwspc these strategic initiatives involve capital and other expenditures and require effective project management and in the case of potential strategic acquisitions successful integration to the extent the processes we or for our joint venture we together with our joint venture partners put in place to manage these initiatives or integrate and grow acquired businesses are not effective our capital expenditure and other costs may exceed our expectations or the benefits we expect from these initiatives might not be fully realized or both thereby resulting in adverse effects on our operating results and financial condition 

cyberattacks could disrupt our operations and have a material adverse impact on our business 

as a global company we utilize and rely upon information technology systems in many aspects of our business including internal and external communications and the management of our accounting financial production and supply chain functions as we become more dependent on information technologies to conduct our operations and as the number and sophistication of cyberattacks increase the risks associated with cyber security increase these risks apply to us our employees and to third parties on whose systems we rely for the conduct of our business we have experienced cyberattacks but to our knowledge we have not experienced any material breaches of our technology systems failure to effectively anticipate prevent detect and recover from the increasing number and sophistication of cyberattacks could result in theft loss or misuse of or damage or modification of our information and cause disruptions or delays in our business reputational damage and thirdparty claims which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 

our crop nutrients and other products are subject to price and demand volatility resulting from periodic imbalances of supply and demand which may cause our results of operations to fluctuate 

historically the market for crop nutrients has been cyclical and prices and demand for our products have fluctuated significantly periods of high demand increasing profits and high capacity utilization tend to lead to new plant investment and increased production in the industry this growth increases supply until the market is oversaturated leading to declining prices and declining capacity utilization until the cycle repeats 

as a result crop nutrient prices and volumes have been and are expected to continue to be volatile this price and volume volatility may cause our results of operations to fluctuate and potentially deteriorate the price at which we sell our crop nutrient products and our sales volumes could fall in the event of industry oversupply conditions which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations in contrast high prices may lead our customers and farmers to delay purchasing decisions in anticipation of future lower prices thus impacting our sales volumes 

due to reduced market demand depressed agricultural economic conditions and other factors we and our predecessors have at various times suspended or curtailed production at some of our facilities the extent to which we utilize available capacity at our facilities will cause fluctuations in our results of operations as we will incur costs for any temporary or indefinite shutdowns of our facilities in addition lower sales tend to lead to higher fixed costs as a percentage of sales 

financial risks 

during periods when the prices for our products are falling because of falling raw material prices we could be required to writedown the value of our inventories any such writedown could adversely affect our results of operations and the value of our assets 

we carry our inventories at the lower of cost or market in periods when the market prices for our products are falling rapidly including in response to falling market prices for raw materials it is possible that we could be required to writedown the value of our inventories if market prices fall below our costs any such writedown could adversely affect our results of operations and the value of our assets any such effect could be material 

our estimates of future selling prices reflect in part the purchase commitments we have from our customers as a result defaults on these existing purchase commitments because of the global or local economic and financial conditions or for other reasons could adversely affect our estimates of future selling prices and require additional inventory writedowns 

we may incur significant noncash charges if our goodwill or longlived assets become impaired in the future 

under accounting principles generally accepted in the us  “ gaap ”  we review goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable other longlived assets including property plant and equipment are reviewed if events or circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable the process of impairment testing involves a number of judgments and estimates made by management including the fair values of assets and liabilities future cash flows our interpretation of current economic indicators and market conditions overall economic conditions and our strategic operational plans with regard to our business units if the judgments and estimates used in our analysis are not realized or change due to external factors then actual results may not be consistent with these judgments and estimates and our goodwill and intangible assets may become impaired in future periods if our goodwill or longlived assets are determined to be impaired in the future we may be required to record noncash charges to earnings during the period in which the impairment is determined which could be significant and have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations we have in the past and may in the future be required to write down the value of our goodwill or other longlived assets and such future write downs could be material see note 9 goodwill and note 25 mine closure costs in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information related to charges incurred in 2019 

changes in tax laws or regulations or their interpretation or exposure to additional tax liabilities could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

we are subject to taxes including income taxes resource taxes and royalties and nonincome based taxes in the united states canada china brazil and other countries where we operate changes in tax laws or regulations or their interpretation could result in higher taxes which could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

in 2018 us federal tax law changes took effect this was a significant change to the us system of taxation resulting in numerous areas open to interpretation given the newness and breadth of changes to the rules as a result risk exists related to developing interpretation and application of the rules that could result in higher taxes which could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

we are subject to periodic audits by various levels of tax authorities in all countries where we have meaningful operations the due process audit and appeal practices and procedures of such authorities may vary significantly by jurisdiction may be unpredictable and unreliable in nature and may result in significant risk to us for various reasons some governments may issue significant reassessments on audit based positions not fully grounded in law or fact even though upon disputing the reassessments a great many are overturned on administrative appeal and through the court system certain systems involve tax litigation as a common practice in certain countries there are requirements to pay a reassessment even though the matter has not been finally decided by the tax administration or a court of law while the taxpayer has a wellsupported objection and appeals administratively or in court this may result in tying up significant funds andor creating adverse treasury and credit risks that may interrupt impede or otherwise materially affect our business operations 

we extend trade credit to our customers and guarantee the financing that some of our customers use to purchase our products our results of operations may be adversely affected if these customers are unable to repay the trade credit from us or financing from their banks increases in prices for crop nutrient other agricultural inputs and grain may increase this risk 

we extend trade credit to our customers in the united states and throughout the world in some cases for extended periods of time in brazil where there are fewer thirdparty financing sources available to farmers we also have several programs under which we guarantee customers’ financing from financial institutions that they use to purchase our products as our exposure to longer trade credit extends throughout the world and use of guarantees in brazil increases we are increasingly exposed to 

the risk that some of our customers will not pay us or the amounts we have guaranteed additionally we become increasingly exposed to risk due to weather and crop growing conditions fluctuations in crop nutrient prices commodity prices or foreign currencies and other factors that influence the price supply and demand for agricultural commodities significant defaults by our customers could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

due to the global nature of our operations we are exposed to currency exchange rate changes which may cause fluctuations in earnings and cash flows 

our primary foreign currency exposures are the canadian dollar and brazilian real the functional currency for our brazilian subsidiaries is the brazilian real however we finance our brazilian inventory purchases with us dollardenominated liabilities the functional currency of several of our canadian entities is the canadian dollar for those entities sales are primarily denominated in us dollars but the costs are paid principally in canadian dollars canadian entities have significant us dollar denominated intercompany loans and us entities with the us dollar as functional currency have brazilian real denominated loans during periods of local or global economic crises local currencies may be devalued significantly against the us dollar during times of a strengthening dollar our net earnings can be reduced due to transaction currency losses arising from these exposures of us dollar denominated liabilities held in the brazilian and canadian entities and brazilian real denominated assets held in us entities to reduce economic risk and volatility on expected cash flows that are denominated in the canadian dollar and brazilian real we use financial instruments that may include forward contracts options or collars when unable to naturally offset the exposures

summary overview of mining 

as used in this form 10k report the terms “mineral resource” “measured mineral resource” “indicated mineral resource” “inferred mineral resource” “mineral reserve” “proven mineral reserve” and “probable mineral reserve” are defined and used in accordance with sk 1300 all mineral resources and mineral reserves have been prepared by qualified persons under sk 1300 mineral resources may not be classified as “mineral reserves” unless the determination has been made by a qualified person that the mineral resources can be the basis of an economically viable project mineral resources are not mineral reserves and do not meet the threshold for mineral reserve modifying factors such as estimated economic viability that would allow for conversion to mineral reserves there is no certainty that any part of the mineral resources estimated will be converted into mineral reserves 

except for that portion of mineral resources classified as mineral reserves mineral resources have not demonstrated economic value inferred mineral resources are estimates based on limited geological evidence and sampling and have too high of a degree of uncertainty to apply relevant technical and economic factors likely to influence the prospects of economic extraction in a manner useful for evaluation of economic viability estimates of inferred mineral resources may not be converted to a mineral reserve it cannot be assumed that all or any part of an inferred mineral resource will be upgraded to a higher category a significant amount of exploration must be completed to determine whether an inferred mineral resource may be upgraded to a higher category therefore you are cautioned not to assume that all or any part of an inferred mineral resource exists that it can be the basis of an economically viable project or that it will be upgraded to a higher category

annual production 

table 21 shows the production tonnage and grade for all phosphate properties for 2021 2020 and 2019 



a annual operational capacity is the expected average longterm annual capacity for finished goods considering constraints represented by the grade quality and quantity of the reserves being mined as well as equipment performance and other operational factors 

b actual production varies from annual operational capacity shown in the above table due to factors that include among others the level of demand for our products the quality of the reserves the nature of the geologic formations we are mining at any particular time maintenance and turnaround time accidents mechanical failure weather conditions and other operating conditions 

c the percent of p 2 o 5 represents a measure of the phosphate content in phosphate rock or a phosphate ore body a higher percentage corresponds to a higher percentage of phosphate content in phosphate rock or a phosphate ore body 

d we have a 75 economic interest in the miski mayo mine in peru and consolidate their results therefore annual operational capacity and production tonnes are presented at 100 economic interest these amounts are presented on a wet tonne basis based on average moisture levels of 35 to 45 as it exits the drying process and is prepared for shipping operational capacity and production on a dry tonne basis would be 38 million tonnes and 41 million tonnes respectively 

table 22 shows the production tonnage and grade for the potash properties for 2021 2020 and 2019 



a represents full capacity based on 350 operating days per annum 

b capacity is based on finished goods capacity not ore mined the annualized proven peaking capacity shown above is the capacity currently used to determine our share of canpotex sales canpotex members’ respective shares of canpotex sales are based upon the members’ respective proven peaking capacities for producing potash when a canpotex member expands its production capacity the new capacity is added to that member’s proven peaking capacity based on a proving run at the maximum production level alternatively after january 2017 canpotex members may elect to rely on an independent engineering firm and approved protocols to calculate their proven peaking capacity the annual operational capacity reported in the table above can exceed the annualized proven peaking capacity until the proving run has been completed 

c annual operational capacity is the expected average longterm annual capacity considering constraints represented by the grade quality and quantity of the reserves being mined as well as equipment performance and other operational factors 

d actual production varies from annual operational capacity shown in the above table due to factors that include among others the level of demand for our products the quality of the reserves the nature of the geologic formations we are mining at any particular time maintenance and turnaround time accidents mechanical failure weather conditions and other operating conditions as well as the effect of recent initiatives intended to improve operational excellence 

e grade  k 2 o is a traditional reference to the percentage by weight of potassium oxide contained in the ore a higher percentage corresponds to a higher percentage of potassium oxide in the ore 

f equivalent to hoisted tonnes at a conventional mine ore mined for belle plaine is a calculated value kcl concentrate mined by solution divided by the estimated global grade of the deposit the calculation is based on actual kcl tonnes mined january 1 2021 october 31 2021 and estimates of kcl tonnes mined november 1 2021  december 31 2021 

g the annual operational capacity at esterhazy increased by 07 million tonnes in 2019 reflecting the rampup in capacity from the k3 shaft 

h we have the ability to reach an annual operating capacity of 21 million tonnes over time at colonsay by increasing our staffing levels and investment in mine development activities

florida phosphates 

our three phosphate production stage mining facilities south fort meade four corners and wingate and three exploration properties desoto pioneer and south pasture in florida consist of over 210000 acres of property in central florida table 28 and figure 23 we idled the mining and beneficiation activities at south pasture the facilities and properties are in desoto hardee hillsborough manatee and polk counties even though we continue to add real property to one or more of these locations most of the property currently being mined or planned for future mining have been in industry ownership for over 50 years the mining facilities and exploration properties are owned by or have controlling interest granted to mosaic fertilizer llc south ft meade land management or south ft meade land partnership lp “ sfmlp ” each a subsidiary of mosaic 

we either own or have a controlling interest in the mineral rights to the current and future facilities mineral and surface rights are joined at the four corners wingate pioneer and south pasture properties portions of the desoto property and south fort meade facility have the surface and mineral interests severed 

the net book value for our florida phosphate mining facilities and exploration properties is 12 billion as of december 31 2021 

table 29 lists the land status and acreages for the facilities and properties 

table 28 property locations 



figure 23 location plan 

the table below includes only land holdings associated with our mining properties 

table 29 property status and acreages 



a the mining agreement relates to the sfmlp which is 100 controlled by mosaic or its subsidiaries 

b all acres include surface rights with the exception of the desoto mineral rights 

governmental permits and approvals for mining are obtained from federal state and county authorities including the environmental resource permit “ erp ” issued by florida department of environmental protection “ dep ” and permits 

required by section 404 of the federal clean water act in connection with these permits we are required to develop a reclamation plan with respect to these areas the erp is associated with a florida depapproved reclamation plan that requires “acre for acre and type for type” reclamation to reclaim mined areas mitigation may also be required by erp conditions which may also require conservation easements to provide permanent protection 

the integrated water use permit “ iwup ” issued by the southwest florida water management district “ swfwmd ” in 2012 authorizes the withdrawal of groundwater from underground aquifers through permitted wells to provide potable and productionwater supplies in support of mining and other operations the iwup addresses all of our active mining operations a separate water use permit “ wup ” was issued by swfwmd for the south pasture property in 2017 the iwup and the south pasture wup also regulate mine dewatering to avoid adverse impacts to wetlands and offsite properties both the iwup and the wup are 20 year permits expiring in 2032 and 2037 respectively 

premining development follows the issuance of regulatory permits this involves ditch and berm construction for stormwater control groundwater draw down mitigation where applicable land clearing installation of infrastructure and premining dewatering only for dragline mining 

there are no significant environmental permitting encumbrances existing or anticipated associated with the mining facilities and exploration properties we do not anticipate any future encumbrances based on current known regulations and existing permitting processes there are no material outstanding violations and fines 

existing infrastructure 

the three mining facilities are in rural central florida located southeast of tampa in hardee hillsborough manatee and polk counties the sites are located in agricultural zones with associated population centers and easy access to multiple transportation hubs in central florida the three exploration properties are located south of the mining facilities each will utilize the same water electrical railway and road networks as the active mines 

the mining facilities at south fort meade four corners wingate and south pasture commenced operations between 1981 and 1995 as noted below under “history and exploration” the phosphate mines have the infrastructure to meet our current production plans and longrange production goals the current infrastructure includes major roads and highway access railway support from csx transportation and electricity supplied by duke energy teco preco florida power and mosaic cogeneration in associated distribution areas water supply is from mosaicowned deep wells and recycle sources current clay and tailings management areas footprints are expected to meet present demands with additional capacity planned to meet the maximum volume and deposition rates from the lom plan which covers the period between 2022 and 2035 an integrated operations center remotely controls certain functions at our florida phosphate mines 

additional infrastructure may be added to increase production reliability or flexibility the assets currently in place are maintained through a workflow process that focuses on proactive inspections and preventative maintenance while trying to minimize reactive maintenance except for south pasture which is currently idled minimal infrastructure is currently in place at the other exploration properties 

we expect the sites to continue to operate effectively during the lom while continuing to maintain the built infrastructure and renewing the longterm agreements in place for the site’s water electricity and logistics needs 

we focus on reliabilitycentered maintenance with the goal of extending the life of the majority of assets to align with the lom plan we expect that some infrastructure will need to be replaced as it reaches end of life and has been factored into the relevant capital cost requirements 

phosphate mining in central florida is a mature industry a network of suppliers machine shops fabricators and specialty contractors exist to support mining and postmining land reclamation activities many large component vendors have branch offices in either lakeland or tampa florida engineering design and technical services are readily available in bartow lakeland and tampa florida 

mining method 

our mining operations in central florida extract phosphate using surface mining techniques the active mines utilize either electric walking draglines or dredges to remove overburden and mine phosphate ore matrix matrix is hydraulically transported via centrifugal pumping systems to the beneficiation plant 

premining development follows the issuance of regulatory permits this involves ditch and berm construction for stormwater control groundwater draw down mitigation where applicable land clearing installation of infrastructure and premining dewatering only for dragline mining 

development of the mine plan is based on several factors including geological data equipment property boundaries geotechnical considerations clay impoundment reclamation schedule production volume and quality demands permits local state and federal and thirdparty agreements such as agreements with local community groups neighboring properties or ngo’s which do not materially impair the mine plan production is monitored through draglinedredge monitoring systems massflow instrumentation on slurry pumping systems and pit surveys in addition to draglines and dredges heavy mobile equipment is used to support mining activities while each mine is staffed with mosaic personnel to handle production and maintenance contractors are used on an asneeded basis 

processing recovery method 

phosphate matrix mined at the three mining facilities is processed through onsite beneficiation plants the principal production components of the beneficiation plants consist of a washer sizing system and flotation plant 

matrix at each mine is slurried for transport to the beneficiation plant after receiving matrix washers separate minerals into four separate material groups these are debris pebbles clay and undersized flotation feed the pebble is one of the final products and the undersized flotation feed material contains recoverable phosphate rock the washers separate 10 mm phosphate product and the 10 mm slurry of liberated clay sand and phosphate particles the clay is removed with hydrocyclones and pumped to clay settling areas while the 01 mm sand and phosphate move on to the sizing section 

the 01 mm sand and phosphate is separated into different size fractions using hydrosizers an upward flow of water is injected into the hydrosizer that forces the fine particles to rise and overflow the sizer while the coarse particles gently fall and flow out the sizer’s underflow the segregated fine and coarse particles are then sent to the flotation plant so the phosphate can be separated from the sand 

the twostep flotation process rougher flotation and cleaning flotation is next utilized to separate phosphate from the sand in the rougher flotation process the phosphate mineral is recovered using flotation machines by adding fatty acid oil soda ash and sodium silicate to increase the recovered rougher phosphate grade a second cleaning flotation process is used to remove the residual sand using amine

geology and mineralization 

the phosphate deposits of florida are sedimentary in origin and part of a phosphatebearing province that extends from southern florida north along the atlantic coast into southern virginia sedimentary phosphate deposits consist of rock in which the phosphate minerals occur in grains pellets nodules and as phosphate replacement of calcium in the remains of animal skeletal material and excrement 

florida has phosphate rock distributed along the entire peninsula with varying lateral extents and abundance there are five phosphate districts recognized in florida identified as northern northeast hardrock southeast and central the phosphates of florida occur in sedimentary rocks and are of secondary origin having been redeposited either by mechanical or chemical action during deposition most of the carbonate platform was drowned and deposition was widespread the intensity of reworking by marine processes allows some deposits to remain relatively near their origins and contribute to massive deposits while others were transported and winnowed into deposits of nodules grains and pellets 

all our phosphate deposits are located in the central florida phosphate district the general description of the phosphatic deposits in central florida consist of two geological facies the phosphate bearing units are within the bone valley member of the peace river formation and the undifferentiated member of the peace river formation within the south florida extension region of the central district the deposit characteristics transition from north east to the south west the major phosphate bearing units in the north east consist of a productive bone valley member with limited production in the undifferentiated member the phosphate bearing units in the south west exhibit limited production in the bone valley member and a productive undifferentiated member of the peace river formation 

the phosphate stratigraphy consists of 5 to 50 feet thick white to brown poorly graded quartz sand with varying abundance of reworked phosphate grains as waste overburden the economic zone is 13 to 50 feet thick with a grade ranging from 27 to 35 p 2 o 5  it consists of tangray to gray quartz sands dark gray to dark graybluegreen clays and silts with phosphate nodules and pellets present with phosphate grains and clasts predominate there can be interbedded waste zones of 0 to 15 feet thick comprised of beds of cream to green barren sandy clay clays or dense dolomitic clays the basal units are dark gray to black clays to phosphatic limestone rubble to beds of phosphatic limestone 

mineral resource and mineral reserve assumptions and modifying factors 

the key mineral resource and mineral reserve assumptions and modifying factors are listed in table 211 

table 211 key assumptions and modifying factors  



mineral resource estimates 

mosaic’s phosphate mineral resources are reported as a beneficiation plant product phosphate rock tonnage and p 2 o 5 grade including a total primary impurities ratio “ mer ” 

the geological information used to estimate the phosphate mineral resources for the mining facilities and exploration properties is based on drilling and sampling the mineral resource estimates are completed using a proprietary software that applies specific grade physical and impurity limits to the raw drill data of the property these factors are used to select material that contains sufficient grade limited impurities and is physically extractable to be included in the mineral resource estimate the confidence and classification of the mineral resources is estimated based on the drill density of the evaluated area 

mineral resources that are not mineral reserves have not demonstrated economic viability utilizing the criteria and assumptions required 

the methodology for estimating mineral resources consists of interpreting the available geological data to create composites of lithological units that meet the specified criteria these composites are then mapped to determine the mineral resource boundary the boundary is then trimmed to account for permit and mine boundary limitations the composite data is also used to create a geologic model composed of volume density grade and impurity grids created using inverse distance weighted as the interpolation method elevation grids are created using triangulation based on lidar light detection and ranging or survey data assigned to each drill hole a utility macro is used to adjust elevations to account for holes with no matrix that meets the mine requirements the data from each grid is then volumetrically combined using product volumes for the specific mineral resource shape and mineral resource classification creating a block of uniform constituents estimation of mineralization tonnage grade and impurities is done by applying the volume weight percent of pebble feed and clay for the given mineral resource shape

f a lom commodity price of 10272tonne of phosphate rock was used to assess prospects for economic extraction but is not used for cutoff purposes 

no mineral resources were reported in 2020 as the company reported under industry guide 7 which did not recognize mineral resources as a result of the change in reporting to regulation sk 1300 the mineral resources are being reported for the first time 

mineral reserve estimates 

mosaic’s estimated mineral reserves are located at the south fort meade four corners and wingate mine facilities and are reported as a beneficiation plant product phosphate rock tonnage and p 2 o 5 grade including a total mer mineral reserves have demonstrated economic viability utilizing the criteria and assumptions required at each phosphate facility and meet all the mining criteria required including but not limited to mining processing metallurgical infrastructure economic marketing legal environmental social and governmental factors 

the methodology for estimating mineral reserves consists of interpreting the available geological data to create composites of lithological units that meet the specified reserve criteria a utility macro is used to apply reserve plant volume recoveries adjust insoluble limits to the geologic model and to adjust elevations grids to account for holes with no matrix that meets the mine requirements dragline or dredge pit design work and scheduling are applied to the geologic model by the mine planner tonnes grades and product quality are estimated by applying the mining shapes to the geological model the data from each grid is then volumetrically combined using product volumes for the specific mine pit shape creating a block of uniform constituents the recoverable tonnes of pebble and feed for the entire mine pit are calculated based on the area of the mine pit the beneficiation plant grade recoveries are then applied to the recoverable feed tonnes to estimate the mineral reserves and recoverable concentrate tonnes

mineral resources and mineral reserves comparison 

as of december 31 2021 we had mineral reserves of 127 million tonnes compared to 515 million in the prior year resulting in a decrease of 75 changes in mineral reserve tonnage from the prior year are the result of mining depletion small changes to beneficiation plant factors the change from industry guide 7 to sk 1300 and the reclassification of south pasture reserves to resources due to the idling of the south pasture property 

belle plaine 

the belle plaine facility is in the rural municipality of pense no 160 in the province of saskatchewan canada it is located north of the transcanada highway hwy 1 approximately 32 miles west of regina figure 24 it is the oldest and largest potash solution mine in the world coordinates for the belle plaine facility are 50° 25’ 3957 105° 11’ 5387” 50° 25’ 3957” 105° 11’ 5387” 

we lease 53133 acres of mineral rights from the crown under subsurface mineral lease kl 106r table 214 lists additional information regarding the lease table 215 outlines the lease acreage designated by township and section the lease term is for a period of 21 years from july 2012 with renewals at the company’s option for additional 21year periods 

in addition we own 19284 acres of mineral rights within the belle plaine area as shown in table 216 below all mineral titles owned or leased by us include “subsurface minerals” which under the subsurface mineral tenure regulations 2015 saskatchewan means “allnatural mineral salts of boron calcium lithium magnesium potassium sodium bromine chlorine fluorine iodine nitrogen phosphorus and sulfur and their compounds occurring more than 1970 feet 600 m below the surface of the land” other commodities eg petroleum and natural gas coal etc may be included within mineral rights we lease or own but are not specifically sought after when acquired 

within the total acreage leased from the crown or owned by us are parcels of land where we own or lease less than a 100 share of the mineral rights in order to mine these properties we would need to acquire 100 control either by lease or ownership acreages currently not mineable for this reason are listed in table 217 below 

there are no significant environmental permitting encumbrances existing or anticipated in the future associated with the belle plaine facility we do not anticipate any future encumbrances based on current known regulations and existing permitting processes there are no outstanding fines or material violations

existing infrastructure 

the belle plaine facility has been operating since 1964 and consists of a mining area and a processing plant and has an expected mine life based on mineral reserves of 63 years the processing plant consists of a refinery and cooling pond the belle plaine facility has the infrastructure in place to meet the current production goals and lom plan the current infrastructure includes major road and highway access railway support from canadian national railway “ cnr ” and 

canadian pacific railway “ cpr ” saskpowersupplied electricity transgassupplied natural gas and potable and nonpotable water supplied from a local fresh water source we expect the current tma footprint to support the volume and deposition rates indicated in the 2021 lom plan 

the main source of water nonpotable required for production is provided by saskwater from the buffalo pound lake located northwest of the mine it also supplies potable water for the cities of regina moose jaw and surrounding regions water levels are controlled by the saskwater security agency and managed through the lake diefenbaker dam 

saskpower provides a portion of the power required to run the belle plaine facility this power comes in off the main saskpower grid which could be fed from any number of saskpower plants along the highline running north and south along kalium road a total of 138 kv comes into the belle plaine facility substation where it is then stepped down to 138 kv using two transformers 28 mva and 333 mva the belle plaine facility owns and manages a substation where there is also a 138 kv grounding transformer and a 138 kva gas insulated breaker lineup the belle plaine facility generates power from the powerhouse from two turbine generators 

transgas supplies natural gas to the belle plaine facility the gas flows from the main lines into a local regulator station situated just north of the administration building and powerhouse this station takes the highpressure feed from the main lines and cuts it down through onsite filtration and also does some preheating to provide low pressure gas directly to the facility 

there are a variety of local or site roads on or to the belle plaine facility these are typically gravel roads roads around the processing plant are paved 

cnr and cpr are available to the belle plaine facility to move final product to port there is an operating agreement between mosaic cpr and cnr which governs the joint operation and interaction of all parties for freight services at the belle plaine facility 

the belle plaine facility is located between the cities of moose jaw and regina saskatchewan moose jaw has a population of approximately 34000 people and is located 17 miles west of the belle plaine facility regina located 27 miles east of the belle plaine facility has a population of approximately 214000 people 

our workforce primarily lives in regina and moose jaw and are typically trained through a variety of trades programs offered at the saskatchewan polytechnic campuses the university of regina or the university of saskatchewan 

the province of saskatchewan offers a large variety of suppliers for the potash mine operators the potash industry in saskatchewan is very mature which makes it easier to attract vendors to support the needs of the various mine sites throughout the province 

saskatoon and regina saskatchewan both have large industrial sectors with a variety of machine shops and industrial support services some specialty services are provided from the alberta oil and gas industry 

supplies are sourced locally regionally and internationally based on availability or commercial considerations lead times and onhand inventory are balanced to meet the needs of the site 

mining method 

the belle plaine facility utilizes an underground solution mining process where paired wells are directionally drilled cased and cemented to the base of the potash beds solution mining techniques are used to target mining of the potash “ kcl ” bedding while minimizing mining of the halite salts “ nacl ” current mining practices allow for all three potash beds in the formation to be mined during the mining process the two wells are mined to connect with each other underground allowing one well to become the feed well and the other well to become the return well water or a weaker brine is injected into the cavern to return a salt saturated and potash rich brine this fluid is pumped through pipelines from the mining area and sent to the refinery complex as raw feed for further processing the total life cycle of each cavern is approximately 25 years once the potash recovery is exhausted each cavern is plugged and decommissioned in accordance with local government regulations 

the mining area capability is scheduled to ramp up to support a finished tonnage projection of 30 million tonnes per year and will do so until drilling is completed in the year 2066 at which point there is a ramp down in production until 2084 

the 2021 belle plaine lom plan based on mineral reserves has an expected total mine life of 63 years ending in 2084 and yielding an estimated total of 16685 million tonnes of final product kcl 

processing recovery method 

the belle plaine facility processing plant receives kclnacl rich brine known as raw feed from the mine and achieves kcl recovery through the refinery and cooling pond areas we use well established solubility curves of h 2 onaclkcl systems to monitor the selective dropout of products in the process 

the refinery subjects the raw feed brine from the mining area to changing temperatures and pressures that selectively precipitates the nacl and then the kcl out of solution in different stages of the process selective drop out of nacl is achieved through two parallel lines of evaporators that heat the brine with steam that is generated onsite through natural gas fired boilers the heating of the raw feed brine results in water liberation causing nacl to concentrate in the brine and then precipitate out of solution after the brine is conditioned in the evaporator circuit it is pumped to the thickener area for clarification and then pumped into a crystallizer circuit for kcl recovery the crystallizer circuit subjects the process brine to a vacuum that allows further boiling creating a cooling effect on the brine as the brine cools the kcl is forced to precipitate out of solution the solid kcl is withdrawn from the crystallizer vessel as a slurry and pumped to the dewatering and drying area the brine that overflows the crystallizer circuit which still contains some dissolved kcl and nacl is fed to the cooling pond area for further kcl recovery 

the cooling pond area consists of multiple ponds that are fed with brine from the refinery and with raw feed brine from the mining area the ponds facilitate atmospheric cooling which allows kcl to preferentially precipitate out of the brine and then settle to the bottom of the ponds the cooling pond area contains several kcl dredges that are comprised of a cutter wheel that fluidizes the deposited kcl from the bottom of a cooling pond and a slurry pump that moves the kcl slurry toward the dewatering and drying areas 

the dewatering and drying area removes the bulk of the brine in the slurry through process equipment and then conveys the kcl product into natural gas fired industrial dryers the dried kcl product is then fed into the sizing area or compaction area for compacting crushing and screening processes to achieve product size specifications finished product is then conveyed to the onsite storage area where it is held until being reclaimed rescreened and shipped off site primarily through rail 

we expect site production to increase by 2025 to 30 million tonnes per year until the year 2066 at which time we expect to stop drilling new cavities and ramp down production to 2084 the site’s ability to produce at a sustained 30 million tonnes per year in future years is backed by a canpotex proving run in 20162017 in which the belle plaine facility achieved a production nameplate of 39 million tonnes per year we expect total site processing recovery to average 79 throughout the remaining life of the mine and is dependent on sustained drilling activities future projections are modeled with mass and energy balance software to predict the future production and recovery capabilities

table 218 history 







geology and mineralization 

the intracratonic elk point basin is a major sedimentary geological feature in western canada and the northwest us it contains one of the world’s largest stratabound potash resources the nature of this type of deposition is largely continuous with predictable depths and thickness it is mined at several locations including belle plaine 

potash at the belle plaine facility occurs conformably within middle devonianage sedimentary rocks ranging in thicknesses from approximately 100 to 131 feet at a depth of approximately 5345 to 5740 feet 

the prairie evaporite formation host to the potash mineralization is divided into a basal lower salt and an overlying unnamed unit containing three potashbearing units and one unit containing thin marker beds in ascending order the potash horizons in the upper unit are the esterhazy member white bear marker beds belle plaine member and patience lake member mineralogically these members consist of sylvite and halite with minor amounts of carnallite kcl mgcl 2 6h 2 o 

the esterhazy belle plaine and patience lake members underly the belle plaine property also present are the white bear formation marker beds which occur between the belle plaine and esterhazy members but are of insufficient thickness to be minable 

the following is a summary of the key stratigraphic units for the belle plaine facility area 

• patience lake member  the uppermost member of the prairie evaporite formation with potash production potential between the top of the prairie evaporite and the top of the patience lake member is a 0 to 45 feet thick unit of halite with clay bands called the salt back the sylviterich horizons within the patience lake member are mined using conventional underground mining techniques along a trend from vanscoy to lanigan in the saskatoon area and by solution mining techniques at belle plaine 

• belle plaine member  the belle plaine member underlies the patience lake member and is separated from it by a zone of low grade sylvinite the belle plaine member is mined using solution mining techniques at the belle plaine facility 

• white bear formation  the white bear formation consists of marker beds that are a distinctive unit of thin interbedded clay halite and sylvinite horizons that are not minable due to their insufficient thicknesses of only 40 to 50 feet 12 to 15 m 

• esterhazy member  the esterhazy member is separated from the belle plaine member by the white bear formation marker beds a sequence of clay seams lowgrade sylvinite and halite the esterhazy member is mined using conventional underground techniques at the esterhazy facility in southeastern saskatchewan and by solution mining techniques at the belle plaine facility the potash mined at the belle plaine facility is a mixture of halite and sylvite and in some parts of the mining area small amounts of carnallite there are a number of insoluble clayrich zones that are not recovered in the solution mining process the potash deposit at belle plaine is uniform and laterally continuous solution mining methods can more easily accommodate any local variations in geological condition due to the nonselective concentrate mining process 

when considering the sequence of mining at the belle plaine facility the following terminology is applied to the beds this describes the geology in a way that best summarizes the grades that are available for solution mining 

• the upper mining zone consists of beds 38 to 31 of the patience lake member and beds 23 to 21 of the belle plaine member the upper mining zone is about 90 feet thick 

• the salt stringer is a thin bed of salt located between beds 31 and 23 in the upper mining zone the salt stringer is approximately 10 feet thick 

• the interzonal salt is a thick bed of salt located between the lower and upper mining zones 

• the marker bed is a small very rich potash bed located midway through the interzonal salt 

• the lower mining zone consists of beds 13 12 and 11 of the esterhazy member the lower mining zone is approximately 20 feet thick 

potash mineralization contains sylvinite a mixture of the iron oxidestained halite sylvite and locally carnallite when present interstitially or as massive pods carnallite can deteriorate rapidly or be preferentially dissolved the color of the potash can vary from light orange to deep red rimmed crystals the mineralization can be locally bedded or massive the halite and sylvite crystals can range from small to more typically coarse to large which can be attributed to the conditions during deposition as there has been no alteration

transgas is the primarily supplier of an uninterrupted supply of natural gas to the esterhazy potash facility esterhazy has regulator stations for the natural gas at each of the sites with a lowpressure distribution piping network 

the k1 and k2 sites are serviced by the cnr main line and by spur lines to the cpr the surrounding area is developed for agriculture with a road network villages and towns 

regina international airport is 140 miles by highway west of the esterhazy facility while yorkton municipal airport is 55 miles to the northwest the town of esterhazy maintains a paved 3000 feet long airstrip located 8 miles southwest of the k1 mill 

the esterhazy facility’s workforce lives throughout the area generally within 62 miles of the mine sites this includes the russell and binscarth areas of western manitoba education and healthcare facilities are in esterhazy russell melville and yorkton 

the province of saskatchewan offers a large variety of suppliers for the potash mine operators the potash industry in saskatchewan is very mature making it easier to attract vendors to support the needs of the various mine sites throughout the province 

saskatoon and regina have large industrial sectors with a variety of machine shops and industrial support services some specialty services are provided from the alberta oil and gas industry 

supplies are sourced locally regionally and internationally based on availability or commercial considerations lead times and onhand inventory are balanced to meet the needs of the site 

mining method 

at the esterhazy facility potash is extracted by underground mining using the roomandpillar method current mine design allows for the planned extraction of 276 of the insitu ore pillars are left in place between mining rooms to support overlying strata and prevent failure of the upper rock formations or an inflow of brine from any waterbearing zones above 

the 2021 lom plan for the esterhazy facility includes the k3 mineral reserves the k4 mineral resources are currently scheduled after depletion of the k3 mineral resources production is based on an average production rate of 17527 million tonnes per year based on 365 production days per year 

we expect the k3 mineral reserves production to ramp up to full production by 2024 we expect the mine to ramp down starting in 2051 with mining anticipated to be completed in 2054 

our current schedule to begin mining the k4 mineral resources is to start mining in 2050 we expect the mine to ramp up to full production in 2055 and ending in 2090 

processing recovery method 

the esterhazy facility’s processing plant consists of two separate mill facilities designated as k1 and k2 each mill processes the raw ore feed stock received from the underground mining operations through crushing separation screening and compaction unit operations to produce ongrade saleable product the plants utilize online grade analyzers to monitor the process as well as routine samples that are analyzed by the onsite lab the milling can be broken down into two main functions the wet end separates potash and salt while the dry end sizes potash for sale 

the wet end of the mill begins with raw ore sizing and crushing to prepare it for the separation processes in heavy media the larger size fraction is separated into potash and salt through dense media separation that is driven by differences of buoyancy in salt and potash flotation receives the smaller size fraction and has specific reagents added that allow the potash crystals to float while the salt is rejected as tailings material at k2 there is also a crystallizer circuit that produces potash using solubility temperature and pressure differences dewatering and drying is the final stage in the wet end where potash is sent through centrifuges and industrial driers to remove all moisture 

once the product is dried it is sent to a screen to separate rightsized material from the over and undersized material for all the different product grades oversized material is sent through a crushing circuit to break it down to rightsized material the undersized material is upgraded through compaction to a larger product 

we plan to ramp up milling rates once the k3 mine is up to full capacity we then expect to stabilize at a total milling rate to the end of mine life the differences in final product tonnes will be based on supplied raw ore grade as it varies throughout the mine workings we believe that the site’s ability to produce at the increasing rates being forecasted in the lom plan is supported by a proving run in 2013 when the esterhazy facility achieved a production nameplate of 63 million tonnes overall 

history and exploration

geology and mineralization 

the intracratonic elk point basin is a major sedimentary geological feature in western canada and the northwest us it contains one of the world’s largest stratabound potash resources the nature of this type of deposition is largely continuous with predictable depths and thickness it is mined at several locations including the esterhazy facility 

potash at the esterhazy facility area occurs conformably within middle devonianage sedimentary rocks and is found in total thicknesses ranging from approximately 100 to 131 feet 30 to 40 m at a depth of approximately 5345 to 5740 feet 1630 to 1750 m 

the prairie evaporite formation host to the potash mineralization is divided into a basal “lower salt” and an overlying unnamed unit containing three potashbearing units and one unit containing thin marker beds in ascending order the potash horizons in the upper unit are the esterhazy member white bear marker beds belle plaine member and patience lake member mineralogically these members consist of sylvite and halite with minor amounts of carnallite kcl mgcl 2 6h 2 o 

in the esterhazy area the esterhazy white bear and belle plaine members are present and the patience lake member is absent the following is a summary of the key stratigraphic units for the esterhazy potash facility area 

• belle plaine member  the belle plaine member underlies second red bed and makes up part of the salt back that is critical to isolating the mining horizon from the formations above the belle plaine member is mined using solution mining techniques at the belle plaine facility and is not mined at the esterhazy facility 

• white bear member  the white bear member consists of marker beds that are a distinctive unit of thin interbedded clay halite and sylvinite horizons that are not minable due to their insufficient thickness of only 40 to 50 feet 

• esterhazy member  the esterhazy member is separated from the belle plaine member by the white bear member marker beds a sequence of clay seams lowgrade sylvinite and halite the esterhazy member is mined using conventional underground techniques at the esterhazy facility in southeastern saskatchewan and by solution mining techniques at the belle plaine facility 

the typical sylvinite intervals within the prairie evaporite formation consist of a mass of interlocked sylvite crystals that range from pink to translucent and may be rimmed by greenishgrey clay or bright red iron insoluble material with minor halite randomly disseminated throughout the mineralized zones local large one inch 25 cm cubic translucent to cloudy halite crystals may be present within the sylvite groundmass and overall the sylvinite ranges from a dusky brownish red color lower grade 23 to 27 k 2 o with an increase in the amount of insoluble material to a bright almost translucent pinkish orange color high grade 30 k 2 o carnallite is also present locally in the prairie evaporite formation as a mineral fraction of the depositional sequence the intervening barren salt beds consist of brownish red vitreous to translucent halite with minor sylvite and carnallite and increased insoluble materials content 

mineral resource and mineral reserve assumptions and modifying factors 

the key mineral resource and mineral reserve assumptions and modifying factors are listed in table 227 

table 227 key assumptions and modifying factors 



mineral resource estimates 

the esterhazy facility’s mineral resources are reported as insitu mineralization and are exclusive of mineral reserves the mineral resources occur in the esterhazy white bear and belle plaine members we assume that the mineralization is laterally continuous and consistent based on publicly available regional geological information and our knowledge of the local geology and area 

mineral resources that are not mineral reserves have not demonstrated economic viability utilizing the criteria and assumptions required at the esterhazy facility 

the methodology for estimating mineral resources consists of interpreting the available geological data in plain view using autocad 2020 software the plan is updated to include the current mineral rights status seismic survey interpretations the limits of the current mining footprint known areas geological anomalies town sites and other surface infrastructure that make the mineral resource inaccessible and therefore excluded from the mineral resource estimation process property boundary pillars pillars around exploration holes and infrastructure “no mining” areas in the uncontrolled mineral rights locations and a pillar between the k1 and k2 mining area and the adjacent k4 mineral resource areas 

additional details regarding the estimation methodology are listed in section 11 of the 2021 esterhazy facility trs filed as an exhibit to this 10k report 

the mineral resource estimates for the esterhazy facility are listed in table 228 

table 228 mineral resources at the end of the fiscal year ended december 31 2021 based on a lom plan kcl price of 219 per tonne abcdegh 



a mineral resources are reported exclusive of those mineral resources that have been converted to mineral reserves mineral resources that are not mineral reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability 

b mineral resources are not mineral reserves and do not meet the threshold for mineral reserve modifying factors such as estimated economic viability that would allow for conversion to mineral reserves there is no certainty that any part of the mineral resources estimated will be converted into mineral reserves 

c mineral resources assume an underground room and pillar mining method 

d mineral resources amenable to underground mining methods are accessed via shaft and scheduled for extraction based on a conceptual room and pillar design using the same technical parameters as for mineral reserves 

e no cutoff grade or value based on commodity price is used to estimate mineral resources this is because the mining method used at esterhazy is not grade selective the potash mineralization is mined on one level by continuous miners following the welldefined and continuous beds of mineralization with relatively consistent grades section 112 of trs 

f k 2 o refers to the total k 2 o of the samples

h we used a uscad exchange rate of 131 to assess prospects for economic extraction for the mineral resources but was not used for cutoff purposes 

no mineral resources were reported in 2020 as the company was reporting under industry guide 7 which did not recognize mineral resources as a result of the change in reporting to sk 1300 mineral resources are being reported for the first time 

mineral reserve estimates 

the esterhazy facility’s mineral reserves are reported as insitu mineralization accounting for all applicable modifying factors mineral reserves meet all the mining criteria required at esterhazy including but not limited to mining processing metallurgical infrastructure economic marketing legal environmental social and governmental factors 

the methodology for estimating mineral reserves consists of post pillar mine design work and scheduling and the application of mining recovery and unplanned dilution additional details regarding the estimation methodology are listed in section 12 of the 2021 esterhazy facility trs

mineral resources and mineral reserves comparison 

our mineral reserves decreased by 36 to 557 million tonnes at december 31 2021 compared to 875 million tonnes at december 31 2020 yearoveryear changes are due to mining depletion the closure of the k1k2 mining operation in june 2021 a change in the density mining recovery and average mining height and the change from industry guide 7 to sk 1300 reporting 

tapira 

tapira is located in the western portion of the state of minas gerais in the southeast of brazil to the north of the town of tapira and approximately 35 km southsoutheast of the city of araxá figure 26 the mine is 420 km by road to the minas gerais state capital of belo horizonte via the br262 highway to araxá and then the br 146 highway to tapira the property extends from approximately utm 7805000 n to 7799500 n and from 304000 e to 310000 e corrego alegre 1961 utm zone 23 south and is centered approximately at 19º52’s46º51’w the tapira complex consists of a mine and a phosphate beneficiation plant the plant produces phosphate conventional and ultrafine concentrate which is sent by pipeline conventional and truck ultrafine to local mosaic chemical plants for finished product production 

figure 26 project location plan 

infrastructure 

tapira is located in a highly developed region known as alto parnaíba this region is known for its excellent modern infrastructure with high standards of living compared with other regions in brazil the local infrastructure available to tapira is excellent as it is situated within a wellestablished mining area 35 km from the welldeveloped city of araxá and within 25 km of two other mining operations 

the supply of electricity occurs via a 138 kilovolt “ kv ” transmission line that is operated by cemig and vale energia concessionaires tapira has a total receipt of 40 megawatts and an annual power usage around 305 gw the main substation receives 138 kv in three oiltype transformers which is transferred to secondary substations from the secondary substations power is distributed to the enduse areas at 110 volts “ v ” 220 v 280 v 440 v or 4160 v 

water intake comes from the ribeirão do inferno and artesian wells as well as recovered water from the tailings dams additionally there are four artesian wells at tapira the industrial reuse system used to recover water from the dams includes 10 pumps four operating and six on standby and 36” pipes covering varying distances to the different dam areas the distance from br1 dam is approximately nine km with a rated capacity of 4400 cubic meters per hour m 3 hr the distance from bl1 dam is approximately three km with a rated capacity of 10400 m 3 hr the distance from br dam is approximately four km with a rated capacity of 4900 m 3 hr 

there is currently no rail or airport access at tapira the closest rail and airport access is in the city of araxá 

infrastructure includes a phosphate beneficiation plant with associated support infrastructure including tailings storage facilities maintenance facilities warehouses and various administrative and other support facilities the mine infrastructure 

includes overburden storage and other material storage facilities surface water management features and maintenance warehouse and other typical support infrastructure 

tapira includes an impoundment stability monitoring system that covers all the operating impoundments at tapira 

network connectivity is in place at the mine buildings and a telephone system provides coverage throughout the mine unit a radio system provides the ability to dispatch and control the mining equipment and transport trucks as well as communicate with the control room in the beneficiation plant 

mineral and surface rights 

mining rights in brazil are governed by the mining code decree 227 dated february 27 1967 and further regulation enacted by the anm this governmental agency which controls the mining activities throughout brazil was recently created as a replacement of the former national department of mineral production “ dnpm ” all subsoil situated within brazilian territory is deemed state property with the mining activities subject to specific permits granted by the anm 

we currently hold a total of eight mining permits within the tapira area 3842 hectares the tapira mineral assets are part of a consortium named consórcio vale fosfértil tapira created by decree number 98962 february 16 1990 process number 9307851988 435576 hectares granted to vale sa previously vale do rio doce sa and vale fertilizantes fosfatados sa – fosfértil 

the tapira mining consortium and all mining permits except for one permit 8033871974 which is currently pending have transferred from vale sa to mosaic fertilizantes pk ltda tapira operates via the tapira mining consortium therefore the transfer process of mining right anm 8033871974 does not affect the continuity of the mining operations 

tapira has an overall surface rights area of 8008 hectares distributed in 18 different property registrations the surface area within the ultimate pit is currently mostly controlled by mosaic there is a small area near a local village that is not within the current property rights the relocation of the village and state highway mg146 will be necessary to fully realize the lom tonnages the area surrounding the village and state highway mg146 is currently included in the currently controlled mining permits and is therefore not seen as a significant encumbrance to tapira 

the capacity requirements are not currently in place for all tailings disposal for total lom capacity requirements however tapira has an ongoing permitting and development plan to support the mining operations that will continue through the lom requirements 

present condition of the propert y 

the tapira mine has been in operation since 1978 and is a production stage property 

all required fixed and permanent infrastructure of power pipelines and primary roadways and project access are established drainage water controls and mine access roads and ramps are established for current operations and will be expanded and continued as the pit progresses through its planned life of operations 

the ore at tapira is recovered using openpit conventional truck and shovel mining methods due to the proximity of the ore to the surface and the physical characteristics of the deposit the ore is transported via truck to a homogenization pile where it is later fed to the beneficiation plant via conveyors the beneficiation plant produces phosphate conventional and ultrafine concentrate which is sent by pipeline conventional and truck ultrafine to local mosaic chemical plants for finished product production 

the mining equipment at tapira is leased and therefore not owned by us the beneficiation plant has been in operation since tapira started 43 years ago the tailings dams water dams and sedimentation ponds have been active at tapira since mining started 43 years ago as well currently the br1 dam is being raised to its final design height to accommodate the lom plan 

the net book value for tapira is 297 million as of december 31 2021 

exploration activities are ongoing for infill drilling for phosphate production to complete the current lom additional areas of exploration and research include better understanding the nonweathered material and titanium mineralization for future mining prospects 

history of previous operations 

tapira has been in operation since 1978 and has produced more than 70 million tonnes mt of phosphate concentrate since 1978 titanium dioxide tio 2  bearing material mainly in the form of anatase has been stockpiled with more than 200000 tonnes awaiting the implementation of an economical beneficiation method 

the geological structure of the alkaline complex of tapira was first recognized in 1953 through magnetometric and radiometric investigations carried out by the brazilgermany project there was an agreement between the two countries to carry out regional geophysical aerosurvey programs performed by the geological survey of brazil in the 1950s 1960s and 1970s 

in 1968 three major private groups – pedro maciel companhia meridional de mineração and companhia brasileira de metalurgia e mineração – had exploration research requests granted by dnpm in early1971 vale previously known as companhia vale do rio doce joined pedro maciel to create the company titan international sa which changed its name to rio doce titânio in later years vale acquired the rights of pedro maciel at the end of 1971 with the mining rights incorporated into the company mineração rio paranaíba at the time a series of intensive and detailed systematic works were undertaken and important occurrences of phosphate titanium niobium rare earths and vermiculite were identified 

extensive exploration works were undertaken between 1971 and 1973 with particular focus on the occurrences of titanium from 1973 to 1977 the exploration priorities changed to occurrences of phosphate with the aim of replacing the massive imports of fertilizers in the agricultural sector that was then undergoing a period of expansion in brazil in 1977 the fosfértil fertilizantes fosfatados sa company was created under the administration of petrofértil a subsidiary of petrobras the brazilian state oil company in 1992 fosfértil was privatized and a pool of investors held the company shares 

in 2010 vale sa acquired complete control of fósfertil and after created a new company vale fertilizantes sa which included other fertilizer assets at the start of 2018 mosaic fertilizantes pk sa acquired the assets of vale fertilizantes including the tapira mineral deposit 

mineral resources and mineral reserves 

the regional and local geology mineral resources and mineral reserves are detailed in the subsections below 

regional and local geology 

the tapira phosphate deposit is part of a series of latecretaceous carbonatitebearing alkaline ultramafic plutonic complexes belong to the alto paranaiba igneous province the tapira igneous rocks intrude the phyllites schists and quartzites of the lateproterozoic brasília mobile belt the tapira igneous complex is roughly elliptical 35 square kilometers km 2  in area and consists predominantly of alkaline pyroxenite rocks with subordinate carbonatite serpentinite dunite glimmerite syenite and ultramafic potassic dikes 

the tropical weathering regime prevailing in the region and the inward drainage patterns developed from the weatheringresistant quartzite margins of the dome structures resulted in the development of an extremely thick soil cover in most of the complexes the extreme weathering process was responsible for the residual concentration of apatite the main geological types identified in the deposit are a combination of the igneous protoliths bebedourites phoscorites and carbonatites and the products of the weathering process 

mineral resources 

the mineral resources at tapira were estimated based on the longstanding exploration drilling and sampling completed at tapira since 1967 the drilling results were loaded into the geological database verified and vetted for errors and then used in the geological model to create the lithology and weathering surfaces the geological model was used in creating the block model where geological domains based on the lithology and weathering surfaces were utilized to interpret grade density and mass recovery in a geologically appropriate manner exploratory data analysis and geostatistical analysis were completed on the raw and composite data sets to help define interpolation parameters and mineral resource classifications the mineral resources were restricted based on an optimized pit limit that took into account cutoff grade price mining costs infrastructure limitations and mineral licenses the mineral resources are exclusive of mineral reserves and include approximately 1298 million tonnes of measured and indicated mineral resources with a p 2 o 5 ap grade of 79 there are an additional 1128 million tonnes of inferred mineral resources with a p 2 o 5 ap grade of 86 table 230

b mineral resources are reported exclusive of mineral reserves mineral resources are not mineral reserves and do not meet the threshold for mineral reserve modifying factors such as estimated economic viability that would allow for conversion to mineral reserves there is no certainty that any part of the mineral resources estimated will be converted into mineral reserves 

c grades are p 2 o 5 ap which represents the p 2 o 5 associated with apatite and was calculated by the evaluation of the cao  p 2 o 5 ratio where cao  p 2 o 5 ratio was greater than or equal to 134 p 2 o 5 ap was equal to the total of p 2 o 5  where the cao  p 2 o 5 ratio was less than 135 p 2 o 5 ap was equal to the cao  135 ratio 

d mineral resource tonnages and grade are stated insitu and exclusive of mineral reserves cutoff grade of p 2 o 5 ap ≥ 50 and 09 ≤ ratio of cao to p 2 o 5 rcp ≤ 30 was applied to mineral resources measured indicated and inferred blocks were included in mineral resource estimates if they were inside mining concessions and exploration permits with a final report approved by anm but exclusive of physical structures such as the crusher and waste piles a revenue factor of 10 with sales price of r149292 per tonne of phosphate concentrate 2020 price evaluation was used to develop the mineral resource pit shell 

mineral reserves 

a mineral reserve estimate has been prepared for tapira mineral reserves are limited by the tapira property boundary and the ultimate pit designed for the lom plan which was limited with an economic optimized pit analysis 

the mineral reserve estimate includes mining modifying adjustments for mining ore recovery mining dilution and ore concentration recovery factors the mineral reserve estimate is limited to a cutoff grade of 50 p 2 o 5 ap as well as certain geometallurgical beneficiation criteria including 

a diluted ratio of cao to p 2 o 5 rcp between 09 and 30 

b within one of the four mineralized domains characterized by lithology and alteration 

the beneficiation plant generates conventional coarse and ultrafine concentrates from the tapira ore the beneficiation process includes milling of the ore magnetite separation hydrosizing and fines separation and flotation the mass recovery of coarse concentrate is forecast based on the results of laboratory flotation tests performed on drill core samples the mass recovery of coarse concentrate is predicted based on a mass recovery regression equation as a function of the rom fe 2 o 3  cao and p 2 o 5 chemical compositions 

the metallurgical recovery is calculated from the mass recovery the concentrate  p 2 o 5  and the rom  p 2 o 5 according to the following equation 

metallurgical recovery  100 x mass recovery x concentrate  p 2 o 5  rom  p 2 o 5 

the annual production estimates were used to determine annual estimates of capital and operating costs all cost estimates were in real 2021 r terms total capital costs included r38 billion of sustaining capital and opportunity costs annual operating costs were based predominantly on historical consumption factors and unit costs they included costs for ongoing final reclamation and closure annual total cost of rock production varied from r458 per tonne to r604 per tonne with an average total cost of production for a tonne of phosphate rock concentrate at r530 

for the purpose of reporting for our total financial statistics the discounted cash flow was converted from reais to us dollars at an exchange rate of r469  us100 

because tapira is a captive operation supplying rock to other mosaicowned chemical plants there is no transparent mined phosphate rock commodities price market in brazil mineral reserves for tapira were estimated based on an internal transfer price this internal transfer price was set as a constant number of us7164 per tonne r33600 per tonne

e mineral reserve tonnages and grade are stated as rom tonnages the mineral reserves are constrained by a pit design that honors site specific geotechnical designs by pit sector the mine plan considers constraints required for surface and groundwater management appropriate extraction methodology labor and equipment requirements beneficiation plant mass and metallurgical recoveries and are dependent upon all permits and environmental licenses in place and continued approved status the reference point for cutoff grade and pit optimization analysis is tonnes of concentrate at a price of r149292tonne concentrate 2020 price evaluation cutoff grade of p 2 o 5 ap ≥ 50 and 09 ≤ rcp ≤ 30 was applied to mineral reserves mineral reserves were proven to be economic based on internal transfer price that was derived in the discounted cash flow and compared to the gross margin available 

mineral resources and mineral reserves comparison 

no mineral resources were reported in 2020 as the company was reporting under industry guide 7 which did not recognize mineral resources as a result of the change in reporting to sk 1300 the mineral resources are being reported for the first time 

as of december 31 2021 we had mineral reserves of 4693 million tonnes compared to 6105 million in the prior year resulting in a decrease of 23 changes in mineral reserve tonnage from the prior year are the result of mining depletion small changes to beneficiation plant factors and the change from industry guide 7 to sk 1300 

regulation sk 1300 internal controls disclosure 

qualified persons including third parties and mosaic employees are responsible for estimating mineral resources and reserves mosaic has a global review team consisting of a broad spectrum of internal personnel outside the operating organization whose primary responsibilities include review of the mineral resources and reserves estimation reporting for compliance with sec rules and regulations the global review team includes members from mosaic’s accounting finance business units and legal departments reports prepared by qualified persons and third parties are reviewed at various levels of the global review team before they are ultimately reviewed and approved by our senior leadership team in future years mosaic expects to modify and streamline our sk 1300 processes and internal controls 




 item 3 legal proceedings 

we have included information about legal and environmental proceedings in note 22 of our notes to consolidated financial statements that information is incorporated herein by reference 

we are also subject to the following legal and environmental proceedings in addition to those described in note 22 of our consolidated financial statements included in this report 

countervailing duty petitions  in 2020 we filed petitions with the us department of commerce “ doc ” and the us international trade commission “ itc ” that requested the initiation of countervailing duty investigations into imports of 

phosphate fertilizers from morocco and russia the purpose of the petitions was to remedy the distortions that we believe foreign subsidies have caused or are causing in the us market for phosphate fertilizers and thereby restore fair competition on february 16 2021 the doc made final affirmative determinations that countervailable subsidies were being provided by those governments on march 11 2021 the itc made final affirmative determinations that the us phosphate fertilizer industry is materially injured by reason of subsidized phosphate fertilizer imports from morocco and russia as a result of these determinations the doc issued countervailing duty orders on phosphate fertilizer imports from russia and morocco which are scheduled to remain in place for at least five years currently the cash deposit rates for such imports are approximately 20 percent for moroccan producer ocp 9 percent and 47 percent for russian producers phosagro and eurochem respectively and 17 percent for all otherrussian producers the final determinations in the doc and itc investigations are subject to challenge before us federal courts and the world trade organization mosaic has initiated actions at the us court of international trade contesting certain aspects of the doc’s final determinations that we believe failed to capture the full extent of moroccan and russian phosphate fertilizer subsidies moroccan and russian producers have also initiated us court of international trade actions seeking lower cash deposit rates and revocation of the countervailing duty orders further the cash deposit rates and the amount of countervailing duties owed by importers on such imports could change based on the results of the litigation as well as doc’s annual administrative review proceedings 

the south pasture extension mine litigation on january 8 2020 the hardee county mining coordinator issued a notice of violation “ nov ” for the failure by mosaic to proceed with reclamation of two designated reclamation units within the south pasture mine footprint these two reclamation units comprise 166 acres of mined lands the nov cites noncompliance with the county land development regulations and with the conditions of development of regional impact “ dri ” development order 1221 that was issued in 2012 to authorize continued mining at the south pasture mine continued operation of the south pasture beneficiation plant and mining at the south pasture mine extension through the nov the county requested that mosaic submit a revised reclamation plan and schedule to demonstrate when initial reclamation activities would be completed for the two reclamation units identified in the nov 

the delay in meeting the required reclamation schedule at the two reclamation units is tied to the idling and eventual shutdown of the plant city fertilizer plant and the idling of the south pasture mine beneficiation plant the plant city facility was first idled in late 2017 in june 2019 mosaic announced that the plant city facility would be closed permanently 

given the relationship between the plant city fertilizer plant and the south pasture beneficiation plant and facing adverse market conditions mosaic idled the south pasture beneficiation plant in september 2018 idling of the south pasture mine beneficiation plant in september 2018 resulted in no tailings sand being produced by the processing of phosphate matrix as a result there was no tailings sand available for use in sand backfilling reclamation at the south pasture mine and specifically the two reclamation units identified in the county’s january 8th nov 

on march 10 2020 mosaic filed an “application for waiver and reclamation schedule extension” to secure board of county commissioners “ bocc ” approval of extended reclamation deadlines for the south pasture mine to obtain waiver relief from the bocc a quasijudicial hearing would be required 

extensive negotiations between mosaic and county legal and technical staff resulted in an agreement that involved two separate but related actions 1 secure a waiver and reclamation schedule extension through formal action by the bocc at a quasijudicial public hearing and 2 enter into a settlement agreement that would require payment of a civil penalty by mosaic for the noncompliance in meeting the required reclamation deadlines of the south pasture mine development order and the county mining ordinance the settlement agreement would also be presented and acted upon at a formal public hearing before the bocc 

on may 7 2020 a quasipublic judicial hearing was held before the hardee county bocc at that hearing the bocc voted unanimously to issue a waiver of the applicable reclamation deadlines of the south pasture development order and the county ordinance for three specific reclamation areas of the south pasture mine the waiver also included a negotiated alternative reclamation schedule that extends the deadline for completion of reclamation until the end of 2023 at that same hearing the bocc approved a settlement agreement that resolved all outstanding noncompliance associated with reclamation obligations at the south pasture mine and required mosaic to pay an agreed settlement amount of 249000 

mosaic has satisfied the payment obligation of the settlement agreement and continues to implement the alternative reclamation schedule as required monitoring programs have been put in place to ensure continued compliance with the waiver and settlement agreement 

cruz litigation  on august 27 2020 a putative class action complaint was filed in the circuit court of the thirteenth judicial circuit in hillsborough county florida against our wholly owned subsidiary mosaic global operations inc and 

two unrelated codefendants the complaint alleges claims related to elevated levels of radiation at two manufactured housing communities located on reclaimed mining land in mulberry polk county florida allegedly due to phosphate mining and reclamation activities occurring decades ago plaintiffs seek monetary damages including punitive damages injunctive relief requiring remediation of their properties and a medical monitoring program funded by the defendants on october 14 2021 the court substantially granted a motion to dismiss we filed late in 2020 with leave for the plaintiffs to amend their complaint 

on november 3 2021 plaintiffs filed an amended complaint and in response mosaic filed a motion to dismiss that complaint with prejudice on november 15 2021 on december 23 2021 plaintiffs opposed that motion and mosaic replied to that opposition on january 26 2022 

we intend to vigorously defend this matter

us phosphate crop nutrients and animal feed ingredients 

our us phosphates operations have capacity to produce approximately 45 million tonnes of phosphoric acid “ p 2 o 5 ” per year or about 7 of world annual capacity and about 59 of north american annual capacity phosphoric acid is produced by reacting finely ground phosphate rock with sulfuric acid phosphoric acid is the key building block for the production of high analysis or concentrated phosphate crop nutrients and animal feed products and is the most comprehensive measure of phosphate capacity and production and a commonly used benchmark in our industry our us phosphoric acid production totaled approximately 41 million tonnes during 2020 our us operations account for approximately 8 of estimated global annual production and 57 of estimated north american annual output 

our phosphate crop nutrient products are marketed worldwide to crop nutrient manufacturers distributors retailers and farmers our principal phosphate crop nutrient products are   

• diammonium phosphate 18460 diammonium phosphate “ dap ” is the most widely used highanalysis phosphate crop nutrient worldwide dap is produced by first combining phosphoric acid with anhydrous ammonia in a reaction vessel this initial reaction creates a slurry that is then pumped into a granulation plant where it is reacted with additional ammonia to produce dap dap is a solid granular product that is applied directly or blended with other solid plant nutrient products such as urea and potash 

• monoammonium phosphate 11520 monoammonium phosphate “ map ” is the second most widely used highanalysis phosphate crop nutrient and the fastest growing phosphate product worldwide map is also produced by first combining phosphoric acid with anhydrous ammonia in a reaction vessel the resulting slurry is then pumped into the granulation plant where it is reacted with additional phosphoric acid to produce map map is a solid granular product that is applied directly or blended with other solid plant nutrient products 

• microessentials ® is a valueadded ammoniated phosphate product that is enhanced through a patented process that creates very thin platelets of sulfur and other micronutrients such as zinc on the granulated product the patented process incorporates both the sulfate and elemental forms of sulfur providing seasonlong availability to crops 

production of our animal feed ingredients products is located at our new wales florida facility we market our feed phosphate primarily under the leading brand names of biofos ® and nexfos ®  

annual capacity by plant as of december 31 2020 and production volumes by plant for 2020 are listed below   



 

a our ability to produce processed phosphates has been less than our annual operational capacity stated in the table above except to the extent we purchase phosphoric acid factors affecting actual production are described in note c below 

b operational capacity is our estimated longterm capacity based on an average amount of scheduled down time including maintenance and scheduled turnaround time and product mix and no significant modifications to operating conditions equipment or facilities 

c actual production varies from annual operational capacity shown in the above table due to factors that include among others the level of demand for our products maintenance and turnaround time accidents mechanical failure product mix and other operating conditions 

d on december 19 2019 we temporarily idled our bartow florida phosphates operations facility to help rebalance the global supply and demand during downmarket conditions operations resumed on february 24 2020 

the phosphoric acid produced at uncle sam is shipped to faustina where it is used to produce dap map and microessentials ® our faustina plant also manufactures ammonia that is mostly consumed in our concentrate plants 

we produced approximately 72 million tonnes of concentrated phosphate crop nutrients during 2020 and accounted for approximately 73 of estimated north american annual production 

phosphate rock 

phosphate rock is the key mineral used to produce phosphate crop nutrients and feed phosphate our florida phosphate rock mines produced approximately 128 million tonnes in 2020 and accounted for approximately 61 of estimated north american annual production we are the world’s second largest miner of phosphate rock excluding china and currently operate four mines in north america with a combined annual capacity of approximately 172 million tonnes additionally we own 75 of the miski mayo mine in peru which has an annual capacity of 40 million tonnes production of one tonne of dap requires between 16 and 17 tonnes of phosphate rock 

all of our wholly owned phosphate mines and related mining operations in north america are located in central florida during 2020 we operated three active mines in florida four corners south fort meade and wingate on august 31 2018 we temporarily idled our south pasture florida phosphates mine we plan to develop the desoto reserves to replace reserves that will be depleted at various times in the future as part of the acquisition we acquired an additional 40 economic interest in the miski mayo mine in peru which increased our aggregate interest to 75 our investment in the miski mayo mine allows us to supplement our other produced rock to meet our overall fertilizer production needs and is the primarily source of rock for our louisiana operations effective with the closing of the acquisition we have the right to use or sell to third parties 75 of miski mayos annual production 

the phosphate deposits of florida are of sedimentary origin and are part of a phosphatebearing province that extends from southern florida north along the atlantic coast into southern virginia our active florida phosphate mines are primarily located in what is known as the bone valley member of the peace river formation in the central florida phosphate district the southern portions of the four corners and wingate mines are in what is referred to as the undifferentiated peace river formation in which the desoto reserves we plan to develop are also located phosphate mining has been conducted in the central florida phosphate district since the late 1800’s the potentially mineable portion of the district encompasses an area approximately 80 miles in length in a northsouth direction and approximately 40 miles in width 

in florida we extract phosphate ore using large surface mining machines that we own called “draglines” prior to extracting the ore the draglines must first remove a 10 to 50 foot layer of sandy overburden at our wingate mine we also utilize dredges to remove the overburden and mine the ore we then process the ore at beneficiation plants that we own at each active mine where the ore goes through washing screening sizing and flotation processes designed to separate the phosphate rock from sands clays and other foreign materials prior to commencing operations at any of our planned future mines we may need to acquire new draglines or move existing draglines to the mines and unless the beneficiation plant at an existing mine were used construct a beneficiation plant 

the phosphate deposits of peru are located within the shallow northtrending sechura basin in the piura region hosting successive interlayered marine sediments of phosphate we extract phosphate ore from the miski mayo mine using excavators the ore is then transported by truck to the feeding platform for supply to the feederbreakers which feed the conveyor belt for the beneficiation plant that we own the ore is then processed with successive stages of washing and gravimetric separations of seawater the final stage of the process is washing with desalinated water to remove salts from the concentrate the concentrate is then shipped to north america for use in our own production or sold to third parties 

the following table shows for each of our phosphate mines annual capacity as of december 31 2020 and rock production volume and grade for the years 2020 2019 and 2018 



 

a annual operational capacity is the expected average longterm annual capacity considering constraints represented by the grade quality and quantity of the reserves being mined as well as equipment performance and other operational factors 

b actual production varies from annual operational capacity shown in the above table due to factors that include among others the level of demand for our products the quality of the reserves the nature of the geologic formations we are mining at any particular time maintenance and turnaround time accidents mechanical failure weather conditions and other operating conditions as well as the effect of recent initiatives intended to improve operational excellence 

c bone phosphate of lime “ bpl ” is a traditional reference to the amount by weight percentage of calcium phosphate contained in phosphate rock or a phosphate ore body a higher bpl corresponds to a higher percentage of calcium phosphate 

d the percent of p 2 o 5 in the above table represents a measure of the phosphate content in phosphate rock or a phosphate ore body a higher percentage corresponds to a higher percentage of phosphate content in phosphate rock or a phosphate ore body 

e production at the four corners mine includes rock mined at the south pasture extension mine in hardee county from september 2018 to december 2018 

f on august 31 2018 we temporarily idled our south pasture florida beneficiation plant for an indefinite period of time 

g annual operational capacity and production tonnes for miski mayo are presented on a wet tonne basis based on average moisture levels of 35 to 45 as it exits the drying process and is prepared for shipping operational capacity and production on a dry tonne basis would be 38 million tonnes and 39 million tonnes respectively 

reserves 

we estimate our phosphate rock reserves based upon exploration core drilling as well as technical and economic analyses to determine that reserves can be economically mined proven measured reserves are those resources of sufficient concentration to meet minimum physical chemical and economic criteria related to our current product standards and mining and production practices our estimates of probable indicated reserves are based on information similar to that used for proven reserves but sites for drilling are farther apart or are otherwise less adequately spaced than for proven reserves although the degree of assurance is high enough to assume continuity between such sites proven reserves are determined using a minimum drill hole spacing in two locations per 40 acre block probable reserves have less than two drill holes per 40 acre block but geological data provides a high degree of assurance that continuity exists between sites 

the following table sets forth our proven and probable phosphate reserves as of december 31 2020 

 

a reserves are in areas that are fully accessible for mining free of surface or subsurface encumbrance legal setbacks wetland preserves and other legal restrictions that preclude permittable access for mining believed by us to be permittable and meet specified minimum physical economic and chemical criteria related to current mining and production practices phosphate rock mineral reserve estimates are based on in place material after adjustments for depletion mining and beneficiation recoveries 

b reserve estimates are generally established by our personnel without a third party review there has been no third party review of reserve estimates within the last five years the reserve estimates have been prepared in accordance with the standards set forth in industry guide 7 promulgated by the united states securities and exchange commission “ sec ” 

c of the reserves shown 5263 million tonnes are proven reserves while probable reserves totaled 773 million tonnes 

d average product bpl ranges from approximately 62 to 66 

e in connection with the purchase in 1996 of approximately 1111 million tonnes of the reported desoto reserves we agreed to i pay royalties of between 050 and 090 per ton of rock mined based on future levels of dap margins and ii pay to the seller lost income from the loss of surface use to the extent we use the property for mining related purposes 

f the four corners reserves include the ona west reserve tonnes 

g we pay royalties to the government of peru based on a percentage of net sales and final determined price these royalty payments average approximately 6 million annually 

h the east ona reserves are expected to be mined through our south pasture mine location 

we generally own the reserves shown for active mines in the table above with the only significant exceptions being further described below   

• we own the aboveground assets of the south fort meade mine including the beneficiation plant rail track and the initial clay settling areas a limited partnership south ft meade partnership lp “ sfmp ” owns the majority of the mineable acres shown in the table for the south fort meade mine 

• we currently have a 95 economic interest in the profits and losses of sfmp sfmp is included as a consolidated subsidiary in our financial statements 

• we have a longterm mineral lease with sfmp this lease expires on the earlier of december 31 2025 or on the date that we have completed mining and reclamation obligations associated with the leased property lease provisions include royalty payments and a commitment to give mining priority to the south fort meade phosphate reserves we pay the partnership a royalty on each bpl short ton mined and shipped from the areas that we lease from it royalty payments to sfmp normally average approximately 11 million annually 

• through its arrangements with us sfmp also earns income from mineral lease payments agricultural lease payments and interest income and uses those proceeds primarily to pay dividends to its equity owners 

• the surface rights to approximately 942 acres for the south fort meade mine are owned by sfmp while the us government owns the mineral rights beneath we control the rights to mine these reserves under a mining lease agreement and pay royalties on the tonnage extracted under the lease we paid an immaterial amount of royalties to the us government in 2020 

in light of the longterm nature of our rights to our reserves we expect to be able to mine all reported reserves that are not currently owned prior to termination or expiration of our rights additional information regarding permitting is included in part i item 1a “risk factors” and under “environmental health safety and security matters—operating requirements and impacts—permitting” in our management’s analysis 

investments in mwspc 

we own a 25 interest in mwspc and in connection with our equity share we are entitled to market approximately 25 of mwspc’s production mwspc consists of a mine and two chemical complexes the “ project ” that produce phosphate fertilizers and other downstream phosphates products in the kingdom of saudi arabia the greenfield project was built in the northern region of saudi arabia at wa’ad al shamal minerals industrial city and included further expansion of processing plants in ras al khair minerals industrial city which is located on the east coast of saudi arabia ammonia operations commenced in late 2016 and on december 1 2018 mwspc commenced commercial operations of the phosphate plant thereby bringing the entire project to the commercial production phase phosphate production will gradually rampup until it reaches an expected 30 million tonnes in annual production capacity actual phosphate production was 21 million tonnes in 2020 the project is expected to benefit from the availability of key raw nutrients from sources within saudi arabia 

our cash investment in the project was 770 million at december 31 2020 our obligation to contribute additional equity was eliminated as part of the project debt refinancing in 2020 

sulfur 

we use molten sulfur at our phosphates concentrates plants to produce sulfuric acid primarily for use in our production of phosphoric acid we purchased approximately 36 million long tons of sulfur during 2020 we purchase the majority of this sulfur from north american oil and natural gas refiners who are required to remove or recover sulfur during the refining process production of one tonne of dap requires approximately 040 long tons of sulfur we procure our sulfur from multiple sources and receive it by truck rail barge and vessel either directly at our phosphate plants or have it sent for gathering to terminals that are located on the us gulf coast in addition we use formed sulfur received through tampa ports which are delivered by truck to our new wales facility and melted through our sulfur melter 

we own and operate a sulfur terminal in riverview florida we also lease terminal space in tampa florida and galveston and beaumont texas we have longterm time charters on two oceangoing tugsbarges and one oceangoing vessel that transports molten sulfur from the texas terminals to tampa we then further transport by truck to our florida phosphate plants in addition we own a 50 equity interest in gulf sulphur services ltd lllp “ gulf sulphur services ” which is 

operated by our joint venture partner gulf sulphur services has a sulfur transportation and terminaling business in the gulf of mexico and handles these functions for a substantial portion of our florida sulfur volume our sulfur logistic assets also include a large fleet of leased railcars that supplement our marine sulfur logistic system our louisiana operations are served by truck from nearby refineries 

although sulfur is readily available from many different suppliers and can be transported to our phosphate facilities by a variety of means sulfur is an important raw material used in our business that has in the past been and may in the future be the subject of volatile pricing and availability alternative transportation and terminaling facilities might not have sufficient capacity to fully serve all of our facilities in the event of a disruption to current transportation or terminaling facilities changes in the price of sulfur or disruptions to sulfur transportation or terminaling facilities could have a material impact on our business we have included a discussion of sulfur prices in our management’s analysis

we use ammonia together with phosphoric acid to produce dap map and microessentials ® we consumed approximately 12 million tonnes of ammonia during 2020 production of one tonne of dap requires approximately 023 tonnes of ammonia we purchase approximately onethird of our ammonia from various suppliers in the spot market with the remaining twothirds either purchased through our ammonia supply agreement the “ cf ammonia supply agreement ” with an affiliate of cf industries inc “ cf ” or produced internally at our faustina louisiana location 

our florida ammonia needs are currently supplied under multiyear contracts with both domestic and offshore producers ammonia for our bartow and riverview plants is terminaled through owned ammonia facilities at the port of tampa and port sutton florida ammonia for our new wales plant is terminaled through another ammonia facility owned and operated by a third party at port sutton florida pursuant to an agreement that provides for service through 2022 with automatic renewal for an additional twoyear period unless either party terminates as provided in the agreement ammonia is transported by pipeline from the terminals to our production facilities we have service agreements with the operators of the pipelines for bartow new wales and riverview which provided service through june 30 2022 with an annual autorenewal provision unless either party objects 

under the cf ammonia supply agreement mosaic agreed to purchase approximately 523000 to 725000 metric tonnes of ammonia per year during a term that commenced in 2017 and may extend until december 31 2032 at a price tied to the prevailing price of us natural gas the contract provides for early termination at certain dates for 2020 our minimum purchase obligation was approximately 523000 metric tonnes and actual purchases were 527000 metric tonnes a specialized tug and barge unit transports ammonia for us between a load location at donaldsonville louisiana and a discharge location at tampa florida additional information about this chartered unit and its financing is provided in note 25 of our consolidated financial statements we expect a majority of the ammonia purchased under the cf ammonia supply agreement to be received by barge at the port of tampa and delivered to our florida facilities as described in the preceding paragraph while the market prices of natural gas and ammonia have changed since we executed this agreement in 2013 and will continue to change we expect that the agreement will provide us a competitive advantage over its term including by providing a reliable longterm ammonia supply 

we produce ammonia at faustina louisiana primarily for our own consumption our annual capacity is approximately 530000 tonnes from time to time we sell surplus ammonia to unrelated parties andor may transport surplus ammonia to the port of tampa in addition under certain circumstances we are permitted to receive ammonia at faustina under the cf ammonia supply agreement 

although ammonia is readily available from many different suppliers and can be transported to our phosphates facilities by a variety of means ammonia is an important raw material used in our business that has in the past been and may in the future be the subject of volatile pricing in addition alternative transportation and terminaling facilities might not have sufficient capacity to fully serve all of our facilities in the event of a disruption to existing transportation or terminaling facilities changes in the price of ammonia or disruptions to ammonia transportation or terminaling could have a material impact on our business we have included a discussion of ammonia prices in our management’s analysis 

natural gas for phosphates 

natural gas is the primary raw material used to manufacture ammonia at our faustina facility ammonia is manufactured on site the majority of natural gas is purchased through firm delivery contracts based on published indexbased prices and is 

sourced from texas and louisiana via pipelines interconnected to the henry hub we use overthecounter swap andor option contracts to forward price portions of future gas purchases we typically purchase approximately 16 million mmbtu of natural gas per year for use in ammonia production at faustina 

our ammonia requirements for our florida operations are purchased rather than manufactured on site therefore while we typically purchase approximately two million mmbtu of natural gas per year in florida it is only used as a thermal fuel for various phosphate production processes 

florida land holdings 

we are a significant landowner in the state of florida which has in the past been considered one of the fastest areas of population growth in the united states we own land comprising over 290000 acres held in fee simple title in central florida and have the right to mine additional properties which contain phosphate rock reserves some of our land holdings are needed to operate our phosphates business while a portion of our land assets such as certain reclaimed properties are no longer required for our ongoing operations as a general matter more of our reclaimed property becomes available for uses other than for phosphate operations each year our real property assets are generally comprised of concentrates plants port facilities phosphate mines and other property which we have acquired through our presence in florida our longterm future land use strategy is to optimize the value of our land assets for example we developed streamsong resort ® the “ resort ” a destination resort and conference center in an area of previously mined land as part of our longterm business strategy to maximize the value and utility of our extensive land holdings in florida in addition to the hotel and conference center the resort includes three golf courses a clubhouse and ancillary facilities 

potash segment 

we are one of the leading potash producers in the world we mine and process potash in canada and the united states and sell potash in north america and internationally the term “potash” applies generally to the common salts of potassium muriate of potash “ mop ” is the primary source of potassium for the crop nutrient industry red mop has traces of iron oxide the granular and standard grade red mop products are well suited for direct fertilizer application and bulk blending white mop has a higher percent potassium oxide “ k 2 o ” white mop besides being well suited for the agricultural market is used in many industrial applications we also produce a double sulfate of potash magnesia product which we market under our brand name kmag ®  at our carlsbad new mexico facility 

our potash products are marketed worldwide to crop nutrient manufacturers distributors and retailers and are also used in the manufacturing of mixed crop nutrients and to a lesser extent in animal feed ingredients we also sell potash to customers for industrial use in addition our potash products are used for deicing and as a water softener regenerant 

in 2020 we operated two potash mines in canada including one shaft mine with a total of three production shafts and one solution mine as well as one potash shaft mine in the united states we own related mills or refineries at our mines in december 2020 we indefinitely idled our potash mine in colonsay saskatchewan also as part of the acquisition we acquired a potash project in kronau saskatchewan 

we continue the expansion of capacity in our potash segment with the k3 shafts at our esterhazy mine these shafts added 09 million tonnes to our annual potash operational capacity this includes infrastructure to move ore from k3 to the k1 and k2 mills which was fully commissioned during the year in 2020 k3 has transported 43 million raw ore tonnes to the k1 and k2 mills as k3 production ramps up we plan to cease underground mining at k1 and k2 by mid2022 we expect to eliminate our brine inflow costs at these two mine shafts by the end of 2021 while we expect brine management costs to be eliminated once k3 is fully operational an increase in inflow levels could cause us to change our mining processes or abandon those mine shafts prior to completion of k3 

see “key factors that can affect results of operations and financial condition” and “potash net sales and gross margin” in our management’s analysis and “our esterhazy mine has had an inflow of salt saturated brine for more than 30 years” in part i item 1a “risk factors” in this report which are incorporated herein by reference for a discussion of costs risks and other information relating to the brine inflows 

the map below shows the location of each of our potash mines 

our north american potash annualized operational capacity totals 112 million tonnes of product per year and accounts for approximately 12 of world annual capacity and 32 of north american annual capacity production during 2020 totaled 84 million tonnes we account for approximately 11 of estimated world annual production and 34 of estimated north american annual production 

the following table shows for each of our potash mines annual capacity as of december 31 2020 and volume of mined ore average grade and finished product output for years 2020 2019 and 2018 

 

a finished product 

b actual production varies from annual operational capacity shown in the above table due to factors that include among othersthe level of demand for our products maintenance and turnaround time the quality of the reserves and the nature of the geologic formations we are mining at any particular time accidents mechanical failure product mix and other operating conditions 

c represents full capacity assuming no turnaround or maintenance time 

d the annualized proven peaking capacity shown above is the capacity currently used to determine our share of canpotex limited “ canpotex ” sales canpotex members’ respective shares of canpotex sales are based upon the members’ respective proven peaking capacities for producing potash when a canpotex member expands its production capacity the new capacity is added to that member’s proven peaking capacity based on a proving run at the maximum production level alternatively after january 2017 canpotex members may elect to rely on an independent engineering firm and approved protocols to calculate their proven peaking capacity the annual operational capacity reported in the table above can exceed the annualized proven peaking capacity until the proving run has been completed our share of canpotex is 362 it has remained at that level through december 31 2020 

e annual operational capacity is our estimated long term potash capacity based on the quality of reserves and the nature of the geologic formations expected to be mined milled andor processed over the long term average amount of scheduled down time including maintenance and scheduled turnaround time and product mix and no significant modifications to operating conditions equipment or facilities operational capacities will continue to be updated to the extent new production results impact ore grades assumptions 

f grade  k 2 o is a traditional reference to the percentage by weight of potassium oxide contained in the ore a higher percentage corresponds to a higher percentage of potassium oxide in the ore 

g in august 2019 we temporarily idled our colonsay saskatchewan potash mine for the remainder of 2019 in light of reduced customer demand on january 28 2020 we announced that we intend to keep it idled for the foreseeable future the colonsay operating capacity will not be included in our operating rate calculation until it resumes operation 

h we have the ability to reach an annual operating capacity of 21 million tonnes over time by increasing our staffing levels and investment in mine development activities 

i the annual operational capacity of esterhazy increased by 07 million tonnes in 2019 reflecting the rampup in capacity from the k3 shaft 

j kmag ® is a specialty product that we produce at our carlsbad facility 

canadian mines 

we operate two canadian potash facilities located in the southern half of the province of saskatchewan they are our solution mine at belle plaine and two interconnected mine shafts at our esterhazy shaft mine our shaft mine at colonsay was indefinitely idled in december 2019 in addition we are expanding our esterhazy mine for the k3 shaft 

extensive potash deposits are found in the southern half of the province of saskatchewan the potash ore is contained in a predominantly rock salt formation known as the prairie evaporites the prairie evaporites deposits are bounded by limestone formations and contain the potash beds three potash deposits of economic importance occur in saskatchewan the esterhazy belle plaine and patience lake members the patience lake member is mined at colonsay and the esterhazy member at esterhazy at belle plaine all three members are mined each of the major potash members contains several potash beds of different thicknesses and grades the particular beds mined at colonsay and esterhazy have a mining height of 11 and 8 feet respectively at belle plaine several beds of different thicknesses are mined 

our potash mines in canada produce mop exclusively esterhazy and colonsay utilize shaft mining while belle plaine utilizes solution mining technology traditional potash shaft mining takes place underground at depths of over 1000 meters where continuous mining machines cut out the ore face and load it onto conveyor belts the ore is then crushed moved to storage bins and hoisted to refineries above ground in contrast our solution mining process involves heated brine which is pumped through a “cluster” to dissolve the potash in the ore beds at a depth of approximately 1500 meters a cluster consists of a series of boreholes drilled into the potash ore a separate distribution center at each cluster controls the brine flow the solution containing dissolved potash and salt is pumped to a refinery where sodium chloride a coproduct of this process is separated from the potash through the use of evaporation and crystallization techniques concurrently the solution is pumped into a cooling pond where additional crystallization occurs and the resulting product is recovered via a floating dredge refined potash is dewatered dried and sized our canadian operations produce 14 different mop products including industrial grades many through proprietary processes 

our potash mineral rights in the province of saskatchewan consist of the following 

we believe that our mineral rights in saskatchewan are sufficient to support current operations for more than a century leases are generally renewable at our option for successive terms generally 21 years each except that certain of the acres shown above as “leased from others” are leased under longterm leases with terms including renewals at our option that expire from 2023 to 2170 

as part of the acquisition mosaic acquired the assets of vale potash canada ltd and its greenfield potash project in the kronau area approximately 27 kilometers southeast of regina saskatchewan in addition mosaic leases approximately 294000 acres of mineral rights from the government of saskatchewan and approximately 99700 acres of freehold mineral rights in the kronauregina area which have not been developed and are not included in the table above 

we pay canadian resource taxes consisting of the potash production tax and resource surcharge the potash production tax is a saskatchewan provincial tax on potash production and consists of a base payment and a profits tax we also pay a percentage of the value of resource sales from our saskatchewan mines in addition to the canadian resource taxes royalties are payable to the mineral owners in respect of potash reserves or production of potash we have included a further discussion of the canadian resource taxes and royalties in our management’s analysis 

since december 1985 we have effectively managed an inflow of salt saturated brine into our esterhazy mine at various times since then we have experienced changing amounts and patterns of brine inflows at esterhazy to date the brine inflow including our remediation efforts to control it has not had a material impact on our production processes or volumes the volume of the net brine inflow the rate of inflow less the amount we are pumping out of the mine or net outflow when we are pumping more brine out of the mine than the rate of inflow fluctuates and is dependent on a number of variables such as the location of the source of the inflow the magnitude of the inflow available pumping surface and underground brine storage capacities underground injection well capacities and the effectiveness of calcium chloride and cementatious grout used to reduce or prevent the inflows among other factors as a result of these brine inflows we incur expenditures certain of which have been capitalized and others that have been charged to expense 

while we expect future brine management costs to be eliminated once k3 is fully operational it is possible that inflow levels at esterhazy may increase before the shutdown of k1 and k2 mining which could lead us to change our mining processes or abandon those mine shafts see “key factors that can affect results of operations and financial condition” and “potash net sales and gross margin” in our management’s analysis and “our esterhazy mine has had an inflow of salt saturated brine for more than 30 years” in part i item 1a “risk factors” in this report which are incorporated herein by reference for a discussion of costs risks and other information relating to the brine inflows the k3 shafts at our esterhazy mine are part of our potash expansion plan which is also designed to mitigate risk from current and future inflows 

due to the ongoing brine inflow at esterhazy subject to exceptions that are limited in scope and amount we are unable to obtain insurance coverage for underground operations for water incursion problems for the k1 and k2 shafts like other potash producers’ shaft mines our colonsay saskatchewan and carlsbad new mexico mines are also subject to the risks of inflow of water as a result of their shaft mining operations but water inflow risks at these mines are included in our insurance coverage subject to deductibles limited coverage terms and lower sublimits negotiated with our insurers 

united states mine 

in the united states we have a shaft mine located in carlsbad new mexico the ore reserves at our carlsbad mine are made up of langbeinite a double sulfate of potassium and magnesium this type of potash reserve occurs in a predominantly rock salt formation known as the salado formation the mcnutt member of this formation consists of eleven units of economic importance of which we currently mine one the mcnutt member’s evaporite deposits are interlayered with anhydrite polyhalite potassium salts clay and minor amounts of sandstone and siltstone 

continuous underground mining methods are utilized to extract the ore drum type mining machines are used to cut the langbeinite ore from the face mined ore is then loaded onto conveyors transported to storage areas and then hoisted to the surface for further processing at our refinery 

we produce a double sulfate of potash magnesia product which we market under our brand name kmag ®  at our carlsbad facility 

at the carlsbad facility we mine and refine potash from 77221 a cres of mineral rights we control these reserves pursuant to either i leases from the us government that in general continue in effect at our option subject to readjustment by the us government every 20 years or ii leases from the state of new mexico that continue as long as we continue to produce from them these reserves contain an estimated total of 176 million tonnes of potash mineralization calculated after estimated extraction losses in one mining bed evaluated at thicknesses ranging from 65 feet to 10 feet at average refinery rates these ore reserves are estimated to be sufficient to yield 32 million tonnes of langbeinite concentrates with an average grade of approximately 22 k 2 o at projected rates of production we estimate that carlsbad’s reserves of langbeinite are sufficient to support operations for approximately 464 years 

royalties for the us operations amounted to approximately 71 million in 2020 these royalties are established by the us department of the interior bureau of land management in the case of the carlsbad leases from the us government and pursuant to provisions set forth in the leases in the case of the carlsbad state leases 

reserves 

our estimates below of our potash reserves and nonreserve potash mineralization are based on exploration drill hole data seismic data and actual mining results over more than 35 years proven reserves are estimated by identifying material in place that is delineated on at least two sides and material in place within a halfmile radius or distance from an existing sampled mine entry or exploration core hole probable reserves are estimated by identifying material in place within a one mile radius from an existing sampled mine entry or exploration core hole historical extraction ratios from the many years of mining results are then applied to both types of material to estimate the proven and probable reserves we believe that all reserves and nonreserve potash mineralization reported below are potentially recoverable using existing production shaft and refinery locations 

our estimated recoverable potash ore reserves and nonreserve potash mineralization as of december 31 2020 for each of our mines are as follows 

 

a there has been no third party review of reserve estimates within the last five years the reserve estimates have been prepared in accordance with the standards set forth in industry guide 7 promulgated by the sec 

b includes 13 billion tonnes of proven reserves and 08 billion tonnes of probable reserves 

c the nonreserve potash mineralization reported in the table in some cases extends to the boundaries of the mineral rights we own or lease such boundaries are up to 16 miles from the closest existing sampled mine entry or exploration core hole based on available geologic data the nonreserve potash mineralization represents potash that we expect to mine in the future but it may not meet all of the technical requirements for categorization as proven or probable reserves under industry guide 7 

as discussed more fully above we either own the reserves and mineralization shown above or lease them pursuant to mineral leases that generally remain in effect or are renewable at our option or are longterm leases accordingly we expect to be able to mine all reported reserves that are leased prior to termination or expiration of the existing leases 

natural gas 

natural gas is used at our belle plaine solution mine as a fuel to produce steam and to dry potash products the steam is used to generate electricity and provide thermal energy to the evaporation crystallization and solution mining processes the belle plaine solution mine typically accounts for approximately 80 of our potash segment’s total natural gas requirements for potash production at our shaft mines natural gas is used as a fuel to heat fresh air supplied to the shaft mines and for drying potash products combined natural gas usage for both the solution and shaft mines totaled 16 million mmbtu during 2020 we purchase our natural gas requirements on firm delivery index pricebased physical contracts and on short term spotpriced physical contracts our canadian operations purchase physical natural gas from alberta and saskatchewan using aeco price indices references and transport the gas to our plants via the transgas pipeline system the us potash operation in new mexico purchases physical gas in the southwest respective regional market using the el paso san juan basin market pricing reference we use financial derivative contracts to manage the pricing on portions of our natural gas requirements 

mosaic fertilizantes segment 

our mosaic fertilizantes segment owns and operates mines chemical plants crop nutrient blending and bagging facilities port terminals and warehouses in brazil and paraguay which produce and sell concentrated phosphates crop nutrients phosphatebased animal feed ingredients and pot a sh fertilizer the following map shows the locations of our operations in brazil and paraguay 

we are the largest producer and one of the largest distributors of blended crop nutrients for agricultural use in brazil we produce and sell phosphate and potashbased crop nutrients and animal feed ingredients through our operations our operations in brazil include five phosphate mines four chemical plants and a potash mine we own and operate ten blending plants in brazil and one blending plant and port in paraguay in addition we lease several other warehouses and blending units depending on sales and production levels we also have a 62 ownership interest in fospar sa “ fospar ” fospar owns and operates an ssp defined below granulation plant which produces approximately 05 million tonnes of ssp per year and a deepwater port and throughput warehouse terminal facility in paranagua brazil the port facility at paranagua handles approximately 30 million tonnes of imported crop nutrients in 2020 mosaic fertilizantes sold approximately 106 million tonnes of crop nutrient products and accounted for approximately 25 of fertilizer shipments in brazil 

we have the capability to annually produce approximately 40 million tonnes of phosphate and potashbased crop nutrients and animal feed ingredients crop nutrient products produced are marketed to crop nutrient manufacturers distributors retailers and farmers 

in addition to producing crop nutrients mosaic fertilizantes purchases phosphates potash and nitrogen products which are either used to produce blended crop nutrients “ blends ” or for resale in 2020 mosaic fertilizantes purchased 17 million tonnes of phosphatebased products primarily microessentials ®  from our phosphates segment and 21 million tonnes of potash products from our potash segment and canpotex 

phosphate crop nutrients and animal feed ingredients 

our brazilian phosphates operations have capacity to produce approximately 11 million tonnes of phosphoric acid “ p 2 o 5 ” per year or about 76 of brazilian annual capacity phosphoric acid is produced by reacting ground phosphate rock with sulfuric acid phosphoric acid is the key building block for the production of high analysis or concentrated phosphate crop 

nutrients and animal feed products and is the most comprehensive measure of phosphate capacity and production and a commonly used benchmark in our industry our brazilian phosphoric acid production totaled approximately 11 million tonnes in 2020 and accounted for approximately 91 of brazilian annual output 

our principal phosphate crop nutrient products are 

• monoammonium phosphate 11520 map map is a crop nutrient composed of two macronutrients nitrogen and phosphoric acid this slurry is added inside a rotary drum type granulator with ammonia to complete the neutralization reaction and produce map 

• triple superphosphate tsp tsp is a highly concentrated phosphate crop nutrient tsp is produced from the phosphate rock reaction with phosphoric acid in a kuhlmann type reactor the process for the production of tsp in brazil is run of pile where the product undergoes a curing process of approximately seven days for later granulation 

• single superphosphate ssp ssp is a crop nutrient with a low concentration of phosphorus that is used in agriculture because of the sulfur content in its formulation ssp is produced from mixing phosphate rock with sulfuric acid in a kuhlmann or malaxador type reactor after the reaction the product goes to the curing process and then feeds the granulation units 

• dicalcium phosphate dcp dicalcium phosphate is produced by the reaction of desulphurized phosphoric acid with limestone at uberaba it is produced from the reaction of concentrated phosphoric acid with limestone slurry at cajati the phosphoric acid is diluted with dry limestone the reaction of the dcp occurs in a kuhlmann or spinden type reactor 

our primary mines and chemical plants are located in the states of minas gerais sao paulo and goias production of our animal feed ingredients products is located at our uberaba minas gerais and cajati sao paulo facilities we market our feed phosphate primarily under the brand name foscálcio 

annual capacity by plant as of december 31 2020 and production volumes by plant for 2020 are listed below 

 

a our ability to produce processed phosphates has been less than our annual operational capacity as stated in the table above except to the extent we purchase phosphoric acid factors affecting actual production are described in note c below 

b the annual production capacity was calculated using the hourly capacity days stopped for annual maintenance and oee historical utilization factor and capacity factor 

c actual production varies from annual operational capacity shown in the table above due to factors that include among others the level of demand for our products maintenance and turnaround time accidents mechanical failure 

the phosphoric acid produced at cajati is used to produce dcp the phosphoric acid produced at uberaba is used to produce map tsp and dcp 

we produced approximately 30 million tonnes of concentrated phosphate crop nutrients during 2020 which accounted for approximately 70 of estimated brazilian annual production 

phosphate rock 

phosphate rock is the key mineral used to produce phosphate crop nutrients and animal feed product our phosphate rock production in brazil totaled approximately 43 million tonnes in 2020 which accounted for approximately 82 of estimated 

brazilian annual production we are the largest producer of phosphate rock in brazil and currently operate five mines with a combined annual capacity of approximately 50 million tonnes production of one tonne of map requires 16 to 17 tonnes of phosphate rock production of one tonne of ssp requires between 06 to 07 tonnes of phosphate rock production of one tonne of tsp requires 14 tonnes of phosphate rock 

our wholly owned phosphate mines and related mining operations in brazil are located in the states of minas gerais goiás and são paulo during 2020 we operated five active mines araxá patrocínio and tapira in the state of minas gerais catalão in the state of goiás and cajati in the state of são paulo 

all of our brazilian phosphate rock mines are open pit mines the phosphate ore is extracted by drilling and blasting loaded by backhoe into trucks and transported to the processing plants at each mine with the exception of patrocínio which does not have its own processing plant the ore extracted at patrocínio is transported by rail to araxá for processing we process the ore at beneficiation plants that we own 

the following table shows the annual capacity of rock production volume and grade for each of our phosphate mines as of december 31 2020 and 2019 

 

a annual operational capacity is the expected average longterm annual capacity considering constraints represented by the grade quality and quantity of the reserves being mined as well as equipment performance and other operational factors 

b actual production varies from annual operational capacity shown in the above table due to factors that include among others the level of demand for our products the quality of the reserves the nature of the geologic formations we are mining at any particular time maintenance and turnaround time accidents mechanical failure weather conditions and other operating conditions as well as the effect of recent initiatives intended to improve operational excellence in 2019 our actual production was negatively impacted by downtime to comply with new standards implemented by brazils national mining agency 

c bpl is a traditional reference to the amount by weight percentage of calcium phosphate contained in phosphate rock or a phosphate ore body a higher bpl corresponds to a higher percentage of calcium phosphate 

d the percent of p 2 o 5 in the above table represents a measure of the phosphate content in phosphate rock or a phosphate ore body a higher percentage corresponds to a higher percentage of phosphate content in phosphate rock or a phosphate ore body 

phosphate reserves 

the evaluation of mineral reserves is based upon exploration core drilling as well as technical and economic analyses to determine that reserves can be economically mined proven measured reserves are those resources of sufficient concentration to meet minimum physical chemical and economic criteria related to our current product standards and mining and production practices our estimates or probable indicated reserves are based on information similar to that used for proven reserves but sites for drilling are farther apart or are otherwise less adequately spaced than for proven reserves although the degree of assurance is high enough to assume continuity between such sites 

the following table sets forth our proven and probable phosphates reserves as of december 31 2020 

 

a tonnage is stated in millions of run of mine dry metric tons and grade is  p205 after adjustments for depletion mining dilution and recovery 

b mineral reserves were reviewed by external consulting firms 

c of the reserves shown 4920 million tonnes are proven reserves while probable reserves totaled 7452 million tonnes 

d the cutoff grade for mineral reserves for each deposit is araxá  50 p2o5 cajati  30 p2o5 catalão  70 p2o5 patrocínio  50 p2o5 and tapira  50 p2o5 

e the declared reserves correspond to the original scope of the patrocínio project 

we are required to pay royalties to mineral owners and resource taxes to the brazilian government for phosphate and potash production the resource taxes known as compensação financeira pela exploração de recursos minerais or cfem  are regulated by the national mining agency in 2020 we paid royalties and resource taxes of approximately 8 million 

sulfur 

we use molten sulfur at our phosphates concentrates plants to produce sulfuric acid one of the key components used in our production of phosphoric acid we consumed approximately 12 million long tons of sulfur for our own production during 2020 we purchase approximately 25 of the volume under annual supply agreements from oil and natural gas refiners who are required to remove or recover sulfur during the refining process the remaining 75 is purchased in the spot market sulfur is imported through the tiplam port and transported by rail to the uberaba plant and by truck to the araxá and cajati locations 

although sulfur is readily available from many different suppliers and can be transported to our phosphate facilities by a variety of means sulfur is an important raw material used in our business that has in the past been and could in the future be subject to volatile pricing and availability alternative transportation and terminaling facilities might not have sufficient capacity to fully serve all of our facilities in the event of a disruption to current transportation or terminaling facilities changes in the price of sulfur or disruptions or sulfur transportation or terminaling facilities could have a material impact on our business 

ammonia 

we use ammonia together with phosphoric acid to produce map and to a lesser extent for ssp production we consumed approximately 169334 tonnes of ammonia during 2020 production of one tonne of map requires approximately 0137 tonnes of ammonia we purchase all of our ammonia under a longterm supply agreement with two suppliers ammonia is imported through the tiplam port and transported by truck to uberaba araxá and catalão 

we own approximately 1 of the tiplam terminal in santos sao paulo our ownership percentage along with a contractual agreement guarantee us unloading priority for ammonia and also provide us unloading capacity for rock sulfur and crop nutrients 

although ammonia is readily available from many different suppliers and can be transported to our phosphates facilities by a variety of means ammonia is an important raw material used in our business that has in the past been and in the future could be subject to volatile pricing alternative transportation and terminaling facilities might not have sufficient capacity to fully serve all of our facilities in the event of a disruption to existing transportation or terminaling facilities changes in the price 

of ammonia or disruptions to ammonia transportation of terminaling could have a material impact on our business we have included a discussion of ammonia prices in our managements analysis 

brazilian potash 

we conduct potash operations through the leased taquarivassouras shaft mine which is the only potash mine in brazil located in rosário do catete in the brazilian state of sergipe we also own a related refinery at the site we produce and sell potash product domestically mop is the primary source of potassium for the crop nutrient industry in brazil red mop has traces of iron oxide the granular and standard grade red mop products are wellsuited for direct fertilizer application and bulk blending our potash product is marketed in brazil to crop nutrient manufacturers distributors and retailers and is also used in the manufacturing of crop nutrients 

potash mine 

the potash deposit is in the taquarivassouras subbasin and the taquarivassouras industrial complex is in rosário do catete it can be reached by road and is also served by rail about 9km from the site and a port facility about 40 km from the mine site the underground mining operations comprises three municipalities rosário do catete capela and carmópolis 

the ore is sylvinite kcl nacl containing sylvite kcl and halite nacl it is mined at a depth of 500 to 740 meters by room and pillar methods using six continuous miners room and pillar is a mining system in which the mined material is extracted across a horizontal plane creating horizontal arrays of rooms and pillars the ore is extracted in two phases in the first pillars of untouched material are left to support the roof overburden and open areas or rooms are extracted underground the pillars are then partially extracted in the same manner the technique is usually used for relatively flatlying deposits 

the beneficiation process operation begins at the runofmine stockpile the material is conveyed to the processing circuit where it is divided into seven major units crushing concentration dissolution drying compaction storage and shipping 

our current potash annualized operational capacity totals 520000 tonnes of product per year and accounts for 100 of brazilian annual capacity production totaled 438000 tonnes in 2020 with a k20 grade of 58 production during 2020 was negatively impacted by an area of challenging geology which affected the mines operating rates 

in 2020 we paid royalties of approximately 5 million related to the leasing of potash assets and mining rights for taquari 

reserves 

our estimate of potash reserves is based on exploration drill hole data seismic data and actual mining results we believe that all reserves are potentially recoverable using existing production and refinery locations as of december 31 2020 we had proven reserves of 57 million tonnes and probable reserves of 42 million tonnes with an average kcl grade of 2388 the cutoff grade is 20 kci based on current estimates we believe the reserves will be exhausted in 2024 

land holdings 

mosaic fertilizantes owns properties and the surface rights of certain additional rural lands comprising over 32000 hectares 79000 acres in the states of são paulo minas gerais goiás paraná mato grosso santa catarina bahia and sergipe and has the right to mine additional properties which contain phosphate rock or potash reserves most of our land holdings are needed to operate our phosphate and potash production and fertilizer distribution businesses a portion of our land assets may no longer be required for our current operations and may be leased to third parties for agricultural or other purposes or may be set aside for mineral or environmental conservation our real property assets are generally comprised of concentrates plants port facilities and phosphate and potash mines crop nutrient blending and bagging facilities and other properties which we have acquired through our presence in brazil 

india and china distribution businesses 

our china and india distribution businesses market phosphate potash and nitrogenbased crop nutrients and provide other ancillary services to wholesalers cooperatives independent retailers and farmers in the asiapacific regions these operations provide our phosphates and potash segments access to key markets outside of north and south america and serve as a marketing agent for our phosphates segment in 2020 the india and china operations purchased 127737 tonnes of phosphatebased products from our phosphates segment and mwspc and 1387743 tonnes of potash products from our 

potash segment and canpotex they also purchase phosphates potash and nitrogen products from unrelated third parties which we either use to produce blended crop nutrients or for resale 

in china we own two 300000tonne per year capacity blending plants in 2020 we sold approximately 233000 tonnes of blends and distributed another 973000 tonnes of phosphate and potash crop nutrients in china 

in india we have distribution facilities to import and sell crop nutrients in 2020 we distributed approximately 793000 tonnes of phosphate and potash crop nutrient products in india 

sales and distribution activities 

united states and canada 

we have a united states and canada sales and marketing team that serves our business segments we sell to wholesale distributors retail chains cooperatives independent retailers and national accounts 

customer service and the ability to effectively minimize the overall supply chain costs are key competitive factors in the crop nutrient and animal feed ingredients businesses in addition to our production facilities to service the needs of our customers we own or have contractual throughput or other arrangements at strategically located distribution warehouses along or near the mississippi and ohio rivers as well as in other key agricultural regions of the united states and canada from these facilities we distribute mosaicproduced phosphate and potash products for customers who in turn resell the product into the distribution channel or directly to farmers in the united states and canada 

we own port facilities in tampa florida and houston texas which have deep water berth capabilities providing access to the gulf of mexico we discontinued operations at the houston texas facility in 2017 we also own warehouse distribution facilities in savage minnesota rosemount minnesota pekin illinois and henderson kentucky we anticipate idling of the savage minnesota facility in the first quarter of 2021 

in addition to the facilities that we own our us distribution operations also include leased distribution space or contractual throughput agreements in other key geographical areas including california florida illinois indiana iowa kentucky louisiana minnesota missouri nebraska north dakota ohio oklahoma texas and wisconsin 

our canadian customers include independent dealers and national accounts we also lease and own warehouse facilities in saskatchewan ontario quebec and manitoba in canada 

international 

outside of the united states and canada we market our phosphates segment’s products through our mosaic fertilizantes segment and our china and india distribution businesses as well as a salesforce focused on geographies outside of north america the countries that account for the largest amount of our phosphates sales outside the united states by volume are brazil canada australia and argentina 

our sales outside of the united states and canada of potash products are made through canpotex canpotex sales are allocated between its members based on peaking capacity in 2020 our share of canpotex sales remained at 362 

our potash exports from carlsbad are sold through our own sales force we also market our potash segment’s products through our mosaic fertilizantes segment and our china and india distribution businesses which acquire potash primarily through canpotex the countries that account for the largest amount of international potash sales by volume are brazil china indonesia india and malaysia 

to service the needs of our customers our mosaic fertilizantes segment includes a network of strategically located sales offices crop nutrient blending and bagging facilities port terminals and warehouse distribution facilities that we own and operate the blending and bagging facilities primarily produce blends from phosphate potash and nitrogen the average product mix in our blends by volume contains approximately 18 nitrogen 50 phosphate and 32 potash although this mix differs based on seasonal and other factors all of our production in brazil is consumed within the country 

our india and china distribution businesses also includes a network of strategically located sales offices crop nutrient blending and bagging facilities port terminals and warehouse distribution facilities these businesses serve primarily as a 

sales outlet for our north american phosphates production as well as additional phosphate production we market from our mwspc joint venture both for resale and as an input for blends our potash segment also has historically furnished the majority of the raw materials needs for the production of blends primarily via canpotex and is expected to continue to do so in the future 

other products 

with a strong brand position in a multibillion dollar animal feed ingredients global market our phosphates segment supplies animal feed ingredients for poultry and livestock to customers in north america latin america and asia our potash sales to nonagricultural users are primarily to large industrial accounts and the animal feed industry additionally in north america we sell potash for deicing and as a water softener regenerant in brazil we also sell phosphogypsum 

competition 

because crop nutrients are global commodities available from numerous sources crop nutrition companies compete primarily on the basis of delivered price other competitive factors include product quality cost and availability of raw materials customer service plant efficiency and availability of product as a result markets for our products are highly competitive we compete with a broad range of domestic and international producers including farmer cooperatives subsidiaries of larger companies and independent crop nutrient companies foreign competitors may have access to cheaper raw materials may not have to comply with as stringent regulatory requirements or are owned or subsidized by governments and as a result may have cost advantages over north american companies we believe that our extensive north american and international production and distribution system provides us with a competitive advantage by allowing us to achieve economies of scale transportation and storage efficiencies and obtain market intelligence also we believe our performance products such as microessentials ®  provide us a competitive advantage with customers in north and south america 

unlike many of our competitors we have our own distribution system to sell phosphate and potashbased crop nutrients and animal feed ingredients whether produced by us or by other third parties around the globe in north america we have one of the largest and most strategically located distribution systems for crop nutrients including warehouse facilities in key agricultural regions we also have an extensive network of distribution facilities internationally including in the key growth regions of south america and asia with port terminals warehouses and blending plants in brazil paraguay china and india our global presence allows us to efficiently serve customers in approximately 40 countries 

phosphates segment 

our phosphates segment operates in a highly competitive global market among the competitors in the global phosphate industry are domestic and foreign companies as well as foreign governmentsupported producers in asia and north africa phosphate producers compete primarily based on price as well as product quality service and innovation major integrated producers of feed phosphates are located in the united states europe and china many smaller producers are located in emerging markets around the world many of these smaller producers are not miners of phosphate rock or manufacturers of phosphoric acid and are required to purchase this material on the open market 

we believe that we are a lowcost integrated producer of phosphatebased crop nutrients due in part to our scale vertical integration and strategic network of production and distribution facilities as the world’s second largest producer of concentrated phosphates as well as the second largest miner of phosphate rock in the world and the largest in the united states we maintain an advantage over some competitors as the scale of operations effectively reduces production costs per unit we are also vertically integrated to captively supply one of our key inputs phosphate rock to our phosphate production facilities we believe that our position as an integrated producer of phosphate rock provides us with a significant cost advantage over competitors that are nonintegrated phosphate producers in addition our ownership in the miski mayo mine allows us to supplement our overall phosphate rock needs we also sell a portion of miski mayo production to third parties mwspc enables us to not only further diversify our sources of phosphates but also improve our access to key agricultural countries in asia and the middle east 

we produce ammonia at our faustina louisiana concentrates plant in quantities sufficient to meet approximately one third of our total ammonia needs in north america we do not have ammonia production capacity within florida to serve our florida operations but we have capacity to supply a portion of our requirements by transporting produced ammonia from louisiana to florida we purchase additional ammonia from world markets and thus are subject to significant volatility in our purchase 

price of ammonia the cf ammonia supply agreement provides us with a longterm supply of a substantial volume of ammonia at prices based on the price of natural gas 

with our dedicated sulfur transportation barges and tugs and our 50 ownership interest in gulf sulphur services we are also wellpositioned to source an adequate flexible and costeffective supply of sulfur our third key input to our florida and louisiana phosphate production facilities we believe that our investments in sulfur logistical and melting assets continue to afford us a competitive advantage compared to other producers in cost and access to sulfur 

with facilities in both central florida and louisiana we are logistically well positioned to fulfill our material needs at very competitive prices those multiple production points also afford us the flexibility to optimally balance supply and demand 

potash segment 

potash is a commodity available from several geographical regions around the world and consequently the market is highly competitive through our participation in canpotex we compete outside of north america against various independent and stateowned potash producers canpotex has substantial expertise and logistical resources for the international distribution of potash including strategically located export assets in portland oregon st john new brunswick and vancouver british columbia our principal methods of competition with respect to the sale of potash include product pricing and offering consistent highquality products and superior service we believe that our potash cost structure is competitive in the industry and should improve as we continue to complete our potash expansion projects 

mosaic fertilizantes 

the mosaic fertilizantes segment operates in a highly competitive market in brazil we compete with a broad range of domestic and international producers including farmer cooperatives subsidiaries of larger companies and independent crop nutrient companies we believe that having a vertically integrated business internationally but also in brazil provides us with a competitive advantage by allowing us to achieve economies of scale transportation and storage efficiencies and obtain market intelligence 

mosaic fertilizantes has a wide variety of customers including farmers blenders and other local distributors we compete with local businesses that offer a wide variety of products that are available from many sources we believe the strategic location of our mines and chemical plants in close proximity to our customers and the benefit of our own distribution network gives us an advantage over most of our competitors the vertical integration of our whollyowned production along with our distribution network as well as our focus on product innovation and customer solutions position us with an advantage over many of our competitors we have a strong brand in brazil in addition to having access to our own production our distribution activities have the capability to supply a wide variety of crop nutrients to our dealerfarmer customer base 

factors affecting demand 

our results of operations historically have reflected the effects of several external factors which are beyond our control and have in the past produced significant downward and upward swings in operating results revenues are highly dependent upon conditions in the agriculture industry and can be affected by among other factors crop conditions changes in agricultural production practices worldwide economic conditions including the increasing world population household incomes and demand for more proteinrich food particularly in developing regions such as china india and latin america changing demand for biofuels variability in commodity pricing governmental policies the level of inventories in the crop nutrient distribution channels customer expectations about farmer economics future crop nutrient prices and availability and transportation costs among other matters market trends in raw material costs market prices for crop nutrients and weather furthermore our crop nutrients business is seasonal to the extent farmers and agricultural enterprises in the markets in which we compete purchase more crop nutrient products during the spring and fall the international scope of our business spanning the northern and southern hemispheres reduces to some extent the seasonal impact on our business the degree of seasonality of our business can change significantly from year to year due to conditions in the agricultural industry and other factors the seasonal nature of our businesses requires significant working capital for inventory in advance of the planting seasons 

we sell products throughout the world unfavorable changes in trade protection laws policies and measures government policies and other regulatory requirements affecting trade unexpected changes in tax and trade treaties strengthening or 

weakening of foreign economies as well as political relations with the united states may cause sales trends to customers in one or more foreign countries to differ from sales trends in the united states 

our international operations are subject to risks from changes in foreign currencies or government policy which can affect local farmer economics

 item 1a risk factors  

our business financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of the risks and uncertainties described below 

operational risks 

our esterhazy mine has had an inflow of salt saturated brine for more than 30 years 

since december 1985 we have had inflows of salt saturated brine into our esterhazy saskatchewan mine over the past century several potash mines experiencing water inflow problems have flooded in order to control brine inflows at esterhazy we have incurred and will continue to incur expenditures certain of which due to their nature have been capitalized while others have been charged to expense 

at various times we experience changing amounts and patterns of brine inflows at the esterhazy mine periodically some of these inflows have exceeded available pumping capacity if that were to continue for several months without abatement it could exceed our available storage capacity and ability to effectively manage the brine inflow this could adversely affect production at the esterhazy mine the brine inflow is variable resulting in both net inflows the rate of inflow is more than the amount we are pumping out of the mine and net outflows when we are pumping more brine out of the mine than the rate of inflow our mines at colonsay saskatchewan and carlsbad new mexico are also subject to the risks of inflow of water as a result of our shaft mining operations 

it is possible that the brine inflows risk to employees or management costs may increase to a level which would cause us to change our mining processes or abandon the mines see the “key factors that can affect results of operations and financial condition” and “potash net sales and gross margin” sections of our management’s analysis which sections are incorporated herein by reference for a discussion of costs risks and other information relating to the brine inflows 

the covid19 pandemic may materially adversely affect our business operations and financial condition 

in march 2020 the world health organization declared the outbreak of the novel coronavirus covid19 that spread across the globe a pandemic in an effort to contain the spread of the virus many government authorities at locations where we do business have issued “social distancing or shelter in place” or similar orders which generally direct individuals to remain at their places of residence the covid19 pandemic could significantly disrupt our operations key suppliers or thirdparty logistics providers customers and ultimate endusers due to the spread of the virus shelter in place orders quarantines or other measures implemented to prevent the spread of the virus in some instances the pandemic has impacted our business as part of government mandates our patrocinio operations in brazil and miski mayo operations in peru were temporarily suspended at the onset of the pandemic patrocinio restarted operations on april 7 2020 and miski mayo resumed operations on may 13 2020 we also delayed planned maintenance at certain locations until the fourth quarter of 2020 which resulted in increased costs 

at this time the company has only experienced limited adverse financial and operational covid19 related conditions as the production and sale of fertilizer has been deemed by government agencies to be an essential business because of the role it plays in the production of food farmers are receiving substantial governmental support globally which could mitigate the potential negative impact on fertilizer demand we continue to see covid19 related risks to logistics and isolated demand pockets impacted in part by the significant decline in oil prices 

the occurrence of any of these events or an increase in severity to our employees customers vendors or supply chain or renewed or stronger shelter in place orders could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition andor results of operations the extent to which the covid19 pandemic impacts our operations and financial results will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain including new information concerning the severity of the virus and the cost time and actions taken to contain its impact 

other cascading effects of the covid19 pandemic that are not currently foreseeable could materially increase our costs negatively impact our revenue andor adversely impact our results of operations and liquidity possibly to a significant degree we cannot predict the severity or duration of any such impacts the covid19 pandemic could also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this item 1a of this 2020 10k report 

our operating results are highly dependent upon and fluctuate based upon business and economic conditions and governmental policies affecting the agricultural industry in which we or our customers operate these factors are outside of our control and may significantly affect our profitability 

the most important of these factors are 

• weather and field conditions particularly during periods of traditionally high crop nutrients consumption 

• quantities of crop nutrients imported and exported 

• current and projected inventories and prices which are heavily influenced by us exports and worldwide markets and 

• governmental policies including farm and biofuel policies which may directly or indirectly influence the number of acres planted the level of inventories the mix of crops planted or crop prices or otherwise negatively affect our operating results 

international market conditions which are also outside of our control may also significantly influence our operating results the international market for crop nutrients is influenced by such factors as the relative value of the us dollar and its impact upon the cost of importing crop nutrients foreign agricultural policies including subsidy policies the existence of or changes in import or foreign currency exchange barriers in certain foreign markets changes in the hard currency demands of certain countries and other regulatory policies of foreign governments as well as the laws and policies of the united states affecting foreign trade and investment including use of tariffs on june 26 2020 we filed petitions with the us department of commerce and the us international trade commission itc that requested the initiation of countervailing duty investigations into imports of phosphate fertilizers from morocco and russia the purpose of the petitions is to remedy the distortions that foreign subsidies are causing in the us market for phosphate fertilizers and thereby restore fair competition the us department of commerce and the itc conducted investigations in response to mosaic’s petitions on february 9 2021 the us department of commerce determined final subsidy rates a final determination by the itc as to whether these subsidized imports has harmed or threatens to harm the us phosphate industry is expected in march 2021 if mosaic is not successful in its petitions it could have an adverse effect on our business andor our financial condition or operating results 

our crop nutrient business is seasonal and varies based on application rates which may result in carrying significant amounts of inventory and seasonal variations in working capital and our inability to predict future seasonal crop nutrient demand accurately may result in excess inventory or product shortages 

the use of crop nutrients is seasonal and varies based on application rates farmers tend to apply crop nutrients during two short application periods the strongest one in the spring before planting and the other in the fall after harvest as a result the strongest demand for our products typically occurs during the spring planting season with a second period of strong demand following the fall harvest in contrast we and other crop nutrient producers generally produce our products throughout the year as a result we andor our customers generally build inventories during the low demand periods of the year in order to ensure timely product availability during the peak sales seasons the seasonality of crop nutrient demand results in our sales volumes and net sales typically being the highest during the north american spring season and our working capital requirements typically being the highest just prior to the start of the spring season our quarterly financial results can vary significantly from one year to the next due to weatherrelated shifts in planting schedules and purchasing patterns 

if seasonal demand exceeds our projections we will not have enough product and our customers may acquire products from our competitors which would negatively impact our profitability if seasonal demand is less than we expect we will be left with excess inventory and higher working capital and liquidity requirements the degree of seasonality of our business can change significantly from year to year due to conditions in the agricultural industry and other factors 

changes in transportation costs can affect our sales volumes and selling prices 

the cost of delivery is a significant factor in the total cost to customers and farmers of crop nutrients as a result changes in 

transportation costs or in customer expectations about them can affect our sales volumes and prices 

a disruption to our production distribution or terminaling facilities could have a material adverse impact on our business the risk of material disruption increases when demand for our products results in high operating rates at our facilities 

we conduct our operations through a limited number of key production distribution and terminaling facilities these facilities include our phosphate mines and concentrates plants our potash mines and the ports and other distribution facilities through which we canpotex and the other joint ventures in which we participate conduct our respective businesses as well as other commercial arrangements with unrelated third parties any disruption of operations at any one of these facilities has the possibility of significantly negatively affecting our production or our ability to distribute our products 

examples of the types of events that could result in a disruption at one of these facilities include adverse weather strikes or other work stoppages deliberate malicious acts including acts of terrorism political or economic instability cyberattacks changes in permitting financial assurance or certain environmental health and safety laws or other changes in the regulatory environment in which we operate legal and regulatory proceedings our relationships with the other member of canpotex and the other joint ventures in which we participate and their or our exit from participation in such joint ventures other changes in our commercial arrangements with unrelated third parties brine inflows at our esterhazy saskatchewan mine or our other shaft mines mechanical failure and accidents or other failures occurring in the course of operating activities including at our gypstacks clay settling areas and tailing dams accidents occurring in the course of operating activities lack of truck rail barge or ship transportation and other factors 

reduced oil refinery operating rates in the united states could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition or operating results 

reduced oil refinery operating rates in the us could result in decreased availability of molten sulfur which could increase costs of sulfur procurement or decrease availability of sulfur needed in our phosphate fertilizer production operations while we have not yet become subject to such results in the sulfur procurement markets if it becomes necessary to procure sulfur at higher costs and if we are unable to pass those costs on in our product prices or if we are unable to procure sulfur at volumes necessary for our operations such events could have a material adverse effect on our phosphate business andor our financial condition or operating results 

important raw materials and energy used in our businesses in the past have been and may in the future be the subject of volatile pricing changes in the price of our raw materials have had and could again have a material impact on our businesses 

natural gas ammonia and sulfur are key raw materials used in the manufacture of phosphate crop nutrient products natural gas is used as both a chemical feedstock and a fuel to produce anhydrous ammonia which is a raw material used in the production of concentrated phosphate products natural gas is also a significant energy source used in the potash solution mining process from time to time our profitability has been and may in the future be impacted by the price and availability of these raw materials and other energy costs because most of our products are commodities there can be no assurance that we will be able to pass through increased costs to our customers a significant increase in the price of natural gas ammonia sulfur or energy costs that is not recovered through an increase in the price of our related crop nutrients products could have a material adverse impact on our business in addition under our longterm cf ammonia supply agreement we have agreed to purchase approximately 545000 to 725000 tonnes of ammonia per year during a term that may extend until december 31 2032 and at a price to be determined by a formula based on the prevailing price of us natural gas if the price of natural gas rises or the market price for ammonia falls outside of the range anticipated at execution of this agreement we may not realize a cost benefit from the natural gasbased pricing over the term of the agreement or the cost of our ammonia under the agreement could become a competitive disadvantage at times we have paid considerably more for ammonia under the agreement than what we would have paid had we purchased it in the spot market 

we are subject to risks associated with our international sales and operations which could negatively affect our sales to customers in foreign countries as well as our operations and assets in foreign countries some of these factors may also make it less attractive to distribute cash generated by our operations outside the united states to our stockholders or to utilize cash generated by our operations in one country to fund our operations or repayments of 

indebtedness in another country or to support other corporate purposes 

for 2020 we derived approximately 70 of our net sales from customers located outside of the united states as a result we are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties relating to international sales and operations including 

• difficulties and costs associated with complying with a wide variety of complex laws treaties and regulations 

• unexpected changes in regulatory environments 

• increased government ownership and regulation of the economy in the countries we serve 

• political and economic instability including the possibility for civil unrest inflation and adverse economic conditions resulting from governmental attempts to reduce inflation such as imposition of higher interest rates and wage and price controls 

• unpredictable tax audit practices of various governments 

• nationalization of properties by foreign governments 

• the imposition of tariffs exchange controls trade barriers or other restrictions or governmentimposed increases in the cost of resources and materials necessary for the conduct of our operations or the completion of strategic initiatives including with respect to our joint ventures and 

• currency exchange rate fluctuations between the us dollar and foreign currencies particularly the brazilian real and the canadian dollar 

the occurrence of any of the above in the countries in which we operate or elsewhere could jeopardize or affect our ability to transact business there and could adversely affect our revenues and operating results and the value of our assets located outside of the united states 

in addition tax regulations and tax audit practices currency exchange controls and other restrictions may also make it economically unattractive to 

• distribute cash generated by our operations outside the united states to our stockholders or 

• utilize cash generated by our operations in one country to fund our operations or repayments of indebtedness in another country or to support other corporate purposes 

our assets outside of north america are located in countries with volatile conditions which could subject us and our assets to significant risks 

we are a global business with substantial assets located outside of the united states and canada our operations in brazil china india and paraguay are a fundamental part of our business we have a majority interest in the joint venture entity operating the miski mayo mine in peru that supplies phosphate rock to us we also have a joint venture investment in mwspc which operates a mine and chemical complexes that produce phosphate fertilizers and other downstream products in the kingdom of saudi arabia volatile economic political and market conditions in these and other emerging market countries may have a negative impact on our operations operating results and financial condition in addition unfavorable changes in trade protection laws policies and measures or governmental actions and policies and other regulatory requirements affecting trade and the pricing and sourcing of our raw materials may also have a negative impact on our operations operating results and financial condition 

natural resource extraction is an important part of the economy in peru and in the past there have been protests against other natural resource operations in peru there remain numerous social conflicts that exist within the natural resource sector in peru as a result there is potential for active protests against natural resource companies if the government of peru’s proactive efforts to address the social and environmental issues surrounding natural resource activities are not successful protests could extend to or impact the miski mayo mine and adversely affect our interest in the miski mayo joint venture or the supply of phosphate rock to us from the mine 

adverse weather conditions including the impact of hurricanes and excess heat cold snow rainfall and drought have in the past and may in the future adversely affect our operations and result in increased costs decreased sales or production and potential liabilities 

adverse weather conditions including the impact of hurricanes and excess heat cold snow rainfall and drought have in the 

past and may in the future adversely affect our operations particularly our phosphates business in the past hurricanes have resulted in physical damage to our facilities in florida and louisiana 

additionally water treatment costs due to high water balances tend to increase significantly following excess rainfall from hurricanes or other adverse weather some of our florida and louisiana facilities have had and others could have high water levels that have required or may require treatment high water balances in the past at phosphate facilities in florida also led the florida department of environmental protection “ fdep ” to adopt rules requiring phosphate production facilities to meet more stringent process water management objectives for phosphogypsum stack systems 

if excess rainfall or hurricanes occur in coming years our facilities may be required to take additional measures to manage process water to comply with existing or future requirements and these measures could potentially have a material effect on our business and financial condition 

adverse weather may also cause a loss of production due to disruptions in our supply chain or adversely affect delivery of our products to our customers for example oil refineries that supply sulfur to us may suspend operations as a result of a hurricane and incoming shipments of ammonia can be delayed disrupting production at our florida or louisiana facilities and delivery of our products 

excess rainfall and drought have in the past and may in the future adversely affect us for example in 2019 we experienced the wettest year in north america in nearly 50 years which reduced fertilizer applications by farmers excess rainfall also resulted in higher river levels which adversely affected delivery of our products drought can reduce farmers’ crop yields and the uptake of phosphates and potash reducing the need for application of additional phosphates and potash for the next planting season drought can also lower river levels adversely affecting delivery of our products to our customers 

we do not own a controlling equity interest in our nonconsolidated companies some of which are foreign companies and therefore our operating results and cash flow may be materially affected by how the governing boards and majority owners operate such businesses there may also be limitations on monetary distributions from these companies that are outside of our control together these factors may lower our equity earnings or cash flow from such businesses and negatively impact our results of operations 

in 2013 we entered into an agreement to form mwspc a joint venture in which we hold a 25 interest to develop a mine and chemical complexes for an estimated 80 billion that produces phosphate fertilizers and other downstream products in the kingdom of saudi arabia the success of mwspc will depend on among other matters the completion of development and full commencement of operations of production facilities in the kingdom of saudi arabia the future success of current plans for completion of the development and for the operation of mwspc including the availability and affordability of necessary resources and materials and access to appropriate infrastructure and any future changes in those plans as well as the general economic and political stability of the region 

we also hold minority ownership interests in other companies that are not controlled by us we expect that the operations and results of mwspc will be and the operations or results of some of the other companies are significant to us and their operations can affect our earnings because we do not control these companies either at the board or stockholder levels and because local laws in foreign jurisdictions and contractual obligations may place restrictions on monetary distributions by these companies we cannot ensure that these companies will operate efficiently pay dividends or generally follow the desires of our management by virtue of our board or stockholder representation as a result these companies may contribute less than anticipated to our earnings and cash flow negatively impacting our results of operations and liquidity 

strikes or other forms of work stoppage or slowdown could disrupt our business and lead to increased costs 

our financial performance is dependent on a reliable and productive work force a significant portion of our workforce and that of the joint ventures in which we participate is covered by collective bargaining agreements with unions unsuccessful contract negotiations or adverse labor relations could result in strikes or slowdowns any disruption may decrease our production and sales or impose additional costs to resolve disputes the risk of adverse labor relations may increase as our profitability increases because labor unions’ expectations and demands generally rise at those times 

accidents occurring in the course of our operating activities could result in significant liabilities interruptions or 

shutdowns of facilities or the need for significant safety or other expenditures 

we engage in mining and industrial activities that can result in serious accidents if our safety procedures are not effective or if an accident occurs we could be subject to liabilities arising out of property damage personal injuries or death our operations could be interrupted and we might have to shut down or abandon affected facilities accidents could cause us to expend significant amounts to remediate safety issues or to repair damaged facilities and could result in significant liabilities andor impact on the financial performance of our company including material adverse effect on our results of operations liquidity or financial condition for example 

• some of our facilities are subject to potential damage from seismic activity 

the excavation of mines in some parts of the world can result in potential seismic events or can increase the likelihood or potential severity of a seismic event our esterhazy mine and southern louisiana facilities have experienced minor seismic events from time to time a significant seismic event at one our facilities or mines could result in serous injuries or death or damage to or flooding operations or damage to adjoining properties or facilities of unrelated third parties 

• our underground potash shaft mines are subject to risk from fire in addition fire at one of our underground shaft mines could halt our operations at the affected mine while we investigate the origin of the fire or for longer periods for remedial work or otherwise 

our underground potash shaft mines at esterhazy and colonsay saskatchewan carlsbad new mexico and taquarivassouras brazil are subject to risk from fire in the event of a fire if our emergency procedures are not successful we could have significant injuries or deaths or shutdowns of our facilities or could cause us to expend significant amounts to remediate safety issues or repair damaged facilities 

• we handle significant quantities of ammonia at several of our facilities if our safety procedures are not effective an accident involving our ammonia operations could result in serious injuries or death or result in the shutdown of our facilities 

we produce ammonia at our faustina louisiana phosphate concentrates plant use ammonia in significant quantities at all of our florida and louisiana phosphates concentrates plants and store ammonia at some of our distribution facilities in florida ammonia is received at terminals in tampa and transported by pipelines and trucks to our facilities we also use ammonia in our brazil phosphate operations our ammonia is generally stored and transported at high pressures or cryogenically 

• we also use or produce other hazardous or volatile chemicals at some of our facilities if our safety procedures are not effective an accident involving these other hazardous or volatile chemicals could result in serious injuries or death or result in the shutdown of our facilities 

we use sulfuric acid in the production of concentrated phosphates in our florida and louisiana us operations and our brazil operations we also use or produce other hazardous or volatile chemicals at some of our facilities an accident involving any of these chemicals could result in serious injuries or death or evacuation of areas near an accident an accident could also result in property damage or shutdown of our facilities or cause us to expend significant amounts to remediate safety issues or to repair damaged facilities 

regulatory risks 

the environmental health and safety regulations and permitting requirements to which we are subject may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we are subject to numerous environmental health and safety laws and regulations in the us canada china brazil and other countries in which we operate these laws and regulations govern a wide range of matters including environmental controls land reclamation discharges to air and water remediation of hazardous substance releases permitting requirements and in some cases demonstration of financial assurance they significantly affect our operating activities as well as the level 

of our operating costs and capital expenditures in some jurisdictions environmental laws change frequently and it may be difficult for us to determine if we are in compliance with all material environmental laws at any given time if we are not in compliance we may be subject to enforcement or thirdparty claims and may require new investment in our business in those circumstances our financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected 

the us comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act “ cercla ” imposes liability including for cleanup costs without regard to fault or to the legality of a party’s conduct on certain categories of persons including current and former owners and operators of a site and parties who are considered to have contributed to the release of “hazardous substances” into the environment under cercla or various us state analogues a party may under certain circumstances be required to bear more than its proportional share of cleanup costs at a site where it has liability if payments cannot be obtained from other responsible parties as a crop nutrient company producing and managing chemicals we periodically have incurred and may incur liabilities and cleanup costs under cercla and other environmental laws with regard to our current or former facilities adjacent or nearby thirdparty facilities or offsite disposal locations 

our operations including our mines are dependent on having the required permits and approvals from governmental authorities denial or delay by a government agency in issuing modifying or renewing any of our permits and approvals or imposition of restrictive or cost prohibitive conditions on us with respect to these permits and approvals may impair our business and operations and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

we have included additional discussion about permitting for our phosphate mines in florida under “environmental health safety and security matters—operating requirements and impacts—permitting” in our management’s analysis 

we are and may in the future be involved in legal and regulatory proceedings that could be material to us 

we have in the past been are currently and in the future may be subject to legal and regulatory proceedings that could be material to our business results of operations liquidity or financial condition joint ventures in which we participate could also become subject to these sorts of proceedings these proceedings may be brought by the government or private parties and may arise out of a variety of matters including 

• allegations that we have violated environmental health and safety laws and regulations or that we are responsible for nuisance or other conditions on nearby properties we are currently involved in proceedings alleging that or to review whether we have violated environmental laws in the united states and brazil 

• allegations by private parties that our operations have resulted in personal injury property damage or damage to business operations 

• antitrust commercial tax including tax audits and other disputes 

the legal and regulatory proceedings to which we are currently or may in the future be subject may depending on the circumstances result in monetary damage awards fines penalties other liabilities injunctions or other court or administrative rulings that interrupt impede or otherwise materially affect our business operations or criminal sanctions 

we have included additional information with respect to pending legal and regulatory proceedings in note 24 of our notes to consolidated financial statements and in this form 10k report in part i item 3 “legal proceedings” 

environmental health and safety and food and crop laws and regulations to which we are subject may become more stringent over time this could increase the effects on us of these laws and regulations and the increased effects could be materially adverse to our business operations liquidity andor results of operations 

heightened regulation on food and crop inputs including crop nutrients and environmental health and safety issues in the united states canada china brazil paraguay and other countries where we operate can be expected to result in requirements that apply to us and our operations that may be more stringent than those described elsewhere in this report these requirements may include 

• increased levels of future investments and expenditures for environmental controls at ongoing operations which will be charged against income from future operations increased levels of the financial assurance requirements to which we are subject and increased efforts or costs to obtain permits or denial of permits 

• new or interpretations of existing statutes or regulations that impose new or more stringent standards restrictions or 

liabilities related to elevated levels of naturallyoccurring radiation that arise on formerly mined land and other matters that could increase our expenses capital requirements or liabilities or adversely affect our business liquidity or financial condition 

in addition to the extent restrictions imposed in countries where our competitors operate such as china india former soviet union countries or morocco are less stringent than in the countries where we operate our competitors could gain cost or other competitive advantages over us these effects could be material 

we are subject to financial assurance requirements as part of our routine business operations if we were unable to satisfy financial assurance requirements we might not be able to obtain or maintain permits we need to operate our business as we have in the past in addition our compliance with these requirements could materially affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

in many cases as a condition to obtaining or maintaining permits and approvals or otherwise we are required to comply with financial assurance requirements of governmental authorities the purpose of these requirements is to provide comfort to the government that sufficient funds will be available for the ultimate closure postclosure care or reclamation of our facilities 

in some cases we are able to comply through the satisfaction of applicable state financial strength tests but if we are unable to do so we must utilize alternative methods of complying with these requirements if we do not we would be prevented from continuing our mining operations and also could be subject to enforcement proceedings brought by relevant government agencies potential alternative methods of compliance include providing credit support in the form of cash escrows or trusts surety bonds from surety or insurance companies letters of credit from banks or other forms of financial instruments or collateral to satisfy the financial assurance requirements in addition we could negotiate a consent agreement that establishes a different form of financial assurance use of alternative means of financial assurance imposes additional expense on us some of them such as letters of credit also use a portion of our available liquidity other alternative means of financial assurance such as surety bonds generally require us to obtain a discharge of the bonds or to post additional collateral typically in the form of cash or letters of credit at the request of the issuer of the bonds collateral that is required may be in forms that utilize a portion of our available liquidity or in the form of assets such as real estate which reduces our flexibility to manage or sell assets 

we have included additional discussion about financial assurance requirements under “off balance sheet arrangements and obligations—other commercial commitments” in our management’s analysis 

regulatory restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions and climate change regulations in the united states canada or elsewhere could adversely affect us and these effects could be material 

various governmental initiatives to limit greenhouse gas emissions are under way or under consideration around the world these initiatives could restrict our operating activities require us to make changes in our operating activities that would increase our operating costs reduce our efficiency or limit our output require us to make capital improvements to our facilities increase our energy raw material and transportation costs or limit their availability or otherwise adversely affect our results of operations liquidity or capital resources and these effects could be material to us 

governmental greenhouse gas emission initiatives include among others the december 2015 agreement the “ paris agreement ” which was the outcome of the 21 st session of the conference of the parties under the united nations framework convention on climate change “ unfccc ”  the paris agreement which was signed by nearly 200 nations including the united states and canada entered into force in late 2016 and sets out a goal of limiting the average rise in temperatures for this century to below 2 degrees celsius each signatory is expected to develop its own plan referred to as a nationally determined contribution or “ ndc ” for reaching that goal 

in may 2017 the united states president announced that the united states would withdraw from the paris agreement the country’s withdrawal was effective november 2020 on january 20 2021 the current us president signed an order to rejoin the paris agreement previously  the united states had submitted an ndc aiming to achieve by 2025 an economywide target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 2628 below its 2005 level the ndc also aims to use best efforts to reduce emissions by 28 the us target covers all greenhouse gases that were a part of the 2014 inventory of greenhouse gas emissions and sinks while the extent of the uss involvement in the paris agreement and the status of this ndc is unclear various legislative or regulatory initiatives relating to greenhouse gases have been adopted or considered by the us congress the epa or various states and those initiatives already adopted may be used to implement a us ndc additionally more stringent laws and regulations may be enacted to accomplish the goals set out in the ndc 

brazil ratified the paris agreement on september 21 2016 committing to an ndc that includes an economywide target of 13 gtco2e by 2025 and 12 gtco2e by 2030 in 2020 brazil submitted a new ndc which reaffirms the country’s commitment to reducing total net greenhouse gas emissions by 37 in 2025 and by 43 in 2030 the ndc further commits to achieving climate neutrality in 2060 complete details surrounding brazil’s plan for achieving the greenhouse gas emissions reductions and climate neutrality are uncertain the government of brazil may intervene with new or different policy instruments to meet the goals set out in the 2020 ndc 

canada’s intended ndc aims to achieve by 2030 an economywide target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 30 below 2005 levels the canadian government has also introduced legislation establishing a longterm target of “netzero” greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 more stringent laws and regulations may be enacted to accomplish the goals set out in canada’s ndc and canada’s own longterm emissions reduction targets 

it is possible that future legislation or regulation addressing climate change including in response to the paris agreement or any new international agreements could adversely affect our operating activities energy raw material and transportation costs results of operations liquidity or capital resources and these effects could be material or adversely impact our competitive advantage in addition to the extent climate change restrictions imposed in countries where our competitors operate such as india former soviet union countries or morocco are less stringent than in the united states or canada our competitors could gain cost or other competitive advantages over us 

future climate change could adversely affect us 

the prospective impact of climate change on our operations and those of our customers and farmers remains uncertain scientists have hypothesized that the impacts of climate change could include changes in rainfall patterns water shortages changing sea levels changing storm patterns and intensities and changing temperature levels and that these changes could be severe these impacts could vary by geographic location severe climate change could impact our costs and operating activities the location and cost of global grain and oilseed production and the supply and demand for grains and oilseeds at the present time we cannot predict the prospective impact of climate change on our results of operations liquidity or capital resources or whether any such effects could be material to us 

we use tailings sediments and water dams to manage residual materials generated by our brazilian mining operations if our safety procedures are not effective an accident involving these impoundments could result in serious injuries or death damage to property or the environment or result in the shutdown of our facilities any of which could materially adversely affect our results of operations in brazil 

mining and processing of potash and phosphate generate residual materials that must be managed both during the operation of the facility and upon facility closure potash tailings consisting primarily of salt and clay are stored in surface disposal sites phosphate clay residuals from mining in brazil are deposited in large tailing dams they are regularly monitored to evaluate structural stability and for leaks the failure of any of our 11 tailings dams and other impoundments at any of our brazilian mining operations could cause severe property and environmental damage and loss of life 

legislation at both brazilian federal and state levels has introduced new rules regarding tailings dam safety construction licensing and operations we cannot predict the full impact of these legislative or potentially related judicial actions or future actions or whether or how it would affect our brazilian operations or customers 

any accident involving our brazilian tailings or other dams or any shutdown or idling of our related mines could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

competitive risks 

our competitive position could be adversely affected if we are unable to participate in continuing industry consolidation 

most of our products are readily available from a number of competitors and price and other competition in the crop nutrient industry is intense in addition crop nutrient production facilities and distribution activities frequently benefit from 

economies of scale as a result particularly during pronounced cyclical troughs the crop nutrient industry has a long history of consolidation mosaic itself is the result of a number of industry consolidations we expect consolidation among crop nutrient producers could continue our competitive position could suffer to the extent we are not able to expand our own resources either through consolidations acquisitions joint ventures or partnerships in the future we may not be able to find suitable companies to combine with assets to purchase or joint venture or partnership opportunities to pursue even if we are able to locate desirable opportunities we may not be able to enter into transactions on economically acceptable terms if we do not successfully participate in continuing industry consolidation our ability to compete successfully could be adversely affected and result in the loss of customers or an uncompetitive cost structure which could adversely affect our sales and profitability 

our strategy for managing market and interest rate risk may not be effective 

our businesses are affected by fluctuations in market prices for our products the purchase price of natural gas ammonia and sulfur consumed in operations freight and shipping costs foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates we periodically enter into derivatives and forward purchase contracts to mitigate some of these risks however our strategy may not be successful in minimizing our exposure to these fluctuations see “market risk” in our management’s analysis and note 16 of our notes to consolidated financial statements that is incorporated by reference in this report in part ii item 8 

a shortage or unavailability of railcars tugs barges and ships for carrying our products and the raw materials we use in our business could result in customer dissatisfaction loss of production or sales and higher transportation or equipment costs 

we rely heavily upon truck rail tug barge and ocean freight transportation to obtain the raw materials we need to distribute raw materials between our mines and concentrates facilities and to deliver our products to our customers in addition the cost of transportation is an important part of the final sale price of our products finding affordable and dependable transportation is important in obtaining our raw materials and to supply our customers higher costs for these transportation services or an interruption or slowdown due to factors including high demand high fuel prices labor disputes layoffs or other factors affecting the availability of qualified transportation workers adverse weather or other environmental events or changes to rail barge or ocean freight systems could negatively affect our ability to produce our products or deliver them to our customers which could affect our performance and results of operations 

strong demand for grain and other products and a strong world economy increase the demand for and reduce the availability of transportation both domestically and internationally shortages of railcars barges and ocean transport for carrying product and increased transit time may result in customer dissatisfaction loss of sales and higher equipment and transportation costs in addition during periods when the shipping industry has a shortage of ships the substantial time needed to build new ships prevents rapid market response delays and missed shipments due to transportation shortages including vessels barges railcars and trucks could result in customer dissatisfaction or loss of sales potential which could negatively affect our performance and results of operations 

our success will continue to depend on our ability to attract and retain highly qualified and motivated employees 

we believe our continued success depends on the collective abilities and efforts of our employees like many businesses a significant number of our employees including some of our most highly skilled employees with specialized expertise in general corporate matters potash and phosphates operations will be approaching retirement age throughout the next decade and beyond in addition we compete for a talented workforce with other businesses particularly within the mining and chemicals industries in general and the crop nutrients industry in particular our expansion plans are highly dependent on our ability to attract retain and train highly qualified and motivated employees who are essential to the success of our ongoing operations as well as to our expansion plans if we were to be unsuccessful in attracting retaining and training the employees we require our ongoing operations and expansion plans could be materially and adversely affected 

our most important products are global commodities and we face intense global competition from other crop nutrient producers that can affect our prices and volumes 

our most important products are concentrated phosphate crop nutrients including diammonium phosphate or dap monoammonium phosphate or map microessentials ® and muriate of potash or mop we sell most of our dap map and 

mop in the form of global commodities our sales of these products face intense global competition from other crop nutrient producers 

changes in competitors’ production or shifts in their marketing focus have in the past significantly affected both the prices at which we sell our products and the volumes that we sell and are likely to continue to do so in the future increases in the global supply of dap map and mop or competitors’ increased sales into regions in which we have significant sales could adversely affect our prices and volumes 

competitors and new entrants in the markets for both concentrated phosphate crop nutrients and potash have in recent years expanded capacity or begun or announced plans to expand capacity or build new facilities the extent to which current global or local economic and financial conditions changes in global or local economic and financial conditions or other factors may cause delays or cancellation of some of these ongoing or planned projects or result in the acceleration of existing or new projects is unclear in addition certain of our products sold to china may be subject to additional tariffs due to ongoing trade tensions between china and the united states the level of exports by chinese producers of concentrated phosphate crop nutrients depends to a significant extent on chinese government actions to curb exports through among other measures prohibitive export taxes at times when the government believes it desirable to assure ample domestic supplies of concentrated phosphate crop nutrients to stimulate grain and oilseed production 

in addition the other member of canpotex is among our competitors who may in the future i ndependently expand its potash production capacity at a time when each canpotex members respective shares of canpotex sales is based upon that members respective proven peaking capacity for producing potash when a canpotex member expands its production capacity the new capacity is added to that member’s proven peaking capacity based on a proving run at the maximum production level alternatively canpotex members may elect to rely on an independent engineering firm and approved protocols to calculate their proven peaking capacity antitrust and competition laws prohibit the members of canpotex from coordinating their production decisions including the timing of their respective proving runs worldwide potash production levels could exceed thencurrent market demand resulting in an oversupply of potash and lower potash prices 

all of the foregoing events are beyond our control the effects of any of these events occurring could be materially adverse to our results of operations 

some of our competitors and potential competitors have greater resources than we do which may place us at a competitive disadvantage and adversely affect our sales and profitability these competitors include stateowned and governmentsubsidized entities in other countries 

we compete with a number of producers throughout the world including stateowned and governmentsubsidized entities some of these entities have greater total resources than we do and may be less dependent on earnings from crop nutrients sales than we are in addition some of these entities have access to lower cost or governmentsubsidized natural gas supplies mining rights and reserves financing transportation and tax incentives placing us at a competitive disadvantage furthermore certain governments as owners of some of our competitors may be willing to accept lower prices and profitability on their products in order to support domestic employment or other political or social goals to the extent other producers of crop nutrients enjoy competitive advantages or are willing to accept lower profit levels the price of our products our sales volumes and our profits may be adversely affected 

industry risks 

future product or technological innovation could affect our business 

future product or technological innovations by third parties such as the development of seeds that require less crop nutrients the development of substitutes for our products or developments in the application of crop nutrients if they occur could have the potential to adversely affect the demand for our products and our results of operations liquidity and capital resources 

the success of our strategic initiatives depends on our ability to effectively manage these initiatives and to successfully integrate and grow acquired businesses 

we have significant ongoing strategic initiatives including our plans to expand the annual production capacity of our potash 

business and mwspc these strategic initiatives involve capital and other expenditures and require effective project management and in the case of potential strategic acquisitions successful integration to the extent the processes we or for our joint venture we together with our joint venture partners put in place to manage these initiatives or integrate and grow acquired businesses are not effective our capital expenditure and other costs may exceed our expectations or the benefits we expect from these initiatives might not be fully realized or both thereby resulting in adverse effects on our operating results and financial condition 

cyberattacks could disrupt our operations and have a material adverse impact on our business 

as a global company we utilize and rely upon information technology systems in many aspects of our business including internal and external communications and the management of our accounting financial production and supply chain functions as we become more dependent on information technologies to conduct our operations and as the number and sophistication of cyberattacks increase the risks associated with cyber security increase these risks apply to us our employees and to third parties on whose systems we rely for the conduct of our business we have experienced cyberattacks but to our knowledge we have not experienced any material breaches of our technology systems failure to effectively anticipate prevent detect and recover from the increasing number and sophistication of cyberattacks could result in theft loss or misuse of or damage or modification of our information and cause disruptions or delays in our business reputational damage and thirdparty claims which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 

our crop nutrients and other products are subject to price and demand volatility resulting from periodic imbalances of supply and demand which may cause our results of operations to fluctuate 

historically the market for crop nutrients has been cyclical and prices and demand for our products have fluctuated to a significantly periods of high demand increasing profits and high capacity utilization tend to lead to new plant investment and increased production in the industry this growth increases supply until the market is oversaturated leading to declining prices and declining capacity utilization until the cycle repeats 

as a result crop nutrient prices and volumes have been and are expected to continue to be volatile this price and volume volatility may cause our results of operations to fluctuate and potentially deteriorate the price at which we sell our crop nutrient products and our sales volumes could fall in the event of industry oversupply conditions which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations in contrast high prices may lead our customers and farmers to delay purchasing decisions in anticipation of future lower prices thus impacting our sales volumes 

due to reduced market demand depressed agricultural economic conditions and other factors we and our predecessors have at various times suspended or curtailed production at some of our facilities the extent to which we utilize available capacity at our facilities will cause fluctuations in our results of operations as we will incur costs for any temporary or indefinite shutdowns of our facilities in addition lower sales tend to lead to higher fixed costs as a percentage of sales 

financial risks 

during periods when the prices for our products are falling because of falling raw material prices we could be required to writedown the value of our inventories any such writedown could adversely affect our results of operations and the value of our assets 

we carry our inventories at the lower of cost or market in periods when the market prices for our products are falling rapidly including in response to falling market prices for raw materials it is possible that we could be required to writedown the value of our inventories if market prices fall below our costs any such writedown could adversely affect our results of operations and the value of our assets any such effect could be material 

our estimates of future selling prices reflect in part the purchase commitments we have from our customers as a result defaults on these existing purchase commitments because of the global or local economic and financial conditions or for other reasons could adversely affect our estimates of future selling prices and require additional inventory writedowns 

we may incur significant noncash charges if our goodwill or longlived assets become impaired in the future 

under gaap we review goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable other longlived assets including property plant and equipment are reviewed if events or circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable the process of impairment testing involves a number of judgments and estimates made by management including the fair values of assets and liabilities future cash flows our interpretation of current economic indicators and market conditions overall economic conditions and our strategic operational plans with regards to our business units if the judgments and estimates used in our analysis are not realized or change due to external factors then actual results may not be consistent with these judgments and estimates and our goodwill and intangible assets may become impaired in future periods if our goodwill or longlived assets are determined to be impaired in the future we may be required to record noncash charges to earnings during the period in which the impairment is determined which could be significant and have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations we have in the past and may in the future be required to write down the value of our goodwill or other longlived assets and such future write downs could be material see note 11 goodwill and note 27 plant city and colonsay closure costs in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information related to charges incurred in 2019 

changes in tax laws or regulations or their interpretation or exposure to additional tax liabilities could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

we are subject to taxes including income taxes resource taxes and royalties and nonincome based taxes in the united states canada china brazil and other countries where we operate changes in tax laws or regulations or their interpretation could result in higher taxes which could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

in 2018 us federal tax law changes took effect this was a significant change to the us system of taxation resulting in numerous areas open to interpretation given the newness and breadth of changes to the rules as a result risk exists related to developing interpretation and application of the new rules that could result in higher taxes which could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

we are subject to periodic audits by various levels of tax authorities in all countries where we have meaningful operations the due process audit and appeal practices and procedures of such authorities may vary significantly by jurisdiction may be unpredictable and unreliable in nature and may result in significant risk to us for various reasons some governments may issue significant reassessments on audit based positions not fully grounded in law or fact even though upon disputing the reassessments a great many are overturned on administrative appeal and through the court system certain systems involve tax litigation as a common practice in certain countries there are requirements to pay a reassessment even though the matter has not been finally decided by the tax administration or a court of law while the taxpayer has a wellsupported objection and appeals administratively or in court this may result in tying up significant funds andor creating adverse treasury and credit risks that may interrupt impede or otherwise materially affect our business operations 

we extend trade credit to our customers and guarantee the financing that some of our customers use to purchase our products our results of operations may be adversely affected if these customers are unable to repay the trade credit from us or financing from their banks increases in prices for crop nutrient other agricultural inputs and grain may increase this risk 

we extend trade credit to our customers in the united states and throughout the world in some cases for extended periods of time in brazil where there are fewer thirdparty financing sources available to farmers we also have several programs under which we guarantee customers’ financing from financial institutions that they use to purchase our products as our exposure to longer trade credit extended throughout the world and use of guarantees in brazil increases we are increasingly exposed to the risk that some of our customers will not pay us or the amounts we have guaranteed additionally we become increasingly exposed to risk due to weather and crop growing conditions fluctuations in crop nutrient prices commodity prices or foreign currencies and other factors that influence the price supply and demand for agricultural commodities significant defaults by our customers could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

due to the global nature of our operations we are exposed to currency exchange rate changes which may cause fluctuations in earnings and cash flows 

our primary foreign currency exposures are the canadian dollar and brazilian real the functional currency for our brazilian subsidiaries is the brazilian real however we finance our brazilian inventory purchases with us dollardenominated liabilities the functional currency of several of our canadian entities is the canadian dollar for those entities sales are primarily denominated in us dollars but the costs are paid principally in canadian dollars canadian entities have significant us dollar denominated intercompany loans and us entities with us dollar as functional currency have brazilian real denominated loans during periods of local or global economic crises local currencies may be devalued significantly against the us dollar during times of a strengthening dollar our net earnings can be reduced due to transaction currency losses arising from these exposures of us dollar denominated liabilities held in the brazilian and canadian entities and brazilian real denominated assets held in us entities to reduce economic risk and volatility on expected cash flows that are denominated in the canadian dollar and brazilian real we use financial instruments that may include forward contracts options or collars when unable to naturally offset the exposures

we have included information about legal and environmental proceedings in note 24 of our notes to consolidated financial statements that information is incorporated herein by reference 

we are also subject to the following legal and environmental proceedings in addition to those described in note 24 of our consolidated financial statements included in this report 

waters of the united states in june 2015 epa and the us army corps of engineers the “ corps ” jointly issued a final rule that proposed to clarify but may actually expand the scope of waters regulated under the federal clean water act the final rule the “ 2015 clean water rule ” became effective in august 2015 but has been challenged through numerous lawsuits in october 2015 the us court of appeals for the sixth circuit issued an order staying the effectiveness of the final rule nationwide pending adjudication of substantive challenges to the rule in early 2017 the us president issued an executive order directing epa and the corps to publish a proposed rule rescinding or revising the new rule in june 2017 epa and the corps issued a proposed rule that would rescind the 2015 clean water rule and recodify regulatory text that existed prior to enactment of the 2015 clean water rule in november 2017 epa issued a rule notice proposing to extend the applicability date of the 2015 clean water rule for two years from the date of final action on the proposed rule to provide continuity and regulatory certainty while agencies proceed to consider potential changes to the 2015 clean water rule 

in january 2018 the us supreme court unanimously held all challenges to the 2015 clean water rule must be heard in federal district courts rather than in the federal courts of appeal overruling a decision by the sixth circuits court of appeals with the sixth circuit court of appeals no longer having jurisdiction that court lifted its 2015 nationwide stay in february 2018 after the nationwide stay was lifted a number of us district courts revived dormant litigation that challenged the 2015 clean water rule in june 2018 the us district court for the southern district of georgia entered an injunction against implementation of the 2015 clean water rule covering 11 states including florida as of september 2018 federal district courts have put the 2015 clean water rule on hold in 28 states the district of columbia and the us territories 

on december 11 2018 epa and the corps issued a proposed rule to replace the 2015 clean water rule referred to as the “navigable waters protection rule” the agencies’ stated interpretation for the proposed rule is to provide clarity predictability and consistency so that the regulated community can better understand where the clean water act applies and where it does not epa and the corps received over 600000 public comments on the proposed rule 

on september 12 2019 epa and the corps jointly issued a final regulation that repealed the 2015 clean water rule and restored the previous regulatory regime this regulation reestablished national consistency by returning all jurisdictions to the longstanding regulatory framework that existed prior to the 2015 clean water rule the final rule and repeal of the 2015 clean water rule took effect sixty 60 days after publication in the federal register 

the september 12 2019 repeal of the 2015 clean water rule was the first step in a twostep rulemaking process to define the scope of “waters of the united states” that are regulated under the clean water act the second step was completed in april 2020 when epa and the corps jointly issued the “navigable waters protection rule” published on april 21 2020 85 fed reg 22250 by defining what constitutes “waters of the united states” under the federal clean water act “cwa” the new rule distinguishes between federal waters and waters under the sole control of the states it also clarifies the types of connections to perennial and intermittent tributaries that make lakes and ponds jurisdictional and clarifies the factors that determine when wetlands are considered “adjacent” 

the new “navigable waters protection rule” revised the definition of “waters of the united states” wotus under the cwa to include i territorial seas and traditional navigable waters ii perennial and intermittent tributaries to those waters iii certain lakes ponds and impoundments iv and wetlands adjacent to jurisdictional waters according to epa “congress in the clean water act explicitly directed the agencies to protect ‘navigable waters’ the navigable waters protection rule regulates the nation’s navigable waters and the core tributary systems that provide perennial or intermittent flow into them” 

the new navigable waters protection rule is in effect in every state except for colorado the us district of colorado blocked implementation of the navigable waters protection rule in colorado holding that the supreme court’s decision in rapanos vunited states foreclosed the interpretation the us epa and corps had incorporated into the new regulation on the same day the us district court for the northern district of california reached the opposite conclusion instead denying a motion by a group of states and cities to block the rule’s nationwide implementation similar requests for relief have been made in other federal district courts including arizona washington and new mexico with more appeals expected in late 2020 to date there have been 13 complaints filed in 11 different us district courts seeking to challenge final rule 

in august 2020 the justice department an industry coalition and individual landowners filed a notice of appeal with the us court of appeals for the 10th circuit to challenge the injunction entered by the colorado district court although oral argument was held there has been no final ruling by the court of appeals to date note under the new biden administration there could be administrative or legal actions that affect the future enforceability of the navigable waters protection rule eg voluntary remand to reconsider the rule issuance of an executive order directing epa and corps to reconsider the rule or formal joint rulemaking to repeal navigable waters protection rule 

countervailing duty petitions on june 26 2020 we filed petitions with the us department of commerce “ doc ” and the us international trade commission “ itc ” that requested the initiation of countervailing duty investigations into imports of phosphate fertilizers from morocco and russia the purpose of the petitions is to remedy the distortions that we believe foreign subsidies have caused or are causing in the us market for phosphate fertilizers and thereby restore fair competition on august 7 2020 the itc preliminarily determined that there is a reasonable indication that the us phosphate industry is materially injured by reason of imports of phosphate fertilizers that are allegedly subsidized by the governments of morocco and russia on november 23 2020 the doc preliminarily determined that counteravailable subsidies were being provided by those governments and on february 9 2021 the doc determined final counteravailable subsidy rates a final determination by the itc as to whether these subsidized imports has harmed or threatens to harm the us phosphate industry is expected in march 2021 

the south pasture extension mine litigation on january 8 2020 the hardee county mining coordinator issued a notice of violation “nov” for the failure by mosaic to proceed with reclamation of two designated reclamation units within the south pasture mine footprint these two reclamation units comprise 166 acres of mined lands the nov cites noncompliance with the county land development regulations and with the conditions of development of regional impact “dri” development order 1221 that was issued in 2012 to authorize continued mining at the south pasture mine continued operation of the south pasture beneficiation plant and mining at the 

south pasture mine extension through the nov the county requested that mosaic submit a revised reclamation plan and schedule to demonstrate when initial reclamation activities would be completed for the two reclamation units identified in the nov 

the delay in meeting the required reclamation schedule at the two reclamation units is tied to the idling and eventual shutdown of the plant city fertilizer plant and the idling of the south pasture mine beneficiation plant the plant city facility was first idled in late 2017 in june 2019 mosaic announced that the plant city facility would be closed permanently 

given the relationship between the plant city fertilizer plant and the south pasture beneficiation plant and facing adverse market conditions mosaic idled the south pasture beneficiation plant in september 2018 idling of the south pasture mine beneficiation plant in september 2018 resulted in no tailings sand being produced by the processing of phosphate matrix as a result there was no tailings sand available for use in sand backfilling reclamation at the south pasture mine and specifically the two reclamation units identified in the county’s january 8th nov 

on march 10 2020 mosaic filed an “application for waiver and reclamation schedule extension” to secure board of county commissioners “ bocc ” approval of extended reclamation deadlines for the south pasture mine to obtain waiver relief from the bocc a quasijudicial hearing will be required 

extensive negotiations between mosaic and county legal and technical staff resulted in an agreement that involved two separate but related actions 1 secure a waiver and reclamation schedule extension through formal action by the bocc at a quasijudicial public hearing and 2 enter into a settlement agreement that would require payment of a civil penalty by mosaic for the noncompliance in meeting the required reclamation deadlines of the south pasture mine development order and the county mining ordinance the settlement agreement would also be presented and acted upon at a formal public hearing before the bocc 

on may 7 2020 a quasipublic judicial hearing was held before the hardee county bocc at that hearing the bocc voted unanimously to issue a waiver of the applicable reclamation deadlines of the south pasture development order and the county ordinance for three specific reclamation areas of the south pasture mine the waiver also included a negotiated alternative reclamation schedule that extends the deadline for completion of reclamation until the end of 2023 at that same hearing the bocc approved a settlement agreement that resolved all outstanding noncompliance associated with reclamation obligations at the south pasture mine and requires mosaic to pay an agreed settlement amount of 249000 

mosaic has satisfied the payment obligation of the settlement agreement and continues to implement the alternative reclamation schedule as required monitoring programs have been put in place to ensure continued compliance with the waiver and settlement agreement 

cruz litigation on august 27 2020 a putative class action complaint was filed in circuit court of the thirteenth judicial circuit in hillsborough county fl against our wholly owned subsidiary mosaic global operations inc and two codefendants the complaint alleges claims related to elevated levels of radiation at two manufactured housing communities located on reclaimed mining land in mulberry polk county florida due to phosphate mining and reclamation activities occurring decades ago plaintiffs seek monetary damages including punitive damages injunctive relief requiring remediation of their properties and a medical monitoring program funded by the defendants we will vigorously defend this matter

overview 

the mosaic company is the world’s leading producer and marketer of concentrated phosphate and potash crop nutrients through our broad product offering we are a single source supplier of phosphate and potashbased crop nutrients and animal feed ingredients we serve customers in approximately 40 countries we are the second largest integrated phosphate producer in the world and one of the largest producers and marketers of phosphatebased animal feed ingredients in north america and brazil following our january 8 2018 acquisition the “ acquisition ” of the global phosphate and potash operations of vale sa conducted through mosaic fertilizantes pk sa formerly vale fertilizantes sa we are the leading fertilizer production and distribution company in brazil we mine phosphate rock in florida and brazil we process rock into finished phosphate products at facilities in florida louisiana and brazil upon completion of the acquisition we became the majority owner of an entity operating a phosphate rock mine in the bayovar region in peru in which we previously held a minority equity interest we are one of the four largest potash producers in the world we mine potash in saskatchewan new mexico and brazil we have other production blending or distribution operations in brazil china india and paraguay as well as a strategic equity investment in a joint venture that operates a phosphate rock mine and chemical complexes in the kingdom of saudi arabia our distribution operations serve the top four nutrientconsuming countries in the world china india the united states and brazil 

the mosaic company is a delaware corporation that was incorporated in march 2004 and serves as the parent company of the business that was formed through the october 2004 combination of imc global inc and the fertilizer businesses of cargill incorporated we are publicly traded on the new york stock exchange under the ticker symbol “mos” and are headquartered in tampa florida 

we conduct our business through wholly and majorityowned subsidiaries as well as businesses in which we own less than a majority or a noncontrolling interest we are organized into three reportable business segments phosphates potash and mosaic fertilizantes intersegment eliminations unrealized marktomarket gainslosses on derivatives debt expenses streamsong resort ® results of operations and the results of the china and india distribution businesses are included within corporate eliminations and other as of january 1 2019 certain selling general and administrative costs that are not controllable by the business segments were no longer allocated to segments and are included within corporate eliminations and other our operating results for the years ended december 31 2018 and 2017 have been recast to reflect this change 

the following charts show the respective contributions to 2019 sales volumes net sales and gross margin for each of our business segments in effect at december 31 2019 

we account for approximately 13 of estimated global annual phosphate production we also account for approximately 11 of estimated global annual potash production 

phosphates segment — we sell phosphatebased crop nutrients and animal feed ingredients throughout north america and internationally we account for approximately 74 of estimated north american annual production of concentrated phosphate crop nutrients 

potash segment — we sell potash throughout north america and internationally principally as fertilizer but also for use in industrial applications and to a lesser degree as animal feed ingredients we account for approximately 34 of estimated north american annual potash production 

mosaic fertilizantes segment — we produce and sell phosphate and potashbased crop nutrients and animal feed ingredients in brazil in addition to five phosphate rock mines four chemical plants and a potash mine in brazil this segment consists of sales offices crop nutrient blending and bagging facilities port terminals and warehouses in brazil and paraguay the mosaic fertilizantes segment also serves as a distribution outlet for our phosphates and potash segments we account for approximately 69 of estimated annual production of concentrated phosphate crop nutrients in brazil and 100 of estimated annual potash production in brazil 

as used in this report   

 statements as to our industry position reflect information from the most recent period available 

business developments during 2019 



in the second half of 2019 primarily at our louisiana facility we also plan to continue to operate at lower rates at our canadian potash mines on october 10 2019 we announced that we would temporarily curtail production at our esterhazy saskatchewan potash mine bringing our total 2019 potash curtailment to approximately 600000 tonnes including the previously announced idling of our colonsay saskatchewan potash mine earlier in 2019 the increased curtailment was based on increasing inventories as a result of a shortterm slowdown in global potash markets and increased risks of a delay in the chinese contract settlement 

 we have included additional information about these and other developments in our business during 2019 in our management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations “ management’s analysis ” and in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 

throughout the discussion below we measure units of production sales and raw materials in metric tonnes which are the equivalent of 2205 pounds unless we specifically state that we mean short or long tons which are the equivalent of 2000 pounds and 2240 pounds respectively in addition we measure natural gas a raw material used in the production of our products in mmbtu which stands for one million british thermal units btu one btu is equivalent to 106 joules 

business segment information 

the discussion below of our business segment operations should be read in conjunction with the following information that we have included in this report   

 this information is incorporated by reference in this report in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data”   

phosphates segment 

our phosphates business segment owns and operates mines and production facilities in florida which produce concentrated phosphate crop nutrients and phosphatebased animal feed ingredients and processing plants in louisiana which produce concentrated phosphate crop nutrients as part of the acquisition we acquired an additional 40 economic interest in the miski mayo phosphate mine in peru which increased our aggregate interest to 75 the results of the miski mayo mine are now included in our phosphates segment on june 18 2019 we permanently closed our plant city florida production facility on september 24 2019 mosaic entered into a longterm lease agreement with anuvia plant nutrition to lease certain assets at that location 

the following map shows the locations of each of our phosphate concentrates plants in the united states and the locations of each of our active temporarily idled and planned phosphate mines in florida the reserves associated with our ona location have been allocated to other active mines based on our future mining plans

the following map shows the location of the miski mayo phosphate mine in peru 

us phosphate crop nutrients and animal feed ingredients 

our us phosphates operations have capacity to produce approximately 45 million tonnes of phosphoric acid “ p 2 o 5 ” per year or about 7 of world annual capacity and about 58 of north american annual capacity phosphoric acid is produced by reacting finely ground phosphate rock with sulfuric acid phosphoric acid is the key building block for the production of high analysis or concentrated phosphate crop nutrients and animal feed products and is the most comprehensive measure of phosphate capacity and production and a commonly used benchmark in our industry our us phosphoric acid production totaled approximately 39 million tonnes during 2019  our us operations account for approximately 9 of estimated global annual production and 60 of estimated north american annual output 

our phosphate crop nutrient products are marketed worldwide to crop nutrient manufacturers distributors retailers and farmers our principal phosphate crop nutrient products are   



production of our animal feed ingredients products is located at our new wales florida facility we market our feed phosphate primarily under the leading brand names of biofos ® and nexfos ®  

annual capacity by plant as of december 31 2019 and production volumes by plant for 2019 are listed below   



 

 the phosphoric acid produced at uncle sam is shipped to faustina where it is used to produce dap map and microessentials ® our faustina plant also manufactures ammonia that is mostly consumed in our concentrate plants 

we produced approximately 76 million tonnes of concentrated phosphate crop nutrients during 2019 and accounted for approximately 74 of estimated north american annual production 

phosphate rock 

phosphate rock is the key mineral used to produce phosphate crop nutrients and feed phosphate our florida phosphate rock mines produced approximately 122 million tonnes in 2019 and accounted for approximately 54 of estimated north american annual production we are the world’s second largest miner of phosphate rock excluding china and currently operate four mines in north america with a combined annual capacity of approximately 167 million tonnes additionally we own 75 of the miski mayo mine in peru which has an annual capacity of 40 million tonnes production of one tonne of dap requires between 16 and 17 tonnes of phosphate rock 

all of our wholly owned phosphate mines and related mining operations in north america are located in central florida during 2019  we operated three active mines in florida four corners south fort meade and wingate on august 31 2018 we temporarily idled our south pasture florida phosphates mine we plan to develop ona and desoto reserves to replace reserves that will be depleted at various times during the next decade as part of the acquisition we acquired an additional 40 economic interest in the miski mayo mine in peru which increased our aggregate interest to 75 our investment in the miski mayo mine allows us to supplement our other produced rock to meet our overall fertilizer production needs effective with the closing of the acquisition we have the right to use or sell to third parties 75 of miski mayos annual production 

the phosphate deposits of florida are of sedimentary origin and are part of a phosphatebearing province that extends from southern florida north along the atlantic coast into southern virginia our active florida phosphate mines are primarily located in what is known as the bone valley member of the peace river formation in the central florida phosphate district the southern portions of the four corners and wingate mines are in what is referred to as the undifferentiated peace river formation in which the ona and desoto reserves we plan to develop are also located phosphate mining has been conducted in the central florida phosphate district since the late 1800’s the potentially mineable portion of the district encompasses an area approximately 80 miles in length in a northsouth direction and approximately 40 miles in width 

in florida we extract phosphate ore using large surface mining machines that we own called “draglines” prior to extracting the ore the draglines must first remove a 10 to 50 foot layer of sandy overburden at our wingate mine we also utilize dredges to remove the overburden and mine the ore we then process the ore at beneficiation plants that we own at each active mine where the ore goes through washing screening sizing and flotation processes designed to separate the phosphate rock from sands clays and other foreign materials prior to commencing operations at any of our planned future mines we may need to acquire new draglines or move existing draglines to the mines and unless the beneficiation plant at an existing mine were used construct a beneficiation plant 

the phosphates deposits of peru are located within the shallow northtrending sechura basin in the piura region hosting successive interlayered marine sediments of phosphate we extract phosphate ore from the miski mayo mine using excavators the ore is then transported by truck to the feeding platform for supply of the feederbreakers which feeds the conveyor belt for the beneficiation plant that we own the ore is then processed with successive stages of washing and gravimetric separations of seawater the final stage of the process is washing with desalinated water to remove salts from the concentrate the concentrate is then shipped to north america for use in our own production or sold to third parties 

the following table shows for each of our phosphate mines annual capacity as of december 31 2019 and rock production volume and grade for the years 2019  2018  and 2017 



 



 reserves 

we estimate our phosphate rock reserves based upon exploration core drilling as well as technical and economic analyses to determine that reserves can be economically mined proven measured reserves are those resources of sufficient concentration to meet minimum physical chemical and economic criteria related to our current product standards and mining and production practices our estimates of probable indicated reserves are based on information similar to that used for proven reserves but sites for drilling are farther apart or are otherwise less adequately spaced than for proven reserves although the degree of assurance is high enough to assume continuity between such sites proven reserves are determined using a minimum drill hole spacing in two locations per 40 acre block probable reserves have less than two drill holes per 40 acre block but geological data provides a high degree of assurance that continuity exists between sites 

the following table sets forth our proven and probable phosphate reserves as of december 31 2019  

 



 we generally own the reserves shown for active mines in the table above with the only significant exceptions being further described below   

 in light of the longterm nature of our rights to our reserves we expect to be able to mine all reported reserves that are not currently owned prior to termination or expiration of our rights additional information regarding permitting is included in part i item 1a “risk factors” and under “environmental health safety and security matters—operating requirements and impacts—permitting” in our management’s analysis 

investments in mwspc 

we own a 25 interest in maaden waad al shamal phosphate company  mwspc  and in connection with our equity share we are entitled to market approximately 25 of mwspc’s production mwspc consists of a mine and two chemical complexes the “ project ” that produce phosphate fertilizers and other downstream phosphates products in the kingdom of saudi arabia the greenfield project was built in the northern region of saudi arabia at wa’ad al shamal minerals industrial city and includes further expansion of processing plants in ras al khair minerals industrial city which is located on the east coast of saudi arabia ammonia operations commenced in late 2016 and on december 1 2018 mwspc commenced commercial operations of the phospate plant thereby bringing the entire project to the commercial production phase phosphate production will gradually rampup until it reaches an expected 30 million tonnes in annual production capacity actual phosphate production was 22 million tonnes in 2019 the project is expected to benefit from the availability of key raw nutrients from sources within saudi arabia 

our cash investment in the project was 770 million at december 31 2019 we did not make any contributions in 2019 and do not expect future contributions will be needed however we are contractually obligated to make future cash contributions of approximately 70 million if needed 

sulfur 

we use molten sulfur at our phosphates concentrates plants to produce sulfuric acid primarily for use in our production of phosphoric acid we purchased approximately 37 million long tons of sulfur during 2019  we purchase the majority of this sulfur from north american oil and natural gas refiners who are required to remove or recover sulfur during the refining process production of one tonne of dap requires approximately 040 long tons of sulfur we procure our sulfur from multiple sources and receive it by truck rail barge and vessel either directly at our phosphate plants or have it sent for gathering to terminals that are located on the us gulf coast in addition we use formed sulfur received through tampa ports which are delivered by truck to our new wales facility and melted through our sulfur melter 

we own and operate a sulfur terminal in riverview florida we also lease terminal space in tampa florida and galveston and beaumont texas we have longterm time charters on two oceangoing tugsbarges and one oceangoing vessel that transports molten sulfur from the texas terminals to tampa and then onward by truck to our florida phosphate plants in addition we own a 50 equity interest in gulf sulphur services ltd lllp “ gulf sulphur services ” which is operated by our joint venture partner gulf sulphur services has a sulfur transportation and terminaling business in the gulf of mexico and handles these functions for a substantial portion of our florida sulfur volume our sulfur logistic assets also include a large fleet of leased railcars that supplement our marine sulfur logistic system our louisiana operations are served by truck from nearby refineries 

although sulfur is readily available from many different suppliers and can be transported to our phosphate facilities by a variety of means sulfur is an important raw material used in our business that has in the past been and may in the future be the subject of volatile pricing and availability alternative transportation and terminaling facilities might not have sufficient capacity to fully serve all of our facilities in the event of a disruption to current transportation or terminaling facilities changes in the price of sulfur or disruptions to sulfur transportation or terminaling facilities could have a material impact on our business we have included a discussion of sulfur prices in our management’s analysis 

ammonia 

we use ammonia together with phosphoric acid to produce dap map and microessentials ® we consumed approximately 12 million tonnes of ammonia during 2019  production of one tonne of dap requires approximately 023 tonnes of ammonia we purchase approximately onethird of our ammonia from various suppliers in the spot market with the remaining twothirds either purchased through our ammonia supply agreement the “ cf ammonia supply agreement ” with an affiliate of cf industries inc “ cf ” or produced internally at our faustina louisiana location 

our florida ammonia needs are currently supplied under multiyear contracts with both domestic and offshore producers ammonia for our bartow and riverview plants is terminaled through owned ammonia facilities at the port of tampa and port sutton florida ammonia for our new wales plant is terminaled through another ammonia facility owned and operated by a third party at port sutton florida pursuant to an agreement that provides for service through 2022 with automatic renewal for an additional twoyear period unless either party terminates as provided in the agreement ammonia is transported by pipeline from the terminals to our production facilities we have service agreements with the operators of the pipelines for bartow new wales and riverview which provide service through june 30 2020 with an annual autorenewal provision unless either party objects we are currently in the process of signing a renegotiated agreement which will run to june 30 2022 also with an annual autorenewal option 

under the cf ammonia supply agreement mosaic agreed to purchase approximately 545000 to 725000 metric tonnes of ammonia per year during a term that commenced in 2017 and may extend until december 31 2032 at a price tied to the prevailing price of us natural gas for 2019 our minimum purchase obligation was approximately 523000 metric tonnes and actual purchases were 575000 metric tonnes in the second half of 2017 a specialized tug and barge unit began transporting ammonia for us between a load location at donaldsonville louisiana and a discharge location at tampa florida additional information about this chartered unit and its financing is provided in note 25 of our consolidated financial statements we expect a majority of the ammonia purchased under the cf ammonia supply agreement to be received by barge at the port of tampa and delivered to our florida facilities as described in the preceding paragraph while the market prices of natural gas and ammonia have changed since we executed this agreement in 2013 and will continue to change we expect that the agreement will provide us a competitive advantage over its term including by providing a reliable longterm ammonia supply 

we produce ammonia at faustina louisiana primarily for our own consumption our annual capacity is approximately 530000 tonnes from time to time we sell surplus ammonia to unrelated parties andor may transport surplus ammonia to the port of tampa in addition under certain circumstances we are permitted to receive ammonia at faustina under the cf ammonia supply agreement 

although ammonia is readily available from many different suppliers and can be transported to our phosphates facilities by a variety of means ammonia is an important raw material used in our business that has in the past been and may in the future be the subject of volatile pricing and alternative transportation and terminaling facilities might not have sufficient capacity to fully serve all of our facilities in the event of a disruption to existing transportation or terminaling facilities changes in the price of ammonia or disruptions to ammonia transportation or terminaling could have a material impact on our business we have included a discussion of ammonia prices in our management’s analysis 

natural gas for phosphates 

natural gas is the primary raw material used to manufacture ammonia at our faustina facility ammonia is manufactured on site the majority of natural gas is purchased through firm delivery contracts based on published indexbased prices and is sourced from texas and louisiana via pipelines interconnected to the henry hub we use overthecounter swap andor option contracts to forward price portions of future gas purchases we typically purchase approximately 11 million mmbtu of natural gas per year for use in ammonia production at faustina our purchases were lower in 2019 as we curtailed production at our faustina facility for a portion of the year 

our ammonia requirements for our florida operations are purchased rather than manufactured on site so while we typically purchase approximately two million mmbtu of natural gas per year in florida it is only used as a thermal fuel for various phosphate production processes 

florida land holdings 

we are a significant landowner in the state of florida which has in the past been considered one of the fastest areas of population growth in the united states we own land comprising over 290000 acres held in fee simple title in central florida and have the right to mine additional properties which contain phosphate rock reserves some of our land holdings are needed to operate our phosphates business while a portion of our land assets such as certain reclaimed properties are no longer required for our ongoing operations as a general matter more of our reclaimed property becomes available for uses other than for phosphate operations each year our real property assets are generally comprised of concentrates plants port facilities phosphate mines and other property which we have acquired through our presence in florida our longterm future land use strategy is to optimize the value of our land assets for example we developed streamsong resort ® the “ resort ” a destination resort and conference center in an area of previously mined land as part of our longterm business strategy to maximize the value and utility of our extensive land holdings in florida in addition to the two golf courses and clubhouse that were opened in december 2012 the resort and conference center opened in january 2014 in 2015 in response to market demand we began construction of a third golf course and ancillary facilities which were completed and opened in 2017 

potash segment 

we are one of the leading potash producers in the world we mine and process potash in canada and the united states and sell potash in north america and internationally the term “potash” applies generally to the common salts of potassium muriate of potash “ mop ” is the primary source of potassium for the crop nutrient industry red mop has traces of iron oxide the granular and standard grade red mop products are well suited for direct fertilizer application and bulk blending white mop has a higher percent potassium oxide “ k 2 o ” white mop besides being well suited for the agricultural market is used in many industrial applications we also produce a double sulfate of potash magnesia product which we market under our brand name kmag ®  at our carlsbad new mexico facility 

our potash products are marketed worldwide to crop nutrient manufacturers distributors and retailers and are also used in the manufacturing of mixed crop nutrients and to a lesser extent in animal feed ingredients we also sell potash to customers for industrial use in addition our potash products are used for deicing and as a water softener regenerant 

in 2019  we operated three potash mines in canada including two shaft mines with a total of four production shafts and one solution mine as well as one potash shaft mine in the united states we also own related mills or refineries at our mines also as part of the acquisition we acquired a potash project in kronau saskatchewan 

we continue the expansion of capacity in our potash segment with the k3 shafts at our esterhazy mine following rampup these shafts are expected to add an estimated 09 million tonnes to our annual potash operational capacity this will provide an infrastructure to move ore from k3 to the k1 and k2 mills in september 2019 the first four rotor mining machine began cutting ore underground at k3 in december 2019 the second four rotor mining machine began cutting and shaft excavation was completed a total of 14 million tonnes of k3 ore was transported from k3 to k2 via the overland conveyor infrastructure in 2019 as k3 production ramps up we plan to cease underground mining at k1 and k2 by mid2022 once mining there ceases we expect to eliminate our brine inflow costs at these mine shafts 

it is possible that the costs of inflow remedial efforts at esterhazy may increase in the future before the shutdown of k1 and k2 mining and that such an increase could be material or in the extreme scenario that the brine inflows risk to employees 

or remediation costs may increase to a level which would cause us to change our mining processes or abandon the mines however with k3 ramping up the long term impact of an inflow event is significantly reduced 

see “key factors that can affect results of operations and financial condition” and “potash net sales and gross margin” in our management’s analysis and “our esterhazy mine has had an inflow of salt saturated brine for more than 30 years” in part i item 1a “risk factors” in this report which are incorporated herein by reference for a discussion of costs risks and other information relating to the brine inflows 

the map below shows the location of each of our potash mines 

  

our north american potash annualized operational capacity totals 112 million tonnes of product per year and accounts for approximately 12 of world annual capacity and 36 of north american annual capacity production during 2019 totaled 79 million tonnes we account for approximately 11 of estimated world annual production and 34 of estimated north american annual production 

the following table shows for each of our potash mines annual capacity as of december 31 2019 and volume of mined ore average grade and finished product output for years 2019  2018 and 2017  

 

 canadian mines 

we operate three canadian potash facilities all located in the southern half of the province of saskatchewan including our solution mine at belle plaine two interconnected mine shafts at our esterhazy shaft mine and our shaft mine at colonsay in addition we are expanding our esterhazy mine for the k3 shaft 

extensive potash deposits are found in the southern half of the province of saskatchewan the potash ore is contained in a predominantly rock salt formation known as the prairie evaporites the prairie evaporites deposits are bounded by limestone formations and contain the potash beds three potash deposits of economic importance occur in saskatchewan the esterhazy belle plaine and patience lake members the patience lake member is mined at colonsay and the esterhazy member at esterhazy at belle plaine all three members are mined each of the major potash members contains several potash beds of different thicknesses and grades the particular beds mined at colonsay and esterhazy have a mining height of 11 and 8 feet respectively at belle plaine several beds of different thicknesses are mined 

our potash mines in canada produce mop exclusively esterhazy and colonsay utilize shaft mining while belle plaine utilizes solution mining technology traditional potash shaft mining takes place underground at depths of over 1000 meters where continuous mining machines cut out the ore face and load it onto conveyor belts the ore is then crushed moved to storage bins and hoisted to refineries above ground in contrast our solution mining process involves heated brine which is pumped through a “cluster” to dissolve the potash in the ore beds at a depth of approximately 1500 meters a cluster consists of a series of boreholes drilled into the potash ore a separate distribution center at each cluster controls the brine flow the solution containing dissolved potash and salt is pumped to a refinery where sodium chloride a coproduct of this process is separated from the potash through the use of evaporation and crystallization techniques concurrently the solution is pumped into a cooling pond where additional crystallization occurs and the resulting product is recovered via a floating dredge refined potash is dewatered dried and sized our canadian operations produce 13 different mop products including industrial grades many through proprietary processes 

our potash mineral rights in the province of saskatchewan consist of the following 

we believe that our mineral rights in saskatchewan are sufficient to support current operations for more than a century leases are generally renewable at our option for successive terms generally 21 years each except that certain of the acres shown above as “leased from others” are leased under longterm leases with terms including renewals at our option that expire from 2023 to 2170 

as part of the vale fertilizantes transaction mosaic acquired the assets of vale potash canada ltd and its greenfield potash project in the kronau area approximately 27 kilometers southeast of regina saskatchewan in addition mosaic leases approximately 294000 acres of mineral rights from the government of saskatchewan and approximately 99700 acres of freehold mineral rights in the kronauregina area which have not been developed and are not included in the table above 

we pay canadian resource taxes consisting of the potash production tax and resource surcharge the potash production tax is a saskatchewan provincial tax on potash production and consists of a base payment and a profits tax we also pay a percentage of the value of resource sales from our saskatchewan mines in addition to the canadian resource taxes royalties are payable to the mineral owners in respect of potash reserves or production of potash we have included a further discussion of the canadian resource taxes and royalties in our management’s analysis 

since december 1985 we have effectively managed an inflow of salt saturated brine into our esterhazy mine at various times since then we have experienced changing amounts and patterns of brine inflows at esterhazy to date the brine inflow including our remediation efforts to control it has not had a material impact on our production processes or volumes the volume of the net brine inflow the rate of inflow less the amount we are pumping out of the mine or net outflow when we are pumping more brine out of the mine than the rate of inflow fluctuates and is dependent on a number of variables such as the location of the source of the inflow the magnitude of the inflow available pumping surface and underground brine storage capacities underground injection well capacities and the effectiveness of calcium chloride and cementatious grout used to reduce or prevent the inflows among other factors as a result of these brine inflows we incur expenditures certain of which have been capitalized and others that have been charged to expense in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 

it is possible that the costs of remedial efforts at esterhazy may further increase in the future and that such an increase could be material or in the extreme scenario that the brine inflows risk to employees or remediation costs may increase to a level which would cause us to change our mining processes or abandon the mine see “key factors that can affect results of operations and financial condition” and “potash net sales and gross margin” in our management’s analysis and “our esterhazy mine has had an inflow of salt saturated brine for more than 30 years” in part i item 1a “risk factors” in this report which are incorporated herein by reference for a discussion of costs risks and other information relating to the brine inflows the k3 shafts at our esterhazy mine are part of our potash expansion plan which is also designed to mitigate risk from current and future inflows 

due to the ongoing brine inflow at esterhazy subject to exceptions that are limited in scope and amount we are unable to obtain insurance coverage for underground operations for water incursion problems for the k1 and k2 shafts like other potash producers’ shaft mines our colonsay saskatchewan and carlsbad new mexico mines are also subject to the risks of inflow of water as a result of their shaft mining operations but water inflow risks at these mines are included in our insurance coverage subject to deductibles limited coverage terms and lower sublimits negotiated with our insurers 

united states mine 

in the united states we have a shaft mine located in carlsbad new mexico the ore reserves at our carlsbad mine are made up of langbeinite a double sulfate of potassium and magnesium this type of potash reserve occurs in a predominantly rock salt formation known as the salado formation the mcnutt member of this formation consists of eleven units of economic importance of which we currently mine one the mcnutt member’s evaporite deposits are interlayered with anhydrite polyhalite potassium salts clay and minor amounts of sandstone and siltstone 

continuous underground mining methods are utilized to extract the ore drum type mining machines are used to cut the langbeinite ore from the face mined ore is then loaded onto conveyors transported to storage areas and then hoisted to the surface for further processing at our refinery 

we produce a double sulfate of potash magnesia product which we market under our brand name kmag ®  at our carlsbad facility 

at the carlsbad facility we mine and refine potash from 77221 acres of mineral rights we control these reserves pursuant to either i leases from the us government that in general continue in effect at our option subject to readjustment by the us government every 20 years or ii leases from the state of new mexico that continue as long as we continue to produce from them these reserves contain an estimated total of 176 million tonnes of potash mineralization calculated after estimated extraction losses in one mining bed evaluated at thicknesses ranging from 65 feet to 10 feet at average refinery rates these ore reserves are estimated to be sufficient to yield 32 million tonnes of langbeinite concentrates with an average grade of approximately 22 k 2 o at projected rates of production we estimate that carlsbad’s reserves of langbeinite are sufficient to support operations for approximately 497 years 

royalties for the us operations amounted to approximately 67 million in 2019  these royalties are established by the us department of the interior bureau of land management in the case of the carlsbad leases from the us government and pursuant to provisions set forth in the leases in the case of the carlsbad state leases 

reserves 

our estimates below of our potash reserves and nonreserve potash mineralization are based on exploration drill hole data seismic data and actual mining results over more than 35 years proven reserves are estimated by identifying material in place that is delineated on at least two sides and material in place within a halfmile radius or distance from an existing sampled mine entry or exploration core hole probable reserves are estimated by identifying material in place within a one mile radius from an existing sampled mine entry or exploration core hole historical extraction ratios from the many years of mining results are then applied to both types of material to estimate the proven and probable reserves we believe that all reserves and nonreserve potash mineralization reported below are potentially recoverable using existing production shaft and refinery locations 

our estimated recoverable potash ore reserves and nonreserve potash mineralization as of december 31 2019 for each of our mines are as follows 

 

 as discussed more fully above we either own the reserves and mineralization shown above or lease them pursuant to mineral leases that generally remain in effect or are renewable at our option or are longterm leases accordingly we expect to be able to mine all reported reserves that are leased prior to termination or expiration of the existing leases 

natural gas 

natural gas is used at our belle plaine solution mine as a fuel to produce steam and to dry potash products the steam is used to generate electricity and provide thermal energy to the evaporation crystallization and solution mining processes the belle plaine solution mine typically accounts for approximately 80 of our potash segment’s total natural gas requirements for potash production at our shaft mines natural gas is used as a fuel to heat fresh air supplied to the shaft mines and for drying potash products combined natural gas usage for both the solution and shaft mines totaled 17 million mmbtu during 2019  we purchase our natural gas requirements on firm delivery index pricebased physical contracts and on short term spotpriced physical contracts our canadian operations purchase physical natural gas from alberta and saskatchewan using aeco price indices references and transport the gas to our plants via the transgas pipeline system the us potash operation in new mexico purchases physical gas in the southwest respective regional market using the el paso san juan basin market pricing reference we use financial derivative contracts to manage the pricing on portions of our natural gas requirements 

mosaic fertilizantes segment 

our mosaic fertilizantes segment owns and operates mines chemical plants crop nutrient blending and bagging facilities port terminals and warehouses in brazil and paraguay which produce and sell concentrated phosphates crop nutrients phosphatebased animal feed ingredients and pot a sh fertilizer the following map shows the locations of our operations in brazil and paraguay 

we are the largest producer and one of the largest distributors of blended crop nutrients for agricultural use in brazil we produce and sell phosphate and potashbased crop nutrients and animal feed ingredients through our operations our operations in brazil include five phosphate rock mines four chemical plants and a potash mine we own and operate ten blending plants in brazil and one blending plant and port in paraguay in addition we lease several other warehouses and blending units depending on sales and production levels we also have a 62 ownership interest in fospar sa “ fospar ” fospar owns and operates an ssp granulation plant which produces approximately 05 million tonnes of ssp per year and a deepwater port and throughput warehouse terminal facility in paranagua brazil the port facility at paranagua handles approximately 30 million tonnes of imported crop nutrients in 2019  mosaic fertilizantes sold approximately 92 million tonnes of crop nutrient products and accounted for approximately 25 of fertilizer shipments in brazil 

we have the capability to annually produce approximately 40 million tonnes of phosphate and potashbased crop nutrients and animal feed ingredients crop nutrient products produced are marketed to crop nutrient manufacturers distributors retailers and farmers 

in addition to producing crop nutrients mosaic fertilizantes purchases phosphates potash and nitrogen products which are either used to produce blended crop nutrients “ blends ” or for resale in 2019  mosaic fertilizantes purchased 16 million tonnes of phosphatebased products primarily microessentials ®  from our phosphates segment and 21 million tonnes of potash products from our potash segment and canpotex 

early in 2019 brazils national mining agency implemented new standards regarding tailings dam safety construction environmental licenses and operations as a result of these new standards we temporarily idled operations at four tailings dams and the three related mines at araxa tapira and catalao which negatively impacted our operations production levels costs and results in an amount of approximately 77 million we resumed full mining operations during the third quarter of 

2019 after we received a certificate of stabilization for each of the idled tailings dams which certified our full compliance with the new standards 

phosphate crop nutrients and animal feed ingredients 

our brazilian phosphates operations have capacity to produce approximately 11 million tonnes of phosphoric acid “ p 2 o 5 ” per year or about 70 of brazilian annual capacity phosphoric acid is produced by reacting ground phosphate rock with sulfuric acid phosphoric acid is the key building block for the production of high analysis or concentrated phosphate crop nutrients and animal feed products and is the most comprehensive measure of phosphate capacity and production and a commonly used benchmark in our industry our brazilian phosphoric acid production totaled approximately 08 million tonnes in 2019 and accounted for approximately 88 of brazilian annual output production in 2019 was negatively impacted by steps taken to comply with the new standards implemented by brazils national mining agency discussed above 

our principal phosphate crop nutrient products are 

 our primary mines and chemical plants are located in the states of minas gerais sao paulo and goias production of our animal feed ingredients products is located at our uberaba minas gerais and cajati sao paulo facilities we market our feed phosphate primarily under the brand name foscálcio 

annual capacity by plant as of december 31 2019 and production volumes by plant for 2019 are listed below 

 



actual production was also impacted by downtime to comply with new standards implemented by brazils national mining agency 

the phosphoric acid produced at cajati is used to produce dcp the phosphoric acid produced at uberaba is used to produce map tsp and dcp we produced approximately 29 million tonnes of concentrated phosphate crop nutrients during 2019 which accounted for approximately 69 of estimated brazilian annual production 

phosphate rock 

phosphate rock is the key mineral used to produce phosphate crop nutrients and feed phosphate our phosphate rock production in brazil totaled approximately 29 million tonnes in 2019 which accounted for approximately 55 of estimated brazilian annual production we are the largest producer of phosphate rock in brazil and currently operate four mines with a combined annual capacity of approximately 50 million tonnes production of one tonne of map requires 16 to 17 tonnes of phosphate rock production of one tonne of ssp requires between 06 to 07 tonnes of phosphate rock production of one tonne of tsp requires 14 tonnes of phosphate rock 

our wholly owned phosphate mines and related mining operations in brazil are located in the states of minas gerais goiás 

and são paulo brazil during 2019  we operated five active mines araxá patrocínio and tapira in the state of minas gerais catalão in the state of goiás and cajati in the state of são paulo 

all of our brazilian phosphate rock mines are open pit mines the phosphate ore is extracted by drilling and blasting loaded by backhoe into trucks and transported to the processing plants at each mine with the exception of patrocínio which does not have its own processing plant the ore extracted at patrocínio is transported by rail to araxá for processing we process the ore at beneficiation plants that we own 

the following table shows the annual capacity of rock production volume and grade for each of our phosphate mines as of december 31 2019 and 2018 

 

 phosphate reserves 

the evaluation of mineral reserves is based upon exploration core drilling as well as technical and economic analyses to determine that reserves can be economically mined proven measured reserves are those resources of sufficient 

concentration to meet minimum physical chemical and economic criteria related to our current product standards and mining and production practices our estimates or probable indicated reserves are based on information similar to that used for proven reserves but sites for drilling are farther apart or are otherwise less adequately spaced than for proven reserves although the degree of assurance is high enough to assume continuity between such sites 

the following table sets forth our proven and probable phosphates reserves as of december 31 2019  

 

 

we are required to pay royalties to mineral owners and resource taxes to the brazilian government for phosphate and potash production the resource taxes known as compensação financeira pela exploração de recursos minerais or cfem  are regulated by the national mining agency in 2019  we paid royalties and resource taxes of approximately 8 million 

sulfur 

we use molten sulfur at our phosphates concentrates plants to produce sulfuric acid one of the key components used in our production of phosphoric acid we consumed approximately 10 million long tons of sulfur for our own production during 2019  we purchase approximately 60 of the volume under annual supply agreements from oil and natural gas refiners who are required to remove or recover sulfur during the refining process the remaining 40 is purchased in the spot market sulfur is imported through the tiplam port and transported by rail to the uberaba plant and by truck to the araxá and cajati locations 

although sulfur is readily available from many different suppliers and can be transported to our phosphate facilities by a variety of means sulfur is an important raw material used in our business that has in the past been and could in the future be subject to volatile pricing and availability alternative transportation and terminaling facilities might not have sufficient capacity to fully serve all of our facilities in the event of a disruption to current transportation or terminaling facilities changes in the price of sulfur or disruptions or sulfur transportation or terminaling facilities could have a material impact on our business 

ammonia 

we use ammonia together with phosphoric acid to produce map and to a lesser extent for ssp production we consumed approximately 130000 tonnes of ammonia during 2019  production of one tonne of map requires approximately 0137 tonnes of ammonia we purchase all of our ammonia under a longterm supply agreement with a single supplier ammonia is imported through the tiplam port and transported by truck to uberaba araxá and catalão 

we own approximately 1 of the tiplam terminal in santos sao paulo our ownership percentage along with a contractual agreement guarantee us unloading priority for ammonia and also provide us unloading capacity for rock sulfur and crop nutrients 

although ammonia is readily available from many different suppliers and can be transported to our phosphates facilities by a variety of means ammonia is an important raw material used in our business that has in the past been and in the future could be subject to volatile pricing alternative transportation and terminaling facilities might not have sufficient capacity to fully 

serve all of our facilities in the event of a disruption to existing transportation or terminaling facilities changes in the price of ammonia or disruptions to ammonia transportation of terminaling could have a material impact on our business we have included a discussion of ammonia prices in our managements analysis 

brazilian potash 

we conduct potash operations through the leased taquarivassouras shaft mine which is the only potash mine in brazil located in rosário do catete in the brazilian state of sergipe we also own a related refinery at the site we produce and sell potash product domestically mop is the primary source of potassium for the crop nutrient industry in brazil red mop has traces of iron oxide the granular and standard grade red mop products are wellsuited for direct fertilizer application and bulk blending our potash product is marketed in brazil to crop nutrient manufacturers distributors and retailers and is also used in the manufacturing of crop nutrients 

potash mine 

the potash deposit is in the taquarivassouras subbasin and the taquarivassouras industrial complex is in rosário do catete it can be reached by road and is also served by rail about 9km from the site and a port facility about 40 km from the mine site the underground mining operations comprises three municipalities rosário do catete capela and carmópolis 

the ore is sylvinite kcl nacl containing sylvite kcl and halite nacl it is mined at a depth of 500 to 740 meters by room and pillar methods using six continuous miners room and pillar is a mining system in which the mined material is extracted across a horizontal plane creating horizontal arrays of rooms and pillars the ore is extracted in two phases in the first pillars of untouched material are left to support the roof overburden and open areas or rooms are extracted underground the pillars are then partially extracted in the same manner the technique is usually used for relatively flatlying deposits 

the beneficiation process operation begins at the runofmine stockpile the material is conveyed to the processing circuit where it is divided into eight major units crushing concentration dissolution drying compaction storage and shipping 

our current potash annualized operational capacity totals 520000 tonnes of product per year and accounts for 100 of brazilian annual capacity production totaled 426000 tonnes in 2019  with a k20 grade of 58 production during 2019 was negatively impacted by an area of challenging geology which affected the mines operating rates 

in 2019  we paid royalties of approximately 7 million related to the leasing of potash assets and mining rights for taquari 

reserves 

our estimate of potash reserves is based on exploration drill hole data seismic data and actual mining results we believe that all reserves are potentially recoverable using existing production and refinery locations as of december 31 2019  we had probable reserves of 95 million tonnes with an average k2o grade of 2375 we are currently in the process of having further technical work performed by independent third parties that will provide the information necessary to determine the proven reserves based on current estimates we believe the reserves will be exhausted in 2023 

land holdings 

mosaic fertilizantes owns properties and the surface rights of certain additional rural lands comprising over 32000 hectares 79000 acres in the states of são paulo minas gerais goiás paraná mato grosso santa catarina bahia and sergipe and has the right to mine additional properties which contain phosphate rock or potash reserves most of our land holdings are needed to operate our phosphate and potash production and fertilizer distribution businesses a portion of our land assets may no longer be required for our current operations and may be leased to third parties for agricultural or other purposes or may be set aside for mineral or environmental conservation our real property assets are generally comprised of concentrates plants port facilities and phosphate and potash mines crop nutrient blending and bagging facilities and other properties which we have acquired through our presence in brazil 

india and china distribution businesses 

our china and india distribution businesses market phosphate potash and nitrogenbased crop nutrients and provide other ancillary services to wholesalers cooperatives independent retailers and farmers in the asiapacific regions these operations provide our phosphates and potash segments access to key markets outside of north and south america and serve 

as a marketing agent for our phosphates segment in 2019  the india and china operations purchased 429686 tonnes of phosphatebased products from our phosphates segment and mwspc and 367470 tonnes of potash products from our potash segment and canpotex they also purchase phosphates potash and nitrogen products from unrelated third parties which we either use to produce blended crop nutrients or for resale 

in china we own two 300000tonne per year capacity blending plants in 2019  we sold approximately 172000 tonnes of blends and distributed another 513000 tonnes of phosphate and potash crop nutrients in china 

in india we have distribution facilities to import and sell crop nutrients in 2019  we distributed approximately 784000 tonnes of phosphate and potash crop nutrient products in india 

sales and distribution activities 

united states and canada 

we have a united states and canada sales and marketing team that serves our business segments we sell to wholesale distributors retail chains cooperatives independent retailers and national accounts 

customer service and the ability to effectively minimize the overall supply chain costs are key competitive factors in the crop nutrient and animal feed ingredients businesses in addition to our production facilities to service the needs of our customers we own or have contractual throughput or other arrangements at strategically located distribution warehouses along or near the mississippi and ohio rivers as well as in other key agricultural regions of the united states and canada from these facilities we distribute mosaicproduced phosphate and potash products for customers who in turn resell the product into the distribution channel or directly to farmers in the united states and canada 

we own port facilities in tampa florida and houston texas which have deep water berth capabilities providing access to the gulf of mexico we discontinued operations at the houston texas facility in 2017 and are currently not marketing the asset for sale we also own warehouse distribution facilities in savage minnesota rosemount minnesota pekin illinois and henderson kentucky we anticipate idling of the savage minnesota facility in the first quarter of 2020 

in addition to the facilities that we own our us distribution operations also include leased distribution space or contractual throughput agreements in other key geographical areas including california florida illinois indiana iowa kentucky louisiana minnesota missouri nebraska north dakota ohio oklahoma texas and wisconsin 

our canadian customers include independent dealers and national accounts we also lease and own warehouse facilities in saskatchewan ontario quebec and manitoba in canada 

international 

outside of the united states and canada we market our phosphates segment’s products through our mosaic fertilizantes segment and our china and india distribution businesses as well as a salesforce focused on geographies outside of north america the countries that account for the largest amount of our phosphates sales outside the united states by volume are brazil canada australia and argentina 

our sales outside of the united states and canada of potash products are made through canpotex canpotex sales are allocated between its members based on peaking capacity in 2019 our share of canpotex sales remained at 362 

our potash exports from carlsbad are sold through our own sales force we also market our potash segment’s products through our mosaic fertilizantes segment and our china and india distribution businesses which acquire potash primarily through canpotex the countries that account for the largest amount of international potash sales by volume are brazil china indonesia india and malaysia 

to service the needs of our customers our mosaic fertilizantes segment includes a network of strategically located sales offices crop nutrient blending and bagging facilities port terminals and warehouse distribution facilities that we own and operate the blending and bagging facilities primarily produce blends from phosphate potash and nitrogen the average product mix in our blends by volume contains approximately 15 nitrogen 50 phosphate and 35 potash although this mix differs based on seasonal and other factors all of our production in brazil is consumed within the country 

our india and china distribution businesses also includes a network of strategically located sales offices crop nutrient blending and bagging facilities port terminals and warehouse distribution facilities these businesses serve primarily as a sales outlet for our north american phosphates production as well as additional phosphate production we market from our mwspc joint venture both for resale and as an input for blends our potash segment also has historically furnished the majority of the raw materials needs for the production of blends primarily via canpotex and is expected to continue to do so in the future 

other products 

with a strong brand position in a multibillion dollar animal feed ingredients global market our phosphates segment supplies animal feed ingredients for poultry and livestock to customers in north america latin america and asia our potash sales to nonagricultural users are primarily to large industrial accounts and the animal feed industry additionally in north america we sell potash for deicing and as a water softener regenerant while recently concluding to exit the fluorosilicic acid business used for water fluoridation in brazil we also sell phosphogypsum 

competition 

because crop nutrients are global commodities available from numerous sources crop nutrition companies compete primarily on the basis of delivered price other competitive factors include product quality cost and availability of raw materials customer service plant efficiency and availability of product as a result markets for our products are highly competitive we compete with a broad range of domestic and international producers including farmer cooperatives subsidiaries of larger companies and independent crop nutrient companies foreign competitors often have access to cheaper raw materials are required to comply with less stringent regulatory requirements or are owned or subsidized by governments and as a result may have cost advantages over north american companies we believe that our extensive north american and international production and distribution system provides us with a competitive advantage by allowing us to achieve economies of scale transportation and storage efficiencies and obtain market intelligence also we believe our performance products such as microessentials ®  provide us a competitive advantage with customers in north and south america 

unlike many of our competitors we have our own distribution system to sell phosphate and potashbased crop nutrients and animal feed ingredients whether produced by us or by other third parties around the globe in north america we have one of the largest and most strategically located distribution systems for crop nutrients including warehouse facilities in key agricultural regions we also have an extensive network of distribution facilities internationally including in the key growth regions of south america and asia with port terminals warehouses and blending plants in brazil paraguay china and india our global presence allows us to efficiently serve customers in approximately 40 countries 

phosphates segment 

our phosphates segment operates in a highly competitive global market among the competitors in the global phosphate industry are domestic and foreign companies as well as foreign governmentsupported producers in asia and north africa phosphate producers compete primarily based on price as well as product quality service and innovation major integrated producers of feed phosphates are located in the united states europe and china many smaller producers are located in emerging markets around the world many of these smaller producers are not miners of phosphate rock or manufacturers of phosphoric acid and are required to purchase this material on the open market 

we believe that we are a lowcost integrated producer of phosphatebased crop nutrients due in part to our scale vertical integration and strategic network of production and distribution facilities as the world’s largest producer of concentrated phosphates as well as the second largest miner of phosphate rock in the world and the largest in the united states we maintain an advantage over some competitors as the scale of operations effectively reduces production costs per unit we are also vertically integrated to captively supply one of our key inputs phosphate rock to our phosphate production facilities we believe that our position as an integrated producer of phosphate rock provides us with a significant cost advantage over competitors that are nonintegrated phosphate producers in addition our ownership in the miski mayo mine allows us to supplement our overall phosphate rock needs we also sell a portion of miski mayo production to third parties mwspc enables us to not only further diversify our sources of phosphates but also improve our access to key agricultural countries in asia and the middle east 

we produce ammonia at our faustina louisiana concentrates plant in quantities sufficient to meet approximately one third of our total ammonia needs in north america with no captive ammonia production supplying all our florida operations we 

are subject to significant volatility in our purchase price of ammonia from world markets the cf ammonia supply agreement provides us with a longterm supply of a substantial volume of ammonia at prices based on the price of natural gas and is intended to lessen this volatility 

with our dedicated sulfur transportation barges and tugs and our 50 ownership interest in gulf sulphur services we are also wellpositioned to source an adequate flexible and costeffective supply of sulfur to our florida and louisiana phosphate production facilities our third key input we believe that our investments in sulfur assets continue to afford us a competitive advantage compared to other producers in cost and access to sulfur 

with facilities in both central florida and louisiana we are logistically well positioned to fulfill our needs at very competitive prices those multiple production points also afford us the flexibility to optimally balance supply and demand 

potash segment 

potash is a commodity available from several geographical regions around the world and consequently the market is highly competitive through our participation in canpotex we compete outside of north america against various independent and stateowned potash producers canpotex has substantial expertise and logistical resources for the international distribution of potash including strategically located export assets in portland oregon st john new brunswick and vancouver british columbia our principal methods of competition with respect to the sale of potash include product pricing and offering consistent highquality products and superior service we believe that our potash cost structure is competitive in the industry and should improve as we continue to complete our potash expansion projects 

mosaic fertilizantes 

the mosaic fertilizantes segment operates in a highly competitive market in brazil we compete with a broad range of domestic and international producers including farmer cooperatives subsidiaries of larger companies and independent crop nutrient companies we believe that having a vertically integrated business internationally but also in brazil provides us with a competitive advantage by allowing us to achieve economies of scale transportation and storage efficiencies and obtain market intelligence 

mosaic fertilizantes has a wide variety of customers including farmers blenders and other local distributors we compete with local businesses that offer a wide variety of products that are available from many sources we believe the strategic location of our mines and chemical plants in close proximity to our customers and the benefit of our own distribution network gives us an advantage over most of our competitors the vertical integration of our whollyowned production along with our distribution network as well as our focus on product innovation and customer solutions position us with an advantage over many of our competitors we have a strong brand in brazil in addition to having access to our own production our distribution activities have the capability to supply a wide variety of crop nutrients to our dealerfarmer customer base 

factors affecting demand 

our results of operations historically have reflected the effects of several external factors which are beyond our control and have in the past produced significant downward and upward swings in operating results revenues are highly dependent upon conditions in the agriculture industry and can be affected by among other factors crop conditions changes in agricultural production practices worldwide economic conditions including the increasing world population household incomes and demand for more proteinrich food particularly in developing regions such as china india and latin america changing demand for biofuels variability in commodity pricing governmental policies the level of inventories in the crop nutrient distribution channels customer expectations about farmer economics future crop nutrient prices and availability and transportation costs among other matters market trends in raw material costs market prices for crop nutrients and weather furthermore our crop nutrients business is seasonal to the extent farmers and agricultural enterprises in the markets in which we compete purchase more crop nutrient products during the spring and fall the international scope of our business spanning the northern and southern hemispheres reduces to some extent the seasonal impact on our business the degree of seasonality of our business can change significantly from year to year due to conditions in the agricultural industry and other factors the seasonal nature of our businesses requires significant working capital for inventory in advance of the planting seasons 

we sell products throughout the world unfavorable changes in trade protection laws policies and measures government policies and other regulatory requirements affecting trade unexpected changes in tax and trade treaties strengthening or 

weakening of foreign economies as well as political relations with the united states may cause sales trends to customers in one or more foreign countries to differ from sales trends in the united states 

our international operations are subject to risks from changes in foreign currencies or government policy which can affect local farmer economics 

other matters 

employees 

we had approximately 12600 employees as of december 31 2019  consisting of approximately 9100 salaried and 3500 hourly employees there are also approximately 700 hourly employees at the miski mayo mine of which we own 75 and its results are consolidated within our results of operations 

labor relations 

as of december 31 2019    

 failure to renew any of our union agreements could result in a strike or labor stoppage that could have a material adverse effect on our operations however we have not experienced significant work stoppage in many years and historically have had good labor relations

 item 1a risk factors 

our business financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of the risks and uncertainties described below 

our esterhazy mine has had an inflow of salt saturated brine for more than 30 years 

since december 1985 we have had inflows of salt saturated brine into our esterhazy saskatchewan mine over the past century several potash mines experiencing water inflow problems have flooded in order to control brine inflows at esterhazy we have incurred and will continue to incur expenditures certain of which due to their nature have been capitalized while others have been charged to expense 

at various times we experience changing amounts and patterns of brine inflows at the esterhazy mine periodically some of these inflows have exceeded available pumping capacity if that were to continue for several months without abatement it could exceed our available storage capacity and ability to effectively manage the brine inflow this could adversely affect production at the esterhazy mine the brine inflow is variable resulting in both net inflows the rate of inflow is more than the amount we are pumping out of the mine and net outflows when we are pumping more brine out of the mine than the rate of inflow there can be no assurance that   

 the expenditures to control the inflows will be consistent with our prior experience or future estimates 

from time to time new or improved technology becomes available to facilitate our management of the inflows such as when horizontal drilling techniques were developed and refined taking advantage of these new or improved technologies may require significant capital expenditures andor may increase our costs of management 

due to the ongoing brine inflow at esterhazy subject to exceptions that are limited in scope and amount we are unable to obtain insurance coverage for underground operations for water incursion problems our mines at colonsay saskatchewan and carlsbad new mexico are also subject to the risks of inflow of water as a result of our shaft mining operations 

it is possible that the costs of remedial efforts at esterhazy may further increase in the future and that such an increase could be material or in the extreme scenario that the brine inflows risk to employees or management costs may increase to a level which would cause us to change our mining processes or abandon the mines see the “key factors that can affect results of operations and financial condition” and “potash net sales and gross margin” sections of our management’s analysis which sections are incorporated herein by reference for a discussion of costs risks and other information relating to the brine inflows 

our operating results are highly dependent upon and fluctuate based upon business and economic conditions and governmental policies affecting the agricultural industry in which we or our customers operate these factors are outside of our control and may significantly affect our profitability 

our operating results are highly dependent upon business and economic conditions and governmental policies affecting the agricultural industry which we cannot control the agricultural products business can be affected by a number of factors the most important of which are   

 international market conditions which are also outside of our control may also significantly influence our operating results the international market for crop nutrients is influenced by such factors as the relative value of the us dollar and its impact upon the cost of importing crop nutrients foreign agricultural policies including subsidy policies the existence of or changes in import or foreign currency exchange barriers in certain foreign markets changes in the hard currency demands of certain countries and other regulatory policies of foreign governments as well as the laws and policies of the united states affecting foreign trade and investment 

our most important products are global commodities and we face intense global competition from other crop nutrient producers that can affect our prices and volumes 

our most important products are concentrated phosphate crop nutrients including diammonium phosphate or dap monoammonium phosphate or map microessentials ® and muriate of potash or mop we sell most of our dap map and mop in the form of global commodities our sales of these products face intense global competition from other crop nutrient producers 

changes in competitors’ production or shifts in their marketing focus have in the past significantly affected both the prices at which we sell our products and the volumes that we sell and are likely to continue to do so in the future 

competitors are more likely to increase their production at times when world agricultural and crop nutrient markets are strong and to focus on sales into regions where their returns are highest increases in the global supply of dap map and mop or competitors’ increased sales into regions in which we have significant sales could adversely affect our prices and volumes 

competitors and potential new entrants in the markets for both concentrated phosphate crop nutrients and potash have in recent years expanded capacity or begun or announced plans to expand capacity or build new facilities the extent to which current global or local economic and financial conditions changes in global or local economic and financial conditions or other factors may cause delays or cancellation of some of these ongoing or planned projects or result in the acceleration of existing or new projects is unclear in addition certain of our products sold to china may be subject to tariffs due to ongoing trade tensions between china and the united states the level of exports by chinese producers of concentrated phosphate 

crop nutrients depends to a significant extent on chinese government actions to curb exports through among other measures prohibitive export taxes at times when the government believes it desirable to assure ample domestic supplies of concentrated phosphate crop nutrients to stimulate grain and oilseed production 

in addition the other member of canpotex is among our competitors who may in the future expand its potash production capacity each canpotex members respective shares of canpotex sales is based upon that members respective proven peaking capacity for producing potash when a canpotex member expands its production capacity the new capacity is added to that member’s proven peaking capacity based on a proving run at the maximum production level alternatively canpotex members may elect to rely on an independent engineering firm and approved protocols to calculate their proven peaking capacity antitrust and competition laws prohibit the members of canpotex from coordinating their production decisions including the timing of their respective proving runs worldwide potash production levels during these proving runs could exceed thencurrent market demand resulting in an oversupply of potash and lower potash prices 

we cannot accurately predict when or whether members’ or new entrants’ ongoing or planned capacity expansions or new facilities will be completed the timing of competitors’ tests to prove peaking capacity for canpotex purposes the cumulative effect of these and recently completed expansions the impact of tariffs on exports to china or future decisions by the chinese government on the level of chinese exports of concentrated phosphate crop nutrients or the effects of these or other actions by our competitors on the prices for our products or the volumes that we will be able to sell the effects of any of these events occurring could be materially adverse to our results of operations 

our crop nutrients and other products are subject to price and demand volatility resulting from periodic imbalances of supply and demand which may cause our results of operations to fluctuate 

historically the market for crop nutrients has been cyclical and prices and demand for our products have fluctuated to a significant extent particularly for phosphates and to a lesser extent potash periods of high demand increasing profits and high capacity utilization tend to lead to new plant investment and increased production in the industry this growth increases supply until the market is oversaturated leading to declining prices and declining capacity utilization until the cycle repeats 

as a result crop nutrient prices and volumes have been and are expected to continue to be volatile this price and volume volatility may cause our results of operations to fluctuate and potentially deteriorate the price at which we sell our crop nutrient products and our sales volumes could fall in the event of industry oversupply conditions which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations in contrast high prices may lead our customers and farmers to delay purchasing decisions in anticipation of future lower prices thus impacting our sales volumes 

due to reduced market demand depressed agricultural economic conditions and other factors we and our predecessors have at various times suspended or curtailed production at some of our facilities the extent to which we utilize available capacity at our facilities will cause fluctuations in our results of operations as we will incur costs for any temporary or indefinite shutdowns of our facilities and lower sales tend to lead to higher fixed costs as a percentage of sales 

variations in crop nutrient application rates may exacerbate the cyclicality of the crop nutrient markets 

farmers are able to maximize their economic return by applying optimum amounts of crop nutrients farmers’ decisions about the application rate for each crop nutrient or to forego application of a crop nutrient particularly phosphate and potash vary from year to year depending on a number of factors including among others crop prices crop nutrient and other crop input costs or the level of the crop nutrient remaining in the soil following the previous harvest farmers are more likely to increase application rates when crop prices are relatively high crop nutrient and other crop input costs are relatively low and the level of the crop nutrient remaining in the soil is relatively low conversely farmers are likely to reduce or forego application when farm economics are weak or declining or the level of the crop nutrients remaining in the soil is relatively high this variability in application rates can materially accentuate the cyclicality in prices for our products and our sales volumes 

our crop nutrient business is seasonal which may result in carrying significant amounts of inventory and seasonal variations in working capital and our inability to predict future seasonal crop nutrient demand accurately may result in excess inventory or product shortages 

the use of crop nutrients is seasonal farmers tend to apply crop nutrients during two short application periods the strongest one in the spring before planting and the other in the fall after harvest as a result the strongest demand for our products typically occurs during the spring planting season with a second period of strong demand following the fall harvest in contrast we and other crop nutrient producers generally produce our products throughout the year as a result we andor our customers generally build inventories during the low demand periods of the year in order to ensure timely product availability 

during the peak sales seasons the seasonality of crop nutrient demand results in our sales volumes and net sales typically being the highest during the north american spring season and our working capital requirements typically being the highest just prior to the start of the spring season our quarterly financial results can vary significantly from one year to the next due to weatherrelated shifts in planting schedules and purchasing patterns 

if seasonal demand exceeds our projections we will not have enough product and our customers may acquire products from our competitors which would negatively impact our profitability if seasonal demand is less than we expect we will be left with excess inventory and higher working capital and liquidity requirements the degree of seasonality of our business can change significantly from year to year due to conditions in the agricultural industry and other factors 

the distribution channels for crop nutrients have capacity to build significant levels of inventories which can adversely affect our sales volumes and selling prices 

in order to balance the production needs of crop nutrient producers with farmers’ seasonal use of crop nutrients crop nutrient distribution channels need to have the capacity to build significant inventories the buildup of inventories in the distribution channels can become excessive particularly during the cyclical periods of low demand that have been typical in the crop nutrient industry when there are excessive inventories in the distribution channel our sales volumes and selling prices can be adversely impacted even during periods in which farmers’ use of crop nutrients may remain strong 

changes in transportation costs can affect our sales volumes and selling prices 

the cost of delivery is a significant factor in the total cost to customers and farmers of crop nutrients as a result changes in transportation costs or in customer expectations about them can affect our sales volumes and prices 

customer expectations about future events can have a significant effect on the demand for our products these expectations can significantly affect our sales volumes and selling prices 

customer expectations about future events have had and are expected to continue to have an effect on the demand and prices for crop nutrients future events that may be affected by customer expectations include among others   

 customer expectations about prices and availability of crop nutrients have had and are expected to continue to have an effect on the demand for crop nutrients when customers anticipate increasing crop nutrient prices customers tend to accumulate inventories before the anticipated price increases this can result in a lag in our realization of rising market prices for our products conversely customers tend to delay their purchases when they anticipate future prices for crop nutrients will stabilize or decrease adversely affecting our sales volumes and selling prices customer expectations about availability of crop nutrients can have similar effects on sales volumes and prices   

 similarly customer expectations about future farmer economics have had and are expected to continue to have an effect on the demand for crop nutrients when customers anticipate improving farmer economics customers tend to accumulate crop nutrient inventories in anticipation of increasing sales volumes and selling prices this can result in a lag in our realization of rising market prices for our products conversely when customers anticipate declining farmer economics customers tend to reduce the level of their purchases of crop nutrients adversely affecting our sales volumes and selling prices   

 as discussed above increasing transportation costs effectively increase customers’ and farmers’ costs for crop nutrients and can reduce the amount we realize for our sales expectations of decreasing transportation costs can result in customers and farmers anticipating that they may be able to decrease their costs by delaying purchases as a result changes in customer expectations about transportation costs can affect our sales volumes and prices 

we conduct our operations primarily through a limited number of key production and distribution facilities any disruption at any one of these facilities could have a material adverse impact on our business the risk of material disruption increases when demand for our products results in high operating rates at our facilities 

we conduct our operations through a limited number of key production and distribution facilities these facilities include our phosphate mines and concentrates plants our potash mines and the ports and other distribution facilities through which we 

canpotex and any joint ventures in which we participate conduct our respective businesses as well as other commercial arrangements with unrelated third parties any disruption of operations at any one of these facilities has the possibility of significantly affecting our production or our ability to distribute our products operating these facilities at high rates during periods of high demand for our products increases the risk of mechanical or structural failures decreases the time available for routine maintenance and increases the impact on our operating results from any disruption a disruption of operations at any one of our key facilities could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 

examples of the types of events that could result in a disruption at one of these facilities include adverse weather strikes or other work stoppages deliberate malicious acts including acts of terrorism political and economic instability cyber attacks risks associated with our international operations changes in permitting financial assurance or other environmental health and safety laws or other changes in the regulatory environment in which we operate legal and regulatory proceedings our relationships with the other member of canpotex and any joint ventures in which we participate and their or our exit from participation in canpotex or any such joint ventures other changes in our commercial arrangements with unrelated third parties brine inflows at our esterhazy saskatchewan mine or our other shaft mines mechanical failure and accidents or other failures occurring in the course of operating activities including at our gypstacks clay settling areas and tailing dams and other factors 

insurance market conditions our loss experience and other factors affect the insurance coverage that we carry and we are not fully insured against all potential hazards and risks incident to our business as a result our insurance coverage may not adequately cover our losses 

we maintain property business interruption and casualty insurance policies but we are not insured against all potential hazards and risks incident to our business we are subject to various selfretentions and deductibles under these insurance policies as a result of market conditions our loss experience and other factors our premiums selfretentions and deductibles for insurance policies can increase substantially and in some instances certain insurance may become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage in addition significantly increased costs could lead us to decide to reduce or possibly eliminate coverage as a result a disruption of operations at one of our key facilities or a significant casualty could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 

important raw materials and energy used in our businesses in the past have been and may in the future be the subject of volatile pricing changes in the price of our raw materials could have a material impact on our businesses 

natural gas ammonia and sulfur are key raw materials used in the manufacture of phosphate crop nutrient products natural gas is used as both a chemical feedstock and a fuel to produce anhydrous ammonia which is a raw material used in the production of concentrated phosphate products natural gas is also a significant energy source used in the potash solution mining process from time to time our profitability has been and may in the future be impacted by the price and availability of these raw materials and other energy costs because most of our products are commodities there can be no assurance that we will be able to pass through increased costs to our customers a significant increase in the price of natural gas ammonia sulfur or energy costs that is not recovered through an increase in the price of our related crop nutrients products could have a material adverse impact on our business in addition under our longterm cf ammonia supply agreement we have agreed to purchase approximately 545000 to 725000 tonnes of ammonia per year during a term that may extend until december 31 2032 and at a price to be determined by a formula based on the prevailing price of us natural gas if the price of natural gas rises or the market price for ammonia falls outside of the range anticipated at execution of this agreement we may not realize a cost benefit from the natural gasbased pricing over the term of the agreement or the cost of our ammonia under the agreement could become a competitive disadvantage at times we have paid considerably more for ammonia under the agreement than what we would have paid had we purchased it in the spot market 

during periods when the price for concentrated phosphates is falling because of falling raw material prices we may experience a lag in realizing the benefits of the falling raw materials prices this lag can adversely affect our gross margins and profitability 

during some periods changes in market prices for raw materials can lead to changes in the global market prices for concentrated phosphate crop nutrients in particular the global market prices for concentrated phosphate crop nutrients can be affected by changes in the market prices for sulfur ammonia phosphate rock or phosphoric acid raw materials increasing market prices for these raw materials tend to put upward pressure on the selling prices for concentrated phosphate crop nutrients and decreasing market prices for these raw materials tend to put downward pressure on selling prices for concentrated phosphate crop nutrients when the market prices for these raw materials falls rapidly the selling prices for our concentrated phosphate crop nutrients can fall more rapidly than we are able to consume our raw material inventory that we 

purchased or committed to purchase in the past at higher prices as a result our costs may not fall as rapidly as the selling prices of our products until we are able to consume the higherpriced raw materials our gross margins and profitability can be adversely affected 

during periods when the prices for our products are falling because of falling raw material prices we could be required to writedown the value of our inventories any such writedown could adversely affect our results of operations and the value of our assets 

we carry our inventories at the lower of cost or market in periods when the market prices for our products are falling rapidly including in response to falling market prices for raw materials it is possible that we could be required to writedown the value of our inventories if market prices fall below our costs any such writedown could adversely affect our results of operations and the value of our assets any such effect could be material 

our estimates of future selling prices reflect in part the purchase commitments we have from our customers as a result defaults on these existing purchase commitments because of the global or local economic and financial conditions or for other reasons could adversely affect our estimates of future selling prices and require additional inventory writedowns 

in the event of a disruption to existing terminaling facilities or transportation for our products or raw materials alternative terminaling facilities or transportation might not be available on a timely basis or have sufficient capacity to fully serve all of our customers or facilities 

terminaling facilities and transportation include the ports and other distribution facilities through which we canpotex and the joint ventures in which we participate conduct our respective businesses transportation and related equipment arrangements and other commercial arrangements with unrelated third parties 

examples of the types of events that could result in a disruption of terminaling facilities or transportation include adverse weather strikes or other work stoppages deliberate malicious acts including cyber attacks political and economic instability and other risks associated with our international operations changes in permitting financial assurance or other environmental health and safety laws or other changes in the regulatory environment in which we operate legal and regulatory proceedings our relationships with the other member of canpotex and any joint ventures in which we participate and their or our exit from participation in canpotex or any such joint ventures other changes in our commercial arrangements with unrelated third parties accidents occurring in the course of operating activities lack of truck rail barge or ship transportation and other factors we discuss a number of these examples in more detail throughout this risk factors section such disruption could adversely impact our business and financial results of operations 

we are subject to risks associated with our international sales and operations which could negatively affect our sales to customers in foreign countries as well as our operations and assets in foreign countries some of these factors may also make it less attractive to distribute cash generated by our operations outside the united states to our stockholders or to utilize cash generated by our operations in one country to fund our operations or repayments of indebtedness in another country or to support other corporate purposes 

for 2019  we derived approximately 74 of our net sales from customers located outside of the united states as a result we are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties relating to international sales and operations including   



the occurrence of any of the above in the countries in which we operate or elsewhere could jeopardize or affect our ability to transact business there and could adversely affect our revenues and operating results and the value of our assets located outside of the united states 

in addition tax regulations and tax audit practices currency exchange controls and other restrictions may also make it economically unattractive to   

 changes in tax laws or regulations or their interpretation or exposure to additional tax liabilities could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

we are subject to taxes including income taxes resource taxes and royalties and nonincome based taxes in the united states canada china brazil and other countries where we operate changes in tax laws or regulations or their interpretation could result in higher taxes which could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

in 2018 us federal tax law changes took effect this was a significant change to the us tax system of taxation resulting in numerous areas open to interpretation given the newness and breadth of changes to the rules as a result risk exists related to developing interpretation and application of the new rules that could result in higher taxes which could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

we are subject to periodic audits by various levels of tax authorities in all countries where we have meaningful operations the due process audit and appeal practices and procedures of such authorities may vary significantly by jurisdiction may be unpredictable and unreliable in nature and may result in significant risk to us for various reasons some governments may issue significant reassessments on audit based positions not fully grounded in law or fact even though upon disputing the reassessments a great many are overturned on administrative appeal and through the court system certain systems involve tax litigation as a common practice in certain countries there are requirements to pay a reassessment even though the matter has not been finally decided by the tax administration or a court of law while the taxpayer has a wellsupported objection and appeals administratively or in court this may result in tying up significant funds andor creating adverse treasury and credit risks that may interrupt impede or otherwise materially affect our business operations 

our assets outside of north america are located in countries with volatile conditions which could subject us and our assets to significant risks 

we are a global business with substantial assets located outside of the united states and canada our operations in brazil china india and paraguay are a fundamental part of our business we have a majority interest in the joint venture entity operating the miski mayo mine in peru that supplies phosphate rock to us we also have a joint venture investment in mwspc which operates a mine and chemical complexes that produce phosphate fertilizers and other downstream products in the kingdom of saudi arabia volatile economic political and market conditions in these and other emerging market countries may have a negative impact on our operations operating results and financial condition in addition unfavorable changes in trade protection laws policies and measures or governmental actions and policies and other regulatory requirements affecting trade and the pricing and sourcing of our raw materials may also have a negative impact on our operations operating results and financial condition 

natural resource extraction is an important part of the economy in peru and in the past there have been protests against other natural resource operations in peru there remain numerous social conflicts that exist within the natural resource sector in peru as a result there is potential for active protests against natural resource companies if the government of peru’s proactive efforts to address the social and environmental issues surrounding natural resource activities are not successful protests could extend to or impact the miski mayo mine and adversely affect our interest in the miski mayo joint venture or the supply of phosphate rock to us from the mine 

adverse weather conditions including the impact of hurricanes and excess heat cold snow rainfall and drought have in the past and may in the future adversely affect our operations and result in increased costs decreased sales or production and potential liabilities 

adverse weather conditions including the impact of hurricanes and excess heat cold snow rainfall and drought have in the past and may in the future adversely affect our operations particularly our phosphates business in the past hurricanes have resulted in minor physical damage to our facilities in florida and louisiana 

additionally water treatment costs due to high water balances tend to increase significantly following excess rainfall from hurricanes or other adverse weather some of our florida and louisiana facilities have had or could have high water levels that may require treatment high water balances in the past at phosphate facilities in florida also led the florida department of environmental protection “ fdep ” to adopt rules requiring phosphate production facilities to meet more stringent process water management objectives for phosphogypsum management systems 

if additional excess rainfall or hurricanes occur in coming years our facilities may be required to take additional measures to manage process water to comply with existing or future requirements and these measures could potentially have a material effect on our business and financial condition 

adverse weather may also cause a loss of production due to disruptions in our supply chain or adversely affect delivery of our products to our customers for example oil refineries that supply sulfur to us may suspend operations as a result of a hurricane and incoming shipments of ammonia can be delayed disrupting production at our florida or louisiana facilities and delivery of our products 

excess rainfall and drought have in the past and may in the future adversely affect us for example we recently experienced the wettest year in north america in nearly 50 years which reduced fertilizer applications by farmers excess rainfall also resulted in higher river levels which adversely affected delivery of our products drought can reduce farmers’ crop yields and the uptake of phosphates and potash reducing the need for application of additional phosphates and potash for the next planting season drought can also lower river levels adversely affecting delivery of our products to our customers 

our operations are dependent on having the required permits and approvals from governmental authorities denial or delay by a government agency in issuing any of our permits and approvals or imposition of restrictive conditions on us with respect to these permits and approvals may impair our business and operations 

we hold numerous governmental environmental mining and other permits and approvals authorizing operations at each of our facilities our ability to continue operations at a facility could be materially affected by a government agency decision to deny or delay issuing a new or renewed permit or approval to revoke or substantially modify an existing permit or approval or to substantially change conditions applicable to a permit modification or by legal actions that successfully challenge our permits 

expanding our operations or extending operations into new areas is also predicated upon securing the necessary environmental or other permits or approvals we have been engaged in and over the next several years we and our subsidiaries will be continuing our efforts to obtain permits in support of anticipated operations at certain of our properties 

a denial of our permits the issuance of permits with costprohibitive conditions substantial delays in issuing key permits or legal actions that prevent us from relying on permits or revocation of permits could prevent us from mining at certain of our properties and thereby have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

for example   

 we have included additional discussion about permitting for our phosphate mines in florida under “environmental health safety and security matters—operating requirements and impacts—permitting” in our management’s analysis 

we are subject to financial assurance requirements as part of our routine business operations these financial assurance requirements affect our costs and increase our liquidity requirements if we were unable to satisfy applicable financial assurance requirements we might not be able to obtain or maintain permits we need to operate our business as we have in the past our need to comply with these requirements could materially affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

in many cases as a condition to obtaining or maintaining permits and approvals or otherwise we are required to comply with financial assurance requirements of governmental authorities the purpose of these requirements is to provide comfort to the government that sufficient funds will be available for the ultimate closure postclosure care or reclamation of our facilities 

in some cases we are able to comply through the satisfaction of applicable state financial strength tests but if we are unable to do so we must utilize alternative methods of complying with the financial assurance requirements or we would be 

prevented from continuing our mining operations and also could be subject to enforcement proceedings brought by relevant government agencies potential alternative methods of compliance include providing credit support in the form of cash escrows or trusts surety bonds from surety or insurance companies letters of credit from banks or other forms of financial instruments or collateral to satisfy the financial assurance requirements or negotiating a consent agreement that establishes a different form of financial assurance use of alternative means of financial assurance imposes additional expense on us some of them such as letters of credit also use a portion of our available liquidity other alternative means of financial assurance such as surety bonds may in some cases require collateral and generally require us to obtain a discharge of the bonds or to post additional collateral typically in the form of cash or letters of credit at the request of the issuer of the bonds collateral that is required may be in many forms including letters of credit or other financial instruments that utilize a portion of our available liquidity or in the form of assets such as real estate which reduces our flexibility to manage or sell assets 

for example 

 in the past we have also not always been able to satisfy applicable financial strength tests and in the future it is possible that we will not be able to pass the applicable financial strength tests negotiate or receive approval of consent decrees establish escrow or trust accounts or obtain letters of credit surety bonds or other financial instruments on acceptable terms and conditions or at a reasonable cost or that the form andor cost of compliance could increase which could materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

we have included additional discussion about financial assurance requirements under “off balance sheet arrangements and obligations—other commercial commitments” in our management’s analysis 

the discontinuation or replacement of libor may affect our financial condition and results of operations 

on july 27 2017 the united kingdom’s financial conduct authority announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit rates for calculation of the london interbank offered rate “ libor ” by the end of 2021 at this time we cannot predict the impact the discontinuation reform or replacement of libor may have on interest rates paid on our credit facility and other financial instruments and interest rate swaps as a result it is possible that these interest rate fluctuations could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

the other environmental health and safety regulations to which we are subject may also have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition to permitting and financial assurance requirements we are subject to numerous other environmental health and safety laws and regulations in the us canada china brazil and other countries where we operate these laws and regulations govern a wide range of matters including environmental controls land reclamation discharges to air and water and remediation of hazardous substance releases they significantly affect our operating activities as well as the level of our operating costs and capital expenditures in some international jurisdictions environmental laws change frequently and it may be difficult for us to determine if we are in compliance with all material environmental laws at any given time if we are not in compliance or the changes require new investment in our business our financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected 

we are and may in the future be involved in legal and regulatory proceedings that could be material to us these proceedings include “legacy” matters arising from activities of our predecessor companies and from facilities and businesses that we have never owned or operated 

we have in the past been are currently and in the future may be subject to legal and regulatory proceedings that could be material to our business results of operations liquidity or financial condition joint ventures in which we participate could also become subject to these sorts of proceedings these proceedings may be brought by the government or private parties and may arise out of a variety of matters including   

 the legal and regulatory proceedings to which we are currently or may in the future be subject can depending on the circumstances result in monetary damage awards fines penalties other liabilities injunctions or other court or administrative rulings that interrupt impede or otherwise materially affect our business operations andor criminal sanctions 

among other environmental laws the us comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act “ cercla ” imposes liability including for cleanup costs without regard to fault or to the legality of a party’s conduct on certain categories of persons including current and former owners and operators of a site and parties who are considered to have contributed to the release of “hazardous substances” into the environment under cercla or various us state analogues a party may under certain circumstances be required to bear more than its proportional share of cleanup costs at a site where it has liability if payments cannot be obtained from other responsible parties as a crop nutrient company producing and managing chemicals we periodically may incur liabilities and cleanup costs under cercla and other environmental laws with regard to our current or former facilities adjacent or nearby thirdparty facilities or offsite disposal locations 

pending and potential legal and regulatory proceedings may arise out of our present activities including operations at current facilities they may also arise out of past activities by us our predecessor companies and subsidiaries that our predecessors have sold these past activities were in some cases at facilities that we and our subsidiaries no longer own or operate and may have never owned or operated 

settlements of legal and regulatory matters frequently require court approval in the event a court were not to approve of a settlement it is possible that we and the other party or parties to the matter might not be able to settle it on terms that were acceptable to all parties or that we could be required to accept more stringent terms of settlement than required by the opposing parties 

we have included additional information with respect to pending legal and regulatory proceedings in note 24 of our notes to consolidated financial statements and in this report in part i item 3 “legal proceedings” 

these legal and regulatory proceedings involve inherent uncertainties and could negatively impact our business results of operations liquidity or financial condition 

the permitting financial assurance and other environmental health and safety laws and regulations to which we are subject may become more stringent over time this could increase the effects on us of these laws and regulations and the increased effects could be material 

continued government and public emphasis on environmental health and safety issues in the united states canada china brazil paraguay and other countries where we operate can be expected to result in requirements that apply to us and our operations that are more stringent than those that are described above and elsewhere in this report these more stringent requirements may include among other matters 

 among other matters in recent years there have been a number of initiatives relating to nutrient discharges new regulatory restrictions developed through these initiatives could have a material effect on either us or our customers for example the gulf coast ecosystem restoration task force established by executive order of the president and comprised of five gulf states and eleven federal agencies delivered a final strategy for longterm ecosystem restoration for the gulf coast in 2016 the strategy calls for among other matters reduction of the flow of excess nutrients into the gulf through state nutrient reduction frameworks new nutrient reduction approaches and reduction of agricultural and urban sources of excess nutrients implementation of the strategy will require legislative or regulatory action at the state level we cannot predict what the requirements of any such legislative or regulatory action could be or whether or how it would affect us or our customers 

in june 2015 epa and the us army corps of engineers the “ corps ” jointly issued a final rule that proposed to clarify but may actually expand the scope of waters regulated under the federal clean water act the final rule the “ 2015 clean water rule ” became effective in august 2015 but has been challenged through numerous lawsuits in october 2015 the us court of appeals for the sixth circuit issued an order staying the effectiveness of the final rule nationwide pending adjudication of substantive challenges to the rule in early 2017 the us president issued an executive order directing epa and the corps to publish a proposed rule rescinding or revising the new rule in june 2017 epa and the corps issued a proposed rule that would rescind the 2015 clean water rule and recodify regulatory text that existed prior to enactment of the 2015 clean water rule in november 2017 epa issued a rule notice proposing to extend the applicability date of the 2015 clean water rule for two years from the date of final action on the proposed rule to provide continuity and regulatory certainty while agencies proceed to consider potential changes to the 2015 clean water rule 

in january 2018 the us supreme court unanimously held all challenges to the 2015 clean water rule must be heard in federal district courts rather than in the federal courts of appeal overruling a decision by the sixth circuits court of appeals with the sixth circuit court of appeals no longer having jurisdiction that court lifted its 2015 nationwide stay in february 2018 after the nationwide stay was lifted a number of us district courts revived dormant litigation that challenged the 2015 clean water rule in june 2018 the us district court for the southern district of georgia entered an injunction 

against implementation of the 2015 clean water rule covering 11 states including florida as of september 2018 federal district courts have put the 2015 clean water rule on hold in 28 states the district of columbia and the us territories 

on december 11 2018 epa and the corps issued a proposed rule to replace the 2015 clean water rule the agencies’ stated interpretation for the proposed rule is to provide clarity predictability and consistency so that the regulated community can better understand where the clean water act applies and where it does not epa and the corps received over 600000 public comments on the proposed rule 

on september 12 2019 epa and the corps jointly issued a final regulation that repeals the 2015 clean water rule and restores the previous regulatory regime this regulation reestablishes national consistency by returning all jurisdictions to the longstanding regulatory framework that existed prior to the 2015 clean water rule the final rule takes effect sixty 60 days after publication in the federal register a challenge to this legislation is possible 

repeal of the 2015 clean water rule was the first step in a twostep rulemaking process to define the scope of “waters of the united states” that are regulated under the clean water act the second step is finalizing the regulation proposed in december 2018 that would define where federal jurisdiction begins and ends in accordance with the clean water act and supreme court precedent 

regulatory restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions and climate change regulations in the united states canada or elsewhere could adversely affect us and these effects could be material 

various governmental initiatives to limit greenhouse gas emissions are under way or under consideration around the world these initiatives could restrict our operating activities require us to make changes in our operating activities that would increase our operating costs reduce our efficiency or limit our output require us to make capital improvements to our facilities increase our energy raw material and transportation costs or limit their availability or otherwise adversely affect our results of operations liquidity or capital resources and these effects could be material to us 

governmental greenhouse gas emission initiatives include among others  the december 2015 agreement the “ paris agreement ” which was the outcome of the 21 st session of the conference of the parties under the united nations framework convention on climate change unfccc the paris agreement which was signed by nearly 200 nations including the united states and canada entered into force in late 2016 and sets out a goal of limiting the average rise in temperatures for this century to below 2 degrees celsius each signatory is expected to develop its own plan referred to as a nationally determined contribution or “ ndc ” for reaching that goal 

in may 2017 the united states president announced that the united states would withdraw from the paris agreement under article 28 of that agreement the earliest such a withdrawal could be effective is november 2020 in 2015 prior to this announcement the united states had submitted an ndc aiming to achieve by 2025 an economywide target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 2628 below its 2005 level the ndc also aims to use best efforts to reduce emissions by 28 the us target covers all greenhouse gases that were a part of the 2014 inventory of greenhouse gas emissions and sinks while it is unclear whether the us executive administration will proceed to withdraw from the paris agreement various legislative or regulatory initiatives relating to greenhouse gases have been adopted or considered by the us congress the epa or various states and those initiatives already adopted may be used to implement the us’s ndc additionally more stringent laws and regulations may be enacted to accomplish the goals set out in the ndc 

canada’s intended ndc aims to achieve by 2030 an economywide target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 30 below 2005 levels in late 2016 the federal government announced plans for a comprehensive tax on carbon emissions under which provinces opting out of the tax would have the option of adopting a capandtrade system in the plans the federal government also committed to implementing a federal carbon pricing backstop system that will apply in any province or territory that does not have a carbon pricing system in place by 2018 as of january 1 2019 a carbon tax of 20tonne now applies in canada for any emitter not covered under the federal backstop program or approved provincial program the carbon tax will increase to 30tonne on january 1 2020 in addition the province of saskatchewan in which our canadian potash mines are located has publicly stated that a carbon pricing system will not be implemented in the province and is currently pursuing legal action will be sought against the federal government in december 2017 saskatchewan announced a comprehensive plan to address climate change that does not include an economywide price on carbon but does include a system of tariffs and credits for large emitters the plan was reviewed and approved in part by the federal government in october 2018 our saskatchewan potash facilities will be subject to the saskatchewan climate change plan regarding emissions at our facilities however indirect costs from the carbon tax associated with electricity natural gas consumption and transportation are now being passed through to us as implementation of the paris agreement proceeds more stringent 

laws and regulations may be enacted to accomplish the goals set out in canadas ndc such as the clean fuel standard which is now under development in ottawa additionally during the 2019 election campaign the recently reelected liberal party of canada announced plans for net zero emissions by 2050 details of the canadian governments plan to achieve the netzero target will be released in coming months we will also continue to monitor developments relating to the legislation as well as the potential future effect on our operating activities energy raw material and transportation costs results of operations liquidity or capital resources 

it is possible that future legislation or regulation addressing climate change including in response to the paris agreement or any new international agreements could adversely affect our operating activities energy raw material and transportation costs results of operations liquidity or capital resources and these effects could be material or adversely impact our competitive advantage in addition to the extent climate change restrictions imposed in countries where our competitors operate such as china india former soviet union countries or morocco are less stringent than in the united states or canada our competitors could gain cost or other competitive advantages over us 

future climate change could adversely affect us 

the prospective impact of climate change on our operations and those of our customers and farmers remains uncertain scientists have hypothesized that the impacts of climate change could include changes in rainfall patterns water shortages changing sea levels changing storm patterns and intensities and changing temperature levels and that these changes could be severe these impacts could vary by geographic location severe climate change could impact our costs and operating activities the location and cost of global grain and oilseed production and the supply and demand for grains and oilseeds at the present time we cannot predict the prospective impact of climate change on our results of operations liquidity or capital resources or whether any such effects could be material to us 

some of our competitors and potential competitors have greater resources than we do which may place us at a competitive disadvantage and adversely affect our sales and profitability these competitors include stateowned and governmentsubsidized entities in other countries 

we compete with a number of producers throughout the world including stateowned and governmentsubsidized entities some of these entities may have greater total resources than we do and may be less dependent on earnings from crop nutrients sales than we are in addition some of these entities may have access to lower cost or governmentsubsidized natural gas supplies placing us at a competitive disadvantage furthermore certain governments as owners of some of our competitors may be willing to accept lower prices and profitability on their products in order to support domestic employment or other political or social goals to the extent other producers of crop nutrients enjoy competitive advantages or are willing to accept lower profit levels the price of our products our sales volumes and our profits may be adversely affected 

we do not own a controlling equity interest in our nonconsolidated companies some of which are foreign companies and therefore our operating results and cash flow may be materially affected by how the governing boards and majority owners operate such businesses there may also be limitations on monetary distributions from these companies that are outside of our control together these factors may lower our equity earnings or cash flow from such businesses and negatively impact our results of operations 

in 2013 we entered into an agreement to form mwspc a joint venture to develop a mine and chemical complexes for an estimated 80 billion that produces phosphate fertilizers and other downstream products in the kingdom of saudi arabia we have a 25 interest in the joint venture and expect our cash investment could be up to 840 million  approximately 770 million of which had been funded as of december 31 2018 the success of mwspc will depend on among other matters the completion of development and full commencement of operations of production facilities in the kingdom of saudi arabia the future success of current plans for completion of the development and for the operation of mwspc including the availability and affordability of necessary resources and materials and access to appropriate infrastructure and any future changes in those plans as well as the general economic and political stability of the region 

we also hold minority ownership interests in companies that are not controlled by us we expect that the operations and results of mwspc will be and the operations or results of some of the other companies are significant to us and their operations can affect our earnings because we do not control these companies either at the board or stockholder levels and because local laws in foreign jurisdictions and contractual obligations may place restrictions on monetary distributions by these companies we cannot ensure that these companies will operate efficiently or in the case of mwspc in compliance with the terms of any funding facility for which we may provide financial guarantees pay dividends or generally follow the desires of our management by virtue of our board or stockholder representation as a result these companies may contribute 

less than anticipated to our earnings and cash flow negatively impacting our results of operations and liquidity additionally in the case of mwspc we may be called upon to provide funds to satisfy mwspc’s debt obligations to the extent we provide financial guarantees in connection with its funding facilities 

strikes or other forms of work stoppage or slowdown could disrupt our business and lead to increased costs 

our financial performance is dependent on a reliable and productive work force a significant portion of our workforce and that of the joint ventures in which we participate is covered by collective bargaining agreements with unions unsuccessful contract negotiations or adverse labor relations could result in strikes or slowdowns any disruption may decrease our production and sales or impose additional costs to resolve disputes the risk of adverse labor relations may increase as our profitability increases because labor unions’ expectations and demands generally rise at those times 

accidents occurring in the course of our operating activities could result in significant liabilities interruptions or shutdowns of facilities or the need for significant safety or other expenditures 

we engage in mining and industrial activities that can result in serious accidents if our safety procedures are not effective or if an accident occurs we could be subject to liabilities arising out of property damage personal injuries or death our operations could be interrupted and we might have to shut down or abandon affected facilities accidents could cause us to expend significant amounts to remediate safety issues or to repair damaged facilities for example   

 the excavation of mines can result in potential seismic events or can increase the likelihood or potential severity of a seismic event the rise and fall of water levels such as those arising from the brine inflows and our remediation activities at our esterhazy mine can also result in or increase the likelihood or potential severity of a seismic event our esterhazy mine and southern louisiana facilities have experienced minor seismic events from time to time a significant seismic event at one of our facilities or mines could result in serious injuries or death or damage to or flooding operations or damage to adjoining properties or facilities of unrelated third parties in an extreme scenario seismic activity could cause us to disrupt our operations or change our mining process or abandon the mine   

 our underground potash shaft mines at esterhazy and colonsay saskatchewan carlsbad new mexico and taquarivassouras brazil are subject to risk from fire any failure of our safety procedures in the future could result in serious injuries or death or shutdowns which could result in significant liabilities andor impact on the financial performance of our potash and mosaic fertilizantes business including a possible material adverse effect on our results of operations liquidity or financial condition 

 we produce ammonia at our faustina louisiana phosphate concentrates plant use ammonia in significant quantities at all of our florida and louisiana phosphates concentrates plants and store ammonia at some of our distribution facilities for our florida phosphates concentrates plants ammonia is received at terminals in tampa and transported by pipelines to our facilities we also use ammonia in our brazil phosphate operations our ammonia is generally stored and transported at high pressures or cryogenically an accident could occur that could result in serious injuries or death or the evacuation of areas near an accident an accident could also result in property damage or the shutdown of our phosphates concentrates plants the ammonia terminals or pipelines serving those plants or our other ammonia storage and handling facilities as a result an accident involving ammonia could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations liquidity or financial condition   



we use sulfuric acid in the production of concentrated phosphates in our florida and louisiana us operations and our brazil operations some of our florida facilities produce fluorosilicic acid which is a hazardous chemical for resale to third parties we also use or produce other hazardous or volatile chemicals at some of our facilities an accident involving any of these chemicals could result in serious injuries or death or evacuation of areas near an accident an accident could also result in property damage or shutdown of our facilities or cause us to expend significant amounts to remediate safety issues or to repair damaged facilities as a result an accident involving any of these chemicals could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations liquidity or financial condition 

we use tailings sediments and water dams to manage residual materials generated by our brazilian mining operations if our safety procedures are not effective an accident involving these impoundments could result in serious injuries or death damage to property or the environment or result in the shutdown of our facilities any of which could materially adversely affect our results of operations in brazil 

mining and processing of potash and phosphate generate residual materials that must be managed both during the operation of the facility and upon facility closure potash tailings consisting primarily of salt and clay are stored in surface disposal sites phosphate clay residuals from mining in brazil are deposited in large tailing dams they are regularly monitored to evaluate structural stability and for leaks the failure of tailings dams and other impoundments at any of our brazilian mining operations could cause severe property and environmental damage and loss of life as a result we apply significant operational and financial resources and both internal and external technical resources towards operating those facilities safely 

we own and maintain 11 tailings dams in brazil in response to the new mining regulations we conducted inspections at all of our tailings dams in brazil under the new regulatory standards we had temporarily idled operations at four tailings dams and the three related mines at araxá tapira and catalão we resumed full mining operations at catalão in june 2019 and at tapira and araxá in september 2019 in addition we continue to augment our existing practices in an effort to reduce the risk of catastrophic failure and expect to bring all our tailings dams to be in compliance with brazilian safety requirements as part of our remediation efforts and in the ordinary course of business we plan to build and license new dams in brazil 

legislation at both brazilian federal and state levels has introduced new rules regarding tailings dam safety construction licensing and operations we cannot predict the full impact of these legislative or potentially related judicial actions or future actions or whether or how it would affect our brazilian operations or customers 

any accident involving our brazilian tailings or other dams or any shut down or idling of our related mines could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

deliberate malicious acts including cyber attacks and terrorism could damage our facilities disrupt our operations or injure employees contractors customers or the public and result in liability to us 

intentional acts of destruction could hinder our sales or production and disrupt our supply chain our facilities could be damaged or destroyed reducing our operational production capacity and requiring us to repair or replace our facilities at substantial cost employees contractors and the public could suffer substantial physical injury for which we could be liable governmental authorities may impose security or other requirements that could make our operations more difficult or costly the consequences of any such actions could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

we may be adversely affected by changing antitrust laws to which we are subject increases in crop nutrient prices can increase the scrutiny to which we are subject under these laws 

we are subject to antitrust and competition laws in various countries throughout the world we cannot predict how these laws or their interpretation administration and enforcement will change over time changes in antitrust laws globally or in their interpretation administration or enforcement may limit our existing or future operations and growth or the operations of canpotex which serves as an export association for our potash business in canada 

increases in crop nutrient prices have in the past resulted in increased scrutiny of the crop nutrient industry under antitrust and competition laws such price increases can increase the risk that these laws could be interpreted administered or enforced in a manner that could affect our operating practices or impose liability on us in a manner that could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

we may be adversely affected by other changes in laws resulting from increases in food and crop nutrient prices 

increases in prices for among other things food fuel and crop inputs including crop nutrients have in the past been the subject of significant discussion by various governmental bodies and officials throughout the world in response to increases 

it is possible that governments in one or more of the locations in which we operate or where we or our competitors sell our products could take actions that could adversely affect us such actions could include among other matters changes in governmental policies relating to agriculture and biofuels including changes in subsidy levels price controls tariffs windfall profits taxes or export or import taxes any such actions could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

our competitive position could be adversely affected if we are unable to participate in continuing industry consolidation 

most of our products are readily available from a number of competitors and price and other competition in the crop nutrient industry is intense in addition crop nutrient production facilities and distribution activities frequently benefit from economies of scale as a result particularly during pronounced cyclical troughs the crop nutrient industry has a long history of consolidation mosaic itself is the result of a number of industry consolidations we expect consolidation among crop nutrient producers could continue our competitive position could suffer to the extent we are not able to expand our own resources either through consolidations acquisitions joint ventures or partnerships in the future we may not be able to find suitable companies to combine with assets to purchase or joint venture or partnership opportunities to pursue even if we are able to locate desirable opportunities we may not be able to enter into transactions on economically acceptable terms if we do not successfully participate in continuing industry consolidation our ability to compete successfully could be adversely affected and result in the loss of customers or an uncompetitive cost structure which could adversely affect our sales and profitability 

our strategy for managing market and interest rate risk may not be effective 

our businesses are affected by fluctuations in market prices for our products the purchase price of natural gas ammonia and sulfur consumed in operations freight and shipping costs foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates we periodically enter into derivatives and forward purchase contracts to mitigate some of these risks however our strategy may not be successful in minimizing our exposure to these fluctuations see “market risk” in our management’s analysis and note 16 of our notes to consolidated financial statements that is incorporated by reference in this report in part ii item 8 

a shortage or unavailability of railcars tugs barges and ships for carrying our products and the raw materials we use in our business could result in customer dissatisfaction loss of production or sales and higher transportation or equipment costs 

we rely heavily upon truck rail tug barge and ocean freight transportation to obtain the raw materials we need and to deliver our products to our customers in addition the cost of transportation is an important part of the final sale price of our products finding affordable and dependable transportation is important in obtaining our raw materials and to supply our customers higher costs for these transportation services or an interruption or slowdown due to factors including high demand high fuel prices labor disputes layoffs or other factors affecting the availability of qualified transportation workers adverse weather or other environmental events or changes to rail barge or ocean freight systems could negatively affect our ability to produce our products or deliver them to our customers which could affect our performance and results of operations 

strong demand for grain and other products and a strong world economy increase the demand for and reduce the availability of transportation both domestically and internationally shortages of railcars barges and ocean transport for carrying product and increased transit time may result in customer dissatisfaction loss of sales and higher equipment and transportation costs in addition during periods when the shipping industry has a shortage of ships the substantial time needed to build new ships prevents rapid market response delays and missed shipments due to transportation shortages including vessels barges railcars and trucks could result in customer dissatisfaction or loss of sales potential which could negatively affect our performance and results of operations 

additionally we have agreed under our longterm cf ammonia supply agreement to purchase approximately 545000 to 725000 tonnes of ammonia per year during a term that may extend until december 31 2032 at a price to be determined by a formula based on the prevailing price of us natural gas we are obligated to provide for transportation of the ammonia under the agreement and if we fail to take the required minimum annual amount cf may elect to require us to make payment of liquidated damages or terminate the agreement payment of significant liquidated damages or an election by cf to terminate the agreement could adversely affect our business if the price of natural gas rises or the market price for ammonia falls outside of the range anticipated at execution of this agreement we may not realize a cost benefit from the natural gasbased pricing over the term of the agreement or the cost of our ammonia under the agreement could become a competitive disadvantage 

a lack of customers’ access to credit can adversely affect their ability to purchase our products 

some of our customers require access to credit to purchase our products a lack of available credit to customers in one or more countries due to global or local economic conditions or for other reasons could adversely affect demand for crop nutrients 

we extend trade credit to our customers and guarantee the financing that some of our customers use to purchase our products our results of operations may be adversely affected if these customers are unable to repay the trade credit from us or financing from their banks increases in prices for crop nutrient other agricultural inputs and grain may increase this risk 

we extend trade credit to our customers in the united states and throughout the world in some cases for extended periods of time in brazil where there are fewer thirdparty financing sources available to farmers we also have several programs under which we guarantee customers’ financing from financial institutions that they use to purchase our products as our exposure to longer trade credit extended throughout the world and use of guarantees in brazil increases we are increasingly exposed to the risk that some of our customers will not pay us or the amounts we have guaranteed additionally we become increasingly exposed to risk due to weather and crop growing conditions fluctuations in commodity prices or foreign currencies and other factors that influence the price supply and demand for agricultural commodities significant defaults by our customers could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

increases in prices for crop nutrients increase the dollar amount of our sales to customers the larger dollar value of our customers’ purchases may also lead them to request longer trade credit from us andor increase their need for us to guarantee their financing of our products either factor could increase the amount of our exposure to the risk that our customers may be unable to repay the trade credit from us or financing from their banks that we guarantee in addition increases in prices for other agricultural inputs and grain may increase the working capital requirements indebtedness and other liabilities of our customers increase the risk that they will default on the trade credit from us or their financing that we guarantee and decrease the likelihood that we will be able to collect from our customers in the event of their default 

provisions in our restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws and of delaware law may prevent or delay an acquisition of our company which could decrease the trading price of our common stock 

our restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that could have the effect of rendering more difficult or discouraging an acquisition deemed undesirable by our board of directors these provisions include the ability of our board of directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval a prohibition on stockholder action by written consent and the inability of our stockholders to request that our board of directors or chairman of our board call a special meeting of stockholders 

we are also subject to section 203 of the delaware general corporation law in general section 203 prohibits a publicly held delaware corporation from engaging in a “business combination” with an “interested stockholder” for a period of three years from the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder unless the interested stockholder attained this status with the approval of the board of directors or unless the business combination was approved in a prescribed manner a “business combination” includes mergers asset sales and other transactions resulting in a financial benefit to the interested stockholder subject to exceptions an “interested stockholder” is a person who together with affiliates and associates owns or within three years owned 15 or more of the corporation’s voting stock this statute could prohibit or delay the accomplishment of mergers or other takeover or change in control attempts with respect to us and accordingly may discourage attempts to acquire us 

these provisions apply not only when they may protect our stockholders from coercive or otherwise unfair takeover tactics but even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders and could delay or prevent an acquisition that our board of directors determines is in our best interests and those of our stockholders 

our success will continue to depend on our ability to attract and retain highly qualified and motivated employees 

we believe our continued success depends on the collective abilities and efforts of our employees like many businesses a significant number of our employees including some of our most highly skilled employees with specialized expertise in general corporate matters potash and phosphates operations will be approaching retirement age throughout the next decade and beyond in addition we compete for a talented workforce with other businesses particularly within the mining and chemicals industries in general and the crop nutrients industry in particular our expansion plans are highly dependent on our ability to attract retain and train highly qualified and motivated employees who are essential to the success of our ongoing 

operations as well as to our expansion plans if we were to be unsuccessful in attracting retaining and training the employees we require our ongoing operations and expansion plans could be materially and adversely affected 

future product or technological innovation could affect our business 

future product or technological innovations by third parties such as the development of seeds that require less crop nutrients the development of substitutes for our products or developments in the application of crop nutrients if they occur could have the potential to adversely affect the demand for our products and our results of operations liquidity and capital resources 

the success of our other strategic initiatives depends on our ability to effectively manage these initiatives and to successfully integrate and grow acquired businesses 

in addition to the acquisition we have other significant ongoing strategic initiatives including principally our plans to expand the annual production capacity of our potash business and mwspc these strategic initiatives involve capital and other expenditures of several billions of dollars over a number of years and require effective project management and in the case of strategic acquisitions successful integration to the extent the processes we or for the mwspc we together with our joint venture partners put in place to manage these initiatives or integrate and grow acquired businesses are not effective our capital expenditure and other costs may exceed our expectations or the benefits we expect from these initiatives might not be fully realized or both thereby resulting in adverse effects on our operating results and financial condition 

we may fail to fully realize the anticipated benefits and cost savings of our longterm cf ammonia supply agreement 

we use ammonia as a raw material in the production of our concentrated phosphate products under our longterm cf ammonia supply agreements we have agreed to purchase approximately 545000 to 725000 tonnes of ammonia per year during a term that may extend until december 31 2032 at a price to be determined by a formula based on the prevailing price of us natural gas 

the success of this agreement depends in part on our ability to realize cost savings from the agreement’s natural gas based pricing if the price of natural gas rises materially or the market price for ammonia falls outside of the range we currently anticipate over the term of the agreement we may not realize a cost benefit from the agreement or the cost of our ammonia under the agreement could be a competitive disadvantage over the past few years we paid considerably more for ammonia under the agreement than we would pay had we purchased it in the spot market in addition our ability to realize benefits and cost savings is subject to certain additional risks including whether cf successfully performs its obligations under the agreement over the life of its commitment and our ability to take delivery of the required minimum annual amount of ammonia over the life of our commitment 

cyber attacks could disrupt our operations and have a material adverse impact on our business 

as a global company we utilize and rely upon information technology systems in many aspects of our business including internal and external communications and the management of our accounting financial production and supply chain functions as we become more dependent on information technologies to conduct our operations and as the number and sophistication of cyber attacks increase the risks associated with cyber security increase these risks apply to us our employees and to third parties on whose systems we rely for the conduct of our business we have experienced cyber attacks but to our knowledge we have not experienced any material breaches of our technology systems failure to effectively anticipate prevent detect and recover from the increasing number and sophistication of cyber attacks could result in theft loss or misuse of or damage or modification of our information and cause disruptions or delays in our business reputational damage and thirdparty claims which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition

we are also subject to the following legal and environmental proceedings in addition to those described in note 24 of our consolidated financial statements included in this report 

waters of the united states   in june 2015 epa and the us army corps of engineers the “ corps ” jointly issued a final rule that proposed to clarify but may actually expand the scope of waters regulated under the federal clean water act the final rule the “ 2015 clean water rule ” became effective in august 2015 but has been challenged through numerous lawsuits in october 2015 the us court of appeals for the sixth circuit issued an order staying the effectiveness of the final rule nationwide pending adjudication of substantive challenges to the rule in early 2017 the us president issued an executive order directing epa and the corps to publish a proposed rule rescinding or revising the new rule in june 2017 epa and the corps issued a proposed rule that would rescind the 2015 clean water rule and recodify regulatory text that existed prior to enactment of the 2015 clean water rule in november 2017 epa issued a rule notice proposing to extend the applicability date of the 2015 clean water rule for two years from the date of final action on the proposed rule to provide continuity and regulatory certainty while agencies proceed to consider potential changes to the 2015 clean water rule 

in january 2018 the us supreme court unanimously held all challenges to the 2015 clean water rule must be heard in federal district courts rather than in the federal courts of appeal overruling a decision by the sixth circuits court of appeals with the sixth circuit court of appeals no longer having jurisdiction that court lifted its 2015 nationwide stay in february 2018 after the nationwide stay was lifted a number of us district courts revived dormant litigation that challenged the 2015 clean water rule in june 2018 the us district court for the southern district of georgia entered an injunction against implementation of the 2015 clean water rule covering 11 states including florida as of september 2018 federal district courts have put the 2015 clean water rule on hold in 28 states the district of columbia and the us territories 

on december 11 2018 epa and the corps issued a proposed rule to replace the 2015 clean water rule the agencies’ stated interpretation for the proposed rule is to provide clarity predictability and consistency so that the regulated community can better understand where the clean water act applies and where it does not 

on september 12 2019 epa and the corps jointly issued a final regulation that repeals the 2015 clean water rule and restores the previous regulatory regime this regulation reestablishes national consistency by returning all jurisdictions to the longstanding regulatory framework that existed prior to the 2015 clean water rule the final rule takes effect sixty 60 days after publication in the federal register a challenge to this legislation is possible 

repeal of the 2015 clean water rule was the first step in a twostep rulemaking process to define the scope of “waters of the united states” that are regulated under the clean water act the second step is finalizing the regulation proposed in december 2018 that would define where federal jurisdiction begins and ends in accordance with the clean water act and supreme court precedent

the mosaic company is a delaware corporation that was incorporated in march 2004 and serves as the parent company of the business that was formed through the october 2004 combination of imc global inc and the fertilizer businesses of cargill incorporated we are publicly traded on the new york stock exchange under the ticker symbol “mos” and are headquartered in plymouth minnesota 

we conduct our business through wholly and majorityowned subsidiaries as well as businesses in which we own less than a majority or a noncontrolling interest we are organized into three reportable business segments phosphates potash and international distribution intersegment eliminations marktomarket gainslosses on derivatives debt expenses streamsong resort ® results of operations and our legacy argentina and chile results are included within corporate eliminations and other following completion of the acquisition we expect to realign our reporting segments to reflect the changes in our operations as our business in brazil will no longer be strictly a distribution business our new segment will be called mosaic fertilizantes and will include the operations of brazil and paraguay the results of the miski mayo mine will be consolidated in our phosphates segment the results of our existing india and china distribution businesses will be reflected with corporate and other these changes will be effective in the first quarter of 2018 

the following charts show the respective contributions to 2017  sales volumes net sales and operating earnings for each of our business segments in effect at december 31 2017 

  

phosphates segment  — we are the largest integrated phosphate producer in the world and one of the largest producers and marketers of phosphatebased animal feed ingredients in north america we sell phosphatebased crop nutrients and animal 

feed ingredients throughout north america and internationally we account for approximately 14 of estimated global annual production and 74 of estimated north american annual production of concentrated phosphate crop nutrients 

potash segment —  we are one of the four largest potash producers in the world we sell potash throughout north america and internationally principally as fertilizer but also for use in industrial applications and to a lesser degree as animal feed ingredients we account for approximately 13 of estimated global annual potash production and 39 of estimated north american annual potash production 

international distribution segment —  this segment consists of sales offices crop nutrient blending and bagging facilities port terminals and warehouses in brazil paraguay india and china we also have a single superphosphate “ ssp ” plant in brazil that produces crop nutrients by mixing sulfuric acid with phosphate rock our international distribution segment serves as a distribution outlet for our phosphates and potash segments but also purchases and markets certain products from other suppliers generally to complement sales of our own product 

as used in this report   

 mosaic fertilizantes acquisition 

on january 8 2018 we completed our acquisition the “ acquisition ” of vale fertilizantes sa now known as mosaic fertilizantes pk sa which we also refer to as mosaic fertilizantes the aggregate consideration paid by mosaic at closing was 108 billion in cash after giving effect to certain adjustments based on matters such as the working capital of mosaic fertilizantes which were estimated at the time of closing and 34176574 shares of our common stock par value 001 per share the cash portion of the purchase price is subject to adjustment following closing to reflect actual balances at the time of closing the assets we acquired include five brazilian phosphate rock mines four chemical plants a potash mine in brazil an additional 40 economic interest in the miski mayo mine which increased our aggregate interest to 75 and a potash project in kronau saskatchewan 

cargill transaction 

in may 2011 cargill divested its interest in us in a splitoff to its stockholders and a debt exchange with certain cargill debt holders the agreements relating to the cargill transaction contemplated an orderly distribution of the approximately 64 2858 million of our shares that cargill formerly held we have included additional information about the cargill transaction in note 18  of our consolidated financial statements which information is incorporated herein by reference and certain of the principal transaction documents related to the cargill transaction are incorporated by reference as exhibits to this report 

business developments during 2017 

we took the following steps toward achieving our strategic priorities   



amount we have invested to date will approximate 840 million  we are contractually obligated to make future cash contributions of approximately 70 million we estimate the total cost to develop and construct the integrated phosphate production facilities to be approximately 80 billion  of which approximately 70 billion has been spent we expect the remaining amount to be funded through external debt facilities income from ammonia operations and remaining investments by the joint venture members 

 we have included additional information about these and other developments in our business during 2017  in our management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations “ management’s analysis ” and in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 

business segment information 

the discussion below of our business segment operations should be read in conjunction with the following information that we have included in this report   

 this information is incorporated by reference in this report in part ii item 8 “financial statements and supplementary data”   

phosphates segment 

our phosphates business segment owns and operates mines and production facilities in florida which produce concentrated phosphate crop nutrients and phosphatebased animal feed ingredients and processing plants in louisiana which produce concentrated phosphate crop nutrients 

us phosphate crop nutrients and animal feed ingredients 

our us phosphates operations have capacity to produce approximately 53 million tonnes of phosphoric acid “ p 2 o 5 ” per year or about 9 of world annual capacity and about 60 of north american annual capacity phosphoric acid is produced by reacting finely ground phosphate rock with sulfuric acid phosphoric acid is the key building block for the production of high analysis or concentrated phosphate crop nutrients and animal feed products and is the most comprehensive measure of phosphate capacity and production and a commonly used benchmark in our industry our us phosphoric acid production totaled approximately 44 million  tonnes during 2017  we account for approximately 10 of estimated global annual production and 58 of estimated north american annual output 

our phosphate crop nutrient products are marketed worldwide to crop nutrient manufacturers distributors retailers and farmers our principal phosphate crop nutrient products are   

 production of our animal feed ingredients products is located at our new wales florida facility we market our feed phosphate primarily under the leading brand names of biofos ®  and nexfos ®  

our primary phosphate crop nutrient production facilities are located in central florida and louisiana the following map shows the locations of each of our phosphate concentrates plants in the united states and the locations of each of our active and planned phosphate mines in florida other than ona as its reserves have been allocated to other active mines 

annual capacity by plant as of december 31 2017  and production volumes by plant for 2017  are listed below   



 



the phosphoric acid produced at uncle sam is shipped to faustina where it is used to produce dap map and microessentials ®  our faustina plant also manufactures ammonia that is mostly consumed in our concentrate plants 

we produced approximately 90 million tonnes of concentrated phosphate crop nutrients during 2017  and accounted for approximately 14 of estimated world annual output and 74 of estimated north american annual production 

phosphate rock 

phosphate rock is the key mineral used to produce phosphate crop nutrients and feed phosphate our phosphate rock production totaled approximately 150 million  tonnes in 2017  and accounted for approximately 7 of estimated world annual production and 54 of estimated north american annual production we are the world’s second largest miner of phosphate rock excluding china and currently operate four mines with a combined annual capacity of approximately 172 million  tonnes production of one tonne of dap requires between 16 and 17 tonnes of phosphate rock 

all of our wholly owned phosphate mines and related mining operations are located in central florida during 2017  we operated four active mines four corners south fort meade wingate and south pasture we plan to develop ona and desoto reserves to replace reserves that will be depleted at various times during the next decade 

the phosphate deposits of florida are of sedimentary origin and are part of a phosphatebearing province that extends from southern florida north along the atlantic coast into southern virginia our active phosphate mines are primarily located in what is known as the bone valley member of the peace river formation in the central florida phosphate district the southern portions of the four corners and wingate mines are in what is referred to as the undifferentiated peace river formation in which the ona and desoto reserves we plan to develop are also located phosphate mining has been conducted in the central florida phosphate district since the late 1800’s the potentially mineable portion of the district encompasses an area approximately 80 miles in length in a northsouth direction and approximately 40 miles in width 

we extract phosphate ore using large surface mining machines that we own called “draglines” prior to extracting the ore the draglines must first remove a 10 to 50 foot layer of sandy overburden at our wingate mine we also utilize dredges to remove the overburden and mine the ore we then process the ore at beneficiation plants that we own at each active mine where the ore goes through washing screening sizing and flotation processes designed to separate the phosphate rock from sands clays and other foreign materials   prior to commencing operations at any of our planned future mines we may need to acquire new draglines or move existing draglines to the mines and unless the beneficiation plant at an existing mine were used construct a beneficiation plant 

the following table shows for each of our phosphate mines annual capacity as of december 31 2017  and rock production volume and grade for the years 2017  2016  and 2015 

  



 



 reserves 

we estimate our phosphate rock reserves based upon exploration core drilling as well as technical and economic analyses to determine that reserves can be economically mined proven measured reserves are those resources of sufficient concentration to meet minimum physical chemical and economic criteria related to our current product standards and mining and production practices our estimates of probable indicated reserves are based on information similar to that used for proven reserves but sites for drilling are farther apart or are otherwise less adequately spaced than for proven reserves although the degree of assurance is high enough to assume continuity between such sites proven reserves are determined using a minimum drill hole spacing in two locations per 40 acre block probable reserves have less than two drill holes per 40 acre block but geological data provides a high degree of assurance that continuity exists between sites 

the following table sets forth our proven and probable phosphate reserves as of december 31 2017  



 

 we generally own the reserves shown for active mines in the table above with the only significant exceptions being further described below   



 in light of the longterm nature of our rights to our reserves we expect to be able to mine all reported reserves that are not currently owned prior to termination or expiration of our rights additional information regarding permitting is included in part i item 1a “risk factors” and under “environmental health safety and security matters—operating requirements and impacts—permitting” in our management’s analysis 

investments in joint ventures 

as of december 31 2017 we had a 35 economic interest in a joint venture which owns the miski mayo phosphate rock mine in the bayovar region of peru with the closing of the acquisition we acquired an additional 40 economic interest bringing our aggregate interest to 75 in 2018 our investment in the miski mayo mine and related commercial offtake supply agreement to purchase a share of the phosphate rock from the miski mayo mine allows us to supplement our internally produced rock to meet our overall fertilizer production needs the miski mayo mine’s annual production capacity is 39 million tonnes of which we have rights to market 75 effective with the closing of the acquisition 

we own a 25 interest in mwspc and in connection with our equity share we will market approximately 25 of the mwspc’s production mwspc is developing a mine and two chemical complexes that are presently expected to produce phosphate fertilizers and other downstream phosphates products in the kingdom of saudi arabia we currently estimate that the cost to develop and construct the integrated phosphate production facilities the “ project ” will approximate 80 billion  which we expect to be funded primarily through investments by us ma’aden and sabic and through borrowing arrangements and other external project financing facilities “ funding facilities ” we currently estimate that our cash investment in the project including the amount we have invested to date will approximate 840 million  our cash investment in the project at december 31 2017 and as of the date of this report was 770 million  we expect our future cash contributions to be approximately 70 million the greenfield project is being built in the northern region of saudi arabia at wa’ad al shamal minerals industrial city and includes further expansion of processing plants in ras al khair minerals industrial city which is located on the east coast of saudi arabia the facilities are expected to have a production capacity of approximately 30 million tonnes of finished product per year the project is expected to benefit from the availability of key raw nutrients from sources within saudi arabia ammonia operations commenced in late 2016 and precommissioning production of finished phosphate products began in 2017 

on june 30 2014 mwspc entered into funding facilities with a consortium of 20 financial institutions for a total amount of approximately 50 billion in january 2016 mwspc announced that it had received the approval of the saudi industrial development fund “ sidf ” for future funding facilities in the total amount of approximately 11 billion subject to the finalization of definitive agreements mwspc has entered into definitive agreements with sidf to draw up to 560 million  from the total sidfapproved amount the terms of the june 30 2014 funding facilities and the sidf funding facilities are further discussed in note 8  of our consolidated financial statements 

sulfur 

we use molten sulfur at our phosphates concentrates plants to produce sulfuric acid primarily for use in our production of phosphoric acid we purchased approximately 41 million long tons of sulfur during 2017  we purchase the majority of this sulfur from north american oil and natural gas refiners who are required to remove or recover sulfur during the refining process production of one tonne of dap requires approximately 040 long tons of sulfur we procure our sulfur from multiple sources and receive it by truck rail barge and vessel either direct to our phosphate plants or have it sent for 

gathering to terminals that are located on the us gulf coast in addition we use formed sulfur received through tampa ports which are delivered by truck to our new wales facility and melted through our sulfur melter 

we own and operate sulfur terminals in houston texas and riverview florida we also lease terminal space in tampa florida and galveston and beaumont texas we own or lease two oceangoing barges one oceangoing vessel and three tugs that transport molten sulfur from the texas terminals to tampa and then onward by truck to our florida phosphate plants in addition we own a 50 equity interest in gulf sulphur services ltd lllp “ gulf sulphur services ” which is operated by our joint venture partner gulf sulphur services has a sulfur transportation and terminaling business in the gulf of mexico and handles these functions for a substantial portion of our florida sulfur volume our sulfur logistic assets also include a large fleet of leased railcars that supplement our marine sulfur logistic system our louisiana operations are served by truck and barge from nearby refineries 

although sulfur is readily available from many different suppliers and can be transported to our phosphate facilities by a variety of means sulfur is an important raw material used in our business that has in the past been and may in the future be the subject of volatile pricing and availability alternative transportation and terminaling facilities might not have sufficient capacity to fully serve all of our facilities in the event of a disruption to current transportation or terminaling facilities changes in the price of sulfur or disruptions to sulfur transportation or terminaling facilities could have a material impact on our business we have included a discussion of sulfur prices in our management’s analysis 

ammonia 

we use ammonia together with phosphoric acid to produce dap map and microessentials ®  we consumed approximately 15 million tonnes of ammonia during 2017  production of one tonne of dap requires approximately 023 tonnes of ammonia we purchase approximately onethird of our ammonia from various suppliers in the spot market with the remaining twothirds either purchased through our ammonia supply agreement the “ cf ammonia supply agreement ” with an affiliate of cf industries inc “ cf ” or produced internally at our faustina louisiana location 

our florida ammonia needs are currently supplied under multiyear contracts with both domestic and offshore producers ammonia for our new wales and riverview plants is terminaled through an owned ammonia facility at port sutton florida ammonia for our bartow plant is terminaled through another ammonia facility owned and operated by a third party at port sutton florida pursuant to an agreement that provides for service through 2019 with automatic renewal for an additional twoyear period unless either party terminates as provided in the agreement ammonia is transported by pipeline from the terminals to our production facilities we have service agreements with the operators of the pipelines for bartow new wales and riverview which provide service through june 30 2018 with an annual autorenewal provision unless either party objects 

under the cf ammonia supply agreement mosaic agreed to purchase approximately 545000 to 725000 tonnes of ammonia per year during a term that commenced in 2017 and may extend until december 31 2032 at a price tied to the prevailing price of us natural gas for 2017 our minimum purchase obligation was approximately 410000 tonnes following our entry into a separate arrangement with cf under which we were deemed to have purchased approximately 135000 tonnes in exchange for providing ammonia storage space and use of related terminal facilities to cf during the second half of 2017 a specialized tug and barge unit began transporting ammonia for us between a load location at donaldsonville louisiana and a discharge location at tampa florida additional information about this chartered unit and its financing is provided in note 10 and note 16  of our consolidated financial statements we expect a majority of the ammonia purchased under the cf ammonia supply agreement to be received by barge at the port of tampa and delivered to our florida facilities as described in the preceding paragraph while the market prices of natural gas and ammonia have changed since we executed this agreement in 2013 and will continue to change we expect that the agreement will provide us a competitive advantage over its term including by providing a reliable longterm ammonia supply 

we produce ammonia at faustina louisiana primarily for our own consumption our annual capacity is approximately 455000 tonnes from time to time we sell surplus ammonia to unrelated parties andor may transport surplus ammonia to the port of tampa in addition under certain circumstances we are permitted to receive ammonia at faustina under the cf ammonia supply agreement 

although ammonia is readily available from many different suppliers and can be transported to our phosphates facilities by a variety of means ammonia is an important raw material used in our business that has in the past been and may in the future be the subject of volatile pricing and alternative transportation and terminaling facilities might not have sufficient capacity to 

fully serve all of our facilities in the event of a disruption to existing transportation or terminaling facilities changes in the price of ammonia or disruptions to ammonia transportation or terminaling could have a material impact on our business we have included a discussion of ammonia prices in our management’s analysis 

natural gas for phosphates 

natural gas is the primary raw material used to manufacture ammonia at our faustina facility ammonia is manufactured on site the majority of natural gas is purchased through firm delivery contracts based on published indexbased prices and is sourced from texas and louisiana via pipelines interconnected to the henry hub we use overthecounter swap andor option contracts to forward price portions of future gas purchases we typically purchase approximately 12 million mmbtu of natural gas per year for use in ammonia production at faustina 

our ammonia requirements for our florida operations are purchased rather than manufactured on site so while we typically purchase approximately two million mmbtu of natural gas per year in florida it is only used as a thermal fuel for various phosphate production processes 

florida land holdings 

we are a significant landowner in the state of florida which has in the past been considered one of the fastest areas of population growth in the united states we own land comprising over 290000 acres held in fee simple title in central florida and have the right to mine additional properties which contain phosphate rock reserves some of our land holdings are needed to operate our phosphates business while a portion of our land assets such as certain reclaimed properties are no longer required for our ongoing operations as a general matter more of our reclaimed property becomes available for uses other than for phosphate operations each year our real property assets are generally comprised of concentrates plants port facilities phosphate mines and other property which we have acquired through our presence in florida our longterm future land use strategy is to optimize the value of our land assets for example we developed streamsong resort ®  the “ resort ” a destination resort and conference center in an area of previously mined land as part of our longterm business strategy to maximize the value and utility of our extensive land holdings in florida in addition to the two golf courses and clubhouse that were opened in december 2012 the resort and conference center opened in january 2014 in 2015 in response to market demand we began construction of a third golf course and ancillary facilities which were completed and opened in 2017 

potash segment 

we are one of the leading potash producers in the world we mine and process potash in canada and the united states and sell potash in north america and internationally the term “potash” applies generally to the common salts of potassium muriate of potash “ mop ” is the primary source of potassium for the crop nutrient industry red mop has traces of iron oxide the granular and standard grade red mop products are well suited for direct fertilizer application and bulk blending white mop has a higher percent potassium oxide “ k 2 o ” white mop besides being well suited for the agricultural market is used in many industrial applications we also produce a double sulfate of potash magnesia product which we market under our brand name kmag ®  at our carlsbad new mexico facility 

our potash products are marketed worldwide to crop nutrient manufacturers distributors and retailers and are also used in the manufacturing of mixed crop nutrients and to a lesser extent in animal feed ingredients we also sell potash to customers for industrial use in addition our potash products are used for deicing and as a water softener regenerant 

in 2017  we operated three potash mines in canada including two shaft mines with a total of three production shafts and one solution mine as well as one potash shaft mine in the united states we also own related refineries at each of the mines 

we continue the expansion of capacity in our potash segment with the k3 shafts at our esterhazy mine from which we began mining potash ore in 2017 following rampup these shafts are expected to add an estimated 09 million tonnes to our annual potash operational capacity this will provide an infrastructure to move ore from k3 to the k1 and k2 mills giving us the flexibility to optimize production at k1 k2 and k3 in order to mitigate risk from current and future brine inflows 

it is possible that the costs of inflow remedial efforts at esterhazy may further increase in the future and that such an increase could be material or in the extreme scenario that the brine inflows risk to employees or remediation costs may increase to a level which would cause us to change our mining processes or abandon the mines see “key factors that can affect results of operations and financial condition” and “potash net sales and gross margin” in our management’s analysis and “our 

esterhazy mine has had an inflow of salt saturated brine for more than 30 years” in part i item 1a “risk factors” in this report which are incorporated herein by reference for a discussion of costs risks and other information relating to the brine inflows 

the map below shows the location of each of our potash mines 

  

our current potash annualized operational capacity totals 105 million  tonnes of product per year and accounts for approximately 13 of world annual capacity and 38 of north american annual capacity production during 2017  totaled 87 million  tonnes we account for approximately 13 of estimated world annual production and 39 of estimated north american annual production 

the following table shows for each of our potash mines annual capacity as of december 31 2017  and volume of mined ore average grade and finished product output for years 2017  2016  and 2015  



 

 canadian mines 

we operate three canadian potash facilities all located in the southern half of the province of saskatchewan including our solution mine at belle plaine two interconnected mine shafts at our esterhazy shaft mine and our shaft mine at colonsay 

extensive potash deposits are found in the southern half of the province of saskatchewan the potash ore is contained in a predominantly rock salt formation known as the prairie evaporites the prairie evaporites deposits are bounded by limestone formations and contain the potash beds three potash deposits of economic importance occur in saskatchewan the esterhazy belle plaine and patience lake members the patience lake member is mined at colonsay and the esterhazy member at esterhazy at belle plaine all three members are mined each of the major potash members contains several potash beds of different thicknesses and grades the particular beds mined at colonsay and esterhazy have a mining height of 11 and 8 feet respectively at belle plaine several beds of different thicknesses are mined 

our potash mines in canada produce mop exclusively esterhazy and colonsay utilize shaft mining while belle plaine utilizes solution mining technology traditional potash shaft mining takes place underground at depths of over 1000 meters where continuous mining machines cut out the ore face and load it onto conveyor belts the ore is then crushed moved to storage bins and hoisted to refineries above ground in contrast our solution mining process involves heated brine which is pumped through a “cluster” to dissolve the potash in the ore beds at a depth of approximately 1500 meters a cluster consists of a series of boreholes drilled into the potash ore a separate distribution center at each cluster controls the brine flow the solution containing dissolved potash and salt is pumped to a refinery where sodium chloride a coproduct of this process is separated from the potash through the use of evaporation and crystallization techniques concurrently the solution is pumped into a cooling pond where additional crystallization occurs and the resulting product is recovered via a floating dredge refined potash is dewatered dried and sized our canadian operations produce 13 different mop products including industrial grades many through proprietary processes 

our potash mineral rights in the province of saskatchewan consist of the following 



we believe that our mineral rights in saskatchewan are sufficient to support current operations for more than a century leases are generally renewable at our option for successive terms generally 21 years each except that certain of the acres shown above as “leased from others” are leased under longterm leases with terms including renewals at our option that expire from 2023 to 2170 

we pay canadian resource taxes consisting of the potash production tax and resource surcharge the potash production tax is a saskatchewan provincial tax on potash production and consists of a base payment and a profits tax we also pay a percentage of the value of resource sales from our saskatchewan mines in addition to the canadian resource taxes royalties are payable to the mineral owners in respect of potash reserves or production of potash we have included a further discussion of the canadian resource taxes and royalties in our management’s analysis 

since december 1985 we have effectively managed an inflow of salt saturated brine into our esterhazy mine at various times since then we have experienced changing amounts and patterns of brine inflows at esterhazy to date the brine inflow including our remediation efforts to control it has not had a material impact on our production processes or volumes the volume of the net brine inflow the rate of inflow less the amount we are pumping out of the mine or net outflow when we are pumping more brine out of the mine than the rate of inflow fluctuates and is dependent on a number of variables such as the location of the source of the inflow the magnitude of the inflow available pumping surface and underground brine storage capacities underground injection well capacities and the effectiveness of calcium chloride and cementatious grout used to reduce or prevent the inflows among other factors as a result of these brine inflows we incur expenditures certain of which have been capitalized and others that have been charged to expense in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 

it is possible that the costs of remedial efforts at esterhazy may further increase in the future and that such an increase could be material or in the extreme scenario that the brine inflows risk to employees or remediation costs may increase to a level which would cause us to change our mining processes or abandon the mine see “key factors that can affect results of operations and financial condition” and “potash net sales and gross margin” in our management’s analysis and “our esterhazy mine has had an inflow of salt saturated brine for more than 30 years” in part i item 1a “risk factors” in this report which are incorporated herein by reference for a discussion of costs risks and other information relating to the brine inflows the k3 shafts at our esterhazy mine are part of our potash expansion plan which is also designed to mitigate risk from current and future inflows 

due to the ongoing brine inflow at esterhazy subject to exceptions that are limited in scope and amount we are unable to obtain insurance coverage for underground operations for water incursion problems like other potash producers’ shaft mines our colonsay saskatchewan and carlsbad new mexico mines are also subject to the risks of inflow of water as a result of their shaft mining operations but water inflow risks at these mines are included in our insurance coverage subject to deductibles limited coverage terms and lower sublimits negotiated with our insurers 

united states mine 

in the united states we have a shaft mine located in carlsbad new mexico the ore reserves at our carlsbad mine are made up of langbeinite a double sulfate of potassium and magnesium this type of potash reserve occurs in a predominantly rock salt formation known as the salado formation the mcnutt member of this formation consists of eleven units of economic importance of which we currently mine one the mcnutt member’s evaporite deposits are interlayered with anhydrite polyhalite potassium salts clay and minor amounts of sandstone and siltstone 

continuous underground mining methods are utilized to extract the ore drum type mining machines are used to cut the langbeinite ore from the face mined ore is then loaded onto conveyors transported to storage areas and then hoisted to the surface for further processing at our refinery 

we produce a double sulfate of potash magnesia product which we market under our brand name kmag ®  at our carlsbad facility 

at the carlsbad facility we mine and refine potash from 77141 acres of mineral rights we control these reserves pursuant to either i leases from the us government that in general continue in effect at our option subject to readjustment by the us government every 20 years or ii leases from the state of new mexico that continue as long as we continue to produce from them these reserves contain an estimated total of 158 million tonnes of potash mineralization calculated after estimated extraction losses in one mining bed evaluated at thicknesses ranging from 65 feet to 10 feet at average refinery rates these ore reserves are estimated to be sufficient to yield 272 million tonnes of langbeinite concentrates with an average grade of approximately 22 k 2 o at projected rates of production we estimate that carlsbad’s reserves of langbeinite are sufficient to support operations for approximately 466 years 

royalties for the us operations amounted to approximately 64 million in 2017  these royalties are established by the us department of the interior bureau of land management in the case of the carlsbad leases from the us government and pursuant to provisions set forth in the leases in the case of the carlsbad state leases 

reserves 

our estimates below of our potash reserves and nonreserve potash mineralization are based on exploration drill hole data seismic data and actual mining results over more than 35 years proven reserves are estimated by identifying material in place that is delineated on at least two sides and material in place within a halfmile radius or distance from an existing sampled mine entry or exploration core hole probable reserves are estimated by identifying material in place within a one mile radius from an existing sampled mine entry or exploration core hole historical extraction ratios from the many years of mining results are then applied to both types of material to estimate the proven and probable reserves we believe that all reserves and nonreserve potash mineralization reported below are potentially recoverable using existing production shaft and refinery locations 

our estimated recoverable potash ore reserves and nonreserve potash mineralization as of december 31 2017  for each of our mines are as follows 



 



as discussed more fully above we either own the reserves and mineralization shown above or lease them pursuant to mineral leases that generally remain in effect or are renewable at our option or are longterm leases accordingly we expect to be able to mine all reported reserves that are leased prior to termination or expiration of the existing leases 

natural gas 

natural gas is used at our belle plaine solution mine as a fuel to produce steam and to dry potash products the steam is used to generate electricity and provide thermal energy to the evaporation crystallization and solution mining processes the belle plaine solution mine typically accounts for approximately 78 of our potash segment’s total natural gas requirements for potash production at our shaft mines natural gas is used as a fuel to heat fresh air supplied to the shaft mines and for drying potash products combined natural gas usage for both the solution and shaft mines totaled 16 million mmbtu during 2017  we purchase our natural gas requirements on firm delivery index pricebased physical contracts and on short term spotpriced physical contracts our canadian operations purchase all of their physical gas in saskatchewan using aeco price indices references and transport the gas to our plants via the transgas pipeline system the us potash operation in new mexico purchases physical gas in the southwest respective regional market using the transwestern el paso permian basin market pricing reference we use financial derivative contracts to manage the pricing on portions of our natural gas requirements 

international distribution segment 

our international distribution segment markets phosphate potash and nitrogenbased crop nutrients and animal feed ingredients and provides other ancillary services to wholesalers cooperatives independent retailers and farmers in south america and the asiapacific regions in 2017  our international distribution segment purchased 21 million tonnes of phosphatebased products from our phosphates segment and 27 million tonnes of potash products from our potash segment and canpotex our international distribution operations also purchase phosphates potash and nitrogen products from unrelated third parties which we either use to produce blended crop nutrients “ blends ” or for resale our international distribution segment provides our phosphates and potash segments access to key markets outside of north america 

our international distribution segment’s production facilities include blending plants and an ssp plant that produces crop nutrients by mixing sulfuric acid with phosphate rock a blending plant combines several crop nutrient products to make a mixture tailored to specific crop requirements we lease various warehouses depending on sales and production levels 

the following maps show the locations of our primary international distribution segment operations in south america and asia 

     

  

international distribution  south america operations 

we are one of the largest producers and distributors of blended crop nutrients for agricultural use in brazil we own and operate twelve blending plants in brazil and one blending plant and port in paraguay in addition we lease several other 

warehouses and blending units depending on sales and production levels we also have a 62 ownership interest in fospar sa “ fospar ” fospar owns and operates an ssp granulation plant and a deepwater crop nutrition port and throughput warehouse terminal facility in paranagua brazil together these plants provide the capability to annually distribute approximately 60 million tonnes of crop nutrients in brazil and paraguay the port facility at paranagua handles approximately 26 million tonnes of imported crop nutrients in 2017 we sold approximately 60 million tonnes of crop nutrient products in south america 

in 2015 we completed the integration of our december 2014 purchase of adm’s fertilizer distribution business in brazil and paraguay in connection with the acquisition we also negotiated the terms of fiveyear fertilizer supply agreements whereby we supply adm’s fertilizer needs in brazil and paraguay 

on january 8 2018 we completed the acquisition following the acquisition mosaic is the leading fertilizer production and distribution company in brazil as the acquisition increased our finished phosphates capacity by over four million tonnes and our finished potash capacity by approximately 500000 tonnes additional information about the acquisition is provided in note 23 to our consolidated financial statements 

  international distribution  asiapacific operations 

in china we own two 300000tonne per year capacity blending plants in 2016 we sold our 35 interest in a joint venture of a dap production plant in 2017  we sold approximately 196000 tonnes of blends and distributed another 419000 tonnes of phosphate and potash crop nutrients in china 

in india we have distribution facilities to import and sell crop nutrients in 2017  we distributed approximately 731000 tonnes of phosphate and potash crop nutrient products in india we also serve as a marketing agent for our phosphates segment 

sales and distribution activities 

united states and canada 

we have a united states and canada sales and marketing team that serves our business segments we sell to wholesale distributors retail chains cooperatives independent retailers and national accounts 

customer service and the ability to effectively minimize the overall supply chain costs are key competitive factors in the crop nutrient and animal feed ingredients businesses in addition to our production facilities to service the needs of our customers we own lease or have contractual throughput or other arrangements at strategically located distribution warehouses along or near the mississippi and ohio rivers as well as in other key agricultural regions of the united states and canada from these facilities we distribute mosaicproduced phosphate and potash products for customers who in turn resell the product into the distribution channel or directly to farmers in the united states and canada 

we own port facilities in tampa florida and houston texas which have deep water berth capabilities providing access to the gulf of mexico we discontinued operations at the houston texas facility in 2017 and expect to sell the facility in 2018 we also own warehouse distribution facilities in savage minnesota pekin illinois and henderson kentucky 

in addition to the geographically situated facilities that we own our us distribution operations also include leased distribution space or contractual throughput agreements in other key geographical areas such as california florida illinois indiana iowa kentucky louisiana minnesota missouri nebraska north dakota ohio oklahoma texas and wisconsin 

our canadian customers include independent dealers and national accounts we also lease and own warehouse facilities in saskatchewan ontario quebec and manitoba in canada 

international 

outside of the united states and canada we market our phosphates segment’s products through our international distribution segment as well as a salesforce focused on geographies outside of north america the countries that account for the largest amount of our phosphates sales outside the united states by volume are brazil canada india australia and mexico 

our sales outside of the united states and canada of saskatchewan potash products are made through canpotex canpotex sales are allocated between its members based on peaking capacity effective july 1 2017 our share of canpotex sales decreased to 362 from 381 as canpotex’s other member demonstrated a change in capacity 

our potash exports from carlsbad are sold through our own sales force we also market our potash segment’s products through our international distribution segment which acquires potash primarily through canpotex the countries that account for the largest amount of international potash sales by volume are brazil china indonesia india and malaysia 

to service the needs of our customers our international distribution segment includes a network of strategically located sales offices crop nutrient blending and bagging facilities port terminals and warehouse distribution facilities that we own and operate in key geographic areas throughout several countries the blending and bagging facilities primarily produce blends from phosphate potash and nitrogen the average product mix in our blends by volume contains approximately 50 phosphate 35 potash and 15 nitrogen although this mix differs based on seasonal and other factors our international distribution segment’s operations serve primarily as a sales outlet for our north american phosphates production both for resale and as an input for blends our potash segment also has historically furnished the majority of the raw materials needs for the production of blends primarily via canpotex and is expected to continue to do so in the future 

other products 

with a strong brand position in a multibillion dollar animal feed ingredients global market our phosphates segment supplies animal feed ingredients for poultry and livestock to customers in north america latin america and asia our potash sales to nonagricultural users are primarily to large industrial accounts and the animal feed industry additionally we sell potash for deicing and as a water softener regenerant as well as fluorosilicic acid for water fluoridation 

competition 

because crop nutrients are global commodities available from numerous sources crop nutrition companies compete primarily on the basis of delivered price other competitive factors include product quality cost and availability of raw materials customer service plant efficiency and availability of product as a result markets for our products are highly competitive we compete with a broad range of domestic and international producers including farmer cooperatives subsidiaries of larger companies and independent crop nutrient companies foreign competitors often have access to cheaper raw materials are required to comply with less stringent regulatory requirements or are owned or subsidized by governments and as a result may have cost advantages over north american companies we believe that our extensive north american and international production and distribution system provides us with a competitive advantage by allowing us to achieve economies of scale transportation and storage efficiencies and obtain market intelligence also we believe our premium products provide us a competitive advantage with customers in north and south america 

unlike many of our competitors we have our own distribution system to sell phosphate and potashbased crop nutrients and animal feed ingredients whether produced by us or by other third parties around the globe in north america we have one of the largest and most strategically located distribution systems for crop nutrients including warehouse facilities in key agricultural regions we also have an extensive network of distribution facilities internationally including in the key growth regions of south america and asia with port terminals warehouses and blending plants in brazil paraguay china and india our global presence allows us to efficiently serve customers in approximately 40 countries 

phosphates segment 

our phosphates segment operates in a highly competitive global market among the competitors in the global phosphate industry are domestic and foreign companies as well as foreign governmentsupported producers in asia and north africa phosphate producers compete primarily based on price as well as product quality service and innovation major integrated producers of feed phosphates are located in the united states europe and china many smaller producers are located in emerging markets around the world many of these smaller producers are not miners of phosphate rock or manufacturers of phosphoric acid and are required to purchase this material on the open market 

we believe that we are a lowcost integrated producer of phosphatebased crop nutrients due in part to our scale vertical integration and strategic network of production and distribution facilities as the world’s largest producer of concentrated phosphates as well as the second largest miner of phosphate rock in the world and the largest in the united states we maintain an advantage over some competitors as the scale of operations effectively reduces production costs per unit we are also vertically integrated to captively supply one of our key inputs phosphate rock to our phosphate production facilities we 

believe that our position as an integrated producer of phosphate rock provides us with a significant cost advantage over competitors that are nonintegrated phosphate producers our investment in the miski mayo mine and related commercial offtake supply agreement to purchase a share of the phosphate rock allows us to supplement our overall phosphate rock needs in addition we expect that mwspc will enable us to not only further diversify our sources of phosphates but also improve our access to key agricultural countries in asia and the middle east 

we produce ammonia at our faustina louisiana concentrates plant in quantities sufficient to meet approximately one quarter of our total ammonia needs with no captive ammonia production supplying all our florida operations we are subject to significant volatility in our purchase price of ammonia from world markets the cf ammonia supply agreement is expected to provide us with a longterm supply of a substantial volume of ammonia at prices based on the price of natural gas and is intended to lessen this volatility 

with our dedicated sulfur transportation barges and tugs and our 50 ownership interest in gulf sulphur services we are also wellpositioned to source an adequate flexible and costeffective supply of sulfur our third key input we believe that our investments in sulfur assets continue to afford us a competitive advantage compared to other producers in cost and access to sulfur 

with facilities in both central florida and louisiana we are logistically well positioned to fulfill our needs at very competitive prices those multiple production points also afford us the flexibility to optimally balance supply and demand 

potash segment 

potash is a commodity available from several geographical regions around the world and consequently the market is highly competitive through our participation in canpotex we compete outside of north america against various independent and stateowned potash producers canpotex has substantial expertise and logistical resources for the international distribution of potash including strategically located export assets in portland oregon st john new brunswick and vancouver british columbia our principal methods of competition with respect to the sale of potash include product pricing and offering consistent highquality products and superior service we believe that our potash cost structure is competitive in the industry and should improve as we continue to complete our potash expansion projects 

international distribution segment 

our international distribution segment generally operates in highly competitive business environments in each of its markets competing with local businesses and with products that are available from many other sources we believe that our international distribution segment’s vertical integration with our own production businesses as well as our focus on product innovation and customer solutions position us with an advantage over many of our competitors we have a strong brand in the countries in which we have international distribution activities in addition to having access to our own production our international distribution activities have the capability to supply a wide variety of crop nutrients to our dealerfarmer customer base our strategic positions in brazil paraguay china and india allow us to capitalize on the nutrient demand in these large and growing international regions 

factors affecting demand 

our results of operations historically have reflected the effects of several external factors which are beyond our control and have in the past produced significant downward and upward swings in operating results revenues are highly dependent upon conditions in the agriculture industry and can be affected by among other factors crop conditions changes in agricultural production practices worldwide economic conditions including the increasing world population household incomes and demand for more proteinrich food particularly in developing regions such as china india and latin america changing demand for biofuels variability in commodity pricing governmental policies the level of inventories in the crop nutrient distribution channels customer expectations about farmer economics future crop nutrient prices and availability and transportation costs among other matters market trends in raw material costs market prices for crop nutrients and weather furthermore our crop nutrients business is seasonal to the extent farmers and agricultural enterprises in the markets in which we compete purchase more crop nutrient products during the spring and fall the international scope of our business spanning the northern and southern hemispheres reduces to some extent the seasonal impact on our business the degree of seasonality of our business can change significantly from year to year due to conditions in the agricultural industry and other factors the seasonal nature of our businesses requires significant working capital for inventory in advance of the planting seasons 

we sell products throughout the world unfavorable changes in trade protection laws policies and measures government policies and other regulatory requirements affecting trade unexpected changes in tax and trade treaties strengthening or weakening of foreign economies as well as political relations with the united states may cause sales trends to customers in one or more foreign countries to differ from sales trends in the united states 

our international operations are subject to risks from changes in foreign currencies or government policy which can affect local farmer economics 

other matters 

employees 

we had approximately 8500 employees as of december 31 2017  consisting of approximately 3500 salaried and 5000 hourly employees we added approximately 7300 employees on january 8 2018 as a result of closing the acquisition for a total of approximately 15800 global employees 

labor relations 

as of december 31 2017    

 failure to renew any of our union agreements could result in a strike or labor stoppage that could have a material adverse effect on our operations however we have not experienced significant work stoppage in many years and historically have had good labor relations

 item 1a risk factors 

our business financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of the risks and uncertainties described below 

our esterhazy mine has had an inflow of salt saturated brine for more than 30 years 

since december 1985 we have had inflows of salt saturated brine into our esterhazy saskatchewan mine over the past century several potash mines experiencing water inflow problems have flooded in order to control brine inflows at esterhazy we have incurred and will continue to incur expenditures certain of which due to their nature have been capitalized while others have been charged to expense 

at various times we experience changing amounts and patterns of brine inflows at the esterhazy mine periodically some of these inflows have exceeded available pumping capacity if that were to continue for several months without abatement it could exceed our available storage capacity and ability to effectively manage the brine inflow this could adversely affect production at the esterhazy mine the brine inflow is variable resulting in both net inflows the rate of inflow is more than the amount we are pumping out of the mine and net outflows when we are pumping more brine out of the mine than the rate of inflow there can be no assurance that   



 from time to time new or improved technology becomes available to facilitate our remediation of the inflows such as when horizontal drilling techniques were developed and refined taking advantage of these new or improved technologies may require significant capital expenditures andor may increase our costs of remediation 

it is possible that the costs of remedial efforts at esterhazy may further increase in the future and that such an increase could be material or in the extreme scenario that the brine inflows risk to employees or remediation costs may increase to a level which would cause us to change our mining processes or abandon the mines see “key factors that can affect results of operations and financial condition” and “potash net sales and gross margin” in our management’s analysis which is incorporated herein by reference for a discussion of costs risks and other information relating to the brine inflows 

due to the ongoing brine inflow at esterhazy subject to exceptions that are limited in scope and amount we are unable to obtain insurance coverage for underground operations for water incursion problems our mines at colonsay saskatchewan and carlsbad new mexico are also subject to the risks of inflow of water as a result of our shaft mining operations 

our operating results are highly dependent upon and fluctuate based upon business and economic conditions and governmental policies affecting the agricultural industry where we or our customers operate these factors are outside of our control and may significantly affect our profitability 

our operating results are highly dependent upon business and economic conditions and governmental policies affecting the agricultural industry which we cannot control the agricultural products business can be affected by a number of factors the most important of these factors for us markets are   

 international market conditions which are also outside of our control may also significantly influence our operating results the international market for crop nutrients is influenced by such factors as the relative value of the us dollar and its impact upon the cost of importing crop nutrients foreign agricultural policies including subsidy policies the existence of or changes in import or foreign currency exchange barriers in certain foreign markets changes in the hard currency demands of certain countries and other regulatory policies of foreign governments as well as the laws and policies of the united states affecting foreign trade and investment 

our most important products are global commodities and we face intense global competition from other crop nutrient producers that can affect our prices and volumes 

our most important products are concentrated phosphate crop nutrients including diammonium phosphate or dap monoammonium phosphate or map microessentials ®  and muriate of potash or mop we sell most of our dap map and mop in the form of global commodities our sales of these products face intense global competition from other crop nutrient producers 

changes in competitors’ production or shifts in their marketing focus have in the past significantly affected both the prices at which we sell our products and the volumes that we sell and are likely to continue to do so in the future 

competitors are more likely to increase their production at times when world agricultural and crop nutrient markets are strong and to focus on sales into regions where their returns are highest increases in the global supply of dap map and mop or competitors’ increased sales into regions in which we have significant sales could adversely affect our prices and volumes 

competitors and potential new entrants in the markets for both concentrated phosphate crop nutrients and potash have in recent years expanded capacity or begun or announced plans to expand capacity or build new facilities the extent to which current global or local economic and financial conditions changes in global or local economic and financial conditions or other factors may cause delays or cancellation of some of these ongoing or planned projects or result in the acceleration of existing or new projects is unclear in addition the level of exports by producers of concentrated phosphate crop nutrients in china depends to a significant extent on chinese government actions to curb exports through among other measures prohibitive export taxes at times when the government believes it desirable to assure ample domestic supplies of concentrated phosphate crop nutrients to stimulate grain and oilseed production 

in addition the other member of canpotex is among our competitors who are expanding their potash production capacity canpotex members’ respective shares of canpotex sales is based upon the members’ respective proven peaking capacity for producing potash when a canpotex member expands its production capacity the new capacity is added to that member’s proven peaking capacity based on a proving run at the maximum production level alternatively after january 2017 canpotex members may elect to rely on an independent engineering firm and approved protocols to calculate their proven peaking capacity antitrust and competition laws prohibit the members of canpotex from coordinating their production decisions including the timing of their respective proving runs worldwide potash production levels during these proving runs could exceed thencurrent market demand resulting in an oversupply of potash and lower potash prices 

we cannot accurately predict when or whether competitors’ or new entrants’ ongoing or planned capacity expansions or new facilities will be completed the timing of competitors’ tests to prove peaking capacity for canpotex purposes the cumulative effect of these and recently completed expansions the impact of future decisions by the chinese government on the level of chinese exports of concentrated phosphate crop nutrients or the effects of these or other actions by our competitors on the prices for our products or the volumes that we will be able to sell 

our crop nutrients and other products are subject to price and demand volatility resulting from periodic imbalances of supply and demand which may cause our results of operations to fluctuate 

historically the market for crop nutrients has been cyclical and prices and demand for our products have fluctuated to a significant extent particularly for phosphates and to a lesser extent potash periods of high demand increasing profits and high capacity utilization tend to lead to new plant investment and increased production this growth increases supply until the market is oversaturated leading to declining prices and declining capacity utilization until the cycle repeats 

as a result crop nutrient prices and volumes have been volatile this price and volume volatility may cause our results of operations to fluctuate and potentially deteriorate the price at which we sell our crop nutrient products and our sales volumes could fall in the event of industry oversupply conditions which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations in contrast high prices may lead our customers and farmers to delay purchasing decisions in anticipation of future lower prices thus impacting our sales volumes 

due to reduced market demand depressed agricultural economic conditions and other factors we and our predecessors have at various times suspended or reduced production at some of our facilities the extent to which we utilize available capacity at our facilities will cause fluctuations in our results of operations as we will incur costs for any temporary or indefinite shutdowns of our facilities and lower sales tend to lead to higher fixed costs as a percentage of sales 

variations in crop nutrient application rates may exacerbate the cyclicality of the crop nutrient markets 

farmers are able to maximize their economic return by applying optimum amounts of crop nutrients farmers’ decisions about the application rate for each crop nutrient or to forego application of a crop nutrient particularly phosphate and potash vary from year to year depending on a number of factors including among others crop prices crop nutrient and other crop input costs or the level of the crop nutrient remaining in the soil following the previous harvest farmers are more likely to increase application rates when crop prices are relatively high crop nutrient and other crop input costs are relatively low and the level of the crop nutrient remaining in the soil is relatively low conversely farmers are likely to reduce or forego application when farm economics are weak or declining or the level of the crop nutrients remaining in the soil is relatively high this variability in application rates can materially accentuate the cyclicality in prices for our products and our sales volumes 

our crop nutrient business is seasonal which may result in carrying significant amounts of inventory and seasonal variations in working capital and our inability to predict future seasonal crop nutrient demand accurately may result in excess inventory or product shortages 

the crop nutrient business is seasonal farmers tend to apply crop nutrients during two short application periods the strongest one in the spring before planting and the other in the fall after harvest as a result the strongest demand for our products typically occurs during the spring planting season with a second period of strong demand following the fall harvest in contrast we and other crop nutrient producers generally produce our products throughout the year as a result we andor our customers generally build inventories during the low demand periods of the year in order to ensure timely product availability during the peak sales seasons the seasonality of crop nutrient demand results in our sales volumes and net sales typically being the highest during the north american spring season and our working capital requirements typically being the highest just prior to the start of the spring season our quarterly financial results can vary significantly from one year to the next due to weatherrelated shifts in planting schedules and purchasing patterns 

if seasonal demand exceeds our projections we will not have enough product and our customers may acquire products from our competitors which would negatively impact our profitability if seasonal demand is less than we expect we will be left with excess inventory and higher working capital and liquidity requirements the degree of seasonality of our business can change significantly from year to year due to conditions in the agricultural industry and other factors 

the distribution channels for crop nutrients have capacity to build significant levels of inventories which can adversely affect our sales volumes and selling prices 

in order to balance the production needs of crop nutrient producers with farmers’ seasonal use of crop nutrients crop nutrient distribution channels need to have the capacity to build significant inventories the buildup of inventories in the distribution channels can become excessive particularly during the cyclical periods of low demand that have been typical in the crop nutrient industry when there are excessive inventories in the distribution channel our sales volumes and selling prices can be adversely impacted even during periods in which farmers’ use of crop nutrients may remain strong 

changes in transportation costs can affect our sales volumes and selling prices 

the cost of delivery is a significant factor in the total cost to customers and farmers of crop nutrients as a result changes in transportation costs or in customer expectations about them can affect our sales volumes and prices 

customer expectations about future events can have a significant effect on the demand for our products these expectations can significantly affect our sales volumes and selling prices 

customer expectations about future events have had and are expected to continue to have an effect on the demand and prices for crop nutrients future events that may be affected by customer expectations include among others   

 customer expectations about selling prices and availability of crop nutrients have had and are expected to continue to have an effect on the demand for crop nutrients when customers anticipate increasing crop nutrient selling prices customers tend to accumulate inventories before the anticipated price increases this can result in a lag in our realization of rising market prices for our products conversely customers tend to delay their purchases when they anticipate future selling prices for crop nutrients will stabilize or decrease adversely affecting our sales volumes and selling prices customer expectations about availability of crop nutrients can have similar effects on sales volumes and prices   

 similarly customer expectations about future farmer economics have had and are expected to continue to have an effect on the demand for crop nutrients when customers anticipate improving farmer economics customers tend to accumulate crop nutrient inventories in anticipation of increasing sales volumes and selling prices this can result in a lag in our realization of rising market prices for our products conversely when customers anticipate declining farmer economics customers tend to reduce the level of their purchases of crop nutrients adversely affecting our sales volumes and selling prices   



as discussed above increasing transportation costs effectively increase customers’ and farmers’ costs for crop nutrients and can reduce the amount we realize for our sales expectations of decreasing transportation costs can result in customers and farmers anticipating that they may be able to decrease their costs by delaying purchases as a result changes in customer expectations about transportation costs can affect our sales volumes and prices 

we conduct our operations primarily through a limited number of key production and distribution facilities any disruption at one of these facilities could have a material adverse impact on our business the risk of material disruption increases when demand for our products results in high operating rates at our facilities 

we conduct our operations through a limited number of key production and distribution facilities these facilities include our phosphate mines and concentrates plants our potash mines and the ports and other distribution facilities through which we canpotex and any joint ventures in which we participate conduct our respective businesses as well as other commercial arrangements with unrelated third parties any disruption of operations at one of these facilities has the possibility of significantly affecting our production or our ability to distribute our products operating these facilities at high rates during periods of high demand for our products increases the risk of mechanical or structural failures decreases the time available for routine maintenance and increases the impact on our operating results from any disruption a disruption of operations at one of our key facilities could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 

examples of the types of events that could result in a disruption at one of these facilities include adverse weather strikes or other work stoppages deliberate malicious acts including acts of terrorism political and economic instability cyber attacks and other risks associated with our international operations changes in permitting financial assurance or other environmental health and safety laws or other changes in the regulatory environment in which we operate legal and regulatory proceedings our relationships with other member of canpotex and any joint ventures in which we participate and their or our exit from participation in canpotex or any such joint ventures other changes in our commercial arrangements with unrelated third parties brine inflows at our esterhazy saskatchewan mine or our other shaft mines mechanical failure and accidents occurring in the course of operating activities and other factors 

insurance market conditions our loss experience and other factors affect the insurance coverage that we carry and we are not fully insured against all potential hazards and risks incident to our business as a result our insurance coverage may not adequately cover our losses 

we maintain property business interruption and casualty insurance policies but we are not fully insured against all potential hazards and risks incident to our business we are subject to various selfretentions and deductibles under these insurance policies as a result of market conditions our loss experience and other factors our premiums selfretentions and deductibles for insurance policies can increase substantially and in some instances certain insurance may become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage in addition significantly increased costs could lead us to decide to reduce or possibly eliminate coverage as a result a disruption of operations at one of our key facilities or a significant casualty could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 

important raw materials and energy used in our businesses in the past have been and may in the future be the subject of volatile pricing changes in the price of our raw materials could have a material impact on our businesses 

natural gas ammonia and sulfur are key raw materials used in the manufacture of phosphate crop nutrient products natural gas is used as both a chemical feedstock and a fuel to produce anhydrous ammonia which is a raw material used in the production of concentrated phosphate products natural gas is also a significant energy source used in the potash solution mining process from time to time our profitability has been and may in the future be impacted by the price and availability of these raw materials and other energy costs because most of our products are commodities there can be no assurance that we will be able to pass through increased costs to our customers a significant increase in the price of natural gas ammonia sulfur or energy costs that is not recovered through an increase in the price of our related crop nutrients products could have a material adverse impact on our business in addition under our longterm cf ammonia supply agreement we have agreed to purchase approximately 545000 to 725000 tonnes of ammonia per year during a term that may extend until december 31 2032 at a price to be determined by a formula based on the prevailing price of us natural gas if the price of natural gas rises or the market price for ammonia falls outside of the range anticipated at execution of the agreement we may not realize a cost benefit from the natural gas based pricing over the term of the agreement or the cost of our ammonia under the agreement could be a competitive disadvantage 

during periods when the price for concentrated phosphates is falling because of falling raw material prices we may experience a lag in realizing the benefits of the falling raw materials prices this lag can adversely affect our gross margins and profitability 

during some periods changes in market prices for raw materials can lead to changes in the global market prices for concentrated phosphate crop nutrients in particular the global market prices for concentrated phosphate crop nutrients can be affected by changes in the market prices for sulfur ammonia phosphate rock andor phosphoric acid raw materials increasing market prices for these raw materials tend to put upward pressure on the selling prices for concentrated phosphate crop nutrients and decreasing market prices for these raw materials tend to put downward pressure on selling prices for concentrated phosphate crop nutrients when the market prices for these raw materials plunge rapidly the selling prices for our concentrated phosphate crop nutrients can fall more rapidly than we are able to consume our raw material inventory that we purchased or committed to purchase in the past at higher prices as a result our costs may not fall as rapidly as the selling prices of our products until we are able to consume the higher priced raw materials our gross margins and profitability can be adversely affected 

during periods when the prices for our products are falling because of falling raw material prices we could be required to writedown the value of our inventories any such writedown would adversely affect our results of operations and the level of our assets 

we carry our inventories at the lower of cost or market in periods when the market prices for our products are falling rapidly including in response to falling market prices for raw materials it is possible that we could be required to writedown the value of our inventories if market prices fall below our costs any such writedown would adversely affect our results of operations and the level of our assets any such effect could be material 

our estimates of future selling prices reflect in part the purchase commitments we have from our customers as a result defaults on these existing purchase commitments because of the global or local economic and financial conditions or for other reasons could adversely affect our estimates of future selling prices and require additional inventory writedowns 

in the event of a disruption to existing terminaling facilities or transportation for our products or raw materials alternative terminaling facilities or transportation might not be available on a timely basis or have sufficient capacity to fully serve all of our customers or facilities 

in the event of a disruption of existing terminaling facilities or transportation for our products or raw materials alternative terminaling facilities or transportation might not be available on a timely basis or have sufficient capacity to fully serve all of our customers or facilities 

terminaling facilities and transportation include the ports and other distribution facilities through which we canpotex and the joint ventures in which we participate conduct our respective businesses transportation and related equipment arrangements and other commercial arrangements with unrelated third parties 

examples of the types of events that could result in a disruption of terminaling facilities or transportation include adverse weather strikes or other work stoppages deliberate malicious acts political and economic instability and other risks associated with our international operations changes in permitting financial assurance or other environmental health and safety laws or other changes in the regulatory environment in which we operate legal and regulatory proceedings our relationships with other member of canpotex and any joint ventures in which we participate and their or our exit from participation in canpotex or any such joint ventures other changes in our commercial arrangements with unrelated third parties accidents occurring in the course of operating activities lack of truck rail barge or ship transportation and other factors we discuss a number of these examples in more detail throughout this risk factors section 

we are subject to risks associated with our international sales and operations which could negatively affect our sales to customers in foreign countries as well as our operations and assets in foreign countries some of these factors may also make it less attractive to distribute cash generated by our operations outside the united states to our stockholders or to utilize cash generated by our operations in one country to fund our operations or repayments of indebtedness in another country or to support other corporate purposes 

for 2017  we derived approximately 64  of our net sales from customers located outside of the united states of which our international distribution segment accounted for 57 as a result we are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties relating to international sales and operations including   



 the occurrence of any of the above in the countries in which we operate or elsewhere could jeopardize or limit our ability to transact business there and could adversely affect our revenues and operating results and the value of our assets located outside of the united states 

in addition tax regulations currency exchange controls and other restrictions may also make it economically unattractive to   

 changes in tax laws or regulations or their interpretation or exposure to additional tax liabilities could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

we are subject to taxes including income taxes resource taxes and royalties and other nonincome based taxes in the us canada china brazil and other countries where we operate changes in tax laws or regulations or their interpretation could result in higher taxes which could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

our international assets are located in countries with volatile conditions which could subject us and our assets to significant risks 

we are a global business with substantial assets located outside of the united states and canada our operations in brazil china india and paraguay are a fundamental part of our business we have a majority interest in the joint venture entity operating the miski mayo mine in peru that supplies phosphate rock to us we also have a joint venture investment in mwspc which is developing a mine and chemical complexes that we presently expect to produce phosphate fertilizers and other downstream products in the kingdom of saudi arabia volatile economic political and market conditions in these and other emerging market countries may have a negative impact on our operations operating results and financial condition in addition unfavorable changes in trade protection laws policies and measures or governmental actions and policies and other regulatory requirements affecting trade and the pricing and sourcing of our raw materials may also have a negative impact on our operations operating results and financial condition 

natural resource extraction is an important part of the economy in peru and in the past there have been protests against other natural resource operations in peru as of the date of this report there remain numerous social conflicts that exist within the natural resource sector in peru and as a result there is potential for active protests against natural resource companies if the government of peru’s proactive efforts to address the social and environmental issues surrounding natural resource activities were not successful protests could extend to or impact the miski mayo mine and adversely affect our interest in the miski mayo joint venture or the supply of phosphate rock to us from the mine 

adverse weather conditions including the impact of hurricanes and excess heat cold snow rainfall and drought have in the past and may in the future adversely affect our operations particularly our phosphates business and result in increased costs decreased production and potential liabilities 

adverse weather conditions including the impact of hurricanes and excess heat cold snow rainfall and drought have in the past and may in the future adversely affect our operations particularly our phosphates business in the past hurricanes have resulted in minor physical damage to our facilities in florida and louisiana in addition a release of process wastewater at our riverview florida facility during a 2004 hurricane resulted in a small civil fine settlement for an immaterial amount of claims for natural resource damages by governmental agencies and an ongoing private lawsuit 

additionally water treatment costs particularly at our florida operations due to high water balances tend to increase significantly following excess rainfall from hurricanes or other adverse weather some of our florida facilities have had or could have high water levels that may require treatment high water balances in the past at phosphate facilities in florida also led the florida department of environmental protection “ fdep ” to adopt new rules requiring phosphate production facilities to meet more stringent process water management objectives for phosphogypsum management systems 

if additional excess rainfall or hurricanes occur in coming years our facilities may be required to take additional measures to manage process water to comply with existing or future requirements and these measures could potentially have a material effect on our business and financial condition 

adverse weather may also cause a loss of production due to disruptions in our supply chain or adversely affect delivery of our products to our customers for example oil refineries that supply sulfur to us may suspend operations as a result of a hurricane and incoming shipments of ammonia can be delayed disrupting production at our florida or louisiana facilities and delivery of our products 

drought can also adversely affect us for example drought can reduce farmers’ crop yields and the uptake of phosphates and potash reducing the need for application of additional phosphates and potash for the next planting season drought can also lower river levels adversely affecting delivery of our products to our customers 

our operations are dependent on having the required permits and approvals from governmental authorities denial or delay by a government agency in issuing any of our permits and approvals or imposition of restrictive conditions on us with respect to these permits and approvals may impair our business and operations 

we hold numerous governmental environmental mining and other permits and approvals authorizing operations at each of our facilities our ability to continue operations at a facility could be materially affected by a government agency decision to deny or delay issuing a new or renewed permit or approval to revoke or substantially modify an existing permit or approval or to substantially change conditions applicable to a permit modification or by legal actions that successfully challenge our permits 

expanding our operations or extending operations into new areas is also predicated upon securing the necessary environmental or other permits or approvals we have been engaged in and over the next several years we and our subsidiaries will be continuing our efforts to obtain permits in support of our anticipated florida mining operations at certain of our properties 

a denial of our permits the issuance of permits with costprohibitive conditions substantial delays in issuing key permits or legal actions that prevent us from relying on permits or revocation of permits could prevent us from mining at certain of our properties and thereby have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

for example   

 the periods of shutdown and reduced phosphate rock production at our south fort meade mine resulted in costs to suspend operations and idle plant costs lower phosphate rock mining production levels also adversely affected gross margin   

we have included additional discussion about permitting for our phosphate mines in florida under “environmental health safety and security matters—operating requirements and impacts—permitting” in our management’s analysis 

we are subject to financial assurance requirements as part of our routine business operations these financial assurance requirements affect our costs and increase our liquidity requirements if we were unable to satisfy applicable financial assurance requirements we might not be able to obtain or maintain permits we need to operate our business as we have in the past our need to comply with these requirements could materially affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

in many cases as a condition to procuring or maintaining permits and approvals or otherwise we are required to comply with financial assurance requirements of governmental authorities the purpose of these requirements is to provide comfort to the government that sufficient funds will be available for the ultimate closure postclosure care andor reclamation of our facilities 

in some cases we are able to comply through the satisfaction of applicable state financial strength tests but if we are unable to do so we must utilize alternative methods of complying with the financial assurance requirements or we could be subject to enforcement proceedings brought by relevant government agencies potential alternative methods of compliance include providing credit support in the form of cash escrows or trusts surety bonds from insurance companies letters of credit from banks or other forms of financial instruments or collateral to satisfy the financial assurance requirements or negotiating a consent agreement that establishes a different form of financial assurance use of alternative means of financial assurance imposes additional expense on us some of them such as letters of credit also use a portion of our available liquidity other alternative means of financial assurance such as surety bonds may in some cases require collateral and generally require us to obtain a discharge of the bonds or to post additional collateral typically in the form of cash or letters of credit at the request of the issuer of the bonds collateral that is required may be in many forms including letters of credit or other financial instruments that utilize a portion of our available liquidity or in the form of assets such as real estate which reduces our flexibility to manage or sell assets 

for example 

 in the past we have also not always been able to satisfy applicable financial strength tests and in the future it is possible that we will not be able to pass the applicable financial strength tests negotiate or receive approval of consent decrees establish escrow or trust accounts or obtain letters of credit surety bonds or other financial instruments on acceptable terms and 

conditions or at a reasonable cost or that the form andor cost of compliance could increase which could materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

we have included additional discussion about financial assurance requirements under “off balance sheet arrangements and obligations—other commercial commitments” in our management’s analysis 

the other environmental regulations to which we are subject may also have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition to permitting and financial assurance requirements we are subject to numerous other environmental health and safety laws and regulations in the us canada china brazil and other countries where we operate these laws and regulations govern a wide range of matters including environmental controls land reclamation discharges to air and water and remediation of hazardous substance releases they significantly affect our operating activities as well as the level of our operating costs and capital expenditures in some international jurisdictions environmental laws change frequently and it may be difficult for us to determine if we are in compliance with all material environmental laws at any given time 

we are and may in the future be involved in legal and regulatory proceedings that could be material to us these proceedings include “legacy” matters arising from activities of our predecessor companies and from facilities and businesses that we have never owned or operated 

we have in the past been are currently and may in the future be subject to legal and regulatory proceedings that could be material to our business results of operations liquidity or financial condition joint ventures in which we participate could also become subject to these sorts of proceedings these proceedings may be brought by the government or private parties and may arise out of a variety of matters including   

 the legal and regulatory proceedings to which we are currently or may in the future be subject can depending on the circumstances result in monetary damage awards fines penalties other liabilities injunctions or other court or administrative rulings that interrupt impede or otherwise materially affect our business operations andor criminal sanctions 

among other environmental laws the us comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act “ cercla ” imposes liability including for cleanup costs without regard to fault or to the legality of a party’s conduct on certain categories of persons including current and former owners and operators of a site and parties who are considered to have contributed to the release of “hazardous substances” into the environment under cercla or various us state analogues a party may under certain circumstances be required to bear more than its proportional share of cleanup costs at a 

site where it has liability if payments cannot be obtained from other responsible parties as a crop nutrient company working with chemicals and other hazardous substances we will periodically incur liabilities and cleanup costs under cercla and other environmental laws with regard to our current or former facilities adjacent or nearby thirdparty facilities or offsite disposal locations 

pending and potential legal and regulatory proceedings may arise out of our present activities including operations at current facilities they may also arise out of past activities by us our predecessor companies and subsidiaries that our predecessors have sold these past activities were in some cases at facilities that we and our subsidiaries no longer own or operate and may have never owned or operated 

settlements of legal and regulatory matters frequently require court approval in the event a court were not to approve of a settlement it is possible that we and the other party or parties to the matter might not be able to settle it on terms that were acceptable to all parties or that we could be required to accept more stringent terms of settlement than required by the opposing parties 

we have included additional information with respect to pending legal and regulatory proceedings in note 21  of our notes to consolidated financial statements and in this report in part i item 3 “legal proceedings” 

these legal and regulatory proceedings involve inherent uncertainties and could negatively impact our business results of operations liquidity or financial condition 

the permitting financial assurance and other environmental health and safety laws and regulations to which we are subject may become more stringent over time this could increase the effects on us of these laws and regulations and the increased effects could be material 

continued government and public emphasis on environmental health and safety issues in the us canada china brazil paraguay and other countries where we operate can be expected to result in requirements that apply to us and our operations that are more stringent than those that are described above and elsewhere in this report these more stringent requirements may include among other matters increased levels of future investments and expenditures for environmental controls at ongoing operations which will be charged against income from future operations increased levels of the financial assurance requirements to which we are subject increased efforts or costs to obtain permits or denial of permits other new or interpretations of existing statutes or regulations that impose new or more stringent restrictions or liabilities including liabilities or additional financial assurance requirements under cercla or similar statutes including restrictions or liabilities related to elevated levels of naturallyoccurring radiation that arise from disturbing the ground in the course of mining activities and other matters that could increase our expenses capital requirements or liabilities or adversely affect our business liquidity or financial condition in addition to the extent restrictions imposed in countries where our competitors operate such as china india former soviet union countries or morocco are less stringent than in the countries where we operate our competitors could gain cost or other competitive advantages over us these effects could be material 

among other matters in recent years there have been a number of initiatives relating to nutrient discharges new regulatory restrictions from these initiatives could have a material effect on either us or our customers for example the gulf coast ecosystem restoration task force established by executive order of the president and comprised of five gulf states and eleven federal agencies delivered a final strategy for longterm ecosystem restoration for the gulf coast in 2016 the strategy calls for among other matters reduction of the flow of excess nutrients into the gulf through state nutrient reduction frameworks new nutrient reduction approaches and reduction of agricultural and urban sources of excess nutrients implementation of the strategy will require legislative or regulatory action at the state level we cannot predict what the requirements of any such legislative or regulatory action could be or whether or how it would affect us or our customers 

in addition in april 2014 epa and the corps jointly issued a proposed rule that would redefine the scope of waters regulated under the federal clean water act the final rule the “ clean water rule ” became effective in august 2015 but has been challenged through numerous lawsuits in october 2015 the us court of appeals for the sixth circuit issued an order staying the effectiveness of the final rule until after the legal validity of the regulation is resolved in early 2017 the united states president issued an executive order directing epa and the corps to publish a proposed rule rescinding or revising the new rule in june 2017 epa and the corps issued a proposed rule that would rescind the clean water rule and recodify regulatory text that existed prior to enactment of the clean water rule in november 2017 epa issued a rule notice proposing to extend the applicability date of the clean water rule for two years from the date of final action on the proposed rule to provide continuity and regulatory certainty while agencies proceed to consider potential changes to the clean water rule we believe the clean water rule if not rescinded would expand the types and extent of water resources regulated under federal law thereby potentially expanding our permitting and reporting requirements increasing our costs of 

compliance including costs associated with wetlands and stream mitigation lengthening the time necessary to obtain permits and potentially restricting our ability to mine certain of our phosphate rock reserves these effects could be material 

regulatory restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions and climate change regulations in the united states canada or elsewhere could adversely affect us and these effects could be material 

various governmental initiatives to limit greenhouse gas emissions are under way or under consideration around the world these initiatives could restrict our operating activities require us to make changes in our operating activities that would increase our operating costs reduce our efficiency or limit our output require us to make capital improvements to our facilities increase our energy raw material and transportation costs or limit their availability or otherwise adversely affect our results of operations liquidity or capital resources and these effects could be material to us 

governmental greenhouse gas emission initiatives include among others  the december 2015 agreement the “ paris agreement ” which was the outcome of the 21 st  session of the conference of the parties under the united nations framework convention on climate change unfccc the paris agreement which was signed by nearly 200 nations including the united states and canada entered into force in late 2016 and sets out a goal of limiting the average rise in temperatures for this century to below 2 degrees celsius each signatory is expected to develop its own plan referred to as a nationally determined contribution or “ ndc ” for reaching that goal 

in may 2017 the united states president announced that the united states would withdraw from the paris agreement under article 28 of that agreement the earliest such a withdrawal could be effective is november 2020 in 2015 prior to this announcement the united states had submitted an ndc aiming to achieve by 2025 an economywide target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 2628 below its 2005 level the ndc also aims to use best efforts to reduce emissions by 28 the us target covers all greenhouse gases that were a part of the 2014 inventory of   greenhouse gas emissions and sinks while it is unclear whether the us executive administration will proceed to withdraw from the paris agreement various legislative or regulatory initiatives relating to greenhouse gases have been adopted or considered by the us congress epa or various states and those initiatives already adopted may be used to implement the us’s ndc additionally more stringent laws and regulations may be enacted to accomplish the goals set out in the ndc 

canada’s intended ndc aims to achieve by 2030 an economywide target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 30 below 2005 levels in late 2016 the federal government announced plans for a comprehensive tax on carbon emissions under which provinces opting out of the tax would have the option of adopting a capandtrade system in the plans the federal government also committed to implementing a federal carbon pricing backstop system that will apply in any province or territory that does not have a carbon pricing system in place by 2018   while no tax has formally been proposed as implementation of the paris agreement proceeds more stringent laws and regulations may be enacted to accomplish the goals set out in canada’s ndc in addition the province of saskatchewan in which our canadian potash mines are located has publicly stated that a carbon pricing system will not be implemented in the province and that legal action will be sought against the federal government if necessary in december 2017 saskatchewan announced a comprehensive plan to address climate change that does not include an economywide price on carbon but does include a system of tariffs and credits for large emitters the plan is subject to federal review and approval in late 2018 our saskatchewan potash facilities will continue to work with the saskatchewan ministry of environment and environment and climate change canada through participation in industry associations to determine next steps we will also continue to monitor developments relating to the anticipated proposed legislation as well as the potential future effect on our operating activities energy raw material and transportation costs results of operations liquidity or capital resources 

it is possible that future legislation or regulation addressing climate change including in response to the paris agreement or any new international agreements could adversely affect our operating activities energy raw material and transportation costs results of operations liquidity or capital resources and these effects could be material or adversely impact our competitive advantage in addition to the extent climate change restrictions imposed in countries where our competitors operate such as china india former soviet union countries or morocco are less stringent than in the united states or canada our competitors could gain cost or other competitive advantages over us 

future climate change could adversely affect us 

the prospective impact of climate change on our operations and those of our customers and farmers remains uncertain scientists have hypothesized that the impacts of climate change could include changes in rainfall patterns water shortages changing sea levels changing storm patterns and intensities and changing temperature levels and that these changes could be severe these impacts could vary by geographic location severe climate change could impact our costs and operating activities the location and cost of global grain and oilseed production and the supply and demand for grains and oilseeds at 

the present time we cannot predict the prospective impact of climate change on our results of operations liquidity or capital resources or whether any such effects could be material to us 

some of our competitors and potential competitors have greater resources than we do which may place us at a competitive disadvantage and adversely affect our sales and profitability these competitors include stateowned and governmentsubsidized entities in other countries 

we compete with a number of producers throughout the world including stateowned and governmentsubsidized entities some of these entities may have greater total resources than we do and may be less dependent on earnings from crop nutrients sales than we are in addition some of these entities may have access to lower cost or governmentsubsidized natural gas supplies placing us at a competitive disadvantage furthermore certain governments as owners of some of our competitors may be willing to accept lower prices and profitability on their products in order to support domestic employment or other political or social goals to the extent other producers of crop nutrients enjoy competitive advantages or are willing to accept lower profit levels the price of our products our sales volumes and our profits may be adversely affected 

we do not own a controlling equity interest in our nonconsolidated companies some of which are foreign companies and therefore our operating results and cash flow may be materially affected by how the governing boards and majority owners operate such businesses there may also be limitations on monetary distributions from these companies that are outside of our control together these factors may lower our equity earnings or cash flow from such businesses and negatively impact our results of operations 

in 2013 we entered into an agreement to form mwspc a joint venture to develop a mine and chemical complexes for an estimated 80 billion  that is expected to produce phosphate fertilizers and other downstream products in the kingdom of saudi arabia we have a 25 interest in the joint venture and expect our cash investment will be up to 840 million  approximately 770 million  of which had been funded as of december 31 2017 we also expect to provide financial guarantees with respect to our proportionate share of approximately 140 million of certain funding facilities obtained by mwspc the success of mwspc will depend on among other matters the completion of development and full commencement of operations of production facilities in the kingdom of saudi arabia the future success of current plans for completion of the development and for the operation of mwspc including the availability and affordability of necessary resources and materials and access to appropriate infrastructure and any future changes in those plans as well as the general economic and political stability of the region 

we also hold minority ownership interests in companies that are not controlled by us we expect that the operations and results of mwspc will be and the operations or results of some of the other companies are significant to us and their operations can affect our earnings because we do not control these companies either at the board or stockholder levels and because local laws in foreign jurisdictions and contractual obligations may place restrictions on monetary distributions by these companies we cannot ensure that these companies will operate efficiently or in the case of mwspc in compliance with the terms of any funding facility for which we may provide financial guarantees pay dividends or generally follow the desires of our management by virtue of our board or stockholder representation as a result these companies may contribute less than anticipated to our earnings and cash flow negatively impacting our results of operations and liquidity additionally in the case of mwspc we may be called upon to provide funds to satisfy mwspc’s debt obligations to the extent we provide financial guarantees in connection with its funding facilities 

strikes or other forms of work stoppage or slowdown could disrupt our business and lead to increased costs 

our financial performance is dependent on a reliable and productive work force a significant portion of our workforce and that of the joint ventures in which we participate is covered by collective bargaining agreements with unions unsuccessful contract negotiations or adverse labor relations could result in strikes or slowdowns any disruptions may decrease our production and sales or impose additional costs to resolve disputes the risk of adverse labor relations may increase as our profitability increases because labor unions’ expectations and demands generally rise at those times 

accidents occurring in the course of our operating activities could result in significant liabilities interruptions or shutdowns of facilities or the need for significant safety or other expenditures 

we engage in mining and industrial activities that can result in serious accidents if our safety procedures are not effective or if an accident occurs we could be subject to liabilities arising out of personal injuries or death our operations could be interrupted and we might have to shut down or abandon affected facilities accidents could cause us to expend significant amounts to remediate safety issues or to repair damaged facilities for example   

 the excavation of mines can result in potential seismic events or can increase the likelihood or potential severity of a seismic event the rise and fall of water levels such as those arising from the brine inflows and our remediation activities at our esterhazy mine can also result in or increase the likelihood or potential severity of a seismic event our esterhazy mine has experienced minor seismic events from time to time a significant seismic event at one of our mines could result in serious injuries or death or damage to or flooding of the mine or in the extreme scenario cause us to change our mining process or abandon the mine   

 our underground potash shaft mines at esterhazy and colonsay saskatchewan and carlsbad new mexico are subject to risk from fire any failure of our safety procedures in the future could result in serious injuries or death or shutdowns which could result in significant liabilities andor impact on the financial performance of our potash business including a possible material adverse effect on our results of operations liquidity or financial condition   

 we produce ammonia at our faustina louisiana phosphate concentrates plant use ammonia in significant quantities at all of our florida and louisiana phosphates concentrates plants and store ammonia at some of our distribution facilities for our florida phosphates concentrates plants ammonia is received at terminals in tampa and transported by pipelines and rail to our facilities our ammonia is generally stored and transported at high pressures or cryogenically an accident could occur that could result in serious injuries or death or the evacuation of areas near an accident an accident could also result in property damage or the shutdown of our florida or louisiana phosphates concentrates plants the ammonia terminals pipelines or rail lines serving those plants or our other ammonia storage and handling facilities as a result an accident involving ammonia could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations liquidity or financial condition   

 we use sulfuric acid in the production of concentrated phosphates in our florida and louisiana operations some of our florida and louisiana facilities produce fluorosilicic acid which is a hazardous chemical for resale to third parties we also use or produce other hazardous or volatile chemicals at some of our facilities an accident involving any of these chemicals could result in serious injuries or death or evacuation of areas near an accident an accident could also result in property damage or shutdown of our facilities or cause us to expend significant amounts to remediate safety issues or to repair damaged facilities as a result an accident involving any of these chemicals could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations liquidity or financial condition 

deliberate malicious acts including terrorism could damage our facilities disrupt our operations or injure employees contractors customers or the public and result in liability to us 

intentional acts of destruction could hinder our sales or production and disrupt our supply chain our facilities could be damaged or destroyed reducing our operational production capacity and requiring us to repair or replace our facilities at substantial cost employees contractors and the public could suffer substantial physical injury for which we could be liable governmental authorities may impose security or other requirements that could make our operations more difficult or costly the consequences of any such actions could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

we may be adversely affected by changing antitrust laws to which we are subject increases in crop nutrient prices can increase the scrutiny to which we are subject under these laws 

we are subject to antitrust and competition laws in various countries throughout the world we cannot predict how these laws or their interpretation administration and enforcement will change over time changes in antitrust laws globally or in their interpretation administration or enforcement may limit our existing or future operations and growth or the operations of 

canpotex which serves as an export association for our potash business increases in crop nutrient prices have in the past resulted in increased scrutiny of the crop nutrient industry under antitrust and competition laws and can increase the risk that these laws could be interpreted administered or enforced in a manner that could affect our operating practices or impose liability on us in a manner that could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

we may be adversely affected by other changes in laws resulting from increases in food and crop nutrient prices 

increases in prices for among other things food fuel and crop inputs including crop nutrients have in the past been the subject of significant discussion by various governmental bodies and officials throughout the world in response to increases it is possible that governments in one or more of the locations in which we operate or where we or our competitors sell our products could take actions that could affect us such actions could include among other matters changes in governmental policies relating to agriculture and biofuels including changes in subsidy levels price controls tariffs windfall profits taxes or export or import taxes any such actions could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

our competitive position could be adversely affected if we are unable to participate in continuing industry consolidation 

most of our products are readily available from a number of competitors and price and other competition in the crop nutrient industry is intense in addition crop nutrient production facilities and distribution activities frequently benefit from economies of scale as a result particularly during pronounced cyclical troughs the crop nutrient industry has a long history of consolidation mosaic itself is the result of a number of industry consolidations we expect consolidation among crop nutrient producers could continue our competitive position could suffer to the extent we are not able to expand our own resources either through consolidations acquisitions joint ventures or partnerships in the future we may not be able to find suitable companies to combine with assets to purchase or joint venture or partnership opportunities to pursue even if we are able to locate desirable opportunities we may not be able to enter into transactions on economically acceptable terms if we do not successfully participate in continuing industry consolidation our ability to compete successfully could be adversely affected and result in the loss of customers or an uncompetitive cost structure which could adversely affect our sales and profitability 

our strategy for managing market and interest rate risk may not be effective 

our businesses are affected by fluctuations in market prices for our products the purchase price of natural gas ammonia and sulfur consumed in operations freight and shipping costs foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates we periodically enter into derivatives and forward purchase contracts to mitigate some of these risks however our strategy may not be successful in minimizing our exposure to these fluctuations see “market risk” in our management’s analysis and note 14  of our notes to consolidated financial statements that is incorporated by reference in this report in part ii item 8 

a shortage or unavailability of railcars tugs barges and ships for carrying our products and the raw materials we use in our business could result in customer dissatisfaction loss of production or sales and higher transportation or equipment costs 

we rely heavily upon truck rail tug barge and ocean freight transportation to obtain the raw materials we need and to deliver our products to our customers in addition the cost of transportation is an important part of the final sale price of our products finding affordable and dependable transportation is important in obtaining our raw materials and to supply our customers higher costs for these transportation services or an interruption or slowdown due to factors including high demand high fuel prices labor disputes layoffs or other factors affecting the availability of qualified transportation workers adverse weather or other environmental events or changes to rail barge or ocean freight systems could negatively affect our ability to produce our products or deliver them to our customers which could affect our performance and results of operations 

strong demand for grain and other products and a strong world economy increase the demand for and reduce the availability of transportation both domestically and internationally shortages of railcars barges and ocean transport for carrying product and increased transit time may result in customer dissatisfaction loss of sales and higher equipment and transportation costs in addition during periods when the shipping industry has a shortage of ships the substantial time needed to build new ships prevents rapid market response delays and missed shipments due to transportation shortages including vessels barges railcars and trucks could result in customer dissatisfaction or loss of sales potential which could negatively affect our performance and results of operations 

additionally we have agreed under our longterm cf ammonia supply agreement to purchase approximately 545000 to 725000 tonnes of ammonia per year during a term that may extend until december 31 2032 at a price to be determined by a formula based on the prevailing price of us natural gas we are obligated to provide for transportation of the ammonia under the agreement and if we fail to take the required minimum annual amount cf may elect to require us to make payment of liquidated damages or terminate the agreement payment of significant liquidated damages or an election by cf to terminate the agreement could adversely affect our business 

a lack of customers’ access to credit can adversely affect their ability to purchase our products 

some of our customers require access to credit to purchase our products a lack of available credit to customers in one or more countries due to global or local economic conditions or for other reasons could adversely affect demand for crop nutrients 

we extend trade credit to our customers and guarantee the financing that some of our customers use to purchase our products our results of operations may be adversely affected if these customers are unable to repay the trade credit from us or financing from their banks increases in prices for crop nutrient other agricultural inputs and grain may increase this risk 

we extend trade credit to our customers in the united states and throughout the world in some cases for extended periods of time in brazil where there are fewer thirdparty financing sources available to farmers we also have several programs under which we guarantee customers’ financing from financial institutions that they use to purchase our products as our exposure to longer trade credit extended throughout the world and use of guarantees in brazil increases we are increasingly exposed to the risk that some of our customers will not pay us or the amounts we have guaranteed additionally we become increasingly exposed to risk due to weather and crop growing conditions fluctuations in commodity prices or foreign currencies and other factors that influence the price supply and demand for agricultural commodities significant defaults by our customers could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

increases in prices for crop nutrients increase the dollar amount of our sales to customers the larger dollar value of our customers’ purchases may also lead them to request longer trade credit from us andor increase their need for us to guarantee their financing of our products either factor could increase the amount of our exposure to the risk that our customers may be unable to repay the trade credit from us or financing from their banks that we guarantee in addition increases in prices for other agricultural inputs and grain may increase the working capital requirements indebtedness and other liabilities of our customers increase the risk that they will default on the trade credit from us or their financing that we guarantee and decrease the likelihood that we will be able to collect from our customers in the event of their default 

provisions in our restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws and of delaware law may prevent or delay an acquisition of our company which could decrease the trading price of our common stock 

our restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that could have the effect of rendering more difficult or discouraging an acquisition deemed undesirable by our board of directors these provisions include the ability of our board of directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval a prohibition on stockholder action by written consent and the inability of our stockholders to request that our board of directors or chairman of our board call a special meeting of stockholders 

we are also subject to section 203 of the delaware general corporation law in general section 203 prohibits a publicly held delaware corporation from engaging in a “business combination” with an “interested stockholder” for a period of three years from the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder unless the interested stockholder attained this status with the approval of the board of directors or unless the business combination was approved in a prescribed manner a “business combination” includes mergers asset sales and other transactions resulting in a financial benefit to the interested stockholder subject to exceptions an “interested stockholder” is a person who together with affiliates and associates owns or within three years owned 15 or more of the corporation’s voting stock this statute could prohibit or delay the accomplishment of mergers or other takeover or change in control attempts with respect to us and accordingly may discourage attempts to acquire us 

these provisions apply not only when they may protect our stockholders from coercive or otherwise unfair takeover tactics but even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders and could delay or prevent an acquisition that our board of directors determines is not in our best interests or those of our stockholders 

our success will continue to depend on our ability to attract and retain highly qualified and motivated employees 

we believe our continued success depends on the collective abilities and efforts of our employees like many businesses a significant number of our employees including some of our most highly skilled employees with specialized expertise in potash and phosphates operations will be approaching retirement age throughout the next decade and beyond in addition we compete for a talented workforce with other businesses particularly within the mining and chemicals industries in general and the crop nutrients industry in particular our expansion plans are highly dependent on our ability to attract retain and train highly qualified and motivated employees who are essential to the success of our ongoing operations as well as to our expansion plans if we were to be unsuccessful in attracting retaining and training the employees we require our ongoing operations and expansion plans could be materially and adversely affected 

future product or technological innovation could affect our business 

future product or technological innovation such as the development of seeds that require less crop nutrients the development of substitutes for our products or developments in the application of crop nutrients if they occur could have the potential to adversely affect the demand for our products and our results of operations liquidity and capital resources 

we may fail to fully realize the anticipated benefits and synergies of our acquisition the “acquisition” of the global phosphate and potash operations of vale sa “vale” conducted through vale fertilizantes sa now known as mosaic fertilizantes pk sa 

the success of the acquisition will depend in part on our ability to realize the anticipated benefits and synergies our ability to realize these anticipated benefits and synergies is subject to certain risks including 

 if we are not able to successfully integrate the acquired business within the anticipated time frame or at all the anticipated benefits and synergies of the acquisition may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected and the combined operations may not perform as expected 

the success of our other strategic initiatives depends on our ability to effectively manage these initiatives and to successfully integrate and grow acquired businesses 

in addition to the acquisition we have other significant ongoing strategic initiatives including principally our plans to expand the annual production capacity of our potash business and mwspc these strategic initiatives involve capital and other expenditures of several billions of dollars over a number of years and require effective project management and in the case of strategic acquisitions successful integration to the extent the processes we or for the mwspc we together with our joint venture partners put in place to manage these initiatives or integrate and grow acquired businesses are not effective our capital expenditure and other costs may exceed our expectations or the benefits we expect from these initiatives might not be fully realized 

we may fail to fully realize the anticipated benefits and cost savings of our longterm cf ammonia supply agreement 

we use ammonia as a raw material in the production of our concentrated phosphate products under our longterm cf ammonia supply agreement we have agreed to purchase approximately 545000 to 725000 tonnes of ammonia per year during a term that may extend until december 31 2032 at a price to be determined by a formula based on the prevailing price of us natural gas 

the success of this agreement will depend in part on our ability to realize cost savings from the agreement’s natural gas based pricing if the price of natural gas rises materially or the market price for ammonia falls outside of the range we 

currently anticipate over the term of the agreement we may not realize a cost benefit from the agreement or the cost of our ammonia under the agreement could be a competitive disadvantage in addition our ability to realize benefits and cost savings is subject to certain additional risks including whether cf successfully performs its obligations under the agreement over the life of its commitment and our ability to take delivery of the required minimum annual amount of ammonia over the life of our commitment 

cyber attacks could disrupt our operations and have a material adverse impact on our business 

as a global company we utilize and rely upon information technology systems in many aspects of our business including internal and external communications and the management of our accounting financial production and supply chain functions as we become more dependent on information technologies to conduct our operations and as the number and sophistication of cyber attacks increase the risks associated with cyber security increase these risks apply both to us and to third parties on whose systems we rely for the conduct of our business failure to effectively anticipate prevent detect and recover from the increasing number and sophistication of cyber attacks could result in theft loss or misuse of or damage or modification of our information and cause disruptions or delays in our business reputational damage and thirdparty claims which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition

business developments during 2016 

we took the following steps toward achieving our strategic priorities   



production facilities to be approximately 80 billion  we expect this amount to be funded through external debt facilities and investments by the joint venture members 



we have included additional information about these and other developments in our business during 2016  in our management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations “ management’s analysis ” and in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 

business segment information 

the discussion below of our business segment operations should be read in conjunction with the following information that we have included in this report   



phosphates segment 

our phosphates business segment owns and operates mines and production facilities in florida which produce concentrated phosphate crop nutrients and phosphatebased animal feed ingredients and processing plants in louisiana which produce concentrated phosphate crop nutrients 

on march 17 2014 we completed our acquisition the  cf phosphate assets acquisition  of the florida phosphate assets and assumption of certain related liabilities of cf industries inc  cf  which included the 25000acre south pasture phosphate mine and beneficiation plant in hardee county florida a phosphate manufacturing facility in plant city florida and ammonia terminal and finished product warehouse facilities in tampa 

us phosphate crop nutrients and animal feed ingredients 

our us phosphates operations have capacity to produce approximately 53 million tonnes of phosphoric acid “ p 2 o 5 ” per year or about 10 of world annual capacity and about 60 of north american annual capacity phosphoric acid is produced by reacting finely ground phosphate rock with sulfuric acid phosphoric acid is the key building block for the production of high analysis or concentrated phosphate crop nutrients and animal feed products and is the most comprehensive measure of phosphate capacity and production and a commonly used benchmark in our industry our us phosphoric acid production totaled approximately 45 million  tonnes during 2016  we account for approximately 10 of estimated global annual production and 61 of estimated north american annual output 

our phosphate crop nutrient products are marketed worldwide to crop nutrient manufacturers distributors retailers and farmers our principal phosphate crop nutrient products are   

 production of our animal feed ingredients products is located at our new wales florida facility we market our feed phosphate primarily under the leading brand names of biofos ®  and nexfos ®  

our primary phosphate crop nutrient production facilities are located in central florida and louisiana the following map shows the locations of each of our phosphate concentrates plants in the united states and the locations of each of our active and planned phosphate mines in florida other than ona as its reserves have been allocated to other active mines 

annual capacity by plant as of december 31 2016  and production volumes by plant for 2016  are listed below   



 



the phosphoric acid produced at uncle sam is shipped to faustina where it is used to produce dap map and microessentials ®  our faustina plant also manufactures ammonia that is mostly consumed in our concentrate plants 

we produced approximately 89 million tonnes of concentrated phosphate crop nutrients during 2016  and accounted for approximately 14 of estimated world annual output and 75 of estimated north american annual production 

phosphate rock 

phosphate rock is the key mineral used to produce phosphate crop nutrients and feed phosphate our phosphate rock production totaled approximately 142 million  tonnes in 2016  and accounted for approximately 7 of estimated world annual production and 54 of estimated north american annual production we are the world’s second largest miner of phosphate rock and currently operate four mines with a combined annual capacity of approximately 172 million  tonnes production of one tonne of dap requires between 16 and 17 tonnes of phosphate rock 

all of our wholly owned phosphate mines and related mining operations are located in central florida during 2016  we operated four active mines four corners south fort meade wingate and south pasture the hookers prairie mines reserves were exhausted during 2014 we plan to develop ona and desoto reserves to replace reserves that will be depleted at various times during the next decade 

the phosphate deposits of florida are of sedimentary origin and are part of a phosphatebearing province that extends from southern florida north along the atlantic coast into southern virginia our active phosphate mines are primarily located in what is known as the bone valley member of the peace river formation in the central florida phosphate district the southern portions of the four corners and wingate mines are in what is referred to as the undifferentiated peace river formation in which the ona and desoto reserves we plan to develop are also located phosphate mining has been conducted in the central florida phosphate district since the late 1800’s the potentially mineable portion of the district encompasses an area approximately 80 miles in length in a northsouth direction and approximately 40 miles in width 

we extract phosphate ore using large surface mining machines that we own called “draglines” prior to extracting the ore the draglines must first remove a 10 to 50 foot layer of sandy overburden at our wingate mine we also utilize dredges to remove the overburden and mine the ore we then process the ore at beneficiation plants that we own at each active mine where the ore goes through washing screening sizing and flotation processes designed to separate the phosphate rock from sands clays and other foreign materials   prior to commencing operations at any of our planned future mines we may need to acquire new draglines or move existing draglines to the mines and unless the beneficiation plant at an existing mine were used construct a beneficiation plant 

the following table shows for each of our phosphate mines annual capacity as of december 31 2016  and rock production volume and grade for the years 2016  2015  and 2014 

  



 



mining at any particular time maintenance and turnaround time accidents mechanical failure weather conditions and other operating conditions as well as the effect of recent initiatives intended to improve operational excellence 

 reserves 

we estimate our phosphate rock reserves based upon exploration core drilling as well as technical and economic analyses to determine that reserves can be economically mined proven measured reserves are those resources of sufficient concentration to meet minimum physical chemical and economic criteria related to our current product standards and mining and production practices our estimates of probable indicated reserves are based on information similar to that used for proven reserves but sites for drilling are farther apart or are otherwise less adequately spaced than for proven reserves although the degree of assurance is high enough to assume continuity between such sites proven reserves are determined using a minimum drill hole spacing in two locations per 40 acre block probable reserves have less than two drill holes per 40 acre block but geological data provides a high degree of assurance that continuity exists between sites 

the following table sets forth our proven and probable phosphate reserves as of december 31 2016  



 



we generally own the reserves shown for active mines in the table above with the only significant exceptions being further described below   

 in light of the longterm nature of our rights to our reserves we expect to be able to mine all reported reserves that are not currently owned prior to termination or expiration of our rights additional information regarding permitting is included in part i item 1a “risk factors” and under “environmental health safety and security matters—operating requirements and impacts—permitting” in our management’s analysis 

investments in joint ventures 

we have a 35 economic interest in a joint venture which owns the miski mayo phosphate rock mine in the bayovar region of peru our investment in the miski mayo mine and related commercial offtake supply agreement to purchase a share of the phosphate rock from the miski mayo mine allows us to supplement our internally produced rock to meet our overall fertilizer production needs the miski mayo mine’s annual production capacity is 39 million tonnes upon the closing of our proposed acquisition of vale fertilizantes sa we will acquire an additional 40  economic interest in the miski mayo joint venture which will bring our aggregate interest to 75 

we own a 25 interest in mwspc and in connection with our equity share we will market approximately 25 of the mwspcs production mwspc is developing a mine and two chemical complexes that are presently expected to produce phosphate fertilizers and other downstream phosphates products in the kingdom of saudi arabia we currently estimate that the cost to develop and construct the integrated phosphate production facilities the  project  will approximate 80 billion  which we expect to be funded primarily through investments by us maaden and sabic and through borrowing arrangements and other external project financing facilities  funding facilities  we currently estimate that our cash investment in the project including the amount we have invested to date will approximate 850 million  our cash investment in the project at december 31 2016 and as of the date of this report was 707 million  we expect our future cash contributions to be approximately 143 million the greenfield project is being built in the northern region of saudi arabia at wa’ad al shamal minerals industrial city and includes further expansion of processing plants in ras al khair minerals industrial city which is located on the east coast of saudi arabia the facilities are expected to have a production capacity of approximately 35 million tonnes of finished product per year the project is expected to benefit from the availability of key raw nutrients from sources within saudi arabia ammonia operations commenced in late 2016 and production of finished phosphate products is expected to begin in 2017 

on june 30 2014 mwspc entered into funding facilities with a consortium of 20 financial institutions for a total amount of approximately 50 billion in january 2016 mwspc announced that it had received the approval of the saudi industrial development fund  sidf  for future funding facilities in the total amount of approximately 11 billion subject to the finalization of definitive agreements we currently expect that mwspc will work to finalize definitive agreements for loans from sidf in the lower amount of approximately 560 million  by april 30 2017 the terms of the june 30 2014 funding facilities and the proposed future funding facilities are further discussed in note 8  of our consolidated financial statements 

sulfur 

we use molten sulfur at our phosphates concentrates plants to produce sulfuric acid primarily for use in our production of phosphoric acid we purchased approximately 42 million long tons of sulfur during 2016  we purchase the majority of this sulfur from north american oil and natural gas refiners who are required to remove or recover sulfur during the refining process production of one tonne of dap requires approximately 040 long tons of sulfur we procure our sulfur from multiple sources and receive it by truck rail barge and vessel either direct to our phosphate plants or have it sent for gathering to terminals that are located on the us gulf coast the new sulfur melter at our new wales facility became operational in the first quarter of 2016 and with the melter we are now able to purchase formed sulfur which is more broadly available than molten sulfur formed sulfur for the melter is received through two tampa ports then delivered by truck to the new wales facility the sulfur melter has the capability to melt over one million long tons of sulfur annually allowing us to leverage economic benefits within the global sulfur marketplace 

we own and operate sulfur terminals in houston texas and riverview florida we also lease terminal space in tampa florida and galveston and beaumont texas we contract for the operation of three oceangoing barges and three tugs that transport molten sulfur from the texas terminals to tampa and then onward by truck to our florida phosphate plants in addition we own a 50 equity interest in gulf sulphur services ltd lllp “ gulf sulphur services ” which is operated by our joint venture partner gulf sulphur services has a sulfur transportation and terminaling business in the gulf of mexico and handles these functions for a substantial portion of our florida sulfur volume our sulfur logistic assets also include a large fleet of leased railcars that supplement our marine sulfur logistic system our louisiana operations are served by truck and barge from nearby refineries 

although sulfur is readily available from many different suppliers and can be transported to our phosphate facilities by a variety of means sulfur is an important raw material used in our business that has in the past been and may in the future be the subject of volatile pricing and availability alternative transportation and terminaling facilities might not have sufficient capacity to fully serve all of our facilities in the event of a disruption to current transportation or terminaling facilities changes in the price of sulfur or disruptions to sulfur transportation or terminaling facilities could have a material impact on our business we have included a discussion of sulfur prices in our management’s analysis 

ammonia 

we use ammonia together with phosphoric acid to produce dap map and microessentials ®  we consumed approximately 15 million tonnes of ammonia during 2016  production of one tonne of dap requires approximately 023 tonnes of ammonia 

our florida ammonia needs are currently supplied under multiyear contracts with both domestic and offshore producers ammonia for our new wales and riverview plants is terminaled through an owned ammonia facility at port sutton florida ammonia for our bartow plant is terminaled through another ammonia facility owned and operated by a third party at port sutton florida pursuant to an agreement that provides for service through 2019 with automatic renewal for an additional twoyear period unless either party terminates as provided in the agreement ammonia is transported by pipeline from the terminals to our production facilities we have service agreements with the operators of the pipelines for bartow new wales and riverview which provide service through june 30 2017 the service agreements may be extended in one year increments unless either party objects ammonia for our plant city facility is terminaled through an owned facility in tampa florida that was acquired as part of the cf phosphate assets acquisition this ammonia is transported by rail via leased railcars the leases for rail cars expire in 2017 2018 and 2019 

in 2013 we entered into an ammonia supply agreement with cf the  cf ammonia supply agreement  that commenced in 2017 under which mosaic agreed to purchase approximately 545000 to 725000 tonnes of ammonia per year during a term that may extend until december 31 2032 at a price tied to the prevailing price of us natural gas for 2017 our remaining minimum purchase obligation is approximately 410000 tonnes following our entry into a separate arrangement with cf under which we were deemed to have purchased approximately 135000 tonnes in exchange for providing ammonia storage space and use of related terminal facilities to cf a specialized tug and barge unit is currently under construction for use in transporting the ammonia and is expected to be operational in the second half of 2017 additional information about the unit and its financing is provided in note 16  of our consolidated financial statements upon completion of the unit we expect a majority of the ammonia purchased under the cf ammonia supply agreement to be received by barge at the port of tampa and delivered to our florida facilities as described in the preceding paragraph while the market prices of natural gas and 

ammonia have changed since we executed this agreement in 2013 we continue to expect that the agreement will provide us a competitive advantage over its term including by providing a reliable longterm ammonia supply 

we produce ammonia at faustina louisiana primarily for our own consumption our annual capacity is approximately 500000 tonnes from time to time we sell surplus ammonia to unrelated parties in addition under certain circumstances we are permitted to receive ammonia at faustina under the cf ammonia supply agreement 

although ammonia is readily available from many different suppliers and can be transported to our phosphates facilities by a variety of means ammonia is an important raw material used in our business that has in the past been and may in the future be the subject of volatile pricing and alternative transportation and terminaling facilities might not have sufficient capacity to fully serve all of our facilities in the event of a disruption to existing transportation or terminaling facilities changes in the price of ammonia or disruptions to ammonia transportation or terminaling could have a material impact on our business we have included a discussion of ammonia prices in our management’s analysis 

natural gas for phosphates 

natural gas is the primary raw material used to manufacture ammonia at our faustina facility ammonia is manufactured on site the majority of natural gas is purchased through firm delivery contracts based on published indexbased prices and is sourced from texas and louisiana via pipelines interconnected to the henry hub we use overthecounter swap andor option contracts to forward price portions of future gas purchases we typically purchase approximately 18 million mmbtu of natural gas per year for use in ammonia production at faustina 

our ammonia requirements for our florida operations are purchased rather than manufactured on site so while we typically purchase approximately two million mmbtu of natural gas per year in florida it is only used as a thermal fuel for various phosphate production processes 

florida land holdings 

we are a significant landowner in the state of florida which has in the past been considered one of the fastest areas of population growth in the united states we own land comprising over 290000 acres held in fee simple title in central florida and have the right to mine additional properties which contain phosphate rock reserves some of our land holdings are needed to operate our phosphates business while a portion of our land assets such as certain reclaimed properties are no longer required for our ongoing operations as a general matter more of our reclaimed property becomes available for uses other than for phosphate operations each year our real property assets are generally comprised of concentrates plants port facilities phosphate mines and other property which we have acquired through our presence in florida our longterm future land use strategy is to optimize the value of our land assets for example we developed streamsong resort ®  the  resort  a destination resort and conference center in an area of previously mined land as part of our longterm business strategy to maximize the value and utility of our extensive land holdings in florida in addition to the two golf courses and clubhouse that were opened in december 2012 the resort and conference center opened in january 2014 in 2015 in response to market demand we began construction of a third golf course and ancillary facilities which are expected to be completed in 2017 

potash segment 

we are one of the leading potash producers in the world we mine and process potash in canada and the united states and sell potash in north america and internationally the term “potash” applies generally to the common salts of potassium muriate of potash “ mop ” is the primary source of potassium for the crop nutrient industry red mop has traces of iron oxide the granular and standard grade red mop products are well suited for direct fertilizer application and bulk blending white mop has a higher percent potassium oxide “ k 2 o ” white mop besides being well suited for the agricultural market is used in many industrial applications we also produce a double sulfate of potash magnesia product which we market under our brand name kmag ®  at our carlsbad new mexico facility 

our potash products are marketed worldwide to crop nutrient manufacturers distributors and retailers and are also used in the manufacturing of mixed crop nutrients and to a lesser extent in animal feed ingredients we also sell potash to customers for industrial use in addition our potash products are used for deicing and as a water softener regenerant 

in 2016  we operated three potash mines in canada including two shaft mines with a total of three production shafts and one solution mine as well as one potash shaft mine in the united states we also own related refineries at each of the mines 

we continue the expansion of capacity in our potash segment with the k3 shafts at our esterhazy mine which are expected to begin mining potash ore in 2017 and following rampup to add an estimated 09 million tonnes to our annual potash 

operational capacity this will provide for an infrastructure to move ore from k3 to the k1 and k2 mills giving us the flexibility to optimize production at k1 k2 and k3 in order to mitigate risk from current and future brine inflows 

it is possible that the costs of remedial efforts at esterhazy may further increase in the future and that such an increase could be material or in the extreme scenario that the brine inflows risk to employees or remediation costs may increase to a level which would cause us to change our mining processes or abandon the mines see “key factors that can affect results of operations and financial condition” and “potash net sales and gross margin” in our management’s analysis and “our esterhazy mine has had an inflow of salt saturated brine for more than 30 years” in part i item 1a “risk factors” in this report which are incorporated herein by reference for a discussion of costs risks and other information relating to the brine inflows 

the map below shows the location of each of our potash mines 

  

our current potash annualized operational capacity totals 99 million  tonnes of product per year and accounts for approximately 14 of world annual capacity and 43 of north american annual capacity production during 2016  totaled 76 million  tonnes we account for approximately 12 of estimated world annual production and 39 of estimated north american annual production 

the following table shows for each of our potash mines annual capacity as of december 31 2016  and volume of mined ore average grade and finished product output for years 2016  2015  and 2014  



 



canadian mines 

we operate three canadian potash facilities all located in the southern half of the province of saskatchewan including our solution mine at belle plaine two interconnected mine shafts at our esterhazy shaft mine and our shaft mine at colonsay 

extensive potash deposits are found in the southern half of the province of saskatchewan the potash ore is contained in a predominantly rock salt formation known as the prairie evaporites the prairie evaporites deposits are bounded by limestone formations and contain the potash beds three potash deposits of economic importance occur in saskatchewan the esterhazy belle plaine and patience lake members the patience lake member is mined at colonsay and the esterhazy member at esterhazy at belle plaine all three members are mined each of the major potash members contains several potash beds of different thicknesses and grades the particular beds mined at colonsay and esterhazy have a mining height of 11 and 8 feet respectively at belle plaine several beds of different thicknesses are mined 

our potash mines in canada produce mop exclusively esterhazy and colonsay utilize shaft mining while belle plaine utilizes solution mining technology traditional potash shaft mining takes place underground at depths of over 1000 meters where continuous mining machines cut out the ore face and load it onto conveyor belts the ore is then crushed moved to storage bins and hoisted to refineries above ground in contrast our solution mining process involves heated brine which is pumped through a “cluster” to dissolve the potash in the ore beds at a depth of approximately 1500 meters a cluster consists of a series of boreholes drilled into the potash ore a separate distribution center at each cluster controls the brine flow the solution containing dissolved potash and salt is pumped to a refinery where sodium chloride a coproduct of this process is separated from the potash through the use of evaporation and crystallization techniques concurrently the solution is pumped into a cooling pond where additional crystallization occurs and the resulting product is recovered via a floating dredge refined potash is dewatered dried and sized our canadian operations produce 13 different mop products including industrial grades many through proprietary processes 

our potash mineral rights in the province of saskatchewan consist of the following 



we believe that our mineral rights in saskatchewan are sufficient to support current operations for more than a century leases are generally renewable at our option for successive terms generally 21 years each except that certain of the acres shown above as “leased from others” are leased under longterm leases with terms including renewals at our option that expire from 2023 to 2170 

we pay canadian resource taxes consisting of the potash production tax and resource surcharge the potash production tax is a saskatchewan provincial tax on potash production and consists of a base payment and a profits tax we also pay a percentage of the value of resource sales from our saskatchewan mines in addition to the canadian resource taxes royalties are payable to the mineral owners in respect of potash reserves or production of potash we have included a further discussion of the canadian resource taxes and royalties in our management’s analysis 

since december 1985 we have effectively managed an inflow of salt saturated brine into our esterhazy mine at various times since then we have experienced changing amounts and patterns of brine inflows at esterhazy to date the brine inflow including our remediation efforts to control it has not had a material impact on our production processes or volumes the volume of the net brine inflow the rate of inflow less the amount we are pumping out of the mine or net outflow when we are pumping more brine out of the mine than the rate of inflow fluctuates and is dependent on a number of variables such as the location of the source of the inflow the magnitude of the inflow available pumping surface and underground brine storage capacities underground injection well capacities and the effectiveness of calcium chloride and cementatious grout used to reduce or prevent the inflows among other factors as a result of these brine inflows we incur expenditures certain of which have been capitalized and others that have been charged to expense in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 

it is possible that the costs of remedial efforts at esterhazy may further increase in the future and that such an increase could be material or in the extreme scenario that the brine inflows risk to employees or remediation costs may increase to a level which would cause us to change our mining processes or abandon the mine see “key factors that can affect results of operations and financial condition” and “potash net sales and gross margin” in our management’s analysis and “our esterhazy mine has had an inflow of salt saturated brine for more than 30 years” in part i item 1a “risk factors” in this report which are incorporated herein by reference for a discussion of costs risks and other information relating to the brine inflows the k3 shafts at our esterhazy mine are part of our potash expansion plan which is also designed to mitigate risk from current and future inflows 

due to the ongoing brine inflow at esterhazy subject to exceptions that are limited in scope and amount we are unable to obtain insurance coverage for underground operations for water incursion problems like other potash producers’ shaft mines our colonsay saskatchewan and carlsbad new mexico mines are also subject to the risks of inflow of water as a result of their shaft mining operations but water inflow risks at these mines are included in our insurance coverage subject to deductibles limited coverage terms and lower sublimits negotiated with our insurers 

united states mine 

in the united states we have a shaft mine located in carlsbad new mexico the ore reserves at our carlsbad mine are made up of langbeinite a double sulfate of potassium and magnesium this type of potash reserve occurs in a predominantly rock salt formation known as the salado formation the mcnutt member of this formation consists of eleven units of economic importance of which we currently mine one the mcnutt member’s evaporite deposits are interlayered with anhydrite polyhalite potassium salts clay and minor amounts of sandstone and siltstone 

continuous underground mining methods are utilized to extract the ore drum type mining machines are used to cut the langbeinite ore from the face mined ore is then loaded onto conveyors transported to storage areas and then hoisted to the surface for further processing at our refinery 

effective january 1 2015 we only produce a double sulfate of potash magnesia product which we market under our brand name kmag ®  at our carlsbad facility prior to 2015 we also produced mop at this facility 

at the carlsbad facility we mine and refine potash from 77141 acres of mineral rights we control these reserves pursuant to either i leases from the us government that in general continue in effect at our option subject to readjustment by the us government every 20 years or ii leases from the state of new mexico that continue as long as we continue to produce from them these reserves contain an estimated total of 161 million tonnes of potash mineralization calculated after estimated extraction losses in one mining bed evaluated at thicknesses ranging from 55 feet to in excess of 11 feet at average refinery rates these ore reserves are estimated to be sufficient to yield 32 million tonnes of langbeinite concentrates with an average grade of approximately 21 k 2 o at projected rates of production we estimate that carlsbad’s reserves of langbeinite are sufficient to support operations for approximately 48 years 

royalties for the us operations amounted to approximately 67 million in 2016  these royalties are established by the us department of the interior bureau of land management in the case of the carlsbad leases from the us government and pursuant to provisions set forth in the leases in the case of the carlsbad state leases 

reserves 

our estimates below of our potash reserves and nonreserve potash mineralization are based on exploration drill hole data seismic data and actual mining results over more than 35 years proven reserves are estimated by identifying material in place that is delineated on at least two sides and material in place within a halfmile radius or distance from an existing sampled mine entry or exploration core hole probable reserves are estimated by identifying material in place within a one mile radius from an existing sampled mine entry or exploration core hole historical extraction ratios from the many years of mining results are then applied to both types of material to estimate the proven and probable reserves we believe that all reserves and nonreserve potash mineralization reported below are potentially recoverable using existing production shaft and refinery locations 

our estimated recoverable potash ore reserves and nonreserve potash mineralization as of december 31 2016  for each of our mines are as follows 



 

 as discussed more fully above we either own the reserves and mineralization shown above or lease them pursuant to mineral leases that generally remain in effect or are renewable at our option or are longterm leases accordingly we expect to be able to mine all reported reserves that are leased prior to termination or expiration of the existing leases 

natural gas 

natural gas is used at our belle plaine solution mine as a fuel to produce steam and to dry potash products the steam is used to generate electricity and provide thermal energy to the evaporation crystallization and solution mining processes the belle plaine solution mine typically accounts for approximately 79 of our potash segment’s total natural gas requirements for potash production at our shaft mines natural gas is used as a fuel to heat fresh air supplied to the shaft mines and for drying potash products combined natural gas usage for both the solution and shaft mines totaled 17 million mmbtu during 2016  we purchase our natural gas requirements on firm delivery index pricebased physical contracts and on short term spotpriced physical contracts our canadian operations purchase all of their physical gas in saskatchewan using aeco price indices references and transport the gas to our plants via the transgas pipeline system the us potash operation in new mexico purchases physical gas in the southwest respective regional market using the transwestern el paso permian basin market pricing reference we use financial derivative contracts to manage the pricing on portions of our natural gas requirements 

international distribution segment 

our international distribution segment markets phosphate potash and nitrogenbased crop nutrients and animal feed ingredients and provides other ancillary services to wholesalers cooperatives independent retailers and farmers in south america and the asiapacific regions in 2016  our international distribution segment purchased 22 million tonnes of phosphatebased products from our phosphates segment and 20 million tonnes of potash products from our potash segment and canpotex our international distribution operations also purchase phosphates potash and nitrogen products from unrelated third parties which we either use to produce blended crop nutrients “ blends ” or for resale our international distribution segment provides our phosphates and potash segments access to key markets outside of north america 

our international distribution segment’s production facilities include blending plants and an ssp plant that produces crop nutrients by mixing sulfuric acid with phosphate rock a blending plant combines several crop nutrient products to make a mixture tailored to specific crop requirements we lease various warehouses depending on sales and production levels 

the following maps show the locations of our primary international distribution segment operations in south america and asia 

     

  

international distribution  south america operations 

we are one of the largest producers and distributors of blended crop nutrients for agricultural use in brazil we own and operate twelve blending plants in brazil and one blending plant and port in paraguay in addition we lease several other warehouses and blending units depending on sales and production levels we also have a 62 ownership interest in fospar sa “ fospar ” fospar owns and operates an ssp granulation plant and a deepwater crop nutrition port and throughput warehouse terminal facility in paranagua brazil together these plants provide the capability to annually distribute approximately 60 million tonnes of crop nutrients in brazil and paraguay the port facility at paranagua handles approximately 26 million tonnes of imported crop nutrients in 2016 we sold approximately 57 million tonnes of crop nutrient products in south america 

in 2015 we completed the integration of our december 2014 purchase of adms fertilizer distribution business in brazil and paraguay in connection with the acquisition we also negotiated the terms of fiveyear fertilizer supply agreements whereby we supply adms fertilizer needs in brazil and paraguay 

on december 19 2016 we entered into an agreement to acquire vale sas global phosphate and potash operations conducted through vale fertilizantes sa for a purchase price valued at 25 billion consisting of 125 billion in cash and 42286874 shares of mosaic common stock upon closing the acquisition mosaic expects to become the leading fertilizer production and distribution company in brazil this transaction is expected to close in late 2017 and remains subject to the satisfaction of closing conditions additional information about the proposed transaction is provided in note 24 to our consolidated financial statements 

  international distribution  asiapacific operations 

in china we own two 300000tonne per year capacity blending plants in 2016 we sold our 35 interest in a joint venture of a dap production plant in 2016  we sold approximately 230000 tonnes of blends and distributed another 310000 tonnes of phosphate and potash crop nutrients in china 

in india we have distribution facilities to import and sell crop nutrients in 2016  we distributed approximately 590000 tonnes of phosphate and potash crop nutrient products in india we also serve as a marketing agent for our phosphates segment 

sales and distribution activities 

united states and canada 

we have a united states and canada sales and marketing team that serves our business segments we sell to wholesale distributors retail chains cooperatives independent retailers and national accounts 

customer service and the ability to effectively minimize the overall supply chain costs are key competitive factors in the crop nutrient and animal feed ingredients businesses in addition to our production facilities to service the needs of our customers we own lease or have contractual throughput or other arrangements at strategically located distribution warehouses along or near the mississippi and ohio rivers as well as in other key agricultural regions of the united states and canada from these facilities we distribute mosaicproduced phosphate and potash products for customers who in turn resell the product into the distribution channel or directly to farmers in the united states and canada 

we own port facilities in tampa florida and houston texas which have deep water berth capabilities providing access to the gulf of mexico we will discontinue operations at the houston texas facility in 2017 and then expect to sell the facility we also own warehouse distribution facilities in savage minnesota pekin illinois and henderson kentucky

outside of the united states and canada we market our phosphates segments products through our international distribution segment as well as a salesforce focused on geographies outside of north america the countries that account for the largest amount of our phosphates sales outside the united states by volume are brazil canada india australia and mexico 

our sales outside of the united states and canada of saskatchewan potash products are made through canpotex canpotex sales are allocated among its members based on peaking capacity effective january 1 2016 our share of canpotex sales decreased to 381 from 406 as canpotexs other members demonstrated a change in capacity 

our potash exports from carlsbad are sold through our own sales force we also market our potash segment’s products through our international distribution segment which acquires potash primarily through canpotex the countries that account for the largest amount of international potash sales by volume are brazil china indonesia india and malaysia 

to service the needs of our customers our international distribution segment includes a network of strategically located sales offices crop nutrient blending and bagging facilities port terminals and warehouse distribution facilities that we own and operate in key geographic areas throughout several countries the blending and bagging facilities primarily produce blends from phosphate potash and nitrogen the average product mix in our blends by volume contains approximately 50 phosphate 35 potash and 15 nitrogen although this mix differs based on seasonal and other factors our international distribution segments operations serve primarily as a sales outlet for our north american phosphates production both for resale and as an input for blends our potash segment also has historically furnished the majority of the raw materials needs for the production of blends primarily via canpotex and is expected to continue to do so in the future 

other products 

with a strong brand position in a multibillion dollar animal feed ingredients global market our phosphates segment supplies animal feed ingredients for poultry and livestock to customers in north america latin america and asia our potash sales to nonagricultural users are primarily to large industrial accounts and the animal feed industry additionally we sell potash for deicing and as a water softener regenerant as well as fluorosilicic acid for water fluoridation 

competition 

because crop nutrients are global commodities available from numerous sources crop nutrition companies compete primarily on the basis of delivered price other competitive factors include product quality cost and availability of raw materials customer service plant efficiency and availability of product as a result markets for our products are highly competitive we compete with a broad range of domestic and international producers including farmer cooperatives subsidiaries of larger companies and independent crop nutrient companies foreign competitors often have access to cheaper raw materials are required to comply with less stringent regulatory requirements or are owned or subsidized by governments and as a result may have cost advantages over north american companies we believe that our extensive north american and international production and distribution system provides us with a competitive advantage by allowing us to achieve economies of scale transportation and storage efficiencies and obtain market intelligence also we believe our premium products provide us a competitive advantage with customers in north and south america 

unlike many of our competitors we have our own distribution system to sell phosphate and potashbased crop nutrients and animal feed ingredients whether produced by us or by other third parties around the globe in north america we have one of the largest and most strategically located distribution systems for crop nutrients including warehouse facilities in key agricultural regions we also have an extensive network of distribution facilities internationally including in the key growth regions of south america and asia with port terminals warehouses and blending plants in brazil paraguay china and india our global presence allows us to efficiently serve customers in approximately 40 countries 

phosphates segment 

our phosphates segment operates in a highly competitive global market among the competitors in the global phosphate industry are domestic and foreign companies as well as foreign governmentsupported producers in asia and north africa phosphate producers compete primarily based on price as well as product quality service and innovation major integrated producers of feed phosphates are located in the united states europe and china many smaller producers are located in emerging markets around the world many of these smaller producers are not miners of phosphate rock or manufacturers of phosphoric acid and are required to purchase this material on the open market 

we believe that we are a lowcost integrated producer of phosphatebased crop nutrients due in part to our scale vertical integration and strategic network of production and distribution facilities as the world’s largest producer of concentrated phosphates as well as the second largest miner of phosphate rock in the world and the largest in the united states we maintain an advantage over some competitors as the scale of operations effectively reduces production costs per unit we are also vertically integrated to captively supply one of our key inputs phosphate rock to our phosphate production facilities we believe that our position as an integrated producer of phosphate rock provides us with a significant cost advantage over competitors that are nonintegrated phosphate producers our investment in the miski mayo mine and related commercial offtake supply agreement to purchase a share of the phosphate rock allows us to supplement our overall phosphate rock needs in addition we expect that mwspc will enable us to not only further diversify our sources of phosphates but also improve our access to key agricultural countries in asia and the middle east 

we produce ammonia at our faustina louisiana concentrates plant in quantities sufficient to meet approximately one quarter of our total ammonia needs with no captive ammonia production in florida we are subject to significant volatility in our purchase price of ammonia from world markets the cf ammonia supply agreement is expected to provide us with a longterm supply of a substantial volume of ammonia at prices based on the price of natural gas and is intended to lessen this volatility 

with our dedicated sulfur transportation barges and tugs and our 50 ownership interest in gulf sulphur services we are also wellpositioned to source an adequate flexible and costeffective supply of sulfur our third key input we believe that our investments in sulfur assets continue to afford us a competitive advantage compared to other producers in cost and access to sulfur 

with facilities in both central florida and louisiana we are logistically well positioned to fulfill our needs at very competitive prices those multiple production points also afford us the flexibility to optimally balance supply and demand 

potash segment 

potash is a commodity available from several geographical regions around the world and consequently the market is highly competitive through our participation in canpotex we compete outside of north america against various independent and 

stateowned potash producers canpotex has substantial expertise and logistical resources for the international distribution of potash including strategically located export assets in portland oregon st john new brunswick and vancouver british columbia our principal methods of competition with respect to the sale of potash include product pricing and offering consistent highquality products and superior service we believe that our potash cost structure is competitive in the industry and should improve as we continue to complete our potash expansion projects 

international distribution segment 

our international distribution segment generally operates in highly competitive business environments in each of its markets competing with local businesses and with products that are available from many other sources we believe that our international distribution segments vertical integration with our own production businesses as well as our focus on product innovation and customer solutions position us with an advantage over many of our competitors we have a strong brand in the countries in which we have international distribution activities in addition to having access to our own production our international distribution activities have the capability to supply a wide variety of crop nutrients to our dealerfarmer customer base our strategic positions in brazil paraguay china and india allow us to capitalize on the nutrient demand in these large and growing international regions 

factors affecting demand 

our results of operations historically have reflected the effects of several external factors which are beyond our control and have in the past produced significant downward and upward swings in operating results revenues are highly dependent upon conditions in the agriculture industry and can be affected by among other factors crop conditions changes in agricultural production practices worldwide economic conditions including the increasing world population household incomes and demand for more proteinrich food particularly in developing regions such as china india and latin america changing demand for biofuels variability in commodity pricing governmental policies the level of inventories in the crop nutrient distribution channels customer expectations about farmer economics future crop nutrient prices and availability and transportation costs among other matters market trends in raw material costs market prices for crop nutrients and weather furthermore our crop nutrients business is seasonal to the extent farmers and agricultural enterprises in the markets in which we compete purchase more crop nutrient products during the spring and fall the international scope of our business spanning the northern and southern hemispheres reduces to some extent the seasonal impact on our business the degree of seasonality of our business can change significantly from year to year due to conditions in the agricultural industry and other factors the seasonal nature of our businesses requires significant working capital for inventory in advance of the planting seasons 

we sell products throughout the world unfavorable changes in trade protection laws policies and measures government policies and other regulatory requirements affecting trade unexpected changes in tax and trade treaties strengthening or weakening of foreign economies as well as political relations with the united states may cause sales trends to customers in one or more foreign countries to differ from sales trends in the united states 

our international operations are subject to risks from changes in foreign currencies or government policy which can affect local farmer economics 

other matters 

employees 

we had approximately 8700 employees as of december 31 2016  consisting of approximately 3600 salaried and 5100 hourly employees 

labor relations 

as of december 31 2016    



 failure to renew any of our union agreements could result in a strike or labor stoppage that could have a material adverse effect on our operations however we have not experienced significant work stoppage in many years and historically have had good labor relations

 item 1a risk factors 

our business financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of the risks and uncertainties described below 

our esterhazy mine has had an inflow of salt saturated brine for more than 30 years 

since december 1985 we have had inflows of salt saturated brine into our esterhazy saskatchewan mine over the past century several potash mines experiencing water inflow problems have flooded in order to control brine inflows at esterhazy we have incurred and will continue to incur expenditures certain of which due to their nature have been capitalized while others have been charged to expense 

at various times we experience changing amounts and patterns of brine inflows at the esterhazy mine periodically some of these inflows have exceeded available pumping capacity if that were to continue for several months without abatement it could exceed our available storage capacity and ability to effectively manage the brine inflow this could adversely affect production at the esterhazy mine the brine inflow is variable resulting in both net inflows the rate of inflow is more than the amount we are pumping out of the mine and net outflows when we are pumping more brine out of the mine than the rate of inflow there can be no assurance that   

 from time to time new or improved technology becomes available to facilitate our remediation of the inflows such as when horizontal drilling techniques were developed and refined taking advantage of these new or improved technologies may require significant capital expenditures andor may increase our costs of remediation 

it is possible that the costs of remedial efforts at esterhazy may further increase in the future and that such an increase could be material or in the extreme scenario that the brine inflows risk to employees or remediation costs may increase to a level which would cause us to change our mining processes or abandon the mines see “key factors that can affect results of operations and financial condition” and “potash net sales and gross margin” in our management’s analysis which is incorporated herein by reference for a discussion of costs risks and other information relating to the brine inflows 

due to the ongoing brine inflow at esterhazy subject to exceptions that are limited in scope and amount we are unable to obtain insurance coverage for underground operations for water incursion problems our mines at colonsay saskatchewan and carlsbad new mexico are also subject to the risks of inflow of water as a result of our shaft mining operations 

our operating results are highly dependent upon and fluctuate based upon business and economic conditions and governmental policies affecting the agricultural industry where we or our customers operate these factors are outside of our control and may significantly affect our profitability 

our operating results are highly dependent upon business and economic conditions and governmental policies affecting the agricultural industry which we cannot control the agricultural products business can be affected by a number of factors the most important of these factors for us markets are   

 international market conditions which are also outside of our control may also significantly influence our operating results the international market for crop nutrients is influenced by such factors as the relative value of the us dollar and its impact upon the cost of importing crop nutrients foreign agricultural policies including subsidy policies the existence of or changes in import or foreign currency exchange barriers in certain foreign markets changes in the hard currency demands of certain countries and other regulatory policies of foreign governments as well as the laws and policies of the united states affecting foreign trade and investment 

our most important products are global commodities and we face intense global competition from other crop nutrient producers that can affect our prices and volumes 

our most important products are concentrated phosphate crop nutrients including diammonium phosphate or dap monoammonium phosphate or map microessentials ®  and muriate of potash or mop we sell most of our dap map and mop in the form of global commodities our sales of these products face intense global competition from other crop nutrient producers 

changes in competitors’ production or shifts in their marketing focus have in the past significantly affected both the prices at which we sell our products and the volumes that we sell and are likely to continue to do so in the future 

competitors are more likely to increase their production at times when world agricultural and crop nutrient markets are strong and to focus on sales into regions where their returns are highest increases in the global supply of dap map and mop or competitors’ increased sales into regions in which we have significant sales could adversely affect our prices and volumes 

competitors and potential new entrants in the markets for both concentrated phosphate crop nutrients and potash have in recent years expanded capacity or begun or announced plans to expand capacity or build new facilities the extent to which current global or local economic and financial conditions changes in global or local economic and financial conditions or other factors may cause delays or cancellation of some of these ongoing or planned projects or result in the acceleration of existing or new projects is unclear in addition the level of exports by producers of concentrated phosphate crop nutrients in china depends to a significant extent on chinese government actions to curb exports through among other measures prohibitive export taxes at times when the government believes it desirable to assure ample domestic supplies of concentrated phosphate crop nutrients to stimulate grain and oilseed production 

in addition some of our competitors who are expanding their potash production capacity include other members of canpotex canpotex members’ respective shares of canpotex sales is based upon the members’ respective proven peaking capacity for producing potash when a canpotex member expands its production capacity the new capacity is added to that member’s proven peaking capacity based on a proving run at the maximum production level alternatively after january 2017 canpotex members may elect to rely on an independent engineering firm and approved protocols to calculate their proven peaking capacity antitrust and competition laws prohibit the members of canpotex from coordinating their production decisions including the timing of their respective proving runs worldwide potash production levels during these proving runs could exceed thencurrent market demand resulting in an oversupply of potash and lower potash prices 

we cannot accurately predict when or whether competitors’ or new entrants’ ongoing or planned capacity expansions or new facilities will be completed the timing of competitors’ tests to prove peaking capacity for canpotex purposes the cumulative effect of these and recently completed expansions the impact of future decisions by the chinese government on the level of chinese exports of concentrated phosphate crop nutrients or the effects of these or other actions by our competitors on the prices for our products or the volumes that we will be able to sell 

our crop nutrients and other products are subject to price and demand volatility resulting from periodic imbalances of supply and demand which may cause our results of operations to fluctuate 

historically the market for crop nutrients has been cyclical and prices and demand for our products have fluctuated to a significant extent particularly for phosphates and to a lesser extent potash periods of high demand increasing profits and high capacity utilization tend to lead to new plant investment and increased production this growth increases supply until the market is oversaturated leading to declining prices and declining capacity utilization until the cycle repeats 

as a result crop nutrient prices and volumes have been volatile this price and volume volatility may cause our results of operations to fluctuate and potentially deteriorate the price at which we sell our crop nutrient products and our sales volumes could fall in the event of industry oversupply conditions which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations in contrast high prices may lead our customers and farmers to delay purchasing decisions in anticipation of future lower prices thus impacting our sales volumes 

due to reduced market demand depressed agricultural economic conditions and other factors we and our predecessors have at various times suspended or reduced production at some of our facilities the extent to which we utilize available capacity at our facilities will cause fluctuations in our results of operations as we will incur costs for any temporary or indefinite shutdowns of our facilities and lower sales tend to lead to higher fixed costs as a percentage of sales 

variations in crop nutrient application rates may exacerbate the cyclicality of the crop nutrient markets 

farmers are able to maximize their economic return by applying optimum amounts of crop nutrients farmers’ decisions about the application rate for each crop nutrient or to forego application of a crop nutrient particularly phosphate and potash vary from year to year depending on a number of factors including among others crop prices crop nutrient and other crop input costs or the level of the crop nutrient remaining in the soil following the previous harvest farmers are more likely to increase application rates when crop prices are relatively high crop nutrient and other crop input costs are relatively low and the level of the crop nutrient remaining in the soil is relatively low conversely farmers are likely to reduce or forego application when farm economics are weak or declining or the level of the crop nutrients remaining in the soil is relatively high this variability in application rates can materially accentuate the cyclicality in prices for our products and our sales volumes 

our crop nutrient business is seasonal which may result in carrying significant amounts of inventory and seasonal variations in working capital and our inability to predict future seasonal crop nutrient demand accurately may result in excess inventory or product shortages 

the crop nutrient business is seasonal farmers tend to apply crop nutrients during two short application periods the strongest one in the spring before planting and the other in the fall after harvest as a result the strongest demand for our products typically occurs during the spring planting season with a second period of strong demand following the fall harvest in contrast we and other crop nutrient producers generally produce our products throughout the year as a result we andor our customers generally build inventories during the low demand periods of the year in order to ensure timely product availability during the peak sales seasons the seasonality of crop nutrient demand results in our sales volumes and net sales typically being the highest during the north american spring season and our working capital requirements typically being the highest just prior to the start of the spring season our quarterly financial results can vary significantly from one year to the next due to weatherrelated shifts in planting schedules and purchasing patterns 

if seasonal demand exceeds our projections we will not have enough product and our customers may acquire products from our competitors which would negatively impact our profitability if seasonal demand is less than we expect we will be left with excess inventory and higher working capital and liquidity requirements the degree of seasonality of our business can change significantly from year to year due to conditions in the agricultural industry and other factors 

the distribution channels for crop nutrients have capacity to build significant levels of inventories which can adversely affect our sales volumes and selling prices 

in order to balance the production needs of crop nutrient producers with farmers’ seasonal use of crop nutrients crop nutrient distribution channels need to have the capacity to build significant inventories the buildup of inventories in the distribution channels can become excessive particularly during the cyclical periods of low demand that have been typical in the crop nutrient industry when there are excessive inventories in the distribution channel our sales volumes and selling prices can be adversely impacted even during periods in which farmers’ use of crop nutrients may remain strong 

changes in transportation costs can affect our sales volumes and selling prices 

the cost of delivery is a significant factor in the total cost to customers and farmers of crop nutrients as a result changes in transportation costs or in customer expectations about them can affect our sales volumes and prices 

customer expectations about future events can have a significant effect on the demand for our products these expectations can significantly affect our sales volumes and selling prices 

customer expectations about future events have had and are expected to continue to have an effect on the demand and prices for crop nutrients future events that may be affected by customer expectations include among others   

 customer expectations about selling prices and availability of crop nutrients have had and are expected to continue to have an effect on the demand for crop nutrients when customers anticipate increasing crop nutrient selling prices customers tend to accumulate inventories before the anticipated price increases this can result in a lag in our realization of rising market prices for our products conversely customers tend to delay their purchases when they anticipate future selling prices for crop nutrients will stabilize or decrease adversely affecting our sales volumes and selling prices customer expectations about availability of crop nutrients can have similar effects on sales volumes and prices   

 similarly customer expectations about future farmer economics have had and are expected to continue to have an effect on the demand for crop nutrients when customers anticipate improving farmer economics customers tend to accumulate crop nutrient inventories in anticipation of increasing sales volumes and selling prices this can result in a lag in our realization of rising market prices for our products conversely when customers anticipate declining farmer economics customers tend to reduce the level of their purchases of crop nutrients adversely affecting our sales volumes and selling prices   

 as discussed above increasing transportation costs effectively increase customers’ and farmers’ costs for crop nutrients and can reduce the amount we realize for our sales expectations of decreasing transportation costs can result in customers and farmers anticipating that they may be able to decrease their costs by delaying purchases as a result changes in customer expectations about transportation costs can affect our sales volumes and prices 

we conduct our operations primarily through a limited number of key production and distribution facilities any disruption at one of these facilities could have a material adverse impact on our business the risk of material disruption increases when demand for our products results in high operating rates at our facilities 

we conduct our operations through a limited number of key production and distribution facilities these facilities include our phosphate mines and concentrates plants our potash mines and the ports and other distribution facilities through which we canpotex and any joint ventures in which we participate conduct our respective businesses as well as other commercial arrangements with unrelated third parties any disruption of operations at one of these facilities has the possibility of significantly affecting our production or our ability to distribute our products operating these facilities at high rates during periods of high demand for our products increases the risk of mechanical or structural failures decreases the time available for routine maintenance and increases the impact on our operating results from any disruption a disruption of operations at one of our key facilities could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 

examples of the types of events that could result in a disruption at one of these facilities include adverse weather strikes or other work stoppages deliberate malicious acts including acts of terrorism political and economic instability cyber attacks and other risks associated with our international operations changes in permitting financial assurance or other environmental health and safety laws or other changes in the regulatory environment in which we operate legal and regulatory proceedings our relationships with other members of canpotex and any joint ventures in which we participate and their or our exit from participation in canpotex or any such joint ventures other changes in our commercial arrangements with unrelated third parties brine inflows at our esterhazy saskatchewan mine or our other shaft mines mechanical failure and accidents occurring in the course of operating activities and other factors 

insurance market conditions our loss experience and other factors affect the insurance coverage that we carry and we are not fully insured against all potential hazards and risks incident to our business as a result our insurance coverage may not adequately cover our losses 

we maintain property business interruption and casualty insurance policies but we are not fully insured against all potential hazards and risks incident to our business we are subject to various selfretentions and deductibles under these insurance policies as a result of market conditions our loss experience and other factors our premiums selfretentions and deductibles for insurance policies can increase substantially and in some instances certain insurance may become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage in addition significantly increased costs could lead us to decide to reduce or possibly eliminate coverage as a result a disruption of operations at one of our key facilities or a significant casualty could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 

important raw materials and energy used in our businesses in the past have been and may in the future be the subject of volatile pricing changes in the price of our raw materials could have a material impact on our businesses 

natural gas ammonia and sulfur are key raw materials used in the manufacture of phosphate crop nutrient products natural gas is used as both a chemical feedstock and a fuel to produce anhydrous ammonia which is a raw material used in the production of concentrated phosphate products natural gas is also a significant energy source used in the potash solution mining process from time to time our profitability has been and may in the future be impacted by the price and availability of these raw materials and other energy costs because most of our products are commodities there can be no assurance that we will be able to pass through increased costs to our customers a significant increase in the price of natural gas ammonia 

sulfur or energy costs that is not recovered through an increase in the price of our related crop nutrients products could have a material adverse impact on our business in addition under our longterm cf ammonia supply agreement we have agreed to purchase approximately 545000 to 725000 tonnes of ammonia per year during a term that may extend until december 31 2032 at a price to be determined by a formula based on the prevailing price of us natural gas if the price of natural gas rises or the market price for ammonia falls outside of the range anticipated at execution of the agreement we may not realize a cost benefit from the natural gas based pricing over the term of the agreement or the cost of our ammonia under the agreement could be a competitive disadvantage 

during periods when the price for concentrated phosphates is falling because of falling raw material prices we may experience a lag in realizing the benefits of the falling raw materials prices this lag can adversely affect our gross margins and profitability 

during some periods changes in market prices for raw materials can lead to changes in the global market prices for concentrated phosphate crop nutrients in particular the global market prices for concentrated phosphate crop nutrients can be affected by changes in the market prices for sulfur ammonia phosphate rock andor phosphoric acid raw materials increasing market prices for these raw materials tend to put upward pressure on the selling prices for concentrated phosphate crop nutrients and decreasing market prices for these raw materials tend to put downward pressure on selling prices for concentrated phosphate crop nutrients when the market prices for these raw materials plunge rapidly the selling prices for our concentrated phosphate crop nutrients can fall more rapidly than we are able to consume our raw material inventory that we purchased or committed to purchase in the past at higher prices as a result our costs may not fall as rapidly as the selling prices of our products until we are able to consume the higher priced raw materials our gross margins and profitability can be adversely affected 

during periods when the prices for our products are falling because of falling raw material prices we could be required to writedown the value of our inventories any such writedown would adversely affect our results of operations and the level of our assets 

we carry our inventories at the lower of cost or market in periods when the market prices for our products are falling rapidly in response to falling market prices for raw materials it is possible that we could be required to writedown the value of our inventories if market prices fall below our costs any such writedown would adversely affect our results of operations and the level of our assets any such effect could be material 

our estimates of future selling prices reflect in part the purchase commitments we have from our customers as a result defaults on these existing purchase commitments because of the global or local economic and financial conditions or for other reasons could adversely affect our estimates of future selling prices and require additional inventory writedowns 

in the event of a disruption to existing terminaling facilities or transportation for our products or raw materials alternative terminaling facilities or transportation might not be available on a timely basis or have sufficient capacity to fully serve all of our customers or facilities 

in the event of a disruption of existing terminaling facilities or transportation for our products or raw materials alternative terminaling facilities or transportation might not be available on a timely basis or have sufficient capacity to fully serve all of our customers or facilities 

terminaling facilities and transportation include the ports and other distribution facilities through which we canpotex and the joint ventures in which we participate conduct our respective businesses transportation and related equipment arrangements and other commercial arrangements with unrelated third parties 

examples of the types of events that could result in a disruption of terminaling facilities or transportation include adverse weather strikes or other work stoppages deliberate malicious acts political and economic instability and other risks associated with our international operations changes in permitting financial assurance or other environmental health and safety laws or other changes in the regulatory environment in which we operate legal and regulatory proceedings our relationships with other members of canpotex and any joint ventures in which we participate and their or our exit from participation in canpotex or any such joint ventures other changes in our commercial arrangements with unrelated third parties accidents occurring in the course of operating activities lack of truck rail barge or ship transportation and other factors we discuss a number of these examples in more detail throughout this risk factors section 

we are subject to risks associated with our international sales and operations which could negatively affect our sales to customers in foreign countries as well as our operations and assets in foreign countries some of these factors may also make it less attractive to distribute cash generated by our operations outside the united states to our stockholders or to utilize cash generated by our operations in one country to fund our operations or repayments of indebtedness in another country or to support other corporate purposes 

for 2016  we derived approximately 63  of our net sales from customers located outside of the united states of which our international distribution segment accounted for 56 as a result we are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties relating to international sales and operations including   

 the occurrence of any of the above in the countries in which we operate or elsewhere could jeopardize or limit our ability to transact business there and could adversely affect our revenues and operating results and the value of our assets located outside of the united states 

in addition tax regulations currency exchange controls and other restrictions may also make it economically unattractive to   

 changes in tax laws or regulations or their interpretation or exposure to additional tax liabilities could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

we are subject to taxes including income taxes resource taxes and royalties and other nonincome based taxes in the us canada china brazil and other countries where we operate changes in tax laws or regulations or their interpretation could result in higher taxes which could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

our international assets are located in countries with volatile conditions which could subject us and our assets to significant risks 

we are a global business with substantial assets located outside of the united states and canada our operations in brazil china india and paraguay are a fundamental part of our business we also have joint venture investments in the miski mayo mine in peru that supplies phosphate rock to us and mwspc which is developing a mine and chemical complexes that we presently expect would produce phosphate fertilizers and other downstream products in the kingdom of saudi arabia volatile economic political and market conditions in these and other emerging market countries may have a negative impact on our operations operating results and financial condition in addition unfavorable changes in trade protection laws policies and measures or governmental actions and policies and other regulatory requirements affecting trade and the pricing and sourcing of our raw materials may also have a negative impact on our operations operating results and financial condition 

natural resource extraction is an important part of the economy in peru and in the past there have been protests against other natural resource operations in peru as of the date of this report there remain numerous social conflicts that exist within the natural resource sector in peru and as a result there is potential for active protests against natural resource companies if the government of peru’s proactive efforts to address the social and environmental issues surrounding natural resource activities were not successful protests could extend to or impact the miski mayo mine and adversely affect our investment in the miski mayo joint venture or the supply of phosphate rock to us from the mine 

adverse weather conditions including the impact of hurricanes and excess heat cold snow rainfall and drought have in the past and may in the future adversely affect our operations particularly our phosphates business and result in increased costs decreased production and potential liabilities 

adverse weather conditions including the impact of hurricanes and excess heat cold snow rainfall and drought have in the past and may in the future adversely affect our operations particularly our phosphates business in the past hurricanes have resulted in minor physical damage to our facilities in florida and louisiana in addition a release of process wastewater at our riverview florida facility during a hurricane resulted in a small civil fine settlement for an immaterial amount of claims for natural resource damages by governmental agencies and an ongoing private lawsuit 

additionally water treatment costs particularly at our florida operations due to high water balances tend to increase significantly following excess rainfall from hurricanes or other adverse weather some of our florida facilities have had or could have high water levels that may require treatment high water balances in the past at phosphate facilities in florida also led the florida department of environmental protection  fdep  to adopt new rules requiring phosphate production facilities to meet more stringent process water management objectives for phosphogypsum management systems 

if additional excess rainfall or hurricanes occur in coming years our facilities may be required to take additional measures to manage process water to comply with existing or future requirements and these measures could potentially have a material effect on our business and financial condition 

adverse weather may also cause a loss of production due to disruptions in our supply chain or adversely affect delivery of our products to our customers for example oil refineries that supply sulfur to us may suspend operations as a result of a hurricane and incoming shipments of ammonia can be delayed disrupting production at our florida or louisiana facilities and delivery of our products 

drought can also adversely affect us for example drought can reduce farmers’ crop yields and the uptake of phosphates and potash reducing the need for application of additional phosphates and potash for the next planting season drought can also lower river levels adversely affecting delivery of our products to our customers 

our operations are dependent on having the required permits and approvals from governmental authorities denial or delay by a government agency in issuing any of our permits and approvals or imposition of restrictive conditions on us with respect to these permits and approvals may impair our business and operations 

we hold numerous governmental environmental mining and other permits and approvals authorizing operations at each of our facilities a decision by a government agency to revoke or substantially modify an existing permit or approval could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue operations at the affected facility 

expansion of our operations also is predicated upon securing the necessary environmental or other permits or approvals over the next several years we and our subsidiaries will be continuing our efforts to obtain permits in support of our anticipated florida mining operations at certain of our properties 

a denial of or delay in issuing these permits the issuance of permits with costprohibitive conditions legal actions that prevent us from relying on permits or revocation of permits could prevent us from mining at these properties and thereby have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

for example   



wetlands permit alleging that the corps’ actions in issuing the permit violated several federal laws relating to the protection of the environment preliminary injunctions entered into in connection with this lawsuit resulted in shutdowns or reduced production at our south fort meade mine until april 2012 following a settlement of the lawsuit in february 2012 and court approval we were able to resume normal production at our south fort meade mine 

the periods of shutdown and reduced phosphate rock production at our south fort meade mine resulted in costs to suspend operations and idle plant costs lower phosphate rock mining production levels also adversely affected gross margin   

we have included additional discussion about permitting for our phosphate mines in florida under “environmental health safety and security matters—operating requirements and impacts—permitting” in our management’s analysis 

we are subject to financial assurance requirements as part of our routine business operations these financial assurance requirements affect our costs and increase our liquidity requirements if we were unable to satisfy applicable financial assurance requirements we might not be able to obtain or maintain permits we need to operate our business as we have in the past our need to comply with these requirements could materially affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

in many cases as a condition to procuring or maintaining permits and approvals or otherwise we are required to comply with financial assurance requirements of governmental authorities the purpose of these requirements is to provide comfort to the government that sufficient funds will be available for the ultimate closure postclosure care andor reclamation of our facilities 

in some cases we are able to comply through the satisfaction of applicable state financial strength tests but if we are unable to do so we must utilize alternative methods of complying with the financial assurance requirements or we could be subject to enforcement proceedings brought by relevant government agencies potential alternative methods of compliance include providing credit support in the form of cash escrows or trusts surety bonds from insurance companies letters of credit from banks or other forms of financial instruments or collateral to satisfy the financial assurance requirements or negotiating a consent agreement that establishes a different form of financial assurance use of alternative means of financial assurance imposes additional expense on us some of them such as letters of credit also use a portion of our available liquidity other alternative means of financial assurance such as surety bonds may in some cases require collateral and generally require us to obtain a discharge of the bonds or to post additional collateral typically in the form of cash or letters of credit at the request of the issuer of the bonds collateral that is required may be in many forms including letters of credit or other financial instruments that utilize a portion of our available liquidity or in the form of assets such as real estate which reduces our flexibility to manage or sell assets 

for example 



difference between the amounts held in each trust fund including earnings and the estimated closure and longterm care costs compliance with the financial assurance requirements included in these consent decrees satisfies substantially all of our state financial assurance obligations relating to the covered facilities which were historically satisfied without the need for any expenditure of corporate funds to the extent our financial statements met certain balance sheet and income statement financial strength tests 

in the past we have also not always been able to satisfy applicable financial strength tests and in the future it is possible that we will not be able to pass the applicable financial strength tests negotiate or receive approval of consent decrees establish escrow or trust accounts or obtain letters of credit surety bonds or other financial instruments on acceptable terms and conditions or at a reasonable cost or that the form andor cost of compliance could increase which could materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

we have included additional discussion about financial assurance requirements under “off balance sheet arrangements and obligations—other commercial commitments” in our management’s analysis 

the other environmental regulations to which we are subject may also have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition to permitting and financial assurance requirements we are subject to numerous other environmental health and safety laws and regulations in the us canada china brazil and other countries where we operate these laws and regulations govern a wide range of matters including environmental controls land reclamation discharges to air and water and remediation of hazardous substance releases they significantly affect our operating activities as well as the level of our operating costs and capital expenditures in some international jurisdictions environmental laws change frequently and it may be difficult for us to determine if we are in compliance with all material environmental laws at any given time 

we are and may in the future be involved in legal and regulatory proceedings that could be material to us these proceedings include “legacy” matters arising from activities of our predecessor companies and from facilities and businesses that we have never owned or operated 

we have in the past been are currently and may in the future be subject to legal and regulatory proceedings that could be material to our business results of operations liquidity or financial condition joint ventures in which we participate could also become subject to these sorts of proceedings these proceedings may be brought by the government or private parties and may arise out of a variety of matters including   



the legal and regulatory proceedings to which we are currently or may in the future be subject can depending on the circumstances result in monetary damage awards fines penalties other liabilities injunctions or other court or administrative rulings that interrupt impede or otherwise materially affect our business operations andor criminal sanctions 

among other environmental laws the us comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act “ cercla ” imposes liability including for cleanup costs without regard to fault or to the legality of a party’s conduct on certain categories of persons including current and former owners and operators of a site and parties who are considered to have contributed to the release of “hazardous substances” into the environment under cercla or various us state analogues a party may under certain circumstances be required to bear more than its proportional share of cleanup costs at a site where it has liability if payments cannot be obtained from other responsible parties as a crop nutrient company working with chemicals and other hazardous substances we will periodically incur liabilities and cleanup costs under cercla and other environmental laws with regard to our current or former facilities adjacent or nearby thirdparty facilities or offsite disposal locations 

pending and potential legal and regulatory proceedings may arise out of our present activities including operations at current facilities they may also arise out of past activities by us our predecessor companies and subsidiaries that our predecessors have sold these past activities were in some cases at facilities that we and our subsidiaries no longer own or operate and may have never owned or operated 

settlements of legal and regulatory matters frequently require court approval in the event a court were not to approve of a settlement it is possible that we and the other party or parties to the matter might not be able to settle it on terms that were acceptable to all parties or that we could be required to accept more stringent terms of settlement than required by the opposing parties 

we have included additional information with respect to pending legal and regulatory proceedings in note 21  of our notes to consolidated financial statements and in this report in part i item 3 “legal proceedings” 

these legal and regulatory proceedings involve inherent uncertainties and could negatively impact our business results of operations liquidity or financial condition 

the permitting financial assurance and other environmental health and safety laws and regulations to which we are subject may become more stringent over time this could increase the effects on us of these laws and regulations and the increased effects could be material 

continued government and public emphasis on environmental health and safety issues in the us canada china brazil paraguay and other countries where we operate can be expected to result in requirements that apply to us and our operations that are more stringent than those that are described above and elsewhere in this report these more stringent requirements may include among other matters increased levels of future investments and expenditures for environmental controls at ongoing operations which will be charged against income from future operations increased levels of the financial assurance requirements to which we are subject increased efforts or costs to obtain permits or denial of permits other new or interpretations of existing statutes or regulations that impose new or more stringent restrictions or liabilities including liabilities or additional financial assurance requirements under cercla or similar statutes including restrictions or liabilities related to elevated levels of naturallyoccurring radiation that arise from disturbing the ground in the course of mining activities and other matters that could increase our expenses capital requirements or liabilities or adversely affect our business liquidity or financial condition in addition to the extent restrictions imposed in countries where our competitors operate such as china india former soviet union countries or morocco are less stringent than in the countries where we operate our competitors could gain cost or other competitive advantages over us these effects could be material 

among other matters there are several recent or ongoing initiatives relating to nutrient discharges new regulatory restrictions from these initiatives could have a material effect on either us or our customers for example   



 in addition in april 2014 epa and the us army corps of engineers jointly issued a proposed rule that would redefine the scope of waters regulated under the federal clean water act the final rule was issued in june 2015 and became effective in august 2015 but has been challenged through numerous lawsuits in october 2015 the us court of appeals for the sixth circuit issued an order staying the effectiveness of the final rule until after the legal validity of the regulation is resolved we believe the new definition would expand the types and extent of water resources regulated under federal law thereby potentially expanding our permitting and reporting requirements increasing our costs of compliance including costs associated with wetlands and stream mitigation lengthening the time necessary to obtain permits and potentially restricting our ability to mine certain of our phosphate rock reserves these effects could be material 

regulatory restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions and climate change regulations in the united states canada or elsewhere could adversely affect us and these effects could be material 

various governmental initiatives to limit greenhouse gas emissions are under way or under consideration around the world these initiatives could restrict our operating activities require us to make changes in our operating activities that would increase our operating costs reduce our efficiency or limit our output require us to make capital improvements to our facilities increase our energy raw material and transportation costs or limit their availability or otherwise adversely affect our results of operations liquidity or capital resources and these effects could be material to us 

governmental greenhouse gas emission initiatives include among others  the december 2015 agreement the “ paris agreement ” which was the outcome of the 21 st  session of the conference of the parties under the united nations framework convention on climate change unfccc the paris agreement which was signed by nearly 200 nations including the united states and canada entered into force in late 2016 and sets out a goal of limiting the average rise in temperatures for this century to below 2 degrees celsius each signatory is expected to develop its own plan referred to as a nationally determined contribution or “ ndc ” for reaching that goal 

the ndc submitted by the united states in 2015 aims to achieve by 2025 an economywide target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 2628 below its 2005 level it also aims to use best efforts to reduce its emissions by 28 the us target covers all greenhouse gases that were a part of the 2014 inventory of   greenhouse gas emissions and sinks while it is unclear whether the new us executive administration will seek to implement the us ndc various legislative or regulatory initiatives relating to greenhouse gases have already been adopted or considered by the us congress epa or various states and those already adopted may be used to implement the us’s ndc additionally more stringent laws and regulations may be enacted to accomplish the goals set out in the ndc 

canada’s intended ndc aims to achieve by 2030 an economywide target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 30 below 2005 levels in addition in late 2016 the federal government announced plans for a comprehensive tax on carbon 

emissions under which provinces opting out of the tax would have the option of adopting a capandtrade system while no tax has formally been proposed as implementation of the paris agreement proceeds more stringent laws and regulations may be enacted to accomplish the goals set out in canada’s ndc in addition the province of saskatchewan in which our canadian potash mines are located has passed legislation to facilitate the development and administration of climate change regulation in saskatchewan by the province rather than the federal government this legislation is not yet effective but key elements under consideration by the province include establishing a provincial greenhouse gas emission reduction target and compliance mechanisms that would provide flexibility for regulated emitters to meet their greenhouse gas reduction obligations our saskatchewan potash facilities will continue to work with the saskatchewan ministry of environment and environment canada through participation in industry associations to determine next steps we will also continue to monitor developments relating to the anticipated proposed legislation as well as the potential future effect on our operating activities energy raw material and transportation costs results of operations liquidity or capital resources 

it is possible that future legislation or regulation addressing climate change including in response to the paris agreement or any new international agreements could adversely affect our operating activities energy raw material and transportation costs results of operations liquidity or capital resources and these effects could be material in addition to the extent climate change restrictions imposed in countries where our competitors operate such as china india former soviet union countries or morocco are less stringent than in the united states or canada our competitors could gain cost or other competitive advantages over us 

future climate change could adversely affect us 

the prospective impact of climate change on our operations and those of our customers and farmers remains uncertain scientists have hypothesized that the impacts of climate change could include changes in rainfall patterns water shortages changing sea levels changing storm patterns and intensities and changing temperature levels and that these changes could be severe these impacts could vary by geographic location at the present time we cannot predict the prospective impact of climate change on our results of operations liquidity or capital resources or whether any such effects could be material to us 

some of our competitors and potential competitors have greater resources than we do which may place us at a competitive disadvantage and adversely affect our sales and profitability these competitors include stateowned and governmentsubsidized entities in other countries 

we compete with a number of producers throughout the world including stateowned and governmentsubsidized entities some of these entities may have greater total resources than we do and may be less dependent on earnings from crop nutrients sales than we are in addition some of these entities may have access to lower cost or governmentsubsidized natural gas supplies placing us at a competitive disadvantage furthermore certain governments as owners of some of our competitors may be willing to accept lower prices and profitability on their products in order to support domestic employment or other political or social goals to the extent other producers of crop nutrients enjoy competitive advantages or are willing to accept lower profit levels the price of our products our sales volumes and our profits may be adversely affected 

we do not own a controlling equity interest in our nonconsolidated companies some of which are foreign companies and therefore our operating results and cash flow may be materially affected by how the governing boards and majority owners operate such businesses there may also be limitations on monetary distributions from these companies that are outside of our control together these factors may lower our equity earnings or cash flow from such businesses and negatively impact our results of operations 

in 2013 we entered into an agreement to form mwspc a joint venture to develop a mine and chemical complexes for an estimated 80 billion  that is expected to produce phosphate fertilizers and other downstream products in the kingdom of saudi arabia we have a 25 interest in the joint venture and expect our cash investment will be up to 850 million  approximately 707 million  of which had been funded as of december 31 2016 we also expect to provide financial guarantees with respect to our proportionate share of certain future planned funding facilities of mwspc the success of mwspc will depend on among other matters its ability to obtain the future planned funding facilities in acceptable amounts and upon acceptable terms the timely development and commencement of operations of production facilities in the kingdom of saudi arabia the future success of current plans for the development and operation of mwspc including the availability and affordability of necessary resources and materials and access to appropriate infrastructure and any future changes in those plans as well as the general economic and political stability of the region 

we also hold minority ownership interests in a joint venture that owns and operates a phosphate rock mine and in other companies that are not controlled by us we expect that the operations and results of mwspc will be and the operations or 

results of some of the other joint ventures or companies are significant to us and their operations can affect our earnings because we do not control these companies either at the board or stockholder levels and because local laws in foreign jurisdictions and contractual obligations may place restrictions on monetary distributions by these companies we cannot ensure that these companies will operate efficiently or in the case of mwspc in compliance with the terms of any future funding facility for which we may provide financial guarantees pay dividends or generally follow the desires of our management by virtue of our board or stockholder representation as a result these companies may contribute less than anticipated to our earnings and cash flow negatively impacting our results of operations and liquidity additionally in the case of mwspc we may be called upon to provide funds to satisfy mwspcs debt obligations to the extent we provide financial guarantees in connection with future planned funding facilities as discussed above 

strikes or other forms of work stoppage or slowdown could disrupt our business and lead to increased costs 

our financial performance is dependent on a reliable and productive work force a significant portion of our workforce and that of the joint ventures in which we participate is covered by collective bargaining agreements with unions unsuccessful contract negotiations or adverse labor relations could result in strikes or slowdowns any disruptions may decrease our production and sales or impose additional costs to resolve disputes the risk of adverse labor relations may increase as our profitability increases because labor unions’ expectations and demands generally rise at those times 

accidents occurring in the course of our operating activities could result in significant liabilities interruptions or shutdowns of facilities or the need for significant safety or other expenditures 

we engage in mining and industrial activities that can result in serious accidents if our safety procedures are not effective or if an accident occurs we could be subject to liabilities arising out of personal injuries or death our operations could be interrupted and we might have to shut down or abandon affected facilities accidents could cause us to expend significant amounts to remediate safety issues or to repair damaged facilities for example   

 the excavation of mines can result in potential seismic events or can increase the likelihood or potential severity of a seismic event the rise and fall of water levels such as those arising from the brine inflows and our remediation activities at our esterhazy mine can also result in or increase the likelihood or potential severity of a seismic event our esterhazy mine has experienced minor seismic events from time to time a significant seismic event at one of our mines could result in serious injuries or death or damage to or flooding of the mine or in the extreme scenario cause us to change our mining process or abandon the mine   

 our underground potash shaft mines at esterhazy and colonsay saskatchewan and carlsbad new mexico are subject to risk from fire any failure of our safety procedures in the future could result in serious injuries or death or shutdowns which could result in significant liabilities andor impact on the financial performance of our potash business including a possible material adverse effect on our results of operations liquidity or financial condition   

 we produce ammonia at our faustina louisiana phosphate concentrates plant use ammonia in significant quantities at all of our florida and louisiana phosphates concentrates plants and store ammonia at some of our distribution facilities for our florida phosphates concentrates plants ammonia is received at terminals in tampa and transported by pipelines and rail to our facilities our ammonia is generally stored and transported at high pressures or cryogenically an accident could occur that could result in serious injuries or death or the evacuation of areas near an accident an accident could also result in property damage or the shutdown of our florida or louisiana phosphates concentrates plants the ammonia terminals pipelines or rail lines serving those plants or our other ammonia storage and handling facilities as a result an accident involving ammonia could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations liquidity or financial condition   

 we use sulfuric acid in the production of concentrated phosphates in our florida and louisiana operations some of our florida and louisiana facilities produce fluorosilicic acid which is a hazardous chemical for resale to third parties we also use or produce other hazardous or volatile chemicals at some of our facilities an accident involving any of these chemicals could result in serious injuries or death or evacuation of areas near an accident an accident could also result in property damage or shutdown of our facilities or cause us to expend significant amounts to remediate safety issues or to repair damaged facilities as a result an accident involving any of these chemicals could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations liquidity or financial condition 

deliberate malicious acts including terrorism could damage our facilities disrupt our operations or injure employees contractors customers or the public and result in liability to us 

intentional acts of destruction could hinder our sales or production and disrupt our supply chain our facilities could be damaged or destroyed reducing our operational production capacity and requiring us to repair or replace our facilities at substantial cost employees contractors and the public could suffer substantial physical injury for which we could be liable governmental authorities may impose security or other requirements that could make our operations more difficult or costly the consequences of any such actions could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

we may be adversely affected by changing antitrust laws to which we are subject increases in crop nutrient prices can increase the scrutiny to which we are subject under these laws 

we are subject to antitrust and competition laws in various countries throughout the world we cannot predict how these laws or their interpretation administration and enforcement will change over time changes in antitrust laws globally or in their interpretation administration or enforcement may limit our existing or future operations and growth or the operations of canpotex which serves as an export association for our potash business increases in crop nutrient prices have in the past resulted in increased scrutiny of the crop nutrient industry under antitrust and competition laws and can increase the risk that these laws could be interpreted administered or enforced in a manner that could affect our operating practices or impose liability on us in a manner that could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

we may be adversely affected by other changes in laws resulting from increases in food and crop nutrient prices 

increases in prices for among other things food fuel and crop inputs including crop nutrients have in the past been the subject of significant discussion by various governmental bodies and officials throughout the world in response to increases it is possible that governments in one or more of the locations in which we operate or where we or our competitors sell our products could take actions that could affect us such actions could include among other matters changes in governmental policies relating to agriculture and biofuels including changes in subsidy levels price controls tariffs windfall profits taxes or export or import taxes any such actions could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

our competitive position could be adversely affected if we are unable to participate in continuing industry consolidation 

most of our products are readily available from a number of competitors and price and other competition in the crop nutrient industry is intense in addition crop nutrient production facilities and distribution activities frequently benefit from economies of scale as a result particularly during pronounced cyclical troughs the crop nutrient industry has a long history of consolidation mosaic itself is the result of a number of industry consolidations we expect consolidation among crop nutrient producers could continue our competitive position could suffer to the extent we are not able to expand our own resources either through consolidations acquisitions joint ventures or partnerships in the future we may not be able to find suitable companies to combine with assets to purchase or joint venture or partnership opportunities to pursue even if we are able to locate desirable opportunities we may not be able to enter into transactions on economically acceptable terms if we do not successfully participate in continuing industry consolidation our ability to compete successfully could be adversely affected and result in the loss of customers or an uncompetitive cost structure which could adversely affect our sales and profitability 

our strategy for managing market and interest rate risk may not be effective 

our businesses are affected by fluctuations in market prices for our products the purchase price of natural gas ammonia and sulfur consumed in operations freight and shipping costs foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates we periodically 

enter into derivatives and forward purchase contracts to mitigate some of these risks however our strategy may not be successful in minimizing our exposure to these fluctuations see “market risk” in our management’s analysis and note 14  of our notes to consolidated financial statements that is incorporated by reference in this report in part ii item 8 

a shortage or unavailability of railcars tugs barges and ships for carrying our products and the raw materials we use in our business could result in customer dissatisfaction loss of production or sales and higher transportation or equipment costs 

we rely heavily upon truck rail tug barge and ocean freight transportation to obtain the raw materials we need and to deliver our products to our customers in addition the cost of transportation is an important part of the final sale price of our products finding affordable and dependable transportation is important in obtaining our raw materials and to supply our customers higher costs for these transportation services or an interruption or slowdown due to factors including high demand high fuel prices labor disputes layoffs or other factors affecting the availability of qualified transportation workers adverse weather or other environmental events or changes to rail barge or ocean freight systems could negatively affect our ability to produce our products or deliver them to our customers which could affect our performance and results of operations 

strong demand for grain and other products and a strong world economy increase the demand for and reduce the availability of transportation both domestically and internationally shortages of railcars barges and ocean transport for carrying product and increased transit time may result in customer dissatisfaction loss of sales and higher equipment and transportation costs in addition during periods when the shipping industry has a shortage of ships the substantial time needed to build new ships prevents rapid market response delays and missed shipments due to transportation shortages including vessels barges railcars and trucks could result in customer dissatisfaction or loss of sales potential which could negatively affect our performance and results of operations 

additionally we have agreed under our longterm cf ammonia supply agreement to purchase approximately 545000 to 725000 tonnes of ammonia per year beginning with 2017 during a term that may extend until december 31 2032 at a price to be determined by a formula based on the prevailing price of us natural gas for 2017 our remaining minimum purchase obligation is approximately 410000 tonnes following our entry into a separate arrangement with cf under which we were deemed to have purchased approximately 135000 tonnes in exchange for providing ammonia storage space and use of related terminal facilities to cf we will be obligated to provide for transportation of the ammonia under the agreement and if we fail to take the required minimum annual amount cf may elect to require us to make payment of liquidated damages or with respect to such failures in years after 2017 terminate the agreement payment of significant liquidated damages or an election by cf to terminate the agreement could adversely affect our business 

a lack of customers’ access to credit can adversely affect their ability to purchase our products 

some of our customers require access to credit to purchase our products a lack of available credit to customers in one or more countries due to global or local economic conditions or for other reasons could adversely affect demand for crop nutrients 

we extend trade credit to our customers and guarantee the financing that some of our customers use to purchase our products our results of operations may be adversely affected if these customers are unable to repay the trade credit from us or financing from their banks increases in prices for crop nutrient other agricultural inputs and grain may increase this risk 

we extend trade credit to our customers in the united states and throughout the world in some cases for extended periods of time in brazil where there are fewer thirdparty financing sources available to farmers we also have several programs under which we guarantee customers’ financing from financial institutions that they use to purchase our products as our exposure to longer trade credit extended throughout the world and use of guarantees in brazil increases we are increasingly exposed to the risk that some of our customers will not pay us or the amounts we have guaranteed additionally we become increasingly exposed to risk due to weather and crop growing conditions fluctuations in commodity prices or foreign currencies and other factors that influence the price supply and demand for agricultural commodities significant defaults by our customers could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

increases in prices for crop nutrients increase the dollar amount of our sales to customers the larger dollar value of our customers’ purchases may also lead them to request longer trade credit from us andor increase their need for us to guarantee their financing of our products either factor could increase the amount of our exposure to the risk that our customers may be unable to repay the trade credit from us or financing from their banks that we guarantee in addition increases in prices for 

other agricultural inputs and grain may increase the working capital requirements indebtedness and other liabilities of our customers increase the risk that they will default on the trade credit from us or their financing that we guarantee and decrease the likelihood that we will be able to collect from our customers in the event of their default 

tax rules governing the cargill transaction limited our ability to execute certain actions for a period of time following the cargill transaction and if our procedures for compliance with those restrictions were ineffective notwithstanding the irs ruling and tax opinion issued to cargill in connection with the cargill transaction we could owe significant taxrelated indemnification liabilities to cargill 

the irs issued a ruling to the effect that the splitoff that was part of the cargill transaction would be taxfree to cargill and its stockholders and in connection with the completion of the cargill transaction cargill received a tax opinion relating to certain tax consequences of the cargill transaction notwithstanding the irs ruling and tax opinion however the splitoff and debt exchanges could be taxable to cargill and its stockholders under certain circumstances therefore we and cargill agreed to taxrelated restrictions and indemnities set forth in a tax agreement related to the cargill transaction under which we were restricted or deterred from taking certain actions until may 26 2013 including i redeeming or purchasing our stock in excess of agreedupon amounts ii issuing any equity securities in excess of agreed upon amounts iii approving or recommending a third party’s acquisition of us iv permitting any merger or other combination of mosaic or mos holdings inc and v entering into an agreement for the purchase of any interest in mosaic or mos holdings inc subject to certain exceptions we agreed to indemnify cargill for taxes and taxrelated losses imposed on cargill as a result of the splitoff andor debt exchange failing to qualify as taxfree if the taxes and related losses are attributable to arise out of or result from certain prohibited acts or to any breach of or inaccuracy in any representation warranty or covenant made by us in the tax agreement referred to above the taxes and taxrelated losses of cargill would be material if these transactions fail to qualify as taxfree and while we do not believe we engaged in any prohibited acts during the relevant period if our procedures for avoiding any of these prohibited acts or breaches were ineffective this indemnity would result in material liabilities from us to cargill that could have a material adverse effect on us for a further discussion of the restrictions and indemnities set forth in the agreements related to the cargill transaction please see note 18  to our notes to consolidated financial statements 

provisions in our restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws and of delaware law may prevent or delay an acquisition of our company which could decrease the trading price of our common stock 

our restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that could have the effect of rendering more difficult or discouraging an acquisition deemed undesirable by our board of directors these provisions include the ability of our board of directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval a prohibition on stockholder action by written consent and the inability of our stockholders to request that our board of directors or chairman of our board call a special meeting of stockholders 

we are also subject to section 203 of the delaware general corporation law in general section 203 prohibits a publicly held delaware corporation from engaging in a “business combination” with an “interested stockholder” for a period of three years from the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder unless the interested stockholder attained this status with the approval of the board of directors or unless the business combination was approved in a prescribed manner a “business combination” includes mergers asset sales and other transactions resulting in a financial benefit to the interested stockholder subject to exceptions an “interested stockholder” is a person who together with affiliates and associates owns or within three years owned 15 or more of the corporation’s voting stock this statute could prohibit or delay the accomplishment of mergers or other takeover or change in control attempts with respect to us and accordingly may discourage attempts to acquire us 

these provisions apply not only when they may protect our stockholders from coercive or otherwise unfair takeover tactics but even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders and could delay or prevent an acquisition that our board of directors determines is not in our best interests or those of our stockholders 

our success will continue to depend on our ability to attract and retain highly qualified and motivated employees 

we believe our continued success depends on the collective abilities and efforts of our employees like many businesses a significant number of our employees including some of our most highly skilled employees with specialized expertise in potash and phosphates operations will be approaching retirement age throughout the next decade and beyond in addition we compete for a talented workforce with other businesses particularly within the mining and chemicals industries in general and the crop nutrients industry in particular our expansion plans are highly dependent on our ability to attract retain and train highly qualified and motivated employees who are essential to the success of our ongoing operations as well as to our 

expansion plans if we were to be unsuccessful in attracting retaining and training the employees we require our ongoing operations and expansion plans could be materially and adversely affected 

future product or technological innovation could affect our business 

future product or technological innovation such as the development of seeds that require less crop nutrients the development of substitutes for our products or developments in the application of crop nutrients if they occur could have the potential to adversely affect the demand for our products and our results of operations liquidity and capital resources 

our acquisition of the global phosphate and potash operations of vale sa “vale” conducted through vale fertilizantes sa the “transaction” is subject to review under antitrust laws and requires governmental approvals which could jeopardize completion of the acquisition or in some cases impose conditions on the acquisition that could have a material adverse effect on our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the transaction 

completion of the transaction is conditioned upon obtaining certain required governmental authorizations there can be no assurance that the authorizations will be obtained and we and the sellers are not obligated to accept any and all conditions imposed by governmental authorities in order to obtain such authorizations in addition the governmental authorities with or from which these authorizations are required have broad discretion in administering the governing regulations as a condition to authorization of the acquisition these governmental authorities may impose requirements limitations or costs or require divestitures or place restrictions on our conduct of the business after completion of the transaction our acceptance of any such divestiture requests or other restrictions on operations could diminish the benefits of the transaction and result in additional transaction costs loss of revenue or other effects associated with restrictions on business operations 

in addition at any time before or after completion of the acquisition the antitrust division of the us department of justice or the us federal trade commission any state or certain foreign governments could take various actions under antitrust competition or similar laws including seeking to enjoin the completion of the transaction or to rescind the transaction private parties also may seek to take legal action under antitrust competition or similar laws under certain circumstances a challenge to the transaction on antitrust competition or similar grounds may be made by any of these governmental or private parties and if such a challenge is made it is possible that we and the sellers will not prevail 

the transaction is also subject to additional risks contingencies and uncertainties that could result in delays to completion of the transaction in the failure of the transaction to be completed or in our inability to realize the anticipated benefits and synergies of the transaction 

completion of the transaction is subject to certain additional closing conditions including i the timely completion of restructuring transactions by the sellers including the transfer of vale fertilizantes sa’s cubatão business to vale and its affiliates ii the achievement of certain additional specified regulatory and operational milestones and iii the absence of governmental actions due to the recent water loss incident at our new wales florida facility that result in a reduction or suspension of operations or increased operating costs at the facility and would be reasonably be expected to materially adversely impact mosaic and its subsidiaries taken as a whole any failure to satisfy these conditions could result in delays to completion of the transaction or in the failure of the transaction to be completed 

there are also additional risks contingencies and uncertainties associated with the transaction including 



 the success of our other strategic initiatives depends on our ability to effectively manage these initiatives and to successfully integrate and grow acquired businesses 

in addition to the transaction we have other significant ongoing strategic initiatives including principally our plans to expand the annual production capacity of our potash business and mwspc these strategic initiatives involve capital and other expenditures of several billions of dollars over a number of years and require effective project management and in the case of strategic acquisitions successful integration to the extent the processes we or for the mwspc we together with ma’aden and sabic put in place to manage these initiatives or integrate and grow acquired businesses are not effective our capital expenditure and other costs may exceed our expectations or the benefits we expect from these initiatives might not be fully realized 

we may fail to fully realize the anticipated benefits and cost savings of our longterm cf ammonia supply agreement 

we use ammonia as a raw material in the production of our concentrated phosphate products under our longterm cf ammonia supply agreement we have agreed to purchase approximately 545000 to 725000 tonnes of ammonia per year during a term that may extend until december 31 2032 at a price to be determined by a formula based on the prevailing price of us natural gas 

the success of this agreement will depend in part on our ability to realize cost savings from the agreement’s natural gas based pricing if the price of natural gas rises materially or the market price for ammonia falls outside of the range we currently anticipate over the term of the agreement we may not realize a cost benefit from the agreement or the cost of our ammonia under the agreement could be a competitive disadvantage in addition our ability to realize benefits and cost savings is subject to certain additional risks including whether cf successfully performs its obligations under the agreement over the life of its commitment and our ability to take delivery of the required minimum annual amount of ammonia over the life of our commitment we discuss the risks associated with our obligations under this agreement in more detail earlier in this risk factors section 

cyber attacks could disrupt our operations and have a material adverse impact on our business 

as a global company we utilize and rely upon information technology systems in many aspects of our business including internal and external communications and the management of our accounting financial production and supply chain functions as we become more dependent on information technologies to conduct our operations and as the number and sophistication of cyber attacks increase the risks associated with cyber security increase these risks apply both to us and to third parties on whose systems we rely for the conduct of our business failure to effectively anticipate prevent detect and recover from the increasing number and sophistication of cyber attacks could result in theft loss or misuse of or damage or modification of our information and cause disruptions or delays in our business reputational damage and thirdparty claims which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition

the mosaic company is a delaware corporation that was incorporated in march 2004 and serves as the parent company of the business that was formed through the october 2004 combination of imc global inc and the fertilizer businesses of cargill incorporated we are publicly traded on the new york stock exchange under the ticker symbol “mos” and are headquartered in plymouth minnesota 

in 2015 we realigned our business segments the  realignment  to more clearly reflect our evolving business model our international distribution activities which had previously been reported in our phosphates business segment were moved into a separate international distribution segment intersegment eliminations marktomarket gainslosses on derivatives that had previously been reported in our phosphates and potash business segments prior to the realignment debt expenses and our legacy argentina and chile results are included within corporate eliminations and other 

we conduct our business through wholly and majorityowned subsidiaries as well as businesses in which we own less than a majority or a noncontrolling interest after the realignment we are organized into three reportable business segments phosphates potash and international distribution the following charts show the respective contributions to 2015  sales volumes net sales and operating earnings for each of these business segments 

  

phosphates segment  — we are the largest integrated phosphate producer in the world and one of the largest producers and marketers of phosphatebased animal feed ingredients in the united states we sell phosphatebased crop nutrients and animal feed ingredients throughout north america and internationally we account for approximately 14 of estimated global annual production and 79 of estimated north american annual production of concentrated phosphate crop nutrients 

potash segment —  we are one of the four largest potash producers in the world we sell potash throughout north america and internationally principally as fertilizer but also for use in industrial applications and to a lesser degree as animal feed ingredients we account for approximately 13 of estimated global annual potash production and 43 of estimated north american annual potash production 

international distribution segment —  this segment consists of sales offices crop nutrient blending and bagging facilities port terminals and warehouses in brazil paraguay india and china our international distribution segment serves as a distribution outlet for our phosphates and potash segments but also purchases and markets certain products from other suppliers generally to complement sales of our own product

 cargill transaction 

in may 2011 cargill divested its interest in us in a splitoff the “ splitoff ” to its stockholders the “ exchanging cargill stockholders ” including the mac trusts and a debt exchange the “ debt exchange ” with certain cargill debt holders the “ exchanging cargill debt holders ” the agreements relating to the cargill transaction contemplated an orderly distribution of the approximately 64 2858 million of our shares that cargill formerly held following the splitoff and debt exchange the mac trusts and exchanging cargill debt holders sold an aggregate of 1570 million of these shares in underwritten public secondary offerings or to us these transactions completed the disposition of shares designated to be sold during the 15month period following the splitoff 

all other shares approximately 1288 million shares in the aggregate of our class a common stock “ class a shares ” received by the exchanging cargill stockholders in the splitoff were generally subject to transfer restrictions that were removed as the class a shares converted to regular mosaic common stock par value 01 per share  common stock  all 429 million outstanding class a shares series a1 including 21647007 shares held by the mac trusts the remaining 17176068 class a shares series a2 held by exchanging cargill stockholders and the remaining 17176046 class a shares series a3 held by exchanging cargill stockholders were converted into common stock on november 26 2013 november 26 2014 and november 26 2015 respectively

other business developments during 2015 

we took the following steps toward achieving our strategic priorities

financial assurance to support certain estimated future asset retirement obligations and take additional actions as discussed more fully in note 20  of our notes to consolidated financial statements 

we have included additional information about these and other developments in our business during 2015 in our management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations “ management’s analysis ” and in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 

business segment information 

the discussion below of our business segment operations should be read in conjunction with the following information that we have included in this report   

 phosphates segment 

our phosphates business segment owns and operates mines and production facilities in florida which produce concentrated phosphate crop nutrients and phosphatebased animal feed ingredients and processing plants in louisiana which produce concentrated phosphate crop nutrients 

on march 17 2014 we completed our acquisition the  cf phosphate assets acquisition  of the florida phosphate assets and assumption of certain related liabilities of cf industries inc  cf  which included the 25000acre south pasture phosphate mine and beneficiation plant in hardee county florida a phosphate manufacturing facility in plant city florida and ammonia terminal and finished product warehouse facilities in tampa 

us phosphate crop nutrients and animal feed ingredients 

our us phosphates operations have capacity to produce approximately 53 million tonnes of phosphoric acid “ p 2 o 5 ” per year or about 10 of world annual capacity and about 60 of north american annual capacity phosphoric acid is produced by reacting finely ground phosphate rock with sulfuric acid phosphoric acid is the key building block for the production of high analysis or concentrated phosphate crop nutrients and animal feed products and is the most comprehensive measure of phosphate capacity and production and a commonly used benchmark in our industry our us phosphoric acid production totaled approximately 45 million  tonnes during 2015  we account for approximately 10 of estimated global annual production and 58 of estimated north american annual output 

our phosphate crop nutrient products are marketed worldwide to crop nutrient manufacturers distributors retailers and farmers our principal phosphate crop nutrient products are   

 production of our animal feed ingredients products is located at our new wales florida facility we market our feed phosphate primarily under the leading brand names of biofos ®  and nexfos ®  

our primary phosphate crop nutrient production facilities are located in central florida and louisiana the following map shows the locations of each of our phosphate concentrates plants in the united states and the locations of each of our active and planned phosphate mines in florida 

annual capacity by plant as of december 31 2015  and production volumes by plant for 2015  are listed below   



 

 5 

the phosphoric acid produced at uncle sam is shipped to faustina where it is used to produce dap map and microessentials ®  our faustina plant also manufactures ammonia that is mostly consumed in our concentrate plants 

we produced approximately 89 million tonnes of concentrated phosphate crop nutrients during 2015  and accounted for approximately 14 of estimated world annual output and 79 of estimated north american annual production 

phosphate rock 

phosphate rock is the key mineral used to produce phosphate crop nutrients and feed phosphate our phosphate rock production totaled approximately 145 million  tonnes in 2015  and accounted for approximately 7 of estimated world annual production and 54 of estimated north american annual production we are the world’s second largest miner of phosphate rock and currently operate four mines with a combined annual capacity of approximately 172 million  tonnes production of one tonne of dap requires between 16 and 17 tonnes of phosphate rock 

all of our wholly owned phosphate mines and related mining operations are located in central florida during 2015  we operated four active mines four corners south fort meade wingate and south pasture the hookers prairie mines reserves were exhausted during 2014 we plan to develop ona and desoto reserves to replace reserves that will be depleted at various times during the next decade 

the phosphate deposits of florida are of sedimentary origin and are part of a phosphatebearing province that extends from southern florida north along the atlantic coast into southern virginia our active phosphate mines are primarily located in what is known as the bone valley member of the peace river formation in the central florida phosphate district the southern portions of the four corners and wingate mines are in what is referred to as the undifferentiated peace river formation in which the ona and desoto reserves we plan to develop are also located phosphate mining has been conducted in the central florida phosphate district since the late 1800’s the potentially mineable portion of the district encompasses an area approximately 80 miles in length in a northsouth direction and approximately 40 miles in width 

we extract phosphate ore using large surface mining machines that we own called “draglines” prior to extracting the ore the draglines must first remove a 10 to 50 foot layer of sandy overburden at our wingate mine we also utilize dredges to remove the overburden and mine the ore we then process the ore at beneficiation plants that we own at each active mine where the ore goes through washing screening sizing and flotation processes designed to separate the phosphate rock from sands clays and other foreign materials   prior to commencing operations at any of our planned future mines we may need to acquire new draglines or move existing draglines to the mines and unless the beneficiation plant at an existing mine were used construct a beneficiation plant 

the following table shows for each of our phosphate mines annual capacity as of december 31 2015  and rock production volume and grade for the years 2015  2014  and 2013

mining at any particular time maintenance and turnaround time accidents mechanical failure weather conditions and other operating conditions as well as the effect of recent initiatives intended to improve operational excellence 

 reserves 

we estimate our phosphate rock reserves based upon exploration core drilling as well as technical and economic analyses to determine that reserves can be economically mined proven measured reserves are those resources of sufficient concentration to meet minimum physical chemical and economic criteria related to our current product standards and mining and production practices our estimates of probable indicated reserves are based on information similar to that used for proven reserves but sites for drilling are farther apart or are otherwise less adequately spaced than for proven reserves although the degree of assurance is high enough to assume continuity between such sites proven reserves are determined using a minimum drill hole spacing of two sites per 40 acre block probable reserves have less than two drill holes per 40 acre block but geological data provides a high degree of assurance that continuity exists between sites 

the following table sets forth our proven and probable phosphate reserves as of december 31 2015  



 

 we generally own the reserves shown for active mines in the table above with the only significant exceptions being further described below   

 in light of the longterm nature of our rights to our reserves we expect to be able to mine all reported reserves that are not currently owned prior to termination or expiration of our rights additional information regarding permitting is included in part i item 1a “risk factors” and under “environmental health safety and security matters—operating requirements and impacts—permitting” in our management’s analysis 

investments in joint ventures 

we have a 35 economic interest in a joint venture which owns the miski mayo phosphate rock mine in the bayovar region of peru our investment in the miski mayo mine and related commercial offtake supply agreement to purchase a share of the phosphate rock from the miski mayo mine allows us to supplement our internally produced rock to meet our overall fertilizer production needs the miski mayo mine’s annual production capacity is 39 million tonnes 

we own a 25 interest in mwspc and in connection with our equity share we will market approximately 25 of the downstream products of the joint venture mwspc is developing a mine and two chemical complexes that are presently expected to produce phosphate fertilizers and other downstream phosphates products in the kingdom of saudi arabia we currently estimate that the cost to develop and construct the integrated phosphate production facilities the  project  will approximate 8 billion  which we expect to be funded primarily through investments by us maaden and sabic and through borrowing arrangements and other external project financing facilities  funding facilities  we currently estimate that our cash investment in the project including the amount we have invested to date will approximate 850 million  our cash investment in the project through december 31 2015 was 488 million the greenfield project is being built in the northern region of saudi arabia at wa’ad al shamal minerals industrial city and includes further expansion of processing plants in ras al khair minerals industrial city which is located on the east coast of saudi arabia the facilities are expected to have a production capacity of approximately 35 million tonnes of finished product per year the project is expected to benefit from the availability of key raw nutrients from sources within saudi arabia ammonia operations are expected to commence in late 2016 and production of finished phosphate products is expected to begin in 2017 

on june 30 2014 mwspc entered into funding facilities with a consortium of 20 financial institutions for a total amount of approximately 50 billion in january 2016 mwspc announced that it had received the approval of the saudi industrial development fund for future funding facilities in the total amount of approximately 11 billion subject to the finalization of definitive agreements the terms of the june 30 2014 funding facilities and the proposed future funding facilities are further discussed in note 8  of our consolidated financial statements 

sulfur 

we use molten sulfur at our phosphates concentrates plants to produce sulfuric acid primarily for use in our production of phosphoric acid we purchased approximately 42 million long tons of sulfur during 2015  we purchase most of this sulfur from north american oil and natural gas refiners who are required to remove or recover sulfur during the refining process production of one tonne of dap requires approximately 040 long tons of sulfur we procure our sulfur from multiple sources and receive it by truck rail barge and vessel either direct to our phosphate plants or have it sent for gathering to terminals 

that are located on the us gulf coast we are also constructing a sulfur melter at our new wales facility that is expected to be operational in the first quarter of 2016 in preparation for the expected completion of the melter we are receiving formed sulfur through tampa ports which will be delivered by truck to our new wales facility 

we own and operate sulfur terminals in houston texas and riverview florida we also lease terminal space in tampa florida and galveston and beaumont texas we own two oceangoing barges and contract for operation of another oceangoing vessel that transport molten sulfur from the texas terminals to tampa and then onward by truck to our florida phosphate plants in addition we own a 50 equity interest in gulf sulphur services ltd lllp “ gulf sulphur services ” which is operated by our joint venture partner gulf sulphur services has a large sulfur transportation and terminaling business in the gulf of mexico and handles these functions for a substantial portion of our florida sulfur volume we further round out our sulfur logistic assets with a large fleet of leased railcars that supplement our marine sulfur logistic system our louisiana operations are served by truck and barge from nearby refineries additionally the sulfur melter we are constructing at our new wales facility is expected to further enhance our access to sulfur and is expected to be operational in the first quarter of 2016 it is planned to have the capability to melt approximately one million long tons of sulfur annually allowing us to leverage economic benefits within the global sulfur marketplace 

although sulfur is readily available from many different suppliers and can be transported to our phosphate facilities by a variety of means sulfur is an important raw material used in our business that has in the past been and may in the future be the subject of volatile pricing and availability alternative transportation and terminaling facilities might not have sufficient capacity to fully serve all of our facilities in the event of a disruption to current transportation or terminaling facilities changes in the price of sulfur or disruptions to sulfur transportation or terminaling facilities could have a material impact on our business we have included a discussion of sulfur prices in our management’s analysis 

ammonia 

we use ammonia together with phosphoric acid to produce dap map and microessentials ®  we consumed approximately 15 million tonnes of ammonia during 2015  production of one tonne of dap requires approximately 023 tonnes of ammonia 

our florida ammonia needs are supplied by offshore producers under multiyear contracts ammonia for our new wales and riverview plants is terminaled through an owned ammonia facility at port sutton florida ammonia for our bartow plant is terminaled through another ammonia facility owned and operated by a third party at port sutton florida pursuant to an agreement that provides for service through 2017 with automatic renewal for additional twoyear periods unless either party terminates as provided in the agreement ammonia is transported by pipeline from the terminals to our production facilities we have service agreements with the operators of the pipelines for bartow new wales and riverview which provide service through june 30 2017 the service agreements may be extended in one year increments unless either party objects ammonia for our plant city facility is terminaled through an owned facility in tampa florida that was acquired as part of the cf phosphate assets acquisition this ammonia is transported by rail via leased railcars the leases for rail cars expire in 2017 2018 and 2019 

we produce ammonia at faustina louisiana primarily for our own consumption our annual capacity is approximately 500000 tonnes from time to time we sell surplus ammonia to unrelated parties 

on october 28 2013 at the same time we signed the agreement relating to the cf phosphate assets acquisition we entered into two strategic supply agreements with cf the “ cf ammonia supply agreements ” and in light of them we decided to forego a proposed ammonia manufacturing plant at our faustina louisiana facility under one of the cf ammonia supply agreements which became effective on the acquisition date we are purchasing from cf approximately 270000 tonnes annually over a threeyear term at cfr tampa market based pricing under the second agreement which will become effective in 2017 we agreed to purchase approximately 545000 to 725000 tonnes of ammonia annually for a term that may extend until december 31 2032 we currently expect to begin purchasing under this agreement in the first half of 2015 upon the availability of the first of two specialized vessels that are currently under construction and that we expect to transport a majority of our purchases under the agreement 

in addition we have a 50 interest in gulf marine solutions llc “ gms ” a wholly owned subsidiary of gulf sulphur services in november 2015 we agreed to provide up to 50 million in bridge loans the “ bridge loan ” to gms to finance the purchase and construction of the two specialized vessels referenced above that are intended to transport ammonia primarily for mosaic’s operations mosaic’s joint venture partner is arranging for construction of the vessels and will charter 

them to gms which will enter into a longterm ammonia transportation contract with a mosaic subsidiary loans obtained by gms from mosaic will in turn be lent by gms to mosaic’s joint venture partner for use in constructing the vessels for additional information about gms the bridge loan and the thirdparty financing gms is seeking for this construction project see note 15 of our consolidated financial statements which information is incorporated herein by reference beginning in the quarter ended december 31 2015 we determined mosaic is the primary beneficiary of gms a variable interest entity and has consolidated gms within our phosphates segment 

although ammonia is readily available from many different suppliers and can be transported to our phosphates facilities by a variety of means ammonia is an important raw material used in our business that has in the past been and may in the future be the subject of volatile pricing and alternative transportation and terminaling facilities might not have sufficient capacity to fully serve all of our facilities in the event of a disruption to existing transportation or terminaling facilities changes in the price of ammonia or disruptions to ammonia transportation or terminaling could have a material impact on our business we have included a discussion of ammonia prices in our management’s analysis 

natural gas 

natural gas is the primary raw material used to manufacture ammonia at our faustina facility ammonia is manufactured on site the majority of natural gas is purchased through firm delivery contracts based on published indexbased prices and is sourced from texas and louisiana via pipelines interconnected to the henry hub we use overthecounter swap andor option contracts to forward price portions of future gas purchases the portions of gas purchases not forward priced are purchased at the index based prices or at domestic spot market prices under shortterm contracts on average we purchase approximately 19 million mmbtu of natural gas per year for use in ammonia production at faustina 

because our ammonia requirements for our florida operations are purchased rather than manufactured on site we purchase on average approximately two million mmbtu of natural gas per year in florida only as a thermal fuel for various production processes

we are a significant landowner in the state of florida which has in the past been considered one of the fastest areas of population growth in the united states we own land comprising approximately 291278 acres held in fee simple title in central florida and have the right to mine additional properties which contain phosphate rock reserves some of our land holdings are needed to operate our phosphates business while a portion of our land assets such as certain reclaimed properties are no longer required for our ongoing operations as a general matter more of our reclaimed property becomes available for uses other than for phosphate operations each year our real property assets are generally comprised of concentrates plants port facilities phosphate mines and other property which we have acquired through our presence in florida we are currently taking initial steps as part of a longterm future land use strategy to optimize the value of our land assets for example we developed streamsong resort ®  the  resort  a destination resort and conference center in an area of previously mined land as part of our longterm business strategy to maximize the value and utility of our extensive land holdings in florida in addition to the two golf courses and clubhouse that were opened in december 2012 the resort and conference center opened in january 2014 in 2015 we began construction of a third golf course and ancillary facilities in response to market demand 

potash segment 

we are one of the leading potash producers in the world we mine and process potash in canada and the united states and sell potash in north america and internationally the term “potash” applies generally to the common salts of potassium muriate of potash “ mop ” is the primary source of potassium for the crop nutrient industry red mop has traces of iron oxide the granular and standard grade red mop products are well suited for direct fertilizer application and bulk blending white mop has a higher percent potassium oxide “ k 2 o ” white mop besides being well suited for the agricultural market is used in many industrial applications 

our potash products are marketed worldwide to crop nutrient manufacturers distributors and retailers and are also used in the manufacturing of mixed crop nutrients and to a lesser extent in animal feed ingredients we also sell potash to customers for industrial use in addition our potash products are used for deicing and as a water softener regenerant 

in 2015  we operated three potash mines in canada including two shaft mines with a total of three production shafts and one solution mine as well as one potash shaft mine in the united states we also own related refineries at each of the mines 

we continue the expansion of capacity in our potash segment with the k3 shafts at our esterhazy mine which are on track to start producing ore in 2017 and following rampup are expected to add an estimated 09 million tonnes to our annual potash operational capacity this will provide for an infrastructure to move ore from k3 to the k1 and k2 mills giving us the flexibility to optimize production at k1 k2 and k3 in order to mitigate risk from current and future brine inflows 

it is possible that the costs of remedial efforts at esterhazy may further increase in the future and that such an increase could be material or in the extreme scenario that the brine inflows risk to employees or remediation costs may increase to a level which would cause us to change our mining processes or abandon the mines see “key factors that can affect results of operations and financial condition” and “potash net sales and gross margin” in our management’s analysis and “our esterhazy mine has had an inflow of salt saturated brine for more than 30 years” in part i item 1a “risk factors” in this report which are incorporated herein by reference for a discussion of costs risks and other information relating to the brine inflows 

the map below shows the location of each of our potash mines 

  

our current potash annualized operational capacity totals 105 million  tonnes of product per year and accounts for approximately 12 of world annual capacity and 41 of north american annual capacity production during 2015  totaled 84 million  tonnes we account for approximately 13 of estimated world annual production and 43 of estimated north american annual production 

the following table shows for each of our potash mines annual capacity as of december 31 2015  and volume of mined ore average grade and finished product output for years 2015  2014  and 2013

canadian mines 

we operate three canadian potash facilities all located in the southern half of the province of saskatchewan including our solution mine at belle plaine two interconnected mine shafts at our esterhazy shaft mine and our shaft mine at colonsay 

extensive potash deposits are found in the southern half of the province of saskatchewan the potash ore is contained in a predominantly rock salt formation known as the prairie evaporites the prairie evaporites deposits are bounded by limestone formations and contain the potash beds three potash deposits of economic importance occur in saskatchewan the esterhazy belle plaine and patience lake members the patience lake member is mined at colonsay and the esterhazy member at esterhazy at belle plaine all three members are mined each of the major potash members contains several potash beds of different thicknesses and grades the particular beds mined at colonsay and esterhazy have a mining height of 11 and 8 feet respectively at belle plaine several beds of different thicknesses are mined 

our potash mines in canada produce mop exclusively esterhazy and colonsay utilize shaft mining while belle plaine utilizes solution mining technology traditional potash shaft mining takes place underground at depths of over 1000 meters where continuous mining machines cut out the ore face and load it onto conveyor belts the ore is then crushed moved to storage bins and hoisted to refineries above ground in contrast our solution mining process involves heated brine which is pumped through a “cluster” to dissolve the potash in the ore beds at a depth of approximately 1500 meters a cluster consists of a series of boreholes drilled into the potash ore a separate distribution center at each cluster controls the brine flow the solution containing dissolved potash and salt is pumped to a refinery where sodium chloride a coproduct of this process is separated from the potash through the use of evaporation and crystallization techniques concurrently the solution is pumped into a cooling pond where additional crystallization occurs and the resulting product is recovered via a floating dredge refined potash is dewatered dried and sized our canadian operations produce 13 different mop products including industrial grades many through proprietary processes 

our potash mineral rights in the province of saskatchewan consist of the following 



we believe that our mineral rights in saskatchewan are sufficient to support current operations for more than a century leases are generally renewable at our option for successive terms generally 21 years each except that certain of the acres shown above as “leased from others” are leased under longterm leases with terms including renewals at our option that expire from 2023 to 2170 

we pay canadian resource taxes consisting of the potash production tax and resource surcharge the potash production tax is a saskatchewan provincial tax on potash production and consists of a base payment and a profits tax we also pay a percentage of the value of resource sales from our saskatchewan mines in addition to the canadian resource taxes royalties are payable to the mineral owners in respect of potash reserves or production of potash we have included a further discussion of the canadian resource taxes and royalties in our management’s analysis 

since december 1985 we have effectively managed an inflow of salt saturated brine into our esterhazy mine at various times since then we have experienced changing amounts and patterns of brine inflows at esterhazy to date the brine inflow including our remediation efforts to control it has not had a material impact on our production processes or volumes the volume of the net brine inflow the rate of inflow less the amount we are pumping out of the mine or net outflow when we are pumping more brine out of the mine than the rate of inflow fluctuates and is dependent on a number of variables such as the location of the source of the inflow the magnitude of the inflow available pumping surface and underground brine storage capacities underground injection well capacities and the effectiveness of calcium chloride and cementatious grout used to reduce or prevent the inflows among other factors as a result of these brine inflows we incur expenditures certain of which have been capitalized and others that have been charged to expense in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 

it is possible that the costs of remedial efforts at esterhazy may further increase in the future and that such an increase could be material or in the extreme scenario that the brine inflows risk to employees or remediation costs may increase to a level which would cause us to change our mining processes or abandon the mine see “key factors that can affect results of operations and financial condition” and “potash net sales and gross margin” in our management’s analysis and “our esterhazy mine has had an inflow of salt saturated brine for more than 30 years” in part i item 1a “risk factors” in this report which are incorporated herein by reference for a discussion of costs risks and other information relating to the brine inflows we have begun construction of the new shafts at our esterhazy mine as part of our potash expansion plan which is also designed to mitigate risk from current and future inflows 

due to the ongoing brine inflow at esterhazy subject to exceptions that are limited in scope and amount we are unable to obtain coverage for underground operations for water incursion problems like other potash producers’ shaft mines our colonsay saskatchewan and carlsbad new mexico mines are also subject to the risks of inflow of water as a result of their shaft mining operations but water inflow risks at these mines are included in our insurance coverage subject to deductibles limited coverage terms and lower sublimits negotiated with our insurers 

united states mines 

in the united states we have a shaft mine located in carlsbad new mexico in 2013 we decided to sell the salt operations of our hersey mine and close the related potash operations the sale of the salt operations at hersey was completed on july 29 2014 

the ore reserves at our carlsbad mine are made up of langbeinite a double sulfate of potassium and magnesium this type of potash reserve occurs in a predominantly rock salt formation known as the salado formation the mcnutt member of this formation consists of eleven units of economic importance of which we currently mine one the mcnutt member’s evaporite deposits are interlayered with anhydrite polyhalite potassium salts clay and minor amounts of sandstone and siltstone 

continuous underground mining methods are utilized to extract the ore drum type mining machines are used to cut the langbeinite ore from the face mined ore is then loaded onto conveyors transported to storage areas and then hoisted to the surface for further processing at our refinery 

effective january 1 2015 we only produce a double sulfate of potash magnesia product which we market under our brand name kmag ®  at our carlsbad facility prior to 2015 we also produced mop at this facility 

at the carlsbad facility we mine and refine potash from 77141 acres of mineral rights we control these reserves pursuant to either i leases from the us government that in general continue in effect at our option subject to readjustment by the us government every 20 years or ii leases from the state of new mexico that continue as long as we continue to produce from them these reserves contain an estimated total of 120 million tonnes of potash mineralization calculated after estimated extraction losses in one mining bed evaluated at thicknesses ranging from 55 feet to in excess of 11 feet at average refinery rates these ore reserves are estimated to be sufficient to yield 24 million tonnes of langbeinite concentrates with an average grade of approximately 22 k 2 o at projected rates of production we estimate that carlsbad’s reserves of langbeinite are sufficient to support operations for approximately 26 years 

royalties for the us operations amounted to approximately 101 million in 2015  these royalties are established by the us department of the interior bureau of land management in the case of the carlsbad leases from the us government and pursuant to provisions set forth in the leases in the case of the carlsbad state leases 

reserves 

our estimates below of our potash reserves and nonreserve potash mineralization are based on exploration drill hole data seismic data and actual mining results over more than 35 years proven reserves are estimated by identifying material in place that is delineated on at least two sides and material in place within a halfmile radius or distance from an existing sampled mine entry or exploration core hole probable reserves are estimated by identifying material in place within a one mile radius from an existing sampled mine entry or exploration core hole historical extraction ratios from the many years of mining results are then applied to both types of material to estimate the proven and probable reserves we believe that all reserves and nonreserve potash mineralization reported below are potentially recoverable using existing production shaft and refinery locations 

our estimated recoverable potash ore reserves and nonreserve potash mineralization as of december 31 2015  for each of our mines are as follows 



 

 as discussed more fully above we either own the reserves and mineralization shown above or lease them pursuant to mineral leases that generally remain in effect or are renewable at our option or are longterm leases accordingly we expect to be able to mine all reported reserves that are leased prior to termination or expiration of the existing leases 

natural gas 

natural gas is used at our belle plaine solution mine as a fuel to produce steam and to dry potash products the steam is used to generate electricity in evaporation and crystallization processes and to provide thermal heat to the solution mining process the belle plaine solution mine typically accounts for approximately 74 of our potash segment’s total natural gas requirements for potash production at our shaft mines natural gas is used as a fuel to heat fresh air supplied to the shaft mines and for drying potash products combined natural gas usage for both the solution and shaft mines approximated 17 million mmbtu during 2015  we purchase our natural gas requirements on firm delivery index pricebased physical contracts and on short term spotpriced physical contracts our canadian operations purchase all of their physical gas in saskatchewan via the transgas pipeline system using aeco price indices as pricing references the us potash operation in new mexico purchases physical gas in the southwest respective regional market using the transwestern el paso permian basin market pricing reference we use financial derivative contracts to manage the price of portions of our future purchases 

international distribution segment 

our international distribution segment produces and markets phosphate potash and nitrogenbased crop nutrients and animal feed ingredients and provides other ancillary services to wholesalers cooperatives independent retailers and farmers in south america and the asiapacific regions in 2015 our international distribution segment purchased 15 million tonnes of phosphate based products from our phosphates segment and 20 million tonnes of potash products from our potash segment and canpotex our international distribution operations also purchase phosphates potash and nitrogen products from unrelated third parties which we either use to produce blended crop nutrients “ blends ” or for resale our international distribution segment provides our phosphates and potash segments access to markets outside of north america 

our international distribution segment’s production facilities include blending plants and a single superphosphate “ ssp ” plant that produces crop nutrients by mixing sulfuric acid with phosphate rock a blending plant combines several crop 

nutrient products to make a mixture tailored to specific crop requirements we lease various warehouses depending on sales and production levels 

the following maps show the locations of our primary international distribution segment operations in south america and asia 

      

  

international distribution  south america operations 

we are one of the largest producers and distributors of blended crop nutrients for agricultural use in brazil we own and operate twelve blending plants in brazil and one blending plant in paraguay in addition we lease several other warehouses and blending units depending on sales and production levels we also have a 62 ownership interest in fospar sa “ fospar ” fospar owns and operates a ssp granulation plant and a deepwater crop nutrition port and throughput warehouse terminal facility in paranagua brazil together these plants provide the capability to annually distribute approximately 60 million tonnes of crop nutrients in brazil and paraguay the port facility at paranagua handles approximately 26 million tonnes of imported crop nutrients 

we have completed the integration of our december 2014 purchase of adms fertilizer distribution business in brazil and paraguay over time we expect this acquisition to increase our distribution capacity in the region from approximately four million tonnes to six million tonnes per year of crop nutrients in connection with the acquisition we also negotiated the terms of fiveyear fertilizer supply agreements whereby we supply adms fertilizer needs in brazil and paraguay 

  international distribution  asiapacific operations 

in china we have a 35 interest in a 600000 tonne per year capacity dap production plant and we own two 300000 tonne per year capacity blending plants in 2015 we sold approximately 350000 tonnes of blends and distributed another 150000 tonnes of straight crop nutrients in china 

in india we have distribution facilities to import and sell crop nutrients in 2015 we distributed approximately 470000 tonnes of phosphate and potash crop nutrient products in india we also serve as a marketing agent for our phosphates segment 

sales and distribution activities 

united states and canada 

we have a united states and canada sales and marketing team that serves our business segments we sell to wholesale distributors retail chains cooperatives independent retailers and national accounts 

customer service and the ability to effectively minimize the overall supply chain costs are key competitive factors in the crop nutrient and animal feed ingredients businesses in addition to our production facilities to service the needs of our customers we own lease or have contractual throughput or other arrangements at strategically located distribution warehouses along or near the mississippi and ohio rivers as well as in other key agricultural regions of the united states and canada from these facilities we market mosaic produced phosphate and potash products for customers who in turn resell the product into the distribution channel or directly to farmers in the united states and canada 

we own port facilities in tampa florida and houston texas which have deep water berth capabilities providing access to the gulf of mexico we also own warehouse distribution facilities in savage minnesota pekin illinois and henderson kentucky 

in addition to the geographically situated facilities that we own our us distribution operations also include leased distribution space or contractual throughput agreements in other key geographical areas such as california florida illinois indiana iowa kentucky louisiana minnesota nebraska north dakota ohio oklahoma texas and wisconsin 

our canadian customers include independent dealers and national accounts we also lease and own warehouse facilities in saskatchewan ontario quebec and manitoba in canada 

international 

outside of the united states and canada we market our phosphates segments products through our international distribution segment as well as a salesforce focused on geographies outside of north america 

our sales outside of the united states and canada of saskatchewan potash products are made through canpotex canpotex sales are allocated among its members based on peaking capacity effective january 1 2015 our entitlement increased from approximately 388 to 406 as a result of a proving run successfully completed at our colonsay mine in 2014 effective january 1 2016 our share of canpotex sales decreased to 391 as one of canpotexs other members demonstrated an increase in its capacity our potash exports from carlsbad are sold through our own sales force we also market our potash segment’s products through our international distribution segment which acquires potash primarily through canpotex the countries that account for the largest amount of international potash sales by volume are brazil china indonesia india and malaysia 

to service the needs of our customers our international distribution segment includes a network of strategically located sales offices crop nutrient blending and bagging facilities port terminals and warehouse distribution facilities that we own and operate in key geographic areas throughout several countries the blending and bagging facilities primarily produce blends from phosphate potash and nitrogen the average product mix in our blends by volume contains approximately 50 phosphate 35 potash and 15   nitrogen although this mix differs based on seasonal and other factors our international distribution segments operations serve primarily as a sales outlet for our north american phosphates production both for resale and as an input for blends our potash segment also has historically furnished the majority of the raw materials needs for the production of blends primarily via canpotex and is expected to continue to do so in the future 

other products 

with a strong brand position in a multibillion dollar animal feed ingredients global market our phosphates segment supplies animal feed ingredients for poultry and livestock to customers in north america latin america and asia our potash sales to nonagricultural users are primarily to large industrial accounts and the animal feed industry additionally we sell potash for deicing and as a water softener regenerant as well as fluorosilicic acid for water fluoridation 

competition 

because crop nutrients are global commodities available from numerous sources crop nutrition companies compete primarily on the basis of delivered price other competitive factors include product quality cost and availability of raw materials customer service plant efficiency and availability of product as a result markets for our products are highly competitive we compete with a broad range of domestic and international producers including farmer cooperatives subsidiaries of larger companies and independent crop nutrient companies foreign competitors often have access to cheaper raw materials are required to comply with less stringent regulatory requirements or are owned or subsidized by governments and as a result may have cost advantages over north american companies we believe that our extensive north american and international production and distribution system provides us with a competitive advantage by allowing us to achieve economies of scale 

transportation and storage efficiencies and obtain market intelligence also we believe our premium products provide us a competitive advantage with customers in north and south america 

unlike many of our competitors we have our own distribution system to sell phosphate and potashbased crop nutrients and animal feed ingredients whether produced by us or by other third parties around the globe in north america we have one of the largest and most strategically located distribution systems for crop nutrients including warehouse facilities in key agricultural regions we also have an extensive network of distribution facilities internationally including in the key growth regions of south america and asia with port terminals warehouses and blending plants in brazil paraguay china and india our global presence allows us to efficiently serve customers in approximately 40 countries 

phosphates segment 

our phosphates segment operates in a highly competitive global market among the competitors in the global phosphate industry are domestic and foreign companies as well as foreign governmentsupported producers in asia and north africa phosphate producers compete primarily based on price and to a lesser extent product quality service and innovation similar to how we compete with our microessentials ®  product major integrated producers of feed phosphates are located in the united states europe and china many smaller producers are located in emerging markets around the world many of these smaller producers are not miners of phosphate rock or manufacturers of phosphoric acid and are required to purchase this material on the open market 

we believe that we are a low cost integrated producer of phosphatebased crop nutrients due in part to our scale vertical integration and strategic network of production and distribution facilities as the world’s largest producer of concentrated phosphates as well as the second largest miner of phosphate rock in the world and the largest in the united states we maintain an advantage over some competitors as the scale of operations effectively reduces production costs per unit we are also vertically integrated to captively supply one of our key inputs phosphate rock to our phosphate production facilities we believe that our position as an integrated producer of phosphate rock provides us with a significant cost advantage over competitors that are nonintegrated phosphate producers our investment in the miski mayo mine and related commercial offtake supply agreement to purchase a share of the phosphate rock allows us to supplement our overall phosphate rock needs in addition we expect that mwspc will enable us to not only further diversify our sources of phosphates but also improve our access to key agricultural countries in asia and the middle east 

we produce ammonia at our faustina louisiana concentrates plant in quantities sufficient to meet approximately one quarter of our total ammonia needs with no captive ammonia production in florida we are subject to significant volatility in our purchase price of ammonia from world markets one of the cf ammonia supply agreements is expected to provide us with a long term supply of a substantial volume of ammonia at prices based on the price of natural gas and is intended to lessen this volatility with our own sulfur transportation barges and our 50 ownership interest in gulf sulphur services we are also wellpositioned to source an adequate flexible and costeffective supply of sulfur our third key input we believe that our investments in sulfur transportation assets continue to afford us a competitive advantage compared to other producers in cost and access to sulfur 

with facilities in both central florida and louisiana we are logistically well positioned to fulfill our needs at very competitive prices those multiple production points also afford us the flexibility to optimally balance supply and demand 

potash segment 

potash is a commodity available from several geographical regions around the world and consequently the market is highly competitive through our participation in canpotex we compete outside of north america against various independent and stateowned potash producers canpotex has substantial expertise and logistical resources for the international distribution of potash including strategically located export assets in portland oregon and vancouver british columbia our principal methods of competition with respect to the sale of potash include product pricing and offering consistent highquality products and superior service we believe that our potash cost structure is competitive in the industry and should improve as we achieve the expected increases in production from our potash expansion projects 

international distribution segment 

our international distribution segment generally operates in highly competitive business environments in each of its markets competing with local businesses and with products that are available from many other sources we believe that our international distribution segments vertical integration with our own production businesses as well as our focus on product 

innovation and customer solutions position us with an advantage over many of our competitors we have a strong brand in the countries in which we have international distribution activities in addition to having access to our own production our international distribution activities have the capability to supply a wide variety of crop nutrients to our dealerfarmer customer base our strategic positions in brazil paraguay china and india allow us to capitalize on the nutrient demand in these large and growing international regions 

factors affecting demand 

our results of operations historically have reflected the effects of several external factors which are beyond our control and have in the past produced significant downward and upward swings in operating results revenues are highly dependent upon conditions in the agriculture industry and can be affected by among other factors crop conditions changes in agricultural production practices worldwide economic conditions including the increasing world population household incomes and demand for more protein rich food particularly in developing regions such as china india and latin america changing demand for biofuels variability in commodity pricing governmental policies the level of inventories in the crop nutrient distribution channels customer expectations about farmer economics future crop nutrient prices and availability and transportation costs among other matters market trends in raw material costs market prices for crop nutrients and weather furthermore our crop nutrients business is seasonal to the extent farmers and agricultural enterprises in the markets in which we compete purchase more crop nutrient products during the spring and fall the international scope of our business spanning the northern and southern hemispheres reduces to some extent the seasonal impact on our business the degree of seasonality of our business can change significantly from year to year due to conditions in the agricultural industry and other factors the seasonal nature of our businesses requires significant working capital for inventory in advance of the planting seasons 

we sell products throughout the world unfavorable changes in trade protection laws policies and measures government policies and other regulatory requirements affecting trade unexpected changes in tax and trade treaties strengthening or weakening of foreign economies as well as political relations with the united states may cause sales trends to customers in one or more foreign countries to differ from sales trends in the united states 

our international operations are subject to risks from changes in foreign currencies or government policy which can affect local farmer economics 

other matters 

employees 

we had approximately 8900 employees as of december 31 2015  consisting of approximately 3800 salaried and 5100 hourly employees 

labor relations 

as of december 31 2015    

 failure to renew any of our union agreements could result in a strike or labor stoppage that could have a material adverse effect on our operations however we have not experienced significant work stoppage in many years and historically have had good labor relations

 item 1a risk factors 

our business financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of the risks and uncertainties described below 

our esterhazy mine has had an inflow of salt saturated brine for more than 30 years 

since december 1985 we have had inflows of salt saturated brine into our esterhazy saskatchewan mine over the past century several potash mines experiencing water inflow problems have flooded in order to control brine inflows at esterhazy we have incurred and will continue to incur expenditures certain of which due to their nature have been capitalized while others have been charged to expense 

at various times we experience changing amounts and patterns of brine inflows at the esterhazy mine periodically some of these inflows have exceeded available pumping capacity if that were to continue for several months without abatement it could exceed our available storage capacity and ability to effectively manage the brine inflow this could adversely affect production at the esterhazy mine see “key factors that can affect results of operations and financial condition” and “potash net sales and gross margin” in our management’s analysis for a discussion of costs and other information relating to the brine inflows the brine inflow is variable resulting in both net inflows the rate of inflow is more than the amount we are pumping out of the mine and net outflows when we are pumping more brine out of the mine than the rate of inflow there can be no assurance that   

 from time to time new or improved technology becomes available to facilitate our remediation of the inflows such as horizontal drilling techniques taking advantage of these new or improved technologies may require significant capital expenditures andor may increase our costs of remediation 

it is possible that the costs of remedial efforts at esterhazy may further increase in the future and that such an increase could be material or in the extreme scenario that the brine inflows risk to employees or remediation costs may increase to a level which would cause us to change our mining processes or abandon the mines see “key factors that can affect results of operations and financial condition” and “potash net sales and gross margin” in our management’s analysis which is incorporated herein by reference for a discussion of costs risks and other information relating to the brine inflows 

due to the ongoing brine inflow at esterhazy subject to exceptions that are limited in scope and amount we are unable to obtain coverage for underground operations for water incursion problems our mines at colonsay saskatchewan and carlsbad new mexico are also subject to the risks of inflow of water as a result of our shaft mining operations 

our operating results are highly dependent upon and fluctuate based upon business and economic conditions and governmental policies affecting the agricultural industry where we or our customers operate these factors are outside of our control and may significantly affect our profitability 

our operating results are highly dependent upon business and economic conditions and governmental policies affecting the agricultural industry which we cannot control the agricultural products business can be affected by a number of factors the most important of these factors for us markets are   

 22 

 international market conditions which are also outside of our control may also significantly influence our operating results the international market for crop nutrients is influenced by such factors as the relative value of the us dollar and its impact upon the cost of importing crop nutrients foreign agricultural policies including subsidy policies the existence of or changes in import or foreign currency exchange barriers in certain foreign markets changes in the hard currency demands of certain countries and other regulatory policies of foreign governments as well as the laws and policies of the united states affecting foreign trade and investment 

our most important products are global commodities and we face intense global competition from other crop nutrient producers that can affect our prices and volumes 

our most important products are concentrated phosphate crop nutrients including diammonium phosphate or dap monoammonium phosphate or map microessentials ®  and muriate of potash or mop we sell most of our dap map and mop in the form of global commodities our sales of these products face intense global competition from other crop nutrient producers 

changes in competitors’ production or shifts in their marketing focus have in the past significantly affected both the prices at which we sell our products and the volumes that we sell and are likely to continue to do so in the future 

competitors are more likely to increase their production at times when world agricultural and crop nutrient markets are strong and to focus on sales into regions where their returns are highest increases in the global supply of dap map and mop or competitors’ increased sales into regions in which we have significant sales could adversely affect our prices and volumes 

competitors and potential new entrants in the markets for both concentrated phosphate crop nutrients and potash have in recent years expanded capacity or begun or announced plans to expand capacity or build new facilities the extent to which current global or local economic and financial conditions changes in global or local economic and financial conditions or other factors may cause delays or cancellation of some of these ongoing or planned projects or result in the acceleration of existing or new projects is unclear in addition the level of exports by producers of concentrated phosphate crop nutrients in china depends to a significant extent on chinese government actions to curb exports through among other measures prohibitive export taxes at times when the government believes it desirable to assure ample domestic supplies of concentrated phosphate crop nutrients to stimulate grain and oilseed production 

in addition some of our competitors who are expanding their potash production capacity include other members of canpotex canpotex members’ respective shares of canpotex sales is based upon the members’ respective proven peaking capacity for producing potash when a canpotex member expands its production capacity the new capacity is added to that member’s proven peaking capacity based on a proving run at the maximum production level antitrust and competition laws prohibit the members of canpotex from coordinating their production decisions including the timing of their respective proving runs worldwide potash production levels during these proving runs could exceed thencurrent market demand resulting in an oversupply of potash and lower potash prices 

we cannot accurately predict when or whether competitors’ or new entrants’ ongoing or planned capacity expansions or new facilities will be completed the timing of competitors’ tests to prove peaking capacity for canpotex purposes the cumulative effect of these and recently completed expansions the impact of future decisions by the chinese government on the level of chinese exports of concentrated phosphate crop nutrients or the effects of these or other actions by our competitors on the prices for our products or the volumes that we will be able to sell 

our crop nutrients and other products are subject to price and demand volatility resulting from periodic imbalances of supply and demand which may cause our results of operations to fluctuate 

historically the market for crop nutrients has been cyclical and prices and demand for our products have fluctuated to a significant extent particularly for phosphates and to a lesser extent potash periods of high demand increasing profits and high capacity utilization tend to lead to new plant investment and increased production this growth increases supply until the market is oversaturated leading to declining prices and declining capacity utilization until the cycle repeats 

as a result crop nutrient prices and volumes have been volatile this price and volume volatility may cause our results of operations to fluctuate and potentially deteriorate the price at which we sell our crop nutrient products and our sales volumes could fall in the event of industry oversupply conditions which could have a material adverse effect on our business 

financial condition and results of operations in contrast high prices may lead our customers and farmers to delay purchasing decisions in anticipation of future lower prices thus impacting our sales volumes 

due to reduced market demand depressed agricultural economic conditions and other factors we and our predecessors have at various times suspended or reduced production at some of our facilities the extent to which we utilize available capacity at our facilities will cause fluctuations in our results of operations as we will incur costs for any temporary or indefinite shutdowns of our facilities and lower sales tend to lead to higher fixed costs as a percentage of sales 

variations in crop nutrient application rates may exacerbate the cyclicality of the crop nutrient markets 

farmers are able to maximize their economic return by applying optimum amounts of crop nutrients farmers’ decisions about the application rate for each crop nutrient or to forego application of a crop nutrient particularly phosphate and potash vary from year to year depending on a number of factors including among others crop prices crop nutrient and other crop input costs or the level of the crop nutrient remaining in the soil following the previous harvest farmers are more likely to increase application rates when crop prices are relatively high crop nutrient and other crop input costs are relatively low and the level of the crop nutrient remaining in the soil is relatively low conversely farmers are likely to reduce or forego application when farm economics are weak or declining or the level of the crop nutrients remaining in the soil is relatively high this variability in application rates can materially accentuate the cyclicality in prices for our products and our sales volumes 

our crop nutrient business is seasonal which may result in carrying significant amounts of inventory and seasonal variations in working capital and our inability to predict future seasonal crop nutrient demand accurately may result in excess inventory or product shortages 

the crop nutrient business is seasonal farmers tend to apply crop nutrients during two short application periods the strongest one in the spring before planting and the other in the fall after harvest as a result the strongest demand for our products typically occurs during the spring planting season with a second period of strong demand following the fall harvest in contrast we and other crop nutrient producers generally produce our products throughout the year as a result we andor our customers generally build inventories during the low demand periods of the year in order to ensure timely product availability during the peak sales seasons the seasonality of crop nutrient demand results in our sales volumes and net sales typically being the highest during the north american spring season and our working capital requirements typically being the highest just prior to the start of the spring season our quarterly financial results can vary significantly from one year to the next due to weatherrelated shifts in planting schedules and purchasing patterns 

if seasonal demand exceeds our projections we will not have enough product and our customers may acquire products from our competitors which would negatively impact our profitability if seasonal demand is less than we expect we will be left with excess inventory and higher working capital and liquidity requirements the degree of seasonality of our business can change significantly from year to year due to conditions in the agricultural industry and other factors 

the distribution channels for crop nutrients have capacity to build significant levels of inventories which can adversely affect our sales volumes and selling prices 

in order to balance the production needs of crop nutrient producers with farmers’ seasonal use of crop nutrients crop nutrient distribution channels need to have the capacity to build significant inventories the buildup of inventories in the distribution channels can become excessive particularly during the cyclical periods of low demand that have been typical in the crop nutrient industry when there are excessive inventories in the distribution channel our sales volumes and selling prices can be adversely impacted even during periods in which farmers’ use of crop nutrients may remain strong 

changes in transportation costs can affect our sales volumes and selling prices 

the cost of delivery is a significant factor in the total cost to customers and farmers of crop nutrients as a result changes in transportation costs or in customer expectations about them can affect our sales volumes and prices 

customer expectations about future events can have a significant effect on the demand for our products these expectations can significantly affect our sales volumes and selling prices 

customer expectations about future events have had and are expected to continue to have an effect on the demand and prices for crop nutrients future events that may be affected by customer expectations include among others   

 24 

customer expectations about selling prices and availability of crop nutrients have had and are expected to continue to have an effect on the demand for crop nutrients when customers anticipate increasing crop nutrient selling prices customers tend to accumulate inventories before the anticipated price increases this can result in a lag in our realization of rising market prices for our products conversely customers tend to delay their purchases when they anticipate future selling prices for crop nutrients will stabilize or decrease adversely affecting our sales volumes and selling prices customer expectations about availability of crop nutrients can have similar effects on sales volumes and prices   

 similarly customer expectations about future farmer economics have had and are expected to continue to have an effect on the demand for crop nutrients when customers anticipate improving farmer economics customers tend to accumulate crop nutrient inventories in anticipation of increasing sales volumes and selling prices this can result in a lag in our realization of rising market prices for our products conversely when customers anticipate declining farmer economics customers tend to reduce the level of their purchases of crop nutrients adversely affecting our sales volumes and selling prices   

 as discussed above increasing transportation costs effectively increase customers’ and farmers’ costs for crop nutrients and can reduce the amount we realize for our sales expectations of decreasing transportation costs can result in customers and farmers anticipating that they may be able to decrease their costs by delaying purchases as a result changes in customer expectations about transportation costs can affect our sales volumes and prices 

we conduct our operations primarily through a limited number of key production and distribution facilities any disruption at one of these facilities could have a material adverse impact on our business the risk of material disruption increases when demand for our products results in high operating rates at our facilities 

we conduct our operations through a limited number of key production and distribution facilities these facilities include our phosphate mines and concentrates plants our potash mines and the ports and other distribution facilities through which we canpotex and any joint ventures in which we participate conduct our respective businesses as well as other commercial arrangements with unrelated third parties any disruption of operations at one of these facilities has the possibility of significantly affecting our production or our ability to distribute our products operating these facilities at high rates during periods of high demand for our products increases the risk of mechanical or structural failures decreases the time available for routine maintenance and increases the impact on our operating results from any disruption a disruption of operations at one of our key facilities could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 

examples of the types of events that could result in a disruption at one of these facilities include adverse weather strikes or other work stoppages deliberate malicious acts including acts of terrorism political and economic instability cyber attacks and other risks associated with our international operations changes in permitting financial assurance or other environmental health and safety laws or other changes in the regulatory environment in which we operate legal and regulatory proceedings our relationships with other members of canpotex and any joint ventures in which we participate and their or our exit from participation in canpotex or any such joint ventures other changes in our commercial arrangements with unrelated third parties brine inflows at our esterhazy saskatchewan mine or our other shaft mines other accidents occurring in the course of operating activities and other factors 

insurance market conditions our loss experience and other factors affect the insurance coverage that we carry and we are not fully insured against all potential hazards and risks incident to our business as a result our insurance coverage may not adequately cover our losses 

we maintain property business interruption and casualty insurance policies but we are not fully insured against all potential hazards and risks incident to our business we are subject to various selfretentions and deductibles under these insurance policies as a result of market conditions our loss experience and other factors our premiums selfretentions and deductibles for insurance policies can increase substantially and in some instances certain insurance may become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage in addition significantly increased costs could lead us to decide to reduce or possibly eliminate coverage as a result a disruption of operations at one of our key facilities or a significant casualty could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 

important raw materials and energy used in our businesses in the past have been and may in the future be the subject of volatile pricing changes in the price of our raw materials could have a material impact on our businesses 

natural gas ammonia and sulfur are key raw materials used in the manufacture of phosphate crop nutrient products natural gas is used as both a chemical feedstock and a fuel to produce anhydrous ammonia which is a raw material used in the production of concentrated phosphate products natural gas is also a significant energy source used in the potash solution mining process from time to time our profitability has been and may in the future be impacted by the price and availability of these raw materials and other energy costs because most of our products are commodities there can be no assurance that we will be able to pass through increased costs to our customers a significant increase in the price of natural gas ammonia sulfur or energy costs that is not recovered through an increase in the price of our related crop nutrients products could have a material adverse impact on our business in addition in 2017 we expect to commence purchasing ammonia under our longterm cf ammonia supply agreement under which we will purchase approximately 545000 to 725000 tonnes of ammonia per year during a term that may extend until december 31 2032 at a price to be determined by a formula based on the prevailing price of us natural gas if the price of natural gas rises or the market price for ammonia falls outside of the range we currently anticipate we may not fully realize the cost benefit from the natural gas based pricing under this agreement or the cost of our ammonia under this agreement could be a competitive disadvantage 

during periods when the price for concentrated phosphates is falling because of falling raw material prices we may experience a lag in realizing the benefits of the falling raw materials prices this lag can adversely affect our gross margins and profitability 

during some periods changes in market prices for raw materials can lead to changes in the global market prices for concentrated phosphate crop nutrients in particular the global market prices for concentrated phosphate crop nutrients can be affected by changes in the market prices for sulfur ammonia phosphate rock andor phosphoric acid raw materials increasing market prices for these raw materials tend to put upward pressure on the selling prices for concentrated phosphate crop nutrients and decreasing market prices for these raw materials tend to put downward pressure on selling prices for concentrated phosphate crop nutrients when the market prices for these raw materials plunge rapidly the selling prices for our concentrated phosphate crop nutrients can fall more rapidly than we are able to consume our raw material inventory that we purchased or committed to purchase in the past at higher prices as a result our costs may not fall as rapidly as the selling prices of our products until we are able to consume the higher priced raw materials our gross margins and profitability can be adversely affected 

during periods when the prices for our products are falling because of falling raw material prices we could be required to writedown the value of our inventories any such writedown would adversely affect our results of operations and the level of our assets 

we carry our inventories at the lower of cost or market in periods when the market prices for our products are falling rapidly in response to falling market prices for raw materials it is possible that we could be required to writedown the value of our inventories if market prices fall below our costs any such writedown would adversely affect our results of operations and the level of our assets any such effect could be material 

our estimates of future selling prices reflect in part the purchase commitments we have from our customers as a result defaults on these existing purchase commitments because of the global or local economic and financial conditions or for other reasons could adversely affect our estimates of future selling prices and require additional inventory writedowns 

in the event of a disruption to existing terminaling facilities or transportation for our products or raw materials alternative terminaling facilities or transportation might not be available on a timely basis or have sufficient capacity to fully serve all of our customers or facilities 

in the event of a disruption of existing terminaling facilities or transportation for our products or raw materials alternative terminaling facilities or transportation might not be available on a timely basis or have sufficient capacity to fully serve all of our customers or facilities 

terminaling facilities and transportation include the ports and other distribution facilities through which we canpotex and the joint ventures in which we participate conduct our respective businesses transportation and related equipment arrangements and other commercial arrangements with unrelated third parties 

examples of the types of events that could result in a disruption of terminaling facilities or transportation include adverse weather strikes or other work stoppages deliberate malicious acts political and economic instability and other risks associated with our international operations changes in permitting financial assurance or other environmental health and 

safety laws or other changes in the regulatory environment in which we operate legal and regulatory proceedings our relationships with other members of canpotex and any joint ventures in which we participate and their or our exit from participation in canpotex or any such joint ventures other changes in our commercial arrangements with unrelated third parties accidents occurring in the course of operating activities lack of truck rail barge or ship transportation and other factors we discuss a number of these examples in more detail throughout this risk factors section 

we are subject to risks associated with our international sales and operations which could negatively affect our sales to customers in foreign countries as well as our operations and assets in foreign countries some of these factors may also make it less attractive to distribute cash generated by our operations outside the united states to our stockholders or to utilize cash generated by our operations in one country to fund our operations or repayments of indebtedness in another country or to support other corporate purposes 

for 2015  we derived approximately 63  of our net sales from customers located outside of the united states as a result we are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties relating to international sales and operations including   

 the occurrence of any of the above in the countries in which we operate or elsewhere could jeopardize or limit our ability to transact business there and could adversely affect our revenues and operating results and the value of our assets located outside of the united states 

in addition tax regulations currency exchange controls and other restrictions may also make it economically unattractive to   

 changes in tax laws or regulations or their interpretation or exposure to additional tax liabilities could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

we are subject to taxes including income taxes resource taxes and royalties and other nonincome based taxes in the us canada china brazil and other countries where we operate changes in tax laws or regulations or their interpretation could result in higher taxes which could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

our international assets are located in countries with volatile conditions which could subject us and our assets to significant risks 

we are a global business with substantial assets located outside of the united states and canada our operations in brazil china india and paraguay are a fundamental part of our business we also have joint venture investments in the miski mayo mine in peru that supplies phosphate rock to us and mwspc which is developing a mine and chemical complexes that we presently expect would produce phosphate fertilizers and other downstream products in the kingdom of saudi arabia volatile economic political and market conditions in these and other emerging market countries may have a negative impact on our operations operating results and financial condition in addition unfavorable changes in trade protection laws policies and measures or governmental actions and policies and other regulatory requirements affecting trade and the pricing and sourcing of our raw materials may also have a negative impact on our operations operating results and financial condition 

natural resource extraction is an important part of the economy in peru and in the past there have been protests against other natural resource operations in peru as of the date of this report there remain numerous social conflicts that exist within 

the natural resource sector in peru and as a result there is potential for active protests against natural resource companies if the government of peru’s proactive efforts to address the social and environmental issues surrounding natural resource activities were not successful protests could extend to or impact the miski mayo mine and adversely affect our investment in the miski mayo joint venture or the supply of phosphate rock to us from the mine 

adverse weather conditions including the impact of hurricanes and excess heat cold snow rainfall and drought have in the past and may in the future adversely affect our operations particularly our phosphates business and result in increased costs decreased production and potential liabilities 

adverse weather conditions including the impact of hurricanes and excess heat cold snow rainfall and drought have in the past and may in the future adversely affect our operations particularly our phosphates business in the past hurricanes have resulted in minor physical damage to our facilities in florida and louisiana in addition a release of process wastewater at our riverview florida facility during a hurricane resulted in a small civil fine settlement for an immaterial amount of claims for natural resource damages by governmental agencies and an ongoing private lawsuit 

additionally water treatment costs particularly at our florida operations due to high water balances tend to increase significantly following excess rainfall from hurricanes or other adverse weather some of our florida facilities have high water levels that may from time to time require treatment the high water balances at phosphate facilities in florida also led the florida department of environmental protection to adopt new rules requiring phosphate production facilities to meet more stringent process water management objectives for phosphogypsum management systems 

if additional excess rainfall or hurricanes occur in coming years our facilities may be required to take additional measures to manage process water to comply with existing or future requirements and these measures could potentially have a material effect on our business and financial condition 

adverse weather may also cause a loss of production due to disruptions in our supply chain for example oil refineries that supply sulfur to us can be closed as a result of a hurricane and incoming shipments of ammonia can be delayed disrupting production at our florida or louisiana facilities 

drought can also adversely affect us for example drought can reduce farmers’ crop yields and the uptake of phosphates and potash reducing the need for application of additional phosphates and potash for the next planting season drought can also lower river levels adversely affecting delivery of our products to our customers 

our operations are dependent on having the required permits and approvals from governmental authorities denial or delay by a government agency in issuing any of our permits and approvals or imposition of restrictive conditions on us with respect to these permits and approvals may impair our business and operations 

we hold numerous governmental environmental mining and other permits and approvals authorizing operations at each of our facilities a decision by a government agency to revoke or substantially modify an existing permit or approval could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue operations at the affected facility 

expansion of our operations also is predicated upon securing the necessary environmental or other permits or approvals over the next several years we and our subsidiaries will be continuing our efforts to obtain permits in support of our anticipated florida mining operations at certain of our properties 

a denial of or delay in issuing these permits the issuance of permits with costprohibitive conditions legal actions that prevent us from relying on permits or revocation of permits could prevent us from mining at these properties and thereby have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

for example   

 28 

 the periods of shutdown and reduced phosphate rock production at our south fort meade mine resulted in costs to suspend operations and idle plant costs lower phosphate rock mining production levels also adversely affected gross margin   

we have included additional discussion about permitting for our phosphate mines in florida under “environmental health safety and security matters—operating requirements and impacts—permitting” in our management’s analysis 

we are subject to financial assurance requirements as part of our routine business operations these financial assurance requirements affect our costs and increase our liquidity requirements if we were unable to satisfy applicable financial assurance requirements we might not be able to obtain or maintain permits we need to operate our business as we have in the past our need to comply with these requirements could materially affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

in many cases as a condition to procuring or maintaining permits and approvals or otherwise we are required to comply with financial assurance requirements of governmental authorities the purpose of these requirements is to provide comfort to the government that sufficient funds will be available for the ultimate closure postclosure care andor reclamation of our facilities with respect to the facilities we acquired as part of the cf phosphate assets acquisition we have funded a trust to meet florida state regulations governing financial assurance related to the closure and postclosure care of phosphogypsum stacks on a closed facility in florida and under the terms of a consent decree with federal and state regulators we have funded a separate trust as a means of complying with similar requirements relating to our plant city florida facility these financial assurance funding obligations require estimates of future expenditures that could be impacted by refinements in scope technological developments cost inflation changes in regulations discount rates and the timing of activities additional funding could be required in the future if increases in cost estimates exceed the amounts held in the applicable trusts which could materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

as more fully discussed in note 20  of our notes to consolidated financial statements in september 2015 we entered into consent decrees with federal and state regulators that when effective will require us to provide meaningful additional financial assurance for the estimated costs of closure and postclosure care of substantially all of our phosphogypsum management systems excluding those acquired as part of the cf phosphate assets acquisition after the consent decrees become effective we will deposit cash in the total amount of 630 million into two trust funds corresponding to a material portion of our estimated costs of closure and postclosure care we will also issue a 50 million letter of credit in 2017 to further support our financial assurance obligations under one of the consent decrees and we have agreed to guarantee the difference between the amounts held in each trust fund including earnings and the estimated closure and longterm care costs compliance with the financial assurance requirements included in these consent decrees which are more burdensome than the current state requirements will satisfy substantially all of our state financial assurance obligations excluding those relating to the facilities acquired as part of the cf phosphate assets acquisition however there can be no assurance that the consent decrees which are subject to court approval will be approved or that they will be approved in substantially the form in which they were submitted as to financial assurance if additional requirements are imposed such requirements could impose additional expense on us or utilize a larger portion of our available liquidity 

with respect to our facilities other than those acquired as part of the cf phosphate assets acquisition our state financial assurance requirements have historically been satisfied without the need for any expenditure of corporate funds to the extent our financial statements meet certain balance sheet and income statement financial strength tests in the event that the consent decrees discussed above do not become effective then in the event that we are unable to satisfy the applicable state financial strength tests we must utilize alternative methods of complying with the financial assurance requirements or could be subject to enforcement proceedings brought by relevant government agencies potential alternative methods of compliance include negotiating a consent agreement that imposes alternative financial assurance or other conditions or alternatively providing 

credit support in the form of cash escrows or trusts surety bonds from insurance companies letters of credit from banks or other forms of financial instruments or collateral to satisfy the financial assurance requirements use of these alternative means of financial assurance imposes additional expense on us some of them such as letters of credit also use a portion of our available liquidity other alternative means of financial assurance such as surety bonds may in some cases require collateral and generally require us to obtain a discharge of the bonds or to post additional collateral typically in the form of cash or letters of credit at the request of the issuer of the bonds collateral that is required may be in many forms including letters of credit or other financial instruments that utilize a portion of our available liquidity or in the form of assets such as real estate which reduces our flexibility to manage or sell assets in the past we have also not always been able to satisfy applicable financial strength tests and in the future it is possible that we will not be able to pass the applicable financial strength tests negotiate or receive approval of consent decrees establish escrow or trust accounts or obtain letters of credit surety bonds or other financial instruments on acceptable terms and conditions or at a reasonable cost or that the form andor cost of compliance could increase which could materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

we have included additional discussion about financial assurance requirements under “off balance sheet arrangements and obligations—other commercial commitments” in our management’s analysis 

the other environmental regulations to which we are subject may also have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition to permitting and financial assurance requirements we are subject to numerous other environmental health and safety laws and regulations in the us canada china brazil and other countries where we operate these laws and regulations govern a wide range of matters including environmental controls land reclamation discharges to air and water and remediation of hazardous substance releases they significantly affect our operating activities as well as the level of our operating costs and capital expenditures in some international jurisdictions environmental laws change frequently and it may be difficult for us to determine if we are in compliance with all material environmental laws at any given time 

we are and may in the future be involved in legal and regulatory proceedings that could be material to us these proceedings include “legacy” matters arising from activities of our predecessor companies and from facilities and businesses that we have never owned or operated 

we have in the past been are currently and may in the future be subject to legal and regulatory proceedings that could be material to our business results of operations liquidity or financial condition joint ventures in which we participate could also become subject to these sorts of proceedings these proceedings may be brought by the government or private parties and may arise out of a variety of matters including   

 the legal and regulatory proceedings to which we are currently or may in the future be subject can depending on the circumstances result in monetary damage awards fines penalties other liabilities injunctions or other court or administrative rulings that interrupt impede or otherwise materially affect our business operations andor criminal sanctions 

among other environmental laws the us comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act “ cercla ” imposes liability including for cleanup costs without regard to fault or to the legality of a party’s conduct on certain categories of persons including current and former owners and operators of a site and parties who are considered to have contributed to the release of “hazardous substances” into the environment under cercla or various us state analogs a party may under certain circumstances be required to bear more than its proportional share of cleanup costs at a site where it has liability if payments cannot be obtained from other responsible parties as a crop nutrient company working with chemicals and other hazardous substances we will periodically incur liabilities and cleanup costs under cercla and other environmental laws with regard to our current or former facilities adjacent or nearby thirdparty facilities or offsite disposal locations 

pending and potential legal and regulatory proceedings may arise out of our present activities including operations at current facilities they may also arise out of past activities by us our predecessor companies and subsidiaries that our predecessors have sold these past activities were in some cases at facilities that we and our subsidiaries no longer own or operate and may have never owned or operated 

settlements of legal and regulatory matters frequently require court approval in the event a court were not to approve of a settlement it is possible that we and the other party or parties to the matter might not be able to settle it on terms that were acceptable to all parties or that we could be required to accept more stringent terms of settlement than required by the opposing parties 

we have included additional information with respect to pending legal and regulatory proceedings in note 20  of our notes to consolidated financial statements and in this report in part i item 3 “legal proceedings” 

these legal and regulatory proceedings involve inherent uncertainties and could negatively impact our business results of operations liquidity or financial condition 

the permitting financial assurance and other environmental health and safety laws and regulations to which we are subject may become more stringent over time this could increase the effects on us of these laws and regulations and the increased effects could be material 

continued government and public emphasis on environmental health and safety issues in the us canada china brazil paraguay and other countries where we operate can be expected to result in requirements that apply to us and our operations that are more stringent than those that are described above and elsewhere in this report these more stringent requirements may include among other matters increased levels of future investments and expenditures for environmental controls at ongoing operations which will be charged against income from future operations increased levels of the financial assurance requirements to which we are subject increased efforts or costs to obtain permits or denial of permits other new or interpretations of existing statutes or regulations that impose new or more stringent restrictions or liabilities including liabilities under cercla or similar statutes including restrictions or liabilities related to elevated levels of naturallyoccurring radiation that arise from disturbing the ground in the course of mining activities and other matters that could increase our expenses capital requirements or liabilities or adversely affect our business liquidity or financial condition in addition to the extent restrictions imposed in countries where our competitors operate such as china india former soviet union countries or morocco are less stringent than in the countries where we operate our competitors could gain cost or other competitive advantages over us these effects could be material 

among other matters there are several ongoing initiatives relating to nutrient discharges new regulatory restrictions from these initiatives could have a material effect on either us or our customers for example   

 31 

and urban sources of excess nutrients implementation of the strategy will require legislative or regulatory action at the state level we cannot predict what the requirements of any such legislative or regulatory action could be or whether or how it would affect us or our customers 

 in addition in april 2014 epa and the us army corps of engineers jointly issued a proposed rule that would redefine the scope of waters regulated under the federal clean water act the final rule was issued in june 2015 and became effective in august 2015 but has been challenged through numerous lawsuits in october 2015 the us court of appeals for the sixth circuit issued an order staying the effectiveness of the final rule until after the legal validity of the regulation is resolved we believe the new definition would expand the types and extent of water resources regulated under federal law thereby potentially expanding our permitting and reporting requirements increasing our costs of compliance including costs associated with wetlands and stream mitigation lengthening the time necessary to obtain permits and potentially restricting our ability to mine certain of our phosphate rock reserves these effects could be material 

regulatory restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions and climate change regulations in the united states canada or elsewhere could adversely affect us and these effects could be material 

various governmental initiatives to limit greenhouse gas emissions are under way or under consideration around the world these initiatives could restrict our operating activities require us to make changes in our operating activities that would increase our operating costs reduce our efficiency or limit our output require us to make capital improvements to our facilities increase our energy raw material and transportation costs or limit their availability or otherwise adversely affect our results of operations liquidity or capital resources and these effects could be material to us 

governmental greenhouse gas emission initiatives include among others  the december 2015 agreement the “ paris agreement ” which was the outcome of the 21 st  session of the conference of the parties under the united nations framework convention on climate change unfccc nearly 200 nations including the united states and canada signed the paris agreement which sets out a goal of limiting the average rise in temperatures for this century to below 2 degrees celsius each signatory is expected to develop its own plan referred to as a nationally determined contribution or “ ndc ” for reaching that goal 

the united states submitted its intended ndc ahead of the paris agreement in march 2015 the ndc aims to achieve by 2025 an economywide target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 2628 below its 2005 level it also aims to use best efforts to reduce its emissions by 28 the us target covers all greenhouse gases ghgs that were a part of the 2014 inventory of   greenhouse gas emissions and sinks various legislative or regulatory initiatives relating to greenhouse gases have been adopted or considered by the us congress epa or various states those already adopted may be used to implement the united states’ ndc and as implementation of the paris agreement proceeds more stringent laws and regulations may be enacted to accomplish the goals set out in its ndc it is possible that future legislation or regulation addressing climate change including in response to the paris agreement could adversely affect our operating activities energy raw material and transportation costs results of operations liquidity or capital resources and these effects could be material 

canada remains committed to addressing climate change although the federal government has not released details regarding specific new targets following execution of the paris agreement it has announced that it will be establishing national targets and ensuring that canadian provinces and territories have the flexibility to design their own carbon pricing policies our saskatchewan potash facilities continue to work with fertilizer canada and environment canada on a sector based approach in addition the province of saskatchewan in which our canadian potash mines are located has passed legislation to facilitate the development and administration of climate change regulation in saskatchewan by the province rather than the federal government this legislation is not yet effective but key elements under consideration by the province include establishing a provincial greenhouse gas emission reduction target and compliance mechanisms that would provide flexibility for regulated emitters to meet their greenhouse gas reduction obligations we continue to monitor developments relating to this legislation as well as the potential future effect on our operating activities energy raw material and transportation costs results of operations liquidity or capital resources 

prior to the paris agreement international negotiations concerning greenhouse gas emission reductions and other responses to climate change were underway but final obligations in the postkyoto protocol period after 2012 remained undefined any new international agreements addressing climate change could adversely affect our operating activities energy raw material and transportation costs results of operations liquidity or capital resources and these effects could be material in addition to the extent climate change restrictions imposed in countries where our competitors operate such as china india former soviet union countries or morocco are less stringent than in the united states or canada our competitors could gain cost or other competitive advantages over us 

future climate change could adversely affect us 

the prospective impact of climate change on our operations and those of our customers and farmers remains uncertain scientists have hypothesized that the impacts of climate change could include changes in rainfall patterns water shortages changing sea levels changing storm patterns and intensities and changing temperature levels and that these changes could be severe these impacts could vary by geographic location at the present time we cannot predict the prospective impact of climate change on our results of operations liquidity or capital resources or whether any such effects could be material to us 

some of our competitors and potential competitors have greater resources than we do which may place us at a competitive disadvantage and adversely affect our sales and profitability these competitors include stateowned and governmentsubsidized entities in other countries 

we compete with a number of producers throughout the world including stateowned and governmentsubsidized entities some of these entities may have greater total resources than we do and may be less dependent on earnings from crop nutrients sales than we are in addition some of these entities may have access to lower cost or governmentsubsidized natural gas supplies placing us at a competitive disadvantage furthermore certain governments as owners of some of our competitors may be willing to accept lower prices and profitability on their products in order to support domestic employment or other political or social goals to the extent other producers of crop nutrients enjoy competitive advantages or are willing to accept lower profit levels the price of our products our sales volumes and our profits may be adversely affected 

we do not own a controlling equity interest in our nonconsolidated companies some of which are foreign companies and therefore our operating results and cash flow may be materially affected by how the governing boards and majority owners operate such businesses there may also be limitations on monetary distributions from these companies that are outside of our control together these factors may lower our equity earnings or cash flow from such businesses and negatively impact our results of operations 

we recently entered into an agreement to form mwspc a joint venture to develop a mine and chemical complexes for an estimated 8 billion  that is expected to produce phosphate fertilizers and other downstream products in the kingdom of saudi arabia we have a 25 interest in the joint venture and expect our cash investment will be up to 850 million  funded over a fouryear period the success of this joint venture will depend on among other matters the ability of mwspc to obtain additional planned funding in acceptable amounts and upon acceptable terms the timely development and commencement of operations of production facilities in the kingdom of saudi arabia the future success of current plans for the development and operation of mwspc including the availability and affordability of necessary resources and materials and access to appropriate infrastructure and any future changes in those plans as well as the general economic and political stability of the region 

we also hold minority ownership interests in a joint venture that owns and operates a phosphate rock mine and in other companies that are not controlled by us we expect that the operations and results of mwspc will be and the operations or 

results of some of the other joint ventures or companies are significant to us and their operations can affect our earnings because we do not control these companies either at the board or stockholder levels and because local laws in foreign jurisdictions and contractual obligations may place restrictions on monetary distributions by these companies we cannot ensure that these companies will operate efficiently pay dividends or generally follow the desires of our management by virtue of our board or stockholder representation as a result these companies may contribute less than anticipated to our earnings and cash flow negatively impacting our results of operations and liquidity 

strikes or other forms of work stoppage or slowdown could disrupt our business and lead to increased costs 

our financial performance is dependent on a reliable and productive work force a significant portion of our workforce and that of the joint ventures in which we participate is covered by collective bargaining agreements with unions unsuccessful contract negotiations or adverse labor relations could result in strikes or slowdowns any disruptions may decrease our production and sales or impose additional costs to resolve disputes the risk of adverse labor relations may increase as our profitability increases because labor unions’ expectations and demands generally rise at those times 

accidents occurring in the course of our operating activities could result in significant liabilities interruptions or shutdowns of facilities or the need for significant safety or other expenditures 

we engage in mining and industrial activities that can result in serious accidents if our safety procedures are not effective or if an accident occurs we could be subject to liabilities arising out of personal injuries or death our operations could be interrupted and we might have to shut down or abandon affected facilities accidents could cause us to expend significant amounts to remediate safety issues or to repair damaged facilities for example   

 the excavation of mines can result in potential seismic events or can increase the likelihood or potential severity of a seismic event the rise and fall of water levels such as those arising from the brine inflows and our remediation activities at our esterhazy mine can also result in or increase the likelihood or potential severity of a seismic event our esterhazy mine has experienced minor seismic events from time to time a significant seismic event at one of our mines could result in serious injuries or death or damage to or flooding of the mine or in the extreme scenario cause us to change our mining process or abandon the mine   

 our underground potash shaft mines at esterhazy and colonsay saskatchewan and carlsbad new mexico are subject to risk from fire any failure of our safety procedures in the future could result in serious injuries or death or shutdowns which could result in significant liabilities andor impact on the financial performance of our potash business including a possible material adverse effect on our results of operations liquidity or financial condition   

 we produce ammonia at our faustina louisiana phosphate concentrates plant use ammonia in significant quantities at all of our florida and louisiana phosphates concentrates plants and store ammonia at some of our distribution facilities for our florida phosphates concentrates plants ammonia is received at terminals in tampa and transported by pipelines and rail to our facilities our ammonia is generally stored and transported at high pressures an accident could occur that could result in serious injuries or death or the evacuation of areas near an accident an accident could also result in property damage or the shutdown of our florida or louisiana phosphates concentrates plants the ammonia terminals pipelines or rail lines serving those plants or our other ammonia storage and handling facilities as a result an accident involving ammonia could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations liquidity or financial condition   

 34 

we use sulfuric acid in the production of concentrated phosphates in our florida and louisiana operations some of our florida and louisiana facilities produce fluorosilicic acid which is a hazardous chemical for resale to third parties we also use or produce other hazardous or volatile chemicals at some of our facilities an accident involving any of these chemicals could result in serious injuries or death or evacuation of areas near an accident an accident could also result in property damage or shutdown of our facilities or cause us to expend significant amounts to remediate safety issues or to repair damaged facilities as a result an accident involving any of these chemicals could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations liquidity or financial condition 

deliberate malicious acts including terrorism and cyber attacks could damage our facilities disrupt our operations or injure employees contractors customers or the public and result in liability to us 

intentional acts of destruction could hinder our sales or production and disrupt our supply chain our facilities could be damaged or destroyed reducing our operational production capacity and requiring us to repair or replace our facilities at substantial cost employees contractors and the public could suffer substantial physical injury for which we could be liable governmental authorities may impose security or other requirements that could make our operations more difficult or costly the consequences of any such actions could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

we may be adversely affected by changing antitrust laws to which we are subject increases in crop nutrient prices can increase the scrutiny to which we are subject under these laws 

we are subject to antitrust and competition laws in various countries throughout the world we cannot predict how these laws or their interpretation administration and enforcement will change over time changes in antitrust laws globally or in their interpretation administration or enforcement may limit our existing or future operations and growth or the operations of canpotex which serves as an export association for our potash business increases in crop nutrient prices have in the past resulted in increased scrutiny of the crop nutrient industry under antitrust and competition laws and can increase the risk that these laws could be interpreted administered or enforced in a manner that could affect our operating practices or impose liability on us in a manner that could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

we may be adversely affected by other changes in laws resulting from increases in food and crop nutrient prices 

increases in prices for among other things food fuel and crop inputs including crop nutrients have in the past been the subject of significant discussion by various governmental bodies and officials throughout the world in response to increases it is possible that governments in one or more of the locations in which we operate or where we or our competitors sell our products could take actions that could affect us such actions could include among other matters changes in governmental policies relating to agriculture and biofuels including changes in subsidy levels price controls tariffs windfall profits taxes or export or import taxes any such actions could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

our competitive position could be adversely affected if we are unable to participate in continuing industry consolidation 

most of our products are readily available from a number of competitors and price and other competition in the crop nutrient industry is intense in addition crop nutrient production facilities and distribution activities frequently benefit from economies of scale as a result particularly during pronounced cyclical troughs the crop nutrient industry has a long history of consolidation mosaic itself is the result of a number of industry consolidations we expect consolidation among crop nutrient producers could continue our competitive position could suffer to the extent we are not able to expand our own resources either through consolidations acquisitions joint ventures or partnerships in the future we may not be able to find suitable companies to combine with assets to purchase or joint venture or partnership opportunities to pursue even if we are able to locate desirable opportunities we may not be able to enter into transactions on economically acceptable terms if we do not successfully participate in continuing industry consolidation our ability to compete successfully could be adversely affected and result in the loss of customers or an uncompetitive cost structure which could adversely affect our sales and profitability 

our strategy for managing market risk may not be effective 

our businesses are affected by fluctuations in market prices for our products the purchase price of natural gas ammonia and sulfur consumed in operations freight and shipping costs and foreign currency exchange rates we periodically enter into derivatives and forward purchase contracts to mitigate some of these risks however our strategy may not be successful in minimizing our exposure to these fluctuations see “market risk” in our management’s analysis and note 13  of our notes to consolidated financial statements that is incorporated by reference in this report in part ii item 8 

a shortage or unavailability of railcars tugs barges and ships for carrying our products and the raw materials we use in our business could result in customer dissatisfaction loss of production or sales and higher transportation or equipment costs 

we rely heavily upon truck rail tug barge and ocean freight transportation to obtain the raw materials we need and to deliver our products to our customers in addition the cost of transportation is an important part of the final sale price of our products finding affordable and dependable transportation is important in obtaining our raw materials and to supply our customers higher costs for these transportation services or an interruption or slowdown due to factors including high demand high fuel prices labor disputes layoffs or other factors affecting the availability of qualified transportation workers adverse weather or other environmental events or changes to rail barge or ocean freight systems could negatively affect our ability to produce our products or deliver them to our customers which could affect our performance and results of operations 

strong demand for grain and other products and a strong world economy increase the demand for and reduce the availability of transportation both domestically and internationally shortages of railcars barges and ocean transport for carrying product and increased transit time may result in customer dissatisfaction loss of sales and higher equipment and transportation costs in addition during periods when the shipping industry has a shortage of ships the substantial time needed to build new ships prevents rapid market response delays and missed shipments due to transportation shortages including vessels barges railcars and trucks could result in customer dissatisfaction or loss of sales potential which could negatively affect our performance and results of operations 

additionally the longterm cf ammonia supply agreement under which we have agreed to purchase approximately 545000 to 725000 tonnes of ammonia per year during a term that may extend until december 31 2032 at a price to be determined by a formula based on the prevailing price of us natural gas will become effective in 2017 we will be obligated to provide for transportation of the ammonia under the agreement and if we fail to take the required minimum annual amount cf may elect either to require us to make payment of liquidated damages or to terminate the agreement payment of significant liquidated damages or an election by cf to terminate the agreement could adversely affect our business 

a lack of customers’ access to credit can adversely affect their ability to purchase our products 

some of our customers require access to credit to purchase our products a lack of available credit to customers in one or more countries due to global or local economic conditions or for other reasons could adversely affect demand for crop nutrients 

we extend trade credit to our customers and guarantee the financing that some of our customers use to purchase our products our results of operations may be adversely affected if these customers are unable to repay the trade credit from us or financing from their banks increases in prices for crop nutrient other agricultural inputs and grain may increase this risk 

we extend trade credit to our customers in the united states and throughout the world in some cases for extended periods of time in brazil where there are fewer thirdparty financing sources available to farmers we also have several programs under which we guarantee customers’ financing from financial institutions that they use to purchase our products as our exposure to longer trade credit extended throughout the world and use of guarantees in brazil increases we are increasingly exposed to the risk that some of our customers will not pay us or the amounts we have guaranteed additionally we become increasingly exposed to risk due to weather and crop growing conditions fluctuations in commodity prices or foreign currencies and other factors that influence the price supply and demand for agricultural commodities significant defaults by our customers could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

increases in prices for crop nutrients increase the dollar amount of our sales to customers the larger dollar value of our customers’ purchases may also lead them to request longer trade credit from us andor increase their need for us to guarantee their financing of our products either factor could increase the amount of our exposure to the risk that our customers may be unable to repay the trade credit from us or financing from their banks that we guarantee in addition increases in prices for other agricultural inputs and grain may increase the working capital requirements indebtedness and other liabilities of our customers increase the risk that they will default on the trade credit from us or their financing that we guarantee and decrease the likelihood that we will be able to collect from our customers in the event of their default 

tax rules governing the cargill transaction limited our ability to execute certain actions for a period of time following the cargill transaction and if our procedures for compliance with those restrictions were ineffective notwithstanding the irs ruling and tax opinion issued to cargill in connection with the cargill transaction we could owe significant taxrelated indemnification liabilities to cargill 

the irs issued a ruling to the effect that the splitoff that was part of the cargill transaction would be taxfree to cargill and its stockholders and in connection with the completion of the cargill transaction cargill received a tax opinion relating to certain tax consequences of the cargill transaction notwithstanding the irs ruling and tax opinion however the splitoff and debt exchanges could be taxable to cargill and its stockholders under certain circumstances therefore we and cargill agreed to taxrelated restrictions and indemnities set forth in a tax agreement related to the cargill transaction under which we were restricted or deterred from taking certain actions until may 26 2013 including i redeeming or purchasing our stock in excess of agreedupon amounts ii issuing any equity securities in excess of agreed upon amounts iii approving or recommending a third party’s acquisition of us iv permitting any merger or other combination of mosaic or mos holdings and v entering into an agreement for the purchase of any interest in mosaic or mos holdings subject to certain exceptions we agreed to indemnify cargill for taxes and taxrelated losses imposed on cargill as a result of the splitoff andor debt exchange failing to qualify as taxfree if the taxes and related losses are attributable to arise out of or result from certain prohibited acts or to any breach of or inaccuracy in any representation warranty or covenant made by us in the tax agreement referred to above the taxes and taxrelated losses of cargill would be material if these transactions fail to qualify as taxfree and while we do not believe we engaged in any prohibited acts during the relevant period if our procedures for avoiding any of these prohibited acts or breaches were ineffective this indemnity would result in material liabilities from us to cargill that could have a material adverse effect on us for a further discussion of the restrictions and indemnities set forth in the agreements related to the cargill transaction please see note 17  to our notes to consolidated financial statements 

provisions in our restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws and of delaware law may prevent or delay an acquisition of our company which could decrease the trading price of our common stock 

our restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that could have the effect of rendering more difficult or discouraging an acquisition deemed undesirable by our board of directors these provisions include the ability of our board of directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval a prohibition on stockholder action by written consent and the inability of our stockholders to request that our board of directors or chairman of our board call a special meeting of stockholders 

we are also subject to section 203 of the delaware general corporation law in general section 203 prohibits a publicly held delaware corporation from engaging in a “business combination” with an “interested stockholder” for a period of three years from the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder unless the interested stockholder attained this status with the approval of the board of directors or unless the business combination was approved in a prescribed manner a “business combination” includes mergers asset sales and other transactions resulting in a financial benefit to the interested stockholder subject to exceptions an “interested stockholder” is a person who together with affiliates and associates owns or within three years owned 15 or more of the corporation’s voting stock this statute could prohibit or delay the accomplishment of mergers or other takeover or change in control attempts with respect to us and accordingly may discourage attempts to acquire us 

these provisions apply not only when they may protect our stockholders from coercive or otherwise unfair takeover tactics but even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders and could delay or prevent an acquisition that our board of directors determines is not in our best interests or those of our stockholders 

our success will continue to depend on our ability to attract and retain highly qualified and motivated employees 

we believe our continued success depends on the collective abilities and efforts of our employees like many businesses a significant number of our employees including some of our most highly skilled employees with specialized expertise in potash and phosphates operations will be approaching retirement age throughout the next decade and beyond in addition we compete for a talented workforce with other businesses particularly within the mining and chemicals industries in general and the crop nutrients industry in particular our expansion plans are highly dependent on our ability to attract retain and train highly qualified and motivated employees who are essential to the success of our ongoing operations as well as to our expansion plans if we were to be unsuccessful in attracting retaining and training the employees we require our ongoing operations and expansion plans could be materially and adversely affected 

future product or technological innovation could affect our business 

future product or technological innovation such as the development of seeds that require less crop nutrients the development of substitutes for our products or developments in the application of crop nutrients if they occur could have the potential to adversely affect the demand for our products and our results of operations liquidity and capital resources 

the success of our strategic initiatives depends on our ability to effectively manage these initiatives and to successfully integrate and grow acquired businesses 

we have significant ongoing strategic initiatives including principally our plans to expand the annual production capacity of our potash business and mwspc these strategic initiatives involve capital and other expenditures of several billions of dollars over a number of years and require effective project management and in the case of strategic acquisitions successful integration to the extent the processes we or for the mwspc we together with ma’aden and sabic put in place to manage these initiatives or integrate and grow acquired businesses are not effective our capital expenditure and other costs may exceed our expectations or the benefits we expect from these initiatives might not be fully realized 

we may fail to fully realize the anticipated benefits and cost savings of one of our longterm cf ammonia supply agreements 

we use ammonia as a raw material in the production of our concentrated phosphate products under our longterm cf ammonia supply agreement that will commence in 2017 we have agreed to purchase approximately 545000 to 725000 tonnes of ammonia per year during a term that may extend until december 31 2032 at a price to be determined by a formula based on the prevailing price of us natural gas 

the success of this agreement will depend in part on our ability to realize cost savings from the agreement’s natural gas based pricing if the price of natural gas rises materially or the market price for ammonia falls outside of the range we currently anticipate over the term of the agreement we may not realize the cost benefit we currently anticipate over that period or the cost of our ammonia under this agreement could be a competitive disadvantage in addition our ability to realize these anticipated benefits and cost savings is subject to certain additional risks including whether cf successfully performs its obligations under the agreement over the life of its commitment and our ability to take delivery of the required minimum annual amount of ammonia over the life of our commitment we discuss the risks associated with our obligations under this agreement in more detail earlier in this risk factors section 

cyber attacks could disrupt our operations and have a material adverse impact on our business 

as a global company we utilize and rely upon information technology systems in many aspects of our business including internal and external communications and the management of our accounting financial production and supply chain functions as we become more dependent on information technologies to conduct our operations and as the number and sophistication of cyber attacks increase the risks associated with cyber security increase these risks apply both to us and to third parties on whose systems we rely for the conduct of our business failure to effectively anticipate prevent detect and recover from the increasing number and sophistication of cyber attacks could result in theft loss or misuse of or damage or modification of our information and cause disruptions or delays in our business reputational damage and thirdparty claims which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition

 on september 20 2013 the louisiana district court issued a decision in this matter holding that while epa was required to respond directly to the petition and find that numeric nutrient criteria either were or were not necessary for the mississippi river watershed epa had the discretion to decide this issue based on nontechnical factors including cost policy considerations administrative complexity and other issues epa appealed this decision to the fifth circuit court of appeals the  court of appeals  in november 2013 the court of appeals issued a decision on april 7 2015 holding in substantial part that epa was not obligated to make a determination that numeric nutrient criteria are or are not necessary provided epa gives a reasonable explanation for its conclusion the court of appeals remanded the case to the louisiana district court to decide whether epa can meet that burden on november 20 2015 epa filed a motion with the louisiana district court seeking summary judgment and on january 14 2016 nonstate intervenors including mosaic filed a brief supporting epas motion 

we intend to defend vigorously epa’s decision in the event that epa were to establish numeric nutrient criteria for nitrogen and phosphorous in the mississippi river basin and the gulf of mexico we cannot predict what its requirements would be or the effects it would have on us or our customers

 cargill transaction and share repurchases 

cargill transaction 

in may 2011 cargill divested its interest in us in a splitoff the “ splitoff ” to its stockholders the “ exchanging cargill stockholders ” including the mac trusts and a debt exchange the “ debt exchange ” with certain cargill debt holders the “ exchanging cargill debt holders ” the agreements relating to the cargill transaction contemplated an orderly distribution of the approximately 64 2858 million of our shares that cargill formerly held following the splitoff and debt exchange the mac trusts and exchanging cargill debt holders sold an aggregate of 1570 million of these shares in underwritten public secondary offerings or to us these transactions completed the disposition of shares designated to be sold during the 15month period following the splitoff 

all other shares approximately 1288 million shares in the aggregate of our class a common stock “class a shares” received by the exchanging cargill stockholders in the splitoff have generally been subject to transfer restrictions unless we consent these transfer restrictions are removed as the class a shares convert to regular common stock the first such conversion under which all 429 million outstanding class a shares series a1 including 21647007 shares held by the mac trusts were converted into regular mosaic common stock par value 01 per share “ common stock ” occurred on november 26 2013 on november 26 2014 the remaining 17176068 class a shares series a2 held by exchanging cargill stockholders were converted into common stock conversion of the remaining 17176046 class a shares series a3 held by exchanging cargill stockholders is scheduled to occur on november 26 2015 

the agreements relating to the cargill transaction continued to restrict our ability to engage in share buybacks until november 26 2013 when the last of such restrictions expired 

on december 6 2013 mosaic entered into a share repurchase agreement with the mac trusts the “ mac trusts share repurchase agreement ” to purchase all of the remaining class a shares held by the mac trusts through a series of eight purchases occurring from january 8 2014 through july 30 2014 during 2014 pursuant to the mac trusts share repurchase agreement all 21647007 class a shares series a3 held by the mac trusts and 21647008 class a shares series a2 were repurchased for an aggregate of approximately 20 billion   

under the mac trusts share repurchase agreement the purchase price per share was equal to the common market price as defined in mosaic’s restated certificate of incorporation as of the date of the purchase in general and subject to the terms and 

provisions of the restated certificate of incorporation the common market price as of any date is equal to the average of the volume weighted average trading price of common stock for each trading day during the preceding 20day trading period 

other share repurchases 

in february of 2014 our board of directors authorized a 1 billion share repurchase program the “ repurchase program ” allowing the company to repurchase class a shares or shares of our common stock  through direct buybacks or in open market transactions this authorization is in addition to the mac trusts share repurchase agreement described above during 2014 under the repurchase program 8193698 class a shares were repurchased under agreements we entered into with certain cargill family member trusts the “ family trusts share repurchase agreements ” and together with the mac trusts share repurchase agreement the  share repurchase agreements  and 7585085 shares of common stock were repurchased on the open market for an aggregate of 7273 million 

the share repurchase agreements were accounted for as forward contracts with an initial liability established at fair value based on the average of the weighted average trading price for each of the preceding 20day trading days and a corresponding reduction of equity the contracts were subsequently remeasured at the present value of the amount to be paid at settlement with the difference being recognized in the consolidated statement of earnings in calculating basic and diluted earnings per share  eps  we were required to exclude the class a shares that remained to be repurchased any amounts including contractual accumulated dividends and participation rights in undistributed earnings attributable to shares that remained to be repurchased that had not yet been recognized in the consolidated statement of earnings were deducted in computing income available to common shareholders consistent with the twoclass method see the calculation of eps in note 7  of our consolidated financial statements   

we have included additional information about the cargill transaction and other share repurchases in note 2  of our consolidated financial statements and in response to item 13 of part iii of this report which information is incorporated herein by reference and the principal transaction documents related to the cargill transaction are incorporated by reference as exhibits to this report 

other business developments during 2014 

during calendar year 2014  we took the following steps toward achieving our strategic priorities   

 3 

replace a substantial amount of planned internal investments in that country we acquired four blending and warehousing facilities in brazil one in paraguay and additional warehousing and logistics service capabilities we expect this acquisition to increase our annual distribution in the region from approximately four million metric tonnes to about six million metric tonnes of crop nutrients 

 we have included additional information about these and other developments in our business during 2014 in our management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations “ management’s analysis ” and in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 

business segment information 

the discussion below of our business segment operations should be read in conjunction with the following information that we have included in this report   

 phosphates segment 

our phosphates business segment owns and operates mines and production facilities in florida which produce concentrated phosphate crop nutrients and phosphatebased animal feed ingredients and processing plants in louisiana which produce concentrated phosphate crop nutrients our phosphates segment’s results also include our international distribution activities 

on march 17 2014 mosaic completed the cf phosphate assets acquisition which included the 25000acre south pasture phosphate mine and beneficiation plant in hardee county florida a phosphate manufacturing facility in plant city florida and ammonia terminal and finished product warehouse facilities in tampa 

on december 17 2014 we completed the acquisition of adms fertilizer distribution business and working capital in brazil and paraguay as discussed above 

us phosphate crop nutrients and animal feed ingredients 

our us phosphates operations have capacity to produce approximately 52 million tonnes of phosphoric acid “ p 2 o 5  ” per year or about 9 of world annual capacity and about 56 of north american annual capacity phosphoric acid is produced by reacting finely ground phosphate rock with sulfuric acid phosphoric acid is the key building block for the production of high 

analysis or concentrated phosphate crop nutrients and animal feed products and is the most comprehensive measure of phosphate capacity and production and a commonly used benchmark in our industry our us phosphoric acid production totaled approximately 44 million  tonnes during 2014  we account for approximately 11 of estimated global annual production and 54 of estimated north american annual output 

our phosphate crop nutrient products are marketed worldwide to crop nutrient manufacturers distributors retailers and farmers our principal phosphate crop nutrient products are   

 production of our animal feed ingredients products is located at our new wales florida facility we market our feed phosphate primarily under the leading brand names of biofos ®  and nexfos ®  

our primary phosphate crop nutrient production facilities are located in central florida and louisiana the following map shows the locations of each of our phosphate concentrates plants in the united states and the locations of each of our active and planned phosphate mines in florida 

  

annual capacity by plant as of december 31 2014  and production volumes by plant for 2014  are listed below   



 

 the phosphoric acid produced at uncle sam is shipped to faustina where it is used to produce dap map and microessentials ®  our faustina plant also manufactures ammonia that is mostly consumed in our concentrate plants 

we produced approximately 87 million tonnes of concentrated phosphate crop nutrients during 2014  and accounted for approximately 14 of estimated world annual output and 71 of estimated north american annual production 

phosphate rock 

phosphate rock is the key mineral used to produce phosphate crop nutrients and feed phosphate our phosphate rock production totaled approximately 140 million  tonnes in 2014  and accounted for approximately 7 of estimated world annual production and 53 of estimated north american annual production we are the world’s second largest miner of phosphate rock and currently operate four mines with a combined annual capacity of approximately 172 million  tonnes production of one tonne of dap requires between 16 and 17 tonnes of phosphate rock 

all of our wholly owned phosphate mines and related mining operations are located in central florida during 2014  we operated five active mines four corners south fort meade hookers prairie wingate and south pasture which was acquired in march of 2014 the hookers prairie mines reserves were exhausted in june of 2014 we plan to develop reserves at ona and at desoto to replace reserves that will be depleted at various times during the next decade 

the phosphate deposits of florida are of sedimentary origin and are part of a phosphatebearing province that extends from southern florida north along the atlantic coast into southern virginia our active phosphate mines are primarily located in what is known as the bone valley member of the peace river formation in the central florida phosphate district the southern portions of the four corners and wingate mines are in what is referred to as the undifferentiated peace river formation in which our future ona and desoto reserves are also located phosphate mining has been conducted in the central florida phosphate district since the late 1800’s the potentially mineable portion of the district encompasses an area approximately 80 miles in length in a northsouth direction and approximately 40 miles in width 

we extract phosphate ore using large surface mining machines that we own called “draglines” prior to extracting the ore the draglines must first remove a 10 to 50 foot layer of sandy overburden at our wingate mine we also utilize dredges to remove the overburden and mine the ore we then process the ore at beneficiation plants that we own at each active mine where the ore 

goes through washing screening sizing and flotation processes designed to separate the phosphate rock from sands clays and other foreign materials   prior to commencing operations at any of our planned future mines we would need to acquire new draglines or move existing draglines to the mines and unless the beneficiation plant at an existing mine were used construct a beneficiation plant 

the following table shows for each of our phosphate mines annual capacity as of december 31 2014  and rock production volume and grade for calendar years 2014  and 2013  the stub period and fiscal 2013 

  



 

 reserves 

we estimate our phosphate rock reserves based upon exploration core drilling as well as technical and economic analyses to determine that reserves can be economically mined proven measured reserves are those resources of sufficient concentration to meet minimum physical chemical and economic criteria related to our current product standards and mining and production practices our estimates of probable indicated reserves are based on information similar to that used for proven reserves but sites for drilling are farther apart or are otherwise less adequately spaced than for proven reserves although the degree of assurance is high enough to assume continuity between such sites proven reserves are determined using a minimum drill hole spacing of two sites per 40 acre block probable reserves have less than two drill holes per 40 acre block but geological data provides a high degree of assurance that continuity exists between sites 

the following table sets forth our proven and probable phosphate reserves as of december 31 2014  



 

 we generally own the reserves shown for active mines in the table above with the only significant exceptions being further described below   

 in light of the longterm nature of our rights to our reserves we expect to be able to mine all reported reserves that are not currently owned prior to termination or expiration of our rights additional information regarding permitting is included in part i item 1a “risk factors” and under “environmental health safety and security matters—operating requirements and impacts—permitting” in our management’s analysis 

investments in joint ventures 

we have a 35 economic interest in a joint venture which owns the miski mayo phosphate rock mine in the bayovar region of peru our investment in the miski mayo mine and related commercial offtake supply agreement to purchase a share of the phosphate rock from the miski mayo mine reduces our need to purchase phosphate rock from other suppliers the miski mayo mine’s annual production capacity is 38 million tonnes 

we own a 25 interest in the wa’ad al shamal joint venture and in connection with our equity share we will market approximately 25 of the production of the joint venture the wa’ad al shamal joint venture is developing a mine and two chemical complexes that are presently expected to produce phosphate fertilizers animal feed food grade purified phosphoric acid and other downstream phosphates products in the kingdom of saudi arabia we currently estimate that the cost to develop and construct the integrated phosphate production facilities the  project  will approximate 75 billion which we expect to be funded primarily through investments by us maaden and sabic and through borrowing arrangements and other external project financing facilities  funding facilities  we currently estimate that our cash investment in the project including the amount we have invested to date will approximate 850 million our cash investment in the project through december 31 2014 was 3285 million the greenfield project is being built in the northern region of saudi arabia at wa’ad al shamal minerals industrial city and include further expansion of processing plants in ras al khair minerals industrial city which is located on the east coast of saudi arabia the facilities are expected to have a production capacity of approximately 35 million tonnes of finished product per year the project is expected to benefit from the availability of key raw nutrients from sources within saudi arabia operations are expected to commence in late 2016 

on june 30 2014 the wa’ad al shamal joint venture entered into funding facilities with a consortium of 20 financial institutions for a total amount of approximately 50 billion the terms of the funding facilities are further discussed in note 9  of our consolidated financial statements 

purchased phosphate rock 

we also purchase phosphate rock the level of our purchases of phosphate rock in the future will depend upon among other factors our phosphate rock mining plans the status of our permits our need for additional phosphate rock to allow us to operate our concentrates plants at or near full capacity the quality and level of impurities in the phosphate rock that we mine and our development or acquisition of additional phosphate rock deposits and mines depending on product mix and tonnage requirements our need for purchased phosphate rock could increase in the future in order to meet product specifications 

sulfur 

we use molten sulfur at our phosphates concentrates plants to produce sulfuric acid primarily for use in our production of phosphoric acid we purchased approximately 40 million long tons of sulfur during 2014  which includes 9 months of purchases related to production at the plant city facility acquired from cf we purchase most of this sulfur from north american oil and natural gas refiners who are required to remove or recover sulfur during the refining process production of one tonne of dap requires approximately 040 long tons of sulfur we procure our sulfur from multiple sources and receive it by truck rail barge and vessel either direct to our phosphate plants or have it sent for gathering to terminals that are located on the us gulf coast 

we own and operate sulfur terminals in houston texas and riverview florida we also lease terminal space in tampa florida and galveston and beaumont texas we own two oceangoing barges and contract for operation of another oceangoing vessel that transport molten sulfur from the texas terminals to tampa and then onward by truck to our florida phosphate plants in addition we own a 50 equity interest in gulf sulphur services ltd lllp “ gulf sulphur services ” which is operated by our joint venture partner gulf sulphur services has a large sulfur transportation and terminaling business in the gulf of mexico and handles these functions for a substantial portion of our florida sulfur volume gulf sulphur services’ capabilities include melting solid sulfur into the molten form that we use which permits us to access sources of solid as well as molten sulfur we further round out our sulfur logistic assets with a large fleet of leased railcars that supplement our marine sulfur logistic system our louisiana operations are served by truck and barge from nearby refineries additionally to further enhance our access to sulfur a project to construct a sulfur melter at our new wales facility is scheduled to be completed in late 2015 it is planned to have the capability to melt approximately one million long tons of sulfur annually allowing us to leverage economic benefits within the global sulfur marketplace 

although sulfur is readily available from many different suppliers and can be transported to our phosphate facilities by a variety of means sulfur is an important raw material used in our business that has in the past been and may in the future be the subject of volatile pricing and availability alternative transportation and terminaling facilities might not have sufficient capacity to fully serve all of our facilities in the event of a disruption to current transportation or terminaling facilities changes 

in the price of sulfur or disruptions to sulfur transportation or terminaling facilities could have a material impact on our business we have included a discussion of sulfur prices in our management’s analysis 

ammonia 

we use ammonia together with phosphoric acid to produce dap map and microessentials ®  we consumed approximately 15 million tonnes of ammonia during 2014  this includes approximately 9 months of ammonia consumption at the plant city facility we acquired as part of the cf phosphate assets acquisition production of one tonne of dap requires approximately 023 tonnes of ammonia 

our florida ammonia needs are supplied by offshore producers under multiyear contracts ammonia for our new wales and riverview plants is terminaled through an owned ammonia facility at port sutton florida ammonia for our bartow plant is terminaled through another ammonia facility owned and operated by a third party at port sutton florida pursuant to an agreement that expires in 2015 ammonia is transported by pipeline from the terminals to our production facilities we have service agreements with the operators of the pipelines for bartow new wales and riverview which provide service through june 30 2017 the service agreements may be extended in one year increments unless either party objects ammonia for our plant city facility is terminaled through a facility that was acquired as part of the cf phosphate assets acquisition this ammonia is transported by rail via leased railcars the leases for rail cars expire in 2017 2018 and 2019 our rail service contract expired on december 31 2014 and is currently being renegotiated we are operating under the terms of that agreement 

we produce ammonia at faustina louisiana primarily for our own consumption our annual capacity is approximately 500000 tonnes from time to time we sell surplus ammonia to unrelated parties 

on october 28 2013 at the same time we signed the agreement relating to the cf phosphate assets acquisition we entered into a strategic supply agreement with cf for approximately 545000 to 725000 tonnes of ammonia annually the  cf ammonia supply agreement  for a term of up to fifteen years we expect that this agreement will commence prior to january 1 2017 under a second agreement we will purchase from cf approximately 270000 tonnes annually for three years at cfr tampa market based pricing in light of these supply arrangements we decided to forego our proposed ammonia manufacturing plant at our faustina louisiana facility but we are reviewing debottlenecking our current faustina ammonia facility 

although ammonia is readily available from many different suppliers and can be transported to our phosphates facilities by a variety of means ammonia is an important raw material used in our business that has in the past been and may in the future be the subject of volatile pricing and alternative transportation and terminaling facilities might not have sufficient capacity to fully serve all of our facilities in the event of a disruption to existing transportation or terminaling facilities changes in the price of ammonia or disruptions to ammonia transportation or terminaling could have a material impact on our business we have included a discussion of ammonia prices in our management’s analysis 

natural gas 

natural gas is the primary raw material used to manufacture ammonia at our faustina facility ammonia is manufactured on site the majority of natural gas is purchased through firm delivery contracts based on published indexbased prices and is sourced from texas and louisiana via pipelines interconnected to the henry hub we use overthecounter swap andor option contracts to forward price portions of future gas purchases the portions of gas purchases not forward priced are purchased at the index based prices or at domestic spot market prices under shortterm contracts on average we purchase approximately 18 million mmbtu of natural gas per year for use in ammonia production at faustina 

because our ammonia requirements for our florida operations are purchased rather than manufactured on site we purchase on average approximately two million mmbtu of natural gas per year in florida only as a thermal fuel for various production processes 

florida land holdings 

we are a significant landowner in the state of florida which in the future is expected to return to its historical status as one of the fastest areas of population growth in the united states we own land comprising approximately 287000 acres held in fee simple title in central florida and have the right to mine additional properties which contain phosphate rock reserves some of our land holdings are needed to operate our phosphates business while a portion of our land assets such as reclaimed properties are no longer required for our ongoing operations as a general matter more of our reclaimed property becomes available for uses other than for phosphate operations each year our real property assets are generally comprised of concentrates plants port facilities phosphate mines and other property which we have acquired through our presence in florida we are currently taking initial steps as part of a longterm future land use strategy to optimize the value of our land 

assets for example we developed streamsong ®  a destination resort and conference center in an area of previously mined land as part of our longterm business strategy to maximize the value and utility of our extensive land holdings in florida in addition to the two golf courses and clubhouse that were opened in december 2012 the resort and conference center opened in january 2014 

international production 

we have an approximate 62 interest in a joint venture in paranagua brazil which includes a plant that produces up to 500000   tonnes  per year of single superphosphate “ ssp ” and granulated ssp crop nutrients by mixing sulfuric acid with purchased phosphate rock 

potash segment 

we are one of the leading potash producers in the world we mine and process potash in canada and the united states and sell potash in north america and internationally the term “potash” applies generally to the common salts of potassium muriate of potash “ mop ” is the primary source of potassium for the crop nutrient industry red mop has traces of iron oxide the granular and standard grade red mop products are well suited for direct fertilizer application and bulk blending white mop has a higher percent potassium oxide “ k 2 o ” white mop besides being well suited for the agricultural market is used in many industrial applications 

our potash products are marketed worldwide to crop nutrient manufacturers distributors and retailers and are also used in the manufacture of mixed crop nutrients and to a lesser extent in animal feed ingredients we also sell potash to customers for industrial use in addition our potash products are used for deicing and as a water softener regenerant 

in 2014  we operated three potash mines in canada including two shaft mines with a total of three production shafts and one solution mine as well as two potash mines in the united states including one shaft mine and one solution mine we sold the salt operations at our former hersey michigan mine and closed the related potash operations the sale of the salt operations was completed on july 29 2014 

we also own related refineries at each of the mines 

the expansion in our colonsay mine was completed and added an additional 06 million tonnes of operational capacity we continue the expansion of capacity in our potash segment with the k3 shafts at our esterhazy mine which are on track to start producing ore in 2017 and will add an estimated 09 million tonnes to our potash operational capacity in december 2014 our board approved approximately 15 billion in capital expenditures over the next ten years to increase the mining capacity of the k3 shafts and provide for an infrastructure to move rock from k3 to the k1 and k2 mills this would provide us the flexibility to optimize production at k1 k2 and k3 in order to mitigate risk from current and future brine inflows 

it is possible that the costs of remedial efforts at esterhazy may further increase in the future and that such an increase could be material or in the extreme scenario that the brine inflows risk to employees or remediation costs may increase to a level which would cause us to change our mining processes or abandon the mines see “key factors that can affect results of operations and financial condition” and “potash net sales and gross margin” in our management’s analysis and “our esterhazy mine has had an inflow of salt saturated brine for more than 25 years” in part i item 1a “risk factors” in this report which are incorporated herein by reference for a discussion of costs risks and other information relating to the brine inflows 

the map below shows the location of each of our potash mines 

  

our current potash annualized operational capacity totals 105 million  tonnes of product per year and accounts for approximately 13 of world annual capacity and 47 of north american annual capacity production during 2014  totaled 82 million  tonnes we account for approximately 14 of estimated world annual production and 44 of estimated north american annual production 

the following table shows for each of our potash mines annual capacity as of december 31 2014  and volume of mined ore average grade and finished product output for calendar years 2014 and 2013 the stub period and fiscal 2013

our esterhazy mine for purposes of calculating our relative share of annual sales of potash to international customers by canpotex in connection with expiration of the tolling agreement 

canadian mines 

we operate three canadian potash facilities all located in the southern half of the province of saskatchewan including our solution mine at belle plaine two interconnected mine shafts at our esterhazy shaft mine and our shaft mine at colonsay 

extensive potash deposits are found in the southern half of the province of saskatchewan the potash ore is contained in a predominantly rock salt formation known as the prairie evaporites the prairie evaporites deposits are bounded by limestone formations and contain the potash beds three potash deposits of economic importance occur in saskatchewan the esterhazy belle plaine and patience lake members the patience lake member is mined at colonsay and the esterhazy member at esterhazy at belle plaine all three members are mined each of the major potash members contains several potash beds of different thicknesses and grades the particular beds mined at colonsay and esterhazy have a mining height of 11 and 8 feet respectively at belle plaine several beds of different thicknesses are mined 

our potash mines in canada produce mop exclusively esterhazy and colonsay utilize shaft mining while belle plaine utilizes solution mining technology traditional potash shaft mining takes place underground at depths of over 1000 meters where continuous mining machines cut out the ore face and load it onto conveyor belts the ore is then crushed moved to storage bins and hoisted to refineries above ground in contrast our solution mining process involves heated brine which is pumped through a “cluster” to dissolve the potash in the ore beds at a depth of approximately 1500 meters a cluster consists of a series of boreholes drilled into the potash ore a separate distribution center at each cluster controls the brine flow the solution containing dissolved potash and salt is pumped to a refinery where sodium chloride a coproduct of this process is separated from the potash through the use of evaporation and crystallization techniques concurrently the solution is pumped into a cooling pond where additional crystallization occurs and the resulting product is recovered via a floating dredge refined potash is dewatered dried and sized our canadian operations produce 12 different mop products including industrial grades many through proprietary processes 

our potash mineral rights in the province of saskatchewan consist of the following 



we believe that our mineral rights in saskatchewan are sufficient to support current operations for more than a century leases are generally renewable at our option for successive terms generally 21 years each except that certain of the acres shown above as “leased from others” are leased under longterm leases with terms including renewals at our option that expire from 2031 to 2162 

we pay canadian resource taxes consisting of the potash production tax and resource surcharge the potash production tax is a saskatchewan provincial tax on potash production and consists of a base payment and a profits tax we also pay a percentage of the value of resource sales from our saskatchewan mines in addition to the canadian resource taxes royalties are payable to the mineral owners in respect of potash reserves or production of potash we have included a further discussion of the canadian resource taxes and royalties in our management’s analysis 

since december 1985 we have effectively managed an inflow of salt saturated brine into our esterhazy mine at various times since then we have experienced changing amounts and patterns of brine inflows at esterhazy to date the brine inflow including our remediation efforts to control it have not had a material impact on our production processes or volumes the volume of the net brine inflow the rate of inflow less the amount we are pumping out of the mine or net outflow when we are pumping more brine out of the mine than the rate of inflow fluctuates and is dependent on a number of variables such as the location of the source of the inflow the magnitude of the inflow available pumping surface and underground brine storage capacities underground injection well capacities and the effectiveness of calcium chloride and cementatious grout used to reduce or prevent the inflows among other factors as a result of these brine inflows we incur expenditures certain of which have been capitalized and others that have been charged to expense in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 

it is possible that the costs of remedial efforts at esterhazy may further increase in the future and that such an increase could be material or in the extreme scenario that the brine inflows risk to employees or remediation costs may increase to a level which would cause us to change our mining processes or abandon the mine see “key factors that can affect results of operations and financial condition” and “potash net sales and gross margin” in our management’s analysis and “our esterhazy mine has had an inflow of salt saturated brine for more than 25 years” in part i item 1a “risk factors” in this report which are incorporated herein by reference for a discussion of costs risks and other information relating to the brine inflows we have begun construction of the new shafts at our esterhazy mine as part of our potash expansion plan which is also designed to mitigate risk from current and future inflows 

due to the ongoing brine inflow at esterhazy subject to exceptions that are limited in scope and amount we are unable to obtain coverage for underground operations for water incursion problems like other potash producers’ shaft mines our colonsay saskatchewan and carlsbad new mexico mines are also subject to the risks of inflow of water as a result of their shaft mining operations but water inflow risks at these mines are included in our insurance coverage subject to deductibles limited coverage terms and lower sublimits negotiated with our insurers 

united states mines 

in the united states we have a shaft mine located in carlsbad new mexico in 2013 we decided to sell the salt operations of our hersey mine and close the related potash operations the sale of the salt operations was completed on july 29 2014 

the ore reserves at our carlsbad mine are made up of langbeinite a double sulfate of potassium and magnesium this type of potash reserve occurs in a predominantly rock salt formation known as the salado formation the mcnutt member of this formation consists of eleven units of economic importance of which we currently mine one the mcnutt member’s evaporite deposits are interlayered with anhydrite polyhalite potassium salts clay and minor amounts of sandstone and siltstone 

continuous underground mining methods are utilized to extract the ore drum type mining machines are used to cut the langbeinite ore from the face mined ore is then loaded onto conveyors transported to storage areas and then hoisted to the surface for further processing at our refinery 

during 2014 two types of potash were produced at the carlsbad refinery mop is the primary source of potassium for the crop nutrient industry double sulfate of potash magnesia is the second type of potash which we market under our brand name kmag ®  and contains sulfur potassium and magnesium with low levels of chloride in july of 2014 we decided to permanently discontinue production of mop at carlsbad and effective january 1 2015 we only produce kmag ® at that facility 

at the carlsbad facility we mine and refine potash from 77103 acres of mineral rights we control these reserves pursuant to either i leases from the us government that in general continue in effect at our option subject to readjustment by the us government every 20 years or ii leases from the state of new mexico that continue as long as we continue to produce from them these reserves contain an estimated total of 110 million tonnes of potash mineralization calculated after estimated extraction losses in one mining bed evaluated at thicknesses ranging from 55 feet to in excess of 11 feet at average refinery rates these ore reserves are estimated to be sufficient to yield 22 million tonnes of langbeinite concentrates with an average grade of approximately 22 k 2 o at projected rates of production we estimate that carlsbad’s reserves of langbeinite are sufficient to support operations for approximately 22 years 

royalties for the us operations amounted to approximately 110 million in 2014  these royalties are established by the us department of the interior bureau of land management in the case of the carlsbad leases from the us government and pursuant to provisions set forth in the leases in the case of the carlsbad state leases 

reserves 

our estimates below of our potash reserves and nonreserve potash mineralization are based on exploration drill hole data seismic data and actual mining results over more than 35 years proven reserves are estimated by identifying material in place that is delineated on at least two sides and material in place within a halfmile radius or distance from an existing sampled mine entry or exploration core hole probable reserves are estimated by identifying material in place within a one mile radius from an existing sampled mine entry or exploration core hole historical extraction ratios from the many years of mining results are then applied to both types of material to estimate the proven and probable reserves we believe that all reserves and nonreserve potash mineralization reported below are potentially recoverable using existing production shaft and refinery locations 

our estimated recoverable potash ore reserves and nonreserve potash mineralization as of december 31 2014  for each of our mines are as follows 



 

 as discussed more fully above we either own the reserves and mineralization shown above or lease them pursuant to mineral leases that generally remain in effect or are renewable at our option or are longterm leases accordingly we expect to be able to mine all reported reserves that are leased prior to termination or expiration of the existing leases 

natural gas 

natural gas is used at our belle plaine solution mine as a fuel to produce steam and to dry potash products the steam is used to generate electricity in evaporation and crystallization processes and to provide thermal heat to the solution mining process the belle plaine solution mine typically accounts for approximately 74 of our potash segment’s total natural gas requirements for potash production at our shaft mines natural gas is used as a fuel to heat fresh air supplied to the shaft mines and for drying potash products combined natural gas usage for both the solution and shaft mines approximated 17 million mmbtu during 2014  we purchase our natural gas requirements on firm delivery index pricebased physical contracts and on short term spotpriced physical contracts our canadian operations purchase all of their physical gas in saskatchewan via the transgas pipeline system using aeco price indices as pricing references the us potash operation in new mexico purchases physical gas in the southwest respective regional market using the transwestern el paso permian basin market pricing reference we use financial derivative contracts to manage the price of portions of our future purchases 

sales and distribution activities 

united states and canada 

we have a united states and canada sales and marketing team that serves our business segments we sell to wholesale distributors retail chains cooperatives independent retailers and national accounts 

customer service and the ability to effectively minimize the overall supply chain costs are key competitive factors in the crop nutrient and animal feed ingredients businesses in addition to our production facilities to service the needs of our customers we own lease or have contractual throughput or other arrangements at strategically located distribution warehouses along or near the mississippi and ohio rivers as well as in other key agricultural regions of the united states and canada from these facilities we market mosaic produced phosphate and potash products for customers who in turn resell the product into the distribution channel or directly to farmers in the united states and canada 

we own port facilities in tampa florida and houston texas which have deep water berth capabilities providing access to the gulf of mexico we also own warehouse distribution facilities in savage minnesota pekin illinois and henderson kentucky 

in addition to the geographically situated facilities that we own our us distribution operations also include leased distribution space or contractual throughput agreements in other key geographical areas such as california florida illinois indiana iowa kentucky louisiana minnesota nebraska north dakota ohio oklahoma texas and wisconsin 

our canadian customers include independent dealers and national accounts we also lease and own warehouse facilities in saskatchewan ontario quebec and manitoba in canada 

international 

outside of the united states and canada we market our phosphates segments products through our own international distribution activities as well as a salesforce focused on geographies outside of north america 

our sales outside of the united states and canada of saskatchewan potash products are made through canpotex canpotex sales are allocated among its members based on peaking capacity we have been notified by canpotex that effective january 1 2015 our entitlement increased from approximately 388 to 406 as a result of a proving run successfully completed at our colonsay mine our potash exports from carlsbad are sold through our own sales force we also market our potash segment’s products through our phosphates segment international distribution activities which acquire potash primarily through canpotex the countries that account for the largest amount of international potash sales by volume are brazil china indonesia india and malaysia 

our international distribution operations also purchase phosphates potash and nitrogen products from unrelated third parties which we either use to produce blended crop nutrients “ blends ” or for resale 

to service the needs of our customers our international distribution activities include a network of strategically located sales offices crop nutrient blending and bagging facilities port terminals and warehouse distribution facilities that we own and operate in key geographic areas throughout several countries the blending and bagging facilities primarily produce blends from phosphate potash and nitrogen the average product mix in our blends by volume contains approximately 50 phosphate 25 potash and 25 nitrogen although this mix differs based on seasonal and other factors our international operations serve primarily as a sales outlet for our north american phosphates production both for resale and as an input for blends our potash segment also has historically furnished the majority of the raw materials needs for the production of blends primarily via canpotex and is expected to continue to do so in the future 

on december 17 2014 we completed the acquisition of adms fertilizer distribution business in brazil and paraguay the acquisition is expected to increase our distribution capacity in the region from approximately four million tonnes per year to six million tonnes we also negotiated the terms of fiveyear fertilizer supply agreements whereby we supply adms fertilizer needs in brazil and paraguay 

we completed the sale of our argentina assets and plan to close the chile business and sell the fixed assets related to chiles distribution business which we do not expect to significantly affect our sales in latin america as we plan to continue to sell crop nutrients through other distributors in these regions 

the following maps show the locations of our primary distribution operations in south america and asia 

     

  

other products 

with a strong brand position in a multibillion dollar animal feed ingredients global market our phosphates segment supplies animal feed ingredients for poultry and livestock to customers in north america latin america and asia our potash sales to nonagricultural users are primarily to large industrial accounts and the animal feed industry additionally we sell potash for deicing and as a water softener regenerant as well as fluorosilicic acid for water fluoridation 

competition 

because crop nutrients are global commodities available from numerous sources crop nutrition companies compete primarily on the basis of delivered price other competitive factors include product quality cost and availability of raw materials customer service plant efficiency and availability of product as a result markets for our products are highly competitive we compete with a broad range of domestic and international producers including farmer cooperatives subsidiaries of larger companies and independent crop nutrient companies foreign competitors often have access to cheaper raw materials are required to comply with less stringent regulatory requirements or are owned or subsidized by governments and as a result may have cost advantages over north american companies we believe that our extensive north american and international production and distribution system provides us with a competitive advantage by allowing us to achieve economies of scale transportation and storage efficiencies and obtain market intelligence also we believe our premium products provide us a competitive advantage with customers in north and south america our sales of microessentials ®  have increased steadily over the past few years reaching 15 million tonnes in north america during 2014 

unlike many of our competitors we have our own distribution system to sell phosphate and potashbased crop nutrients and animal feed ingredients whether produced by us or by other third parties around the globe in north america we have one of the largest and most strategically located distribution systems for crop nutrients including warehouse facilities in key agricultural regions we also have an extensive network of distribution facilities internationally including in the key growth regions of south america and asia with port terminals warehouses and blending plants in brazil paraguay china and india our global presence allows us to efficiently serve customers in approximately 40 countries 

phosphates segment 

our phosphates segment operates in a highly competitive global market among the competitors in the global phosphate industry are domestic and foreign companies as well as foreign governmentsupported producers in asia and north africa phosphate producers compete primarily based on price and to a lesser extent product quality service and innovation similar to how we compete with our microessentials ®  product major integrated producers of feed phosphates are located in the united states europe and china many smaller producers are located in emerging markets around the world many of these smaller producers are not miners of phosphate rock or manufacturers of phosphoric acid and are required to purchase this material on the open market 

we believe that we are a low cost integrated producer of phosphatebased crop nutrients due in part to our scale vertical integration and strategic network of production and distribution facilities as the world’s largest producer of concentrated phosphates as well as the second largest miner of phosphate rock in the world and the largest in the united states we maintain an advantage over some competitors as the scale of operations effectively reduces production costs per unit we are also vertically integrated to captively supply one of our key inputs phosphate rock to our phosphate production facilities we believe that our position as an integrated producer of phosphate rock provides us with a significant cost advantage over competitors that are nonintegrated phosphate producers our investment in the miski mayo mine and related commercial offtake supply agreement to purchase a share of the phosphate rock also allows us to reduce our purchases of phosphate rock from other suppliers in addition we expect that the wa’ad al shamal joint venture will enable us to not only further diversify our sources of phosphates but also improve our access to key agricultural countries in asia and the middle east 

we produce ammonia at our faustina louisiana concentrates plant in quantities sufficient to meet approximately one quarter of our total ammonia needs with no captive ammonia production in florida we are subject to significant volatility in our purchase price of ammonia from world markets one of the cf ammonia supply agreements is expected to provide us with a long term supply of a substantial volume of ammonia at prices based on the price of natural gas and is intended to lessen this volatility with our own sulfur transportation barges and our 50 ownership interest in gulf sulphur services we are also wellpositioned to source an adequate flexible and costeffective supply of sulfur our third key input we believe that our investments in sulfur transportation assets continue to afford us a competitive advantage compared to other producers in cost and access to sulfur 

with facilities in both central florida and louisiana we are logistically well positioned to fulfill our needs at very competitive prices those multiple production points also afford us the flexibility to optimally balance supply and demand 

we have a strong brand in the countries in which we have international distribution activities in addition to having access to our own production our international distribution activities have the capability to supply a wide variety of crop nutrients to our dealerfarmer customer base our strategic positions in brazil paraguay china and india allow us to capitalize on the growth in nutrient demand in these large and growing international regions 

potash segment 

potash is a commodity available from several geographical regions around the world and consequently the market is highly competitive through our participation in canpotex we compete outside of north america against various independent and stateowned potash producers canpotex has substantial expertise and logistical resources for the international distribution of potash including strategically located export assets in portland oregon and vancouver british columbia our principal methods of competition with respect to the sale of potash include product pricing and offering consistent highquality products and superior service we believe that our potash cost structure is competitive in the industry and should improve as we achieve the expected increases in production from our potash expansion projects 

factors affecting demand 

our results of operations historically have reflected the effects of several external factors which are beyond our control and have in the past produced significant downward and upward swings in operating results revenues are highly dependent upon conditions in the agriculture industry and can be affected by among other factors crop conditions changes in agricultural production practices worldwide economic conditions including the increasing world population household incomes and demand for more protein rich food particularly in developing regions such as china india and latin america changing demand for biofuels variability in commodity pricing governmental policies the level of inventories in the crop nutrient distribution channels customer expectations about farmer economics future crop nutrient prices and availability and transportation costs among other matters market trends in raw material costs market prices for crop nutrients and weather furthermore our crop nutrients business is seasonal to the extent farmers and agricultural enterprises in the markets in which we compete purchase more crop nutrient products during the spring and fall the international scope of our business spanning the northern and southern hemispheres reduces to some extent the seasonal impact on our business the degree of seasonality of our business can change significantly from year to year due to conditions in the agricultural industry and other factors the seasonal nature of our businesses requires significant working capital for inventory in advance of the planting seasons 

we sell products throughout the world unfavorable changes in trade protection laws policies and measures government policies and other regulatory requirements affecting trade unexpected changes in tax and trade treaties strengthening or weakening of foreign economies as well as political relations with the united states may cause sales trends to customers in one or more foreign countries to differ from sales trends in the united states 

our international operations are subject to risks from changes in foreign currencies or government policy which can affect local farmer economics 

other matters 

employees 

we had approximately 9100 employees as of december 31 2014  consisting of approximately 3800 salaried and 5300 hourly employees 

labor relations 

as of december 31 2014    

 19 

failure to renew any of our union agreements could result in a strike or labor stoppage that could have a material adverse effect on our operations however we have not experienced significant work stoppage in many years and historically have had good labor relations

 item 1a risk factors 

our business financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of the risks and uncertainties described below 

our esterhazy mine has had an inflow of salt saturated brine for more than 25 years 

since december 1985 we have had inflows of salt saturated brine into our esterhazy saskatchewan mine over the past century several potash mines experiencing water inflow problems have flooded in order to control brine inflows at esterhazy we have incurred and will continue to incur expenditures certain of which due to their nature have been capitalized while others have been charged to expense 

at various times we experience changing amounts and patterns of brine inflows at the esterhazy mine periodically some of these inflows have exceeded available pumping capacity if that were to continue for several months without abatement it could exceed our available storage capacity and ability to effectively manage the brine inflow this could adversely affect production at the esterhazy mine see “key factors that can affect results of operations and financial condition” and “potash net sales and gross margin” in our management’s analysis for a discussion of costs and other information relating to the brine inflows the brine inflow is variable resulting in both net inflows the rate of inflow is more than the amount we are pumping out of the mine and net outflows when we are pumping more brine out of the mine than the rate of inflow there can be no assurance that   

 from time to time new or improved technology becomes available to facilitate our remediation of the inflows such as horizontal drilling techniques taking advantage of these new or improved technologies may require significant capital expenditures andor may increase our costs of remediation 

it is possible that the costs of remedial efforts at esterhazy may further increase in the future and that such an increase could be material or in the extreme scenario that the brine inflows risk to employees or remediation costs may increase to a level which would cause us to change our mining processes or abandon the mines see “key factors that can affect results of operations and financial condition” and “potash net sales and gross margin” in our management’s analysis which is incorporated herein by reference for a discussion of costs risks and other information relating to the brine inflows 

due to the ongoing brine inflow at esterhazy subject to exceptions that are limited in scope and amount we are unable to obtain coverage for underground operations for water incursion problems our mines at colonsay saskatchewan and carlsbad new mexico are also subject to the risks of inflow of water as a result of our shaft mining operations 

our operating results are highly dependent upon and fluctuate based upon business and economic conditions and governmental policies affecting the agricultural industry where we or our customers operate these factors are outside of our control and may significantly affect our profitability 

our operating results are highly dependent upon business and economic conditions and governmental policies affecting the agricultural industry which we cannot control the agricultural products business can be affected by a number of factors the most important of these factors for us markets are   

 22 

 international market conditions which are also outside of our control may also significantly influence our operating results the international market for crop nutrients is influenced by such factors as the relative value of the us dollar and its impact upon the cost of importing crop nutrients foreign agricultural policies including subsidy policies the existence of or changes in import or foreign currency exchange barriers in certain foreign markets changes in the hard currency demands of certain countries and other regulatory policies of foreign governments as well as the laws and policies of the united states affecting foreign trade and investment 

our most important products are global commodities and we face intense global competition from other crop nutrient producers that can affect our prices and volumes 

our most important products are concentrated phosphate crop nutrients including diammonium phosphate or dap monoammonium phosphate or map microessentials ®  and muriate of potash or mop we sell most of our dap map and mop in the form of global commodities our sales of these products face intense global competition from other crop nutrient producers 

changes in competitors’ production or shifts in their marketing focus have in the past significantly affected both the prices at which we sell our products and the volumes that we sell and are likely to continue to do so in the future 

competitors are more likely to increase their production at times when world agricultural and crop nutrient markets are strong and to focus on sales into regions where their returns are highest increases in the global supply of dap map and mop or competitors’ increased sales into regions in which we have significant sales could adversely affect our prices and volumes 

competitors and potential new entrants in the markets for both concentrated phosphate crop nutrients and potash have in recent years expanded capacity or begun or announced plans to expand capacity or build new facilities the extent to which current global or local economic and financial conditions changes in global or local economic and financial conditions or other factors may cause delays or cancellation of some of these ongoing or planned projects or result in the acceleration of existing or new projects is unclear in addition the level of exports by producers of concentrated phosphate crop nutrients in china depends to a significant extent on chinese government actions to curb exports through among other measures prohibitive export taxes at times when the government believes it desirable to assure ample domestic supplies of concentrated phosphate crop nutrients to stimulate grain and oilseed production 

in addition some of our competitors who are expanding their potash production capacity include other members of canpotex canpotex members’ respective shares of canpotex sales is based upon the members’ respective proven peaking capacity for producing potash when a canpotex member expands its production capacity the new capacity is added to that member’s proven peaking capacity based on a proving run at the maximum production level antitrust and competition laws prohibit the members of canpotex from coordinating their production decisions including the timing of their respective proving runs worldwide potash production levels during these proving runs could exceed thencurrent market demand resulting in an oversupply of potash and lower potash prices 

we cannot accurately predict when or whether competitors’ or new entrants’ ongoing or planned capacity expansions or new facilities will be completed the timing of competitors’ tests to prove peaking capacity for canpotex purposes the cumulative effect of these and recently completed expansions the impact of future decisions by the chinese government on the level of chinese exports of concentrated phosphate crop nutrients or the effects of these or other actions by our competitors on the prices for our products or the volumes that we will be able to sell 

our crop nutrients and other products are subject to price and demand volatility resulting from periodic imbalances of supply and demand which may cause our results of operations to fluctuate 

historically the market for crop nutrients has been cyclical and prices and demand for our products have fluctuated to a significant extent particularly for phosphates and to a lesser extent potash periods of high demand increasing profits and high capacity utilization tend to lead to new plant investment and increased production this growth increases supply until the market is oversaturated leading to declining prices and declining capacity utilization until the cycle repeats 

as a result crop nutrient prices and volumes have been volatile this price and volume volatility may cause our results of operations to fluctuate and potentially deteriorate the price at which we sell our crop nutrient products and our sales volumes could fall in the event of industry oversupply conditions which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial 

condition and results of operations in contrast high prices may lead our customers and farmers to delay purchasing decisions in anticipation of future lower prices thus impacting our sales volumes 

due to reduced market demand depressed agricultural economic conditions and other factors we and our predecessors have at various times suspended or reduced production at some of our facilities the extent to which we utilize available capacity at our facilities will cause fluctuations in our results of operations as we will incur costs for any temporary or indefinite shutdowns of our facilities and lower sales tend to lead to higher fixed costs as a percentage of sales 

variations in crop nutrient application rates may exacerbate the cyclicality of the crop nutrient markets 

farmers are able to maximize their economic return by applying optimum amounts of crop nutrients farmers’ decisions about the application rate for each crop nutrient or to forego application of a crop nutrient particularly phosphate and potash vary from year to year depending on a number of factors including among others crop prices crop nutrient and other crop input costs or the level of the crop nutrient remaining in the soil following the previous harvest farmers are more likely to increase application rates when crop prices are relatively high crop nutrient and other crop input costs are relatively low and the level of the crop nutrient remaining in the soil is relatively low conversely farmers are likely to reduce or forego application when farm economics are weak or declining or the level of the crop nutrients remaining in the soil is relatively high this variability in application rates can materially accentuate the cyclicality in prices for our products and our sales volumes 

our crop nutrient business is seasonal which may result in carrying significant amounts of inventory and seasonal variations in working capital and our inability to predict future seasonal crop nutrient demand accurately may result in excess inventory or product shortages 

the crop nutrient business is seasonal farmers tend to apply crop nutrients during two short application periods the strongest one in the spring before planting and the other in the fall after harvest as a result the strongest demand for our products typically occurs during the spring planting season with a second period of strong demand following the fall harvest in contrast we and other crop nutrient producers generally produce our products throughout the year as a result we andor our customers generally build inventories during the low demand periods of the year in order to ensure timely product availability during the peak sales seasons the seasonality of crop nutrient demand results in our sales volumes and net sales typically being the highest during the north american spring season and our working capital requirements typically being the highest just prior to the start of the spring season our quarterly financial results can vary significantly from one year to the next due to weatherrelated shifts in planting schedules and purchasing patterns 

if seasonal demand exceeds our projections we will not have enough product and our customers may acquire products from our competitors which would negatively impact our profitability if seasonal demand is less than we expect we will be left with excess inventory and higher working capital and liquidity requirements the degree of seasonality of our business can change significantly from year to year due to conditions in the agricultural industry and other factors 

the distribution channels for crop nutrients have capacity to build significant levels of inventories which can adversely affect our sales volumes and selling prices 

in order to balance the production needs of crop nutrient producers with farmers’ seasonal use of crop nutrients crop nutrient distribution channels need to have the capacity to build significant inventories the buildup of inventories in the distribution channels can become excessive particularly during the cyclical periods of low demand that have been typical in the crop nutrient industry when there are excessive inventories in the distribution channel our sales volumes and selling prices can be adversely impacted even during periods in which farmers’ use of crop nutrients may remain strong 

changes in transportation costs can affect our sales volumes and selling prices 

the cost of delivery is a significant factor in the total cost to customers and farmers of crop nutrients as a result changes in transportation costs or in customer expectations about them can affect our sales volumes and prices 

customer expectations about future events can have a significant effect on the demand for our products these expectations can significantly affect our sales volumes and selling prices 

customer expectations about future events have had and are expected to continue to have an effect on the demand and prices for crop nutrients future events that may be affected by customer expectations include among others   

 customer expectations about selling prices and availability of crop nutrients have had and are expected to continue to have an effect on the demand for crop nutrients when customers anticipate increasing crop nutrient selling prices 

customers tend to accumulate inventories before the anticipated price increases this can result in a lag in our realization of rising market prices for our products conversely customers tend to delay their purchases when they anticipate future selling prices for crop nutrients will stabilize or decrease adversely affecting our sales volumes and selling prices customer expectations about availability of crop nutrients can have similar effects on sales volumes and prices   

 similarly customer expectations about future farmer economics have had and are expected to continue to have an effect on the demand for crop nutrients when customers anticipate improving farmer economics customers tend to accumulate crop nutrient inventories in anticipation of increasing sales volumes and selling prices this can result in a lag in our realization of rising market prices for our products conversely when customers anticipate declining farmer economics customers tend to reduce the level of their purchases of crop nutrients adversely affecting our sales volumes and selling prices   

 as discussed above increasing transportation costs effectively increase customers’ and farmers’ costs for crop nutrients and can reduce the amount we realize for our sales expectations of decreasing transportation costs can result in customers and farmers anticipating that they may be able to decrease their costs by delaying purchases as a result changes in customer expectations about transportation costs can affect our sales volumes and prices 

we conduct our operations primarily through a limited number of key production and distribution facilities any disruption at one of these facilities could have a material adverse impact on our business the risk of material disruption increases when demand for our products results in high operating rates at our facilities 

we conduct our operations through a limited number of key production and distribution facilities these facilities include our phosphate mines and concentrates plants our potash mines and the ports and other distribution facilities through which we and the export associations and joint ventures in which we participate conduct our respective businesses as well as other commercial arrangements with unrelated third parties any disruption of operations at one of these facilities has the possibility of significantly affecting our production or our ability to distribute our products operating these facilities at high rates during periods of high demand for our products increases the risk of mechanical or structural failures decreases the time available for routine maintenance and increases the impact on our operating results from any disruption a disruption of operations at one of our key facilities could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 

examples of the types of events that could result in a disruption at one of these facilities include adverse weather strikes or other work stoppages deliberate malicious acts including acts of terrorism political and economic instability cyber attacks and other risks associated with our international operations changes in permitting financial assurance or other environmental health and safety laws or other changes in the regulatory environment in which we operate legal and regulatory proceedings our relationships with other members of an export association and joint ventures in which we participate and their or our exit from participation in such export association or joint ventures other changes in our commercial arrangements with unrelated third parties brine inflows at our esterhazy saskatchewan mine or our other shaft mines other accidents occurring in the course of operating activities and other factors 

insurance market conditions our loss experience and other factors affect the insurance coverage that we carry and we are not fully insured against all potential hazards and risks incident to our business as a result our insurance coverage may not adequately cover our losses 

we maintain property business interruption and casualty insurance policies but we are not fully insured against all potential hazards and risks incident to our business we are subject to various selfretentions and deductibles under these insurance policies as a result of market conditions our loss experience and other factors our premiums selfretentions and deductibles for insurance policies can increase substantially and in some instances certain insurance may become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage in addition significantly increased costs could lead us to decide to reduce or possibly eliminate coverage as a result a disruption of operations at one of our key facilities or a significant casualty could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 

important raw materials and energy used in our businesses in the past have been and may in the future be the subject of volatile pricing changes in the price of our raw materials could have a material impact on our businesses 

natural gas ammonia and sulfur are key raw materials used in the manufacture of phosphate crop nutrient products natural gas is used as both a chemical feedstock and a fuel to produce anhydrous ammonia which is a raw material used in the 

production of concentrated phosphate products natural gas is also a significant energy source used in the potash solution mining process from time to time our profitability has been and may in the future be impacted by the price and availability of these raw materials and other energy costs because most of our products are commodities there can be no assurance that we will be able to pass through increased costs to our customers a significant increase in the price of natural gas ammonia sulfur or energy costs that is not recovered through an increase in the price of our related crop nutrients products could have a material adverse impact on our business 

during periods when the price for concentrated phosphates is falling because of falling raw material prices we may experience a lag in realizing the benefits of the falling raw materials prices this lag can adversely affect our gross margins and profitability 

during some periods changes in market prices for raw materials can lead to changes in the global market prices for concentrated phosphate crop nutrients in particular the global market prices for concentrated phosphate crop nutrients can be affected by changes in the market prices for sulfur ammonia phosphate rock andor phosphoric acid raw materials increasing market prices for these raw materials tend to put upward pressure on the selling prices for concentrated phosphate crop nutrients and decreasing market prices for these raw materials tend to put downward pressure on selling prices for concentrated phosphate crop nutrients when the market prices for these raw materials plunge rapidly the selling prices for our concentrated phosphate crop nutrients can fall more rapidly than we are able to consume our raw material inventory that we purchased or committed to purchase in the past at higher prices as a result our costs may not fall as rapidly as the selling prices of our products until we are able to consume the higher priced raw materials our gross margins and profitability can be adversely affected 

during periods when the prices for our products are falling because of falling raw material prices we could be required to writedown the value of our inventories any such writedown would adversely affect our results of operations and the level of our assets 

we carry our inventories at the lower of cost or market in periods when the market prices for our products are falling rapidly in response to falling market prices for raw materials it is possible that we could be required to writedown the value of our inventories if market prices fall below our costs any such writedown would adversely affect our results of operations and the level of our assets any such effect could be material 

our estimates of future selling prices reflect in part the purchase commitments we have from our customers as a result defaults on these existing purchase commitments because of the global or local economic and financial conditions or for other reasons could adversely affect our estimates of future selling prices and require additional inventory writedowns 

in the event of a disruption to existing terminaling facilities or transportation for our products or raw materials alternative terminaling facilities or transportation might not be available on a timely basis or have sufficient capacity to fully serve all of our customers or facilities 

in the event of a disruption of existing terminaling facilities or transportation for our products or raw materials alternative terminaling facilities or transportation might not be available on a timely basis or have sufficient capacity to fully serve all of our customers or facilities 

terminaling facilities and transportation include the ports and other distribution facilities through which we and the export associations and joint ventures in which we participate conduct our respective businesses transportation and related equipment arrangements and other commercial arrangements with unrelated third parties 

examples of the types of events that could result in a disruption of terminaling facilities or transportation include adverse weather strikes or other work stoppages deliberate malicious acts political and economic instability and other risks associated with our international operations changes in permitting financial assurance or other environmental health and safety laws or other changes in the regulatory environment in which we operate legal and regulatory proceedings our relationships with other members of export associations and joint ventures in which we participate and their or our exit from participation in such export associations and joint ventures other changes in our commercial arrangements with unrelated third parties accidents occurring in the course of operating activities lack of truck rail barge or ship transportation and other factors we discuss a number of these examples in more detail throughout this risk factors section 

we are subject to risks associated with our international sales and operations which could negatively affect our sales to customers in foreign countries as well as our operations and assets in foreign countries some of these factors may also make it less attractive to distribute cash generated by our operations outside the united states to our stockholders or to utilize cash generated by our operations in one country to fund our operations or repayments of indebtedness in another country or to support other corporate purposes 

for 2014  we derived approximately 58  of our net sales from customers located outside of the united states as a result we are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties relating to international sales and operations including   

 the occurrence of any of the above in the countries in which we operate or elsewhere could jeopardize or limit our ability to transact business there and could adversely affect our revenues and operating results and the value of our assets located outside of the united states 

in addition tax regulations currency exchange controls and other restrictions may also make it economically unattractive to   

 changes in tax laws or regulations or their interpretation or exposure to additional tax liabilities could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

we are subject to taxes including income taxes resource taxes and royalties and other nonincome based taxes in the us canada china brazil and other countries where we operate changes in tax laws or regulations or their interpretation could result in higher taxes which could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

our international assets are located in countries with volatile conditions which could subject us and our assets to significant risks 

we are a global business with substantial assets located outside of the united states and canada our operations in brazil china and india are a fundamental part of our business we also have joint venture investments in the miski mayo mine in peru that supplies phosphate rock to us and the wa’ad al shamal joint venture that is developing a mine and chemical complexes that we presently expect would produce phosphate fertilizers animal feed feed grade purified phosphoric acid and sodium tripolyphosphate in the kingdom of saudi arabia volatile economic political and market conditions in these and other emerging market countries may have a negative impact on our operations operating results and financial condition 

natural resource extraction is an important part of the economy in peru and in the past there have been protests against other natural resource operations in peru as of the date of this report there remain numerous social conflicts that exist within the natural resource sector in peru and as a result there is potential for active protests against natural resource companies if the government of peru’s proactive efforts to address the social and environmental issues surrounding natural resource activities were not successful protests could extend to or impact the miski mayo mine and adversely affect our investment in the miski mayo joint venture or the supply of phosphate rock to us from the mine 

adverse weather conditions including the impact of potential hurricanes and excess heat cold snow rainfall and drought have in the past and may in the future adversely affect our operations particularly our phosphates business and result in increased costs decreased production and potential liabilities 

adverse weather conditions including the impact of potential hurricanes and excess heat cold snow rainfall and drought have in the past and may in the future adversely affect our operations particularly our phosphates business in the past hurricanes have resulted in minor physical damage to our facilities in florida and louisiana in addition a release of phosphoric acid process wastewater at our riverview florida facility during a hurricane resulted in a small civil fine settlement for an immaterial amount of claims for natural resource damages by governmental agencies and an ongoing private lawsuit 

additionally water treatment costs particularly at our florida operations due to high water balances tend to increase significantly following excess rainfall from hurricanes or other adverse weather some of our florida facilities have high water levels that may from time to time require treatment the high water balances at phosphate facilities in florida also led the 

florida department of environmental protection to adopt new rules requiring phosphate production facilities to meet more stringent process water management objectives for phosphogypsum management systems 

if additional excess rainfall or hurricanes occur in coming years our facilities may be required to take additional measures to manage process water to comply with existing or future requirements and these measures could potentially have a material effect on our business and financial condition 

adverse weather may also cause a loss of production due to disruptions in our supply chain for example oil refineries that supply sulfur to us can be closed as a result of a hurricane and incoming shipments of ammonia can be delayed disrupting production at our florida or louisiana facilities 

drought can also adversely affect us for example drought can reduce farmers’ crop yields and the uptake of phosphates and potash reducing the need for application of additional phosphates and potash for the next planting season drought can also lower river levels adversely affecting delivery of our products to our customers 

our operations are dependent on having the required permits and approvals from governmental authorities denial or delay by a government agency in issuing any of our permits and approvals or imposition of restrictive conditions on us with respect to these permits and approvals may impair our business and operations 

we hold numerous governmental environmental mining and other permits and approvals authorizing operations at each of our facilities a decision by a government agency to revoke or substantially modify an existing permit or approval could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue operations at the affected facility 

expansion of our operations also is predicated upon securing the necessary environmental or other permits or approvals over the next several years we and our subsidiaries will be continuing our efforts to obtain permits in support of our anticipated florida mining operations at certain of our properties 

a denial of or delay in issuing these permits the issuance of permits with costprohibitive conditions legal actions that prevent us from relying on permits or revocation of permits could prevent us from mining at these properties and thereby have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

for example   

 the periods of shutdown and reduced phosphate rock production at our south fort meade mine resulted in costs to suspend operations and idle plant costs lower phosphate rock mining production levels also adversely affected gross margin   

we have included additional discussion about permitting for our phosphate mines in florida under “environmental health safety and security matters—operating requirements and impacts—permitting” in our management’s analysis 

we are subject to financial assurance requirements as part of our routine business operations these financial assurance requirements affect our costs and increase our liquidity requirements if we were unable to satisfy applicable financial assurance requirements we might not be able to obtain or maintain permits we need to operate our business as we have 

in the past our need to comply with these requirements could materially affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

in many cases as a condition to procuring or maintaining permits and approvals or otherwise we are required to comply with financial assurance regulatory requirements the purpose of these requirements is to provide comfort to the government that sufficient funds will be available for the ultimate closure postclosure care andor reclamation of our facilities in most cases these financial assurance requirements have historically been satisfied without the need for any expenditure of corporate funds to the extent our financial statements meet certain balance sheet and income statement financial strength tests in the event that we are unable to satisfy these financial strength tests we must utilize alternative methods of complying with the financial assurance requirements or could be subject to enforcement proceedings brought by relevant government agencies potential alternative methods of compliance include negotiating a consent agreement that imposes alternative financial assurance or other conditions or alternatively providing credit support in the form of cash escrows or trusts surety bonds from insurance companies letters of credit from banks or other forms of financial instruments or collateral to satisfy the financial assurance requirements use of these alternative means of financial assurance imposes additional expense on us some of them such as letters of credit also use a portion of our available liquidity other alternative means of financial assurance such as surety bonds may in some cases require collateral and generally require us to obtain a discharge of the bonds or to post additional collateral typically in the form of cash or letters of credit at the request of the issuer of the bonds collateral that is required may be in many forms including letters of credit or other financial instruments that utilize a portion of our available liquidity or in the form of assets such as real estate which reduces our flexibility to manage or sell assets in the past we have also not always been able to satisfy applicable financial strength tests and in the future it is possible that we will not be able to pass the applicable financial strength tests negotiate consent decrees establish escrow or trust accounts or obtain letters of credit surety bonds or other financial instruments on acceptable terms and conditions or at a reasonable cost or that the form andor cost of compliance could increase which could materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

as more fully discussed in note 20  of our consolidated financial statements the us environmental protection agency is engaged in an ongoing review of mineral processing industries including us and other phosphoric acid producers under the us resource conservation and recovery act we are negotiating with the government the terms of a possible settlement of certain matters related to this review the final terms of this possible settlement are not yet agreed or approved however if a settlement can be achieved in all likelihood our multifaceted commitments would include as one of its key elements our deposit into one or more trust funds of an amount currently estimated at 625 million  to prefund a material portion of our existing asset retirement obligations for closure and postclosure care of our phosphogypsum management systems 

we have included additional discussion about financial assurance requirements under “off balance sheet arrangements and obligations—other commercial commitments” in our management’s analysis 

the other environmental regulations to which we are subject may also have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition to permitting and financial assurance requirements we are subject to numerous other environmental health and safety laws and regulations in the us canada china brazil and other countries where we operate these laws and regulations govern a wide range of matters including environmental controls land reclamation discharges to air and water and remediation of hazardous substance releases they significantly affect our operating activities as well as the level of our operating costs and capital expenditures in some international jurisdictions environmental laws change frequently and it may be difficult for us to determine if we are in compliance with all material environmental laws at any given time 

we are and may in the future be involved in legal and regulatory proceedings that could be material to us these proceedings include “legacy” matters arising from activities of our predecessor companies and from facilities and businesses that we have never owned or operated 

we have in the past been are currently and may in the future be subject to legal and regulatory proceedings that could be material to our business results of operations liquidity or financial condition joint ventures in which we participate could also become subject to these sorts of proceedings these proceedings may be brought by the government or private parties and may arise out of a variety of matters including   

 29 

also involved in other proceedings alleging that or to review whether we have violated environmental laws in the united states and brazil 

 the legal and regulatory proceedings to which we are currently or may in the future be subject can depending on the circumstances result in monetary damage awards fines penalties other liabilities injunctions or other court or administrative rulings that interrupt impede or otherwise materially affect our business operations andor criminal sanctions 

among other environmental laws the us comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act “ cercla ” imposes liability including for cleanup costs without regard to fault or to the legality of a party’s conduct on certain categories of persons including current and former owners and operators of a site and parties who are considered to have contributed to the release of “hazardous substances” into the environment under cercla or various us state analogs a party may under certain circumstances be required to bear more than its proportional share of cleanup costs at a site where it has liability if payments cannot be obtained from other responsible parties as a crop nutrient company working with chemicals and other hazardous substances we will periodically incur liabilities and cleanup costs under cercla and other environmental laws with regard to our current or former facilities adjacent or nearby thirdparty facilities or offsite disposal locations 

pending and potential legal and regulatory proceedings may arise out of our present activities including operations at current facilities they may also arise out of past activities by us our predecessor companies and subsidiaries that our predecessors have sold these past activities were in some cases at facilities that we and our subsidiaries no longer own or operate and may have never owned or operated 

settlements of legal and regulatory matters frequently require court approval in the event a court were not to approve of a settlement it is possible that we and the other party or parties to the matter might not be able to settle it on terms that were acceptable to all parties or that we could be required to accept more stringent terms of settlement than required by the opposing parties 

we have included additional information with respect to pending legal and regulatory proceedings in note 20  of our consolidated financial statements and in this report in part i item 3 “legal proceedings” 

these legal and regulatory proceedings involve inherent uncertainties and could negatively impact our business results of operations liquidity or financial condition 

the permitting financial assurance and other environmental health and safety laws and regulations to which we are subject may become more stringent over time this could increase the effects on us of these laws and regulations and the increased effects could be material 

continued government and public emphasis on environmental health and safety issues in the us canada china brazil and other countries where we operate can be expected to result in requirements that apply to us and our operations that are more stringent than those that are described above and elsewhere in this report these more stringent requirements may include among other matters increased levels of future investments and expenditures for environmental controls at ongoing operations which will be charged against income from future operations increased levels of the financial assurance requirements to which we are subject increased efforts or costs to obtain permits or denial of permits other new or interpretations of existing statutes or regulations that impose new or more stringent restrictions or liabilities including liabilities under cercla or similar statutes including restrictions or liabilities related to elevated levels of naturallyoccurring radiation that arise from disturbing the ground in the course of mining activities and other matters that could increase our expenses capital requirements or liabilities or adversely affect our business liquidity or financial condition in addition to the extent restrictions imposed in countries where our competitors operate such as china india former soviet union countries or morocco are less stringent than in the countries where we operate our competitors could gain cost or other competitive advantages over us these effects could be material 

among other matters there are several ongoing initiatives relating to nutrient discharges new regulatory restrictions from these initiatives could have a material effect on either us or our customers for example   

 in addition in april 2014 the epa and the us army corps of engineers jointly issued a proposed rule that would redefine the scope of waters regulated under the federal clean water act we believe the new definition would expand the types and extent of water resources regulated under federal law thereby potentially expanding our permitting and reporting requirements increasing our costs of compliance including costs associated with wetlands and stream mitigation lengthening the time necessary to obtain permits and restricting our ability to mine certain of our phosphate rock reserves if the rule were finalized as proposed we believe it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

regulatory restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions and climate change regulations in the united states canada or elsewhere could adversely affect us and these effects could be material 

various governmental initiatives to limit greenhouse gas emissions are under way or under consideration around the world these initiatives could restrict our operating activities require us to make changes in our operating activities that would increase our operating costs reduce our efficiency or limit our output require us to make capital improvements to our facilities increase our energy raw material and transportation costs or limit their availability or otherwise adversely affect our results of operations liquidity or capital resources and these effects could be material to us 

governmental greenhouse gas emission initiatives include among others   

 31 

potash facilities continue to work with the canadian fertilizer institute and environment canada on a sector based approach 

in may 2009 the province of saskatchewan in which our canadian potash mines are located began to consider legislation intended to lead to the development and administration of climate change regulation in saskatchewan by the province rather than the federal government key elements under consideration by the province include a primary focus on achieving a 20 reduction by 2020 under the proposed framework compliance mechanisms such as the technology fund recognition for early action precertified investments emission intensive trade exposed credits and carbon offsets would be established to provide flexibility for regulated emitters to meet their greenhouse gas reduction obligations   

 future climate change could adversely affect us 

the prospective impact of climate change on our operations and those of our customers and farmers remains uncertain some scientists have hypothesized that the impacts of climate change could include changes in rainfall patterns water shortages changing sea levels changing storm patterns and intensities and changing temperature levels and that these changes could be severe these impacts could vary by geographic location at the present time we cannot predict the prospective impact of climate change on our results of operations liquidity or capital resources or whether any such effects could be material to us 

some of our competitors and potential competitors have greater resources than we do which may place us at a competitive disadvantage and adversely affect our sales and profitability these competitors include stateowned and governmentsubsidized entities in other countries 

we compete with a number of producers throughout the world including stateowned and governmentsubsidized entities some of these entities may have greater total resources than we do and may be less dependent on earnings from crop nutrients sales than we are in addition some of these entities may have access to lower cost or governmentsubsidized natural gas supplies placing us at a competitive disadvantage furthermore certain governments as owners of some of our competitors may be willing to accept lower prices and profitability on their products in order to support domestic employment or other political or social goals to the extent other producers of crop nutrients enjoy competitive advantages or are willing to accept lower profit levels the price of our products our sales volumes and our profits may be adversely affected 

we have substantial cash balances that we invest in what we believe to be relatively shortterm highly liquid and high credit quality investments we intend the investment risks including counterparty default and lack of liquidity on these types of investments to be relatively low but market rates of return on these types of investments are also generally relatively low in addition our efforts to manage the investment risks could be unsuccessful this could result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations liquidity or financial condition 

our significant cash flows from operations have resulted in cash and cashequivalents of approximately 24 billion  as of december 31 2014  our cash and cashequivalents should continue to increase when we generate cash from operations except to the extent we reinvest in our business or make distributions to our stockholders we generally invest these cash and cashequivalents in what we believe to be relatively shortterm highly liquid and high credit quality instruments because of these characteristics of our cash and cashequivalents the market rates of return on them are lower than our expectations for the return on capital invested in our business operations moreover our efforts to manage investment risk by focusing our investing on shortterm highly liquid and high credit quality investments could prove unsuccessful the likelihood that our efforts to manage investment risk might prove unsuccessful is heightened during times when there is significant turmoil in the financial markets as a result counterparties could default on their obligations to us or the liquidity of financial instruments that we hold could become impaired any such event could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations liquidity or financial condition 

during 2014 we repurchased approximately 515 million class a shares and approximately 76 million common shares and we have approximately 1913 million remaining under our publicly announced 1 billion share repurchase program these share repurchases have and are expected to continue to reduce our cash balances and liquidity 

the agreements relating to the cargill transaction prevented us from repurchasing our shares in a negotiated transaction or through open market repurchases until november 26 2013 on december 6 2013 we entered into the mac trusts share 

repurchase agreement to purchase all of our class a shares held by the mac trusts through a series of eight purchases during the period january 8 2014 through july 30 2014 during 2014 all 43294015 class a shares held by the mac trusts were repurchased under the mac trusts share repurchase agreement 

in february of 2014 our board of directors authorized a 1 billion share repurchase program the “ repurchase program ” allowing us to repurchase class a shares or shares of common stock through direct buybacks or in open market transactions in line with our capital management policy the authorization is in addition to the mac trusts share repurchase agreement under which we have repurchased class a shares from the mac trusts during 2014 under the repurchase program 8193698 class a shares were repurchased under agreements we entered into with certain cargill family member trusts and 7585085 shares of common stock were repurchased in the open market for an aggregate of 7273 million 

under our capital management policy we have also indicated our willingness to use our available debt capacity as well as our surplus cash to fund share repurchases financial assurance requirements arising in our business and strategic investments our use of our surplus cash andor available debt capacity for these purposes has reduced our available cash and liquidity to the extent we use our surplus cash andor available debt capacity for these purposes in the future our available cash and liquidity could be further reduced 

we do not own a controlling equity interest in our nonconsolidated companies some of which are foreign companies and therefore our operating results and cash flow may be materially affected by how the governing boards and majority owners operate such businesses there may also be limitations on monetary distributions from these companies that are outside of our control together these factors may lower our equity earnings or cash flow from such businesses and negatively impact our results of operations 

we recently entered into the wa’ad al shamal joint venture to develop a mine and chemical complexes for an estimated 75 billion  that would produce phosphate fertilizers animal feed feed grade purified phosphoric acid and sodium tripolyphosphate in the kingdom of saudi arabia we have a 25 interest in the joint venture and expect our cash investment will be up to 850 million  funded over a fouryear period the success of this joint venture will depend on among other matters the ability of the wa’ad al shamal joint venture to obtain additional planned funding in acceptable amounts and upon acceptable terms the future success of current plans for the development and operation of the wa’ad al shamal joint venture and any future changes in those plans 

we also hold minority ownership interests in a joint venture that owns and operates a phosphate rock mine and in other companies that are not controlled by us we expect that the operations and results of the wa’ad al shamal joint venture will be and the operations or results of some of the other joint ventures or companies are significant to us and their operations can affect our earnings because we do not control these companies either at the board or stockholder levels and because local laws in foreign jurisdictions and contractual obligations may place restrictions on monetary distributions by these companies we cannot ensure that these companies will operate efficiently pay dividends or generally follow the desires of our management by virtue of our board or stockholder representation as a result these companies may contribute less than anticipated to our earnings and cash flow negatively impacting our results of operations and liquidity 

strikes or other forms of work stoppage or slowdown could disrupt our business and lead to increased costs 

our financial performance is dependent on a reliable and productive work force a significant portion of our workforce and that of the joint ventures in which we participate is covered by collective bargaining agreements with unions unsuccessful contract negotiations or adverse labor relations could result in strikes or slowdowns any disruptions may decrease our production and sales or impose additional costs to resolve disputes the risk of adverse labor relations may increase as our profitability increases because labor unions’ expectations and demands generally rise at those times 

accidents occurring in the course of our operating activities could result in significant liabilities interruptions or shutdowns of facilities or the need for significant safety or other expenditures 

we engage in mining and industrial activities that can result in serious accidents mining in particular can be a dangerous activity if our safety procedures are not effective or if an accident occurs we could be subject to liabilities arising out of personal injuries or death our operations could be interrupted and we might have to shut down or abandon affected facilities accidents could cause us to expend significant amounts to remediate safety issues or to repair damaged facilities for example   

 the excavation of mines can result in potential seismic events or can increase the likelihood or potential severity of a seismic event the rise and fall of water levels such as those arising from the brine inflows and our remediation activities at our esterhazy mine can also result in or increase the likelihood or potential severity of a seismic event our esterhazy mine has experienced minor seismic events from time to time a significant seismic event at one of our 

mines could result in serious injuries or death or damage to or flooding of the mine or in the extreme scenario cause us to change our mining process or abandon the mine   

 our underground potash shaft mines at esterhazy and colonsay saskatchewan and carlsbad new mexico are subject to risk from fire any failure of our safety procedures in the future could result in serious injuries or death or shutdowns which could result in significant liabilities andor impact on the financial performance of our potash business including a possible material adverse effect on our results of operations liquidity or financial condition   

 we produce ammonia at our faustina louisiana phosphate concentrates plant use ammonia in significant quantities at all of our florida and louisiana phosphates concentrates plants and store ammonia at some of our distribution facilities for our florida phosphates concentrates plants ammonia is received at terminals in tampa and transported by pipelines and rail to our facilities our ammonia is generally stored and transported at high pressures an accident could occur that could result in serious injuries or death or the evacuation of areas near an accident an accident could also result in property damage or the shutdown of our florida or louisiana phosphates concentrates plants the ammonia terminals pipelines or rail lines serving those plants or our other ammonia storage and handling facilities as a result an accident involving ammonia could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations liquidity or financial condition   

 we use sulfuric acid in the production of concentrated phosphates in our florida and louisiana operations some of our florida and louisiana facilities produce fluorosilicic acid which is a hazardous chemical for resale to third parties we also use or produce other hazardous or volatile chemicals at some of our facilities an accident involving any of these chemicals could result in serious injuries or death or evacuation of areas near an accident an accident could also result in property damage or shutdown of our facilities or cause us to expend significant amounts to remediate safety issues or to repair damaged facilities as a result an accident involving any of these chemicals could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations liquidity or financial condition 

deliberate malicious acts including terrorism and cyber attacks could damage our facilities disrupt our operations or injure employees contractors customers or the public and result in liability to us 

intentional acts of destruction could hinder our sales or production and disrupt our supply chain our facilities could be damaged or destroyed reducing our operational production capacity and requiring us to repair or replace our facilities at substantial cost employees contractors and the public could suffer substantial physical injury for which we could be liable governmental authorities may impose security or other requirements that could make our operations more difficult or costly the consequences of any such actions could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

we may be adversely affected by changing antitrust laws to which we are subject increases in crop nutrient prices can increase the scrutiny to which we are subject under these laws 

we are subject to antitrust and competition laws in various countries throughout the world we cannot predict how these laws or their interpretation administration and enforcement will change over time changes in antitrust laws globally or in their interpretation administration or enforcement may limit our existing or future operations and growth or the operations of canpotex which serves as an export association for our potash business increases in crop nutrient prices have in the past resulted in increased scrutiny of the crop nutrient industry under antitrust and competition laws and can increase the risk that these laws could be interpreted administered or enforced in a manner that could affect our operating practices or impose liability on us in a manner that could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

we may be adversely affected by other changes in laws resulting from increases in food and crop nutrient prices 

increases in prices for among other things food fuel and crop inputs including crop nutrients have in the past been the subject of significant discussion by various governmental bodies and officials throughout the world in response to increases it is possible that governments in one or more of the locations in which we operate or where we or our competitors sell our products could take actions that could affect us such actions could include among other matters changes in governmental policies relating to agriculture and biofuels including changes in subsidy levels price controls tariffs windfall profits taxes or export or import taxes any such actions could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

our competitive position could be adversely affected if we are unable to participate in continuing industry consolidation 

most of our products are readily available from a number of competitors and price and other competition in the crop nutrient industry is intense in addition crop nutrient production facilities and distribution activities frequently benefit from economies of scale as a result particularly during pronounced cyclical troughs the crop nutrient industry has a long history of consolidation mosaic itself is the result of a number of industry consolidations we expect consolidation among crop nutrient producers could continue our competitive position could suffer to the extent we are not able to expand our own resources either through consolidations acquisitions joint ventures or partnerships in the future we may not be able to find suitable companies to combine with assets to purchase or joint venture or partnership opportunities to pursue even if we are able to locate desirable opportunities we may not be able to enter into transactions on economically acceptable terms if we do not successfully participate in continuing industry consolidation our ability to compete successfully could be adversely affected and result in the loss of customers or an uncompetitive cost structure which could adversely affect our sales and profitability 

our strategy for managing market risk may not be effective 

our businesses are affected by fluctuations in market prices for our products the purchase price of natural gas ammonia and sulfur consumed in operations freight and shipping costs and foreign currency exchange rates we periodically enter into derivatives and forward purchase contracts to mitigate some of these risks however our strategy may not be successful in minimizing our exposure to these fluctuations see “market risk” in our management’s analysis and note 14  of our consolidated financial statements that is incorporated by reference in this report in part ii item 8 

a shortage of railcars barges and ships for carrying our products and the raw materials we use in our business could result in customer dissatisfaction loss of production or sales and higher transportation or equipment costs 

we rely heavily upon truck rail barge and ocean freight transportation to obtain the raw materials we need and to deliver our products to our customers in addition the cost of transportation is an important part of the final sale price of our products finding affordable and dependable transportation is important in obtaining our raw materials and to supply our customers higher costs for these transportation services or an interruption or slowdown due to factors including high demand high fuel prices labor disputes layoffs or other factors affecting the availability of qualified transportation workers adverse weather or other environmental events or changes to rail barge or ocean freight systems could negatively affect our ability to produce our products or deliver them to our customers which could affect our performance and results of operations 

strong demand for grain and other products and a strong world economy increase the demand for and reduce the availability of transportation both domestically and internationally shortages of railcars barges and ocean transport for carrying product and increased transit time may result in customer dissatisfaction loss of sales and higher equipment and transportation costs in addition during periods when the shipping industry has a shortage of ships the substantial time needed to build new ships prevents rapid market response delays and missed shipments due to transportation shortages including vessels barges railcars and trucks could result in customer dissatisfaction or loss of sales potential which could negatively affect our performance and results of operations 

a lack of customers’ access to credit can adversely affect their ability to purchase our products 

some of our customers require access to credit to purchase our products a lack of available credit to customers in one or more countries due to global or local economic conditions or for other reasons could adversely affect demand for crop nutrients 

we extend trade credit to our customers and guarantee the financing that some of our customers use to purchase our products our results of operations may be adversely affected if these customers are unable to repay the trade credit from us or financing from their banks increases in prices for crop nutrient other agricultural inputs and grain may increase this risk 

we extend trade credit to our customers in the united states and throughout the world in some cases for extended periods of time in brazil where there are fewer thirdparty financing sources available to farmers we also have several programs under which we guarantee customers’ financing from financial institutions that they use to purchase our products as our exposure to 

longer trade credit extended throughout the world and use of guarantees in brazil increases we are increasingly exposed to the risk that some of our customers will not pay us or the amounts we have guaranteed additionally we become increasingly exposed to risk due to weather and crop growing conditions fluctuations in commodity prices or foreign currencies and other factors that influence the price supply and demand for agricultural commodities significant defaults by our customers could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

increases in prices for crop nutrients increase the dollar amount of our sales to customers the larger dollar value of our customers’ purchases may also lead them to request longer trade credit from us andor increase their need for us to guarantee their financing of our products either factor could increase the amount of our exposure to the risk that our customers may be unable to repay the trade credit from us or financing from their banks that we guarantee in addition increases in prices for other agricultural inputs and grain may increase the working capital requirements indebtedness and other liabilities of our customers increase the risk that they will default on the trade credit from us or their financing that we guarantee and decrease the likelihood that we will be able to collect from our customers in the event of their default 

tax rules governing the cargill transaction limited our ability to execute certain actions for a period of time following the cargill transaction and if our procedures for compliance with those restrictions were ineffective notwithstanding the irs ruling and tax opinion issued to cargill in connection with the cargill transaction we could owe significant taxrelated indemnification liabilities to cargill 

the irs issued a ruling to the effect that the splitoff that was part of the cargill transaction would be taxfree to cargill and its stockholders and in connection with the completion of the cargill transaction cargill received a tax opinion relating to certain tax consequences of the cargill transaction notwithstanding the irs ruling and tax opinion however the splitoff and debt exchanges could be taxable to cargill and its stockholders under certain circumstances therefore we and cargill agreed to taxrelated restrictions and indemnities set forth in a tax agreement related to the cargill transaction under which we were restricted or deterred from taking certain actions until may 26 2013 including i redeeming or purchasing our stock in excess of agreedupon amounts ii issuing any equity securities in excess of agreed upon amounts iii approving or recommending a third party’s acquisition of us iv permitting any merger or other combination of mosaic or mos holdings and v entering into an agreement for the purchase of any interest in mosaic or mos holdings subject to certain exceptions we agreed to indemnify cargill for taxes and taxrelated losses imposed on cargill as a result of the splitoff andor debt exchange failing to qualify as taxfree if the taxes and related losses are attributable to arise out of or result from certain prohibited acts or to any breach of or inaccuracy in any representation warranty or covenant made by us in the tax agreement referred to above the taxes and taxrelated losses of cargill would be material if these transactions fail to qualify as taxfree and if our procedures for avoiding any of these prohibited acts or breaches were ineffective this indemnity would result in material liabilities from us to cargill that could have a material adverse effect on us for a further discussion of the restrictions and indemnities set forth in the agreements related to the cargill transaction please see note 2  to our consolidated financial statements 

provisions in our restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws and of delaware law may prevent or delay an acquisition of our company which could decrease the trading price of our common stock 

our restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that could have the effect of rendering more difficult or discouraging an acquisition deemed undesirable by our board of directors these provisions include the ability of our board of directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval a prohibition on stockholder action by written consent and the inability of our stockholders to request that our board of directors or chairman of our board call a special meeting of stockholders 

we are also subject to section 203 of the delaware general corporation law in general section 203 prohibits a publicly held delaware corporation from engaging in a “business combination” with an “interested stockholder” for a period of three years from the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder unless the interested stockholder attained this status with the approval of the board of directors or unless the business combination was approved in a prescribed manner a “business combination” includes mergers asset sales and other transactions resulting in a financial benefit to the interested stockholder subject to exceptions an “interested stockholder” is a person who together with affiliates and associates owns or within three years owned 15 or more of the corporation’s voting stock this statute could prohibit or delay the accomplishment of mergers or other takeover or change in control attempts with respect to us and accordingly may discourage attempts to acquire us 

these provisions apply not only when they may protect our stockholders from coercive or otherwise unfair takeover tactics but even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders and could delay or prevent an acquisition that our board of directors determines is not in our best interests or those of our stockholders 

our success will increasingly depend on our ability to attract and retain highly qualified and motivated employees 

we believe our continued success depends on the collective abilities and efforts of our employees like many businesses a significant number of our employees including some of our most highly skilled employees with specialized expertise in potash and phosphates operations will be approaching retirement age throughout the next decade and beyond in addition we compete for a talented workforce with other businesses particularly within the mining and chemicals industries in general and the crop nutrients industry in particular our expansion plans are highly dependent on our ability to attract retain and train highly qualified and motivated employees who are essential to the success of our ongoing operations as well as to our expansion plans if we were to be unsuccessful in attracting retaining and training the employees we require our ongoing operations and expansion plans could be materially and adversely affected 

future technological innovation could affect our business 

future technological innovation such as the development of seeds that require less crop nutrients or developments in the application of crop nutrients if they occur could have the potential to adversely affect the demand for our products and our results of operations liquidity and capital resources 

the success of our strategic initiatives depends on our ability to effectively manage these initiatives and to successfully integrate and grow acquired businesses 

we have initiated several significant strategic initiatives principally our plans to expand the annual production capacity of our potash business the wa’ad al shamal joint venture the cf phosphate assets acquisition and our acquisition of adms fertilizer distribution business in brazil and paraguay these strategic initiatives involve capital and other expenditures of several billions of dollars over a number of years and require effective project management and in the case of strategic acquisitions successful integration to the extent the processes we or for the wa’ad al shamal joint venture we together with ma’aden and sabic put in place to manage these initiatives or integrate and grow acquired businesses are not effective our capital expenditure and other costs may exceed our expectations or the benefits we expect from these initiatives might not be fully realized 

we may fail to fully realize the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the cf phosphate assets acquisition and the cf ammonia supply agreements 

the success of our cf phosphate assets acquisition and the cf ammonia supply agreements will depend in part on our ability to realize the anticipated benefits and cost savings from combining cf’s phosphate mining and production operations with our operations in central florida our ability to avoid or delay future capital spending as a result of the transactions and our ability to realize cost savings from natural gas based pricing under one of the long term cf ammonia supply agreements our ability to realize these anticipated benefits and cost savings is subject to certain risks including   

 in addition we use ammonia as a raw material in the production of our concentrated phosphate products under one of the cf ammonia supply agreements we have agreed to purchase 545000 to 725000 tonnes of ammonia per year for up to 15 years at a price to be determined by a formula based on the prevailing price of us natural gas this agreement is expected to commence prior to january 1 2017 if the price of natural gas rises or the market price for ammonia falls outside of the range we currently anticipate we may not fully realize the cost benefit we anticipate from the natural gas based pricing under this agreement or the cost of our ammonia under this agreement could be a competitive disadvantage 

our benefits from the cf phosphate assets acquisition and the acquisition of adms fertilizer distribution business depend in part on the accuracy of our estimates of the liabilities and obligations we are assuming in the transaction 

we have assumed various liabilities and obligations of cf and adm as part of the cf phosphate assets acquisition and our acquisition of adms fertilizer distribution business in brazil and paraguay the benefits we expect from these acquisitions depend in part on the accuracy of our estimates of these liabilities and obligations to the extent we have underestimated these liabilities and obligations we might not fully realize the benefits we are expecting from the acquisitions 

cyber attacks could disrupt our operations and have a material adverse impact on our business 

we utilize and rely upon information technology systems in many aspects of our business including internal and external communications and the management of our accounting financial and supply chain functions as we become more dependent on information technologies to conduct our operations and as the number and sophistication of cyber attacks increase the risks associated with cyber security increase these risks apply both to us and to third parties on whose systems we rely for the conduct of our business failure to effectively anticipate prevent detect and recover from the increasing number and sophistication of cyber attacks could result in theft loss damage misuse or modification of and to our information and cause disruptions in our business reputational damage and thirdparty claims which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition
