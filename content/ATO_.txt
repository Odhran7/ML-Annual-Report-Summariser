overview and strategy 

atmos energy corporation headquartered in dallas texas and incorporated in texas and virginia is the country’s largest naturalgasonly distributor based on number of customers we safely deliver reliable affordable efficient and abundant natural gas through regulated sales and transportation arrangements to approximately 33 million residential commercial public authority and industrial customers in eight states located primarily in the south we also operate one of the largest intrastate pipelines in texas based on miles of pipe 

atmos energys vision is to be the safest provider of natural gas services we will be recognized for exceptional customer service for being a great employer and for achieving superior financial results 

since 2011 our operating strategy has focused on modernizing our business and infrastructure while reducing regulatory lag this operating strategy supports continued investment in safety innovation environmental sustainability and our communities 

operating segments 

as of september 30 2022 we manage and review our consolidated operations through the following reportable segments 

• the distribution segment is primarily comprised of our regulated natural gas distribution and related sales operations in eight states 

• the pipeline and storage segment is comprised primarily of the pipeline and storage operations of our atmos pipelinetexas division and our natural gas transmission operations in louisiana 

distribution segment overview 

the following table summarizes key information about our six regulated natural gas distribution divisions presented in order of total rate base 



we operate in our service areas under terms of nonexclusive franchise agreements granted by the various cities and towns that we serve at september 30 2022 we held 1028 franchises having terms generally ranging from five to 35 years a significant number of our franchises expire each year which require renewal prior to the end of their terms historically we have successfully renewed these franchises and believe that we will continue to be able to renew our franchises as they expire 

revenues in this operating segment are established by regulatory authorities in the states in which we operate these rates are intended to be sufficient to cover the costs of conducting business including a reasonable return on invested capital in addition we transport natural gas for others through our distribution systems 

rates established by regulatory authorities often include cost adjustment mechanisms for costs that i are subject to significant price fluctuations compared to our other costs ii represent a large component of our cost of service and iii are generally outside our control 

purchased gas cost adjustment mechanisms represent a traditional and common form of cost adjustment mechanism purchased gas cost adjustment mechanisms provide a method of recovering purchased gas costs on an ongoing basis without filing a rate case because they provide a dollarfordollar offset to increases or decreases in the cost of natural gas therefore although substantially all of our distribution operating revenues fluctuate with the cost of gas that we purchase distribution operating income is generally not affected by fluctuations in the cost of gas 

additionally some jurisdictions have performancebased ratemaking adjustments to provide incentives to minimize purchased gas costs through improved storage management and use of financial instruments to reduce volatility in gas costs under the performancebased ratemaking adjustments purchased gas costs savings are shared between the company and its customers 

our supply of natural gas is provided by a variety of suppliers including independent producers and marketers the gas is delivered into our systems by various pipeline companies withdrawals of gas from proprietary and contracted storage assets and base load and peaking arrangements as needed 

supply arrangements consist of both base load and peaking quantities and are contracted from our suppliers on a firm basis with various terms at market prices base load quantities are those that flow at a constant level throughout the month and peaking quantities provide the flexibility to change daily quantities to match increases or decreases in requirements related to weather conditions 

except for local production purchases we select our natural gas suppliers through a competitive bidding process by periodically requesting proposals from suppliers we select these suppliers based on their ability to reliably deliver gas supply to our designated firm pipeline receipt points at the lowest reasonable cost major suppliers during fiscal 2022 were conocophillips company enlink gas marketing lp enterprise navitas midstream midland basin llc eog resources inc hartree partners lp sequent energy management llc symmetry energy solutions llc targa gas marketing llc texla energy management inc and twin eagle resource management llc 

the combination of base load and peaking agreements coupled with the withdrawal of gas held in storage allows us the flexibility to adjust to changes in weather which minimizes our need to enter into longterm firm commitments we estimate our peakday availability of natural gas supply to be approximately 44 bcf the peakday demand for our distribution operations in fiscal 2022 was on february 3 2022 when sales to customers reached approximately 36 bcf 

currently our distribution divisions utilize 38 pipeline transportation companies both interstate and intrastate to transport our natural gas the pipeline transportation agreements are firm and many of them have “pipeline nonotice” storage service which provides for daily balancing between system requirements and nominated flowing supplies these agreements have been negotiated with the shortest term necessary while still maintaining our right of first refusal the natural gas supply for our midtex division is delivered primarily by our apt division 

to maintain our deliveries to high priority customers we have the ability and have exercised our right to interrupt or curtail service to certain customers pursuant to contracts and applicable state regulations or statutes our customers’ demand on our system is not necessarily indicative of our ability to meet current or anticipated market demands or immediate delivery requirements because of factors such as the physical limitations of gathering storage and transmission systems the duration and severity of cold weather the availability of gas reserves from our suppliers the ability to purchase additional supplies on a shortterm basis and actions by federal and state regulatory authorities interruption and curtailment rights provide us the flexibility to meet the humanneeds requirements of our customers on a reliable basis priority allocations imposed by federal and state regulatory agencies as well as other factors beyond our control may affect our ability to meet the demands of some of our customers 

pipeline and storage segment overview 

our pipeline and storage segment consists of the pipeline and storage operations of apt and our natural gas transmission operations in louisiana apt is one of the largest intrastate pipeline operations in texas with a heavy concentration in the established natural gasproducing areas of central northern and eastern texas extending into or near the major producing areas of the barnett shale the texas gulf coast and the permian basin of west texas through its system apt provides transportation and storage services to our midtex division other third party local distribution companies industrial and electric generation customers marketers and producers as part of its pipeline operations apt owns and operates five underground storage reservoirs in texas 

revenues earned from transportation and storage services for apt are subject to traditional ratemaking governed by the rrc rates are updated through periodic filings made under texas’ grip grip allows us to include in our rate base annually approved capital costs incurred in the prior calendar year provided that we file a complete rate case at least once every five 

years the most recent of which was completed in august 2017 apt’s existing regulatory mechanisms allow certain transportation and storage services to be provided under marketbased rates 

our natural gas transmission operations in louisiana are comprised of a 21mile pipeline located in the new orleans louisiana area that is primarily used to aggregate gas supply for our distribution division in louisiana under a longterm contract and on a more limited basis to third parties the demand fee charged to our louisiana distribution division for these services is subject to regulatory approval by the louisiana public service commission we also manage two asset management plans that serve distribution affiliates of the company which have been approved by applicable state regulatory commissions generally these asset management plans require us to share with our distribution customers a significant portion of the cost savings earned from these arrangements 

ratemaking activity 

overview 

the method of determining regulated rates varies among the states in which our regulated businesses operate the regulatory authorities have the responsibility of ensuring that utilities in their jurisdictions operate in the best interests of customers while providing utility companies the opportunity to earn a reasonable return on their investment generally each regulatory authority reviews rate requests and establishes a rate structure intended to generate revenue sufficient to cover the costs of conducting business including a reasonable return on invested capital 

our rate strategy focuses on reducing or eliminating regulatory lag obtaining adequate returns and providing stable predictable margins which benefit both our customers and the company as a result of our ratemaking efforts in recent years atmos energy has 

• formula rate mechanisms in place in four states that provide for an annual rate review and adjustment to rates 

• infrastructure programs in place in all of our states that provide for an annual adjustment to rates for qualifying capital expenditures through our annual formula rate mechanisms and infrastructure programs we have the ability to recover approximately 90 percent of our capital expenditures within six months and substantially all of our capital expenditures within twelve months 

• authorization in tariffs statute or commission rules that allows us to defer certain elements of our cost of service such as depreciation ad valorem taxes and pension costs until they are included in rates 

• wna mechanisms in seven states that serve to minimize the effects of weather on approximately 96 percent of our distribution residential and commercial revenues 

• the ability to recover the gas cost portion of bad debts in five states which represents approximately 81 percent of our distribution residential and commercial revenues

although substantial progress has been made in recent years to improve rate design and recovery of investment across our service areas we are continuing to seek improvements in rate design to address cost variations and pursue tariffs that reduce regulatory lag associated with investments further potential changes in federal energy policy federal safety regulations and changing economic conditions will necessitate continued vigilance by the company and our regulators in meeting the challenges presented by these external factors 

recent ratemaking activity 

the amounts described in the following sections represent the annual operating income that was requested or received in each rate filing which may not necessarily reflect the stated amount referenced in the final order as certain operating costs may have changed as a result of the commissions or other governmental authoritys final ruling our ratemaking outcomes include the refund return of excess deferred income taxes edit resulting from previously enacted tax reform legislation and do not reflect the true economic benefit of the outcomes because they do not include the corresponding income tax benefit the following tables summarize the annualized ratemaking outcomes we implemented in each of the last three fiscal years 



the following ratemaking efforts seeking 1445 million in annual operating income were initiated during fiscal 2022 but had not been completed or implemented as of september 30 2022 



1 on august 12 2022 the state corporation commission of virginia approved a rate increase of 05 million effective october 1 2022 

2 on august 12 2022 the kentucky public service commission approved a rate increase of 19 million effective october 2 2022 subject to refund 

3 the midtex cities approved a rate increase of 814 million which includes 04 million related to the return of excess deferred income taxes that will be offset by lower income tax expense new rates were implemented on october 1 2022 

4 the mississippi public service commission mpsc approved an increase in operating income of 86 million for the sir filing the mpsc also approved an increase in operating income of 122 million for the srf filing which includes 08 million related to the refund of excess deferred income taxes that will be offset by lower income tax expense new rates for both filings were implemented november 1 2022 

5 the west texas cities approved a rate increase of 73 million new rates were implemented on october 1 2022 

our recent ratemaking activity is discussed in greater detail below 

annual formula rate mechanisms 

as an instrument to reduce regulatory lag formula rate mechanisms allow us to refresh our rates on an annual basis without filing a formal rate case however these filings still involve discovery by the appropriate regulatory authorities prior to the final determination of rates under these mechanisms we currently have specific infrastructure programs in all of our distribution divisions with tariffs in place to permit the investment associated with these programs to have their surcharge rate adjusted annually to recover approved capital costs incurred in a prior testyear period the following table summarizes our annual formula rate mechanisms by state 



1 infrastructure mechanisms in texas louisiana and tennessee allow for the deferral of all expenses associated with capital expenditures incurred pursuant to these rules which primarily consists of interest depreciation and other taxes texas only until the next rate proceeding rate case or annual rate filing at which time investment and costs would be recoverable through base rates 

the following table summarizes our annual formula rate mechanisms with effective dates during the fiscal years ended september 30 2022 2021 and 2020 





1 rates were implemented on july 1 2022 subject to refund 

2 the rate increase for this filing was approved based on the effective date herein however the new rates were implemented beginning september 1 2022 

3 the rate increases for these filings were approved based on the effective dates herein however the new rates were implemented beginning september 1 2021 

4 the rate increases for our texas grip filings were approved based on the effective date herein however the new rates were implemented beginning september 1 2020 

rate case filings 

a rate case is a formal request from atmos energy to a regulatory authority to increase rates that are charged to customers rate cases may also be initiated when the regulatory authorities request us to justify our rates this process is referred to as a “show cause” action adequate rates are intended to provide for recovery of the company’s costs as well as a reasonable rate of return to our shareholders and ensure that we continue to safely deliver reliable reasonably priced natural gas service to our customers 

the following table summarizes our recent rate case activity during the fiscal years ended september 30 2022 2021 and 2020 



1 the rate case outcome for kentucky is inclusive of the fiscal 2022 pipeline replacement program 

other ratemaking activity 

the following table summarizes other ratemaking activity during the fiscal years ended september 30 2022 2021 and 2020 



  

1 the ad valorem filing relates to property taxes that are either over or undercollected compared to the amount included in our kansas service areas base rates 

other regulation 

we are regulated by various state or local public utility authorities we are also subject to regulation by the united states department of transportation with respect to safety requirements in the operation and maintenance of our transmission and distribution facilities in addition our operations are also subject to various state and federal laws regulating environmental matters from time to time we receive inquiries regarding various environmental matters we believe that our properties and operations comply with and are operated in conformity with applicable safety and environmental statutes and regulations there are no administrative or judicial proceedings arising under environmental quality statutes pending or known to be contemplated by governmental agencies which would have a material adverse effect on us or our operations the pipeline and hazardous materials safety administration phmsa within the us department of transportation develops and enforces regulations for the safe reliable and environmentally sound operation of the pipeline transportation system the phmsa pipeline safety statutes provide for states to assume safety authority over intrastate natural transmission and distribution gas pipelines state pipeline safety programs are responsible for adopting and enforcing the federal and state pipeline safety regulations for intrastate natural gas transmission and distribution pipelines 

the federal energy regulatory commission ferc allows pursuant to section 311 of the natural gas policy act ngpa gas transportation services through our apt assets “on behalf of” interstate pipelines or local distribution companies served by interstate pipelines without subjecting these assets to the jurisdiction of the ferc under the ngpa additionally the ferc has regulatory authority over the use and release of interstate pipeline and storage capacity the ferc also has authority to detect and prevent market manipulation and to enforce compliance with ferc’s other rules policies and orders by companies engaged in the sale purchase transportation or storage of natural gas in interstate commerce we have taken what we believe are the necessary and appropriate steps to comply with these regulations 

the sec and the commodities futures trading commission pursuant to the dodd–frank act established numerous regulations relating to us financial markets we enacted procedures and modified existing business practices and contractual arrangements to comply with such regulations there are however some rulemaking proceedings that have not yet been finalized including those relating to capital and margin rules for non–cleared swaps we do not expect these rules to directly impact our business practices or collateral requirements however depending on the substance of these final rules in addition to certain international regulatory requirements still under development that are similar to dodd–frank our swap counterparties could be subject to additional and potentially significant capitalization requirements these regulations could motivate counterparties to increase our collateral requirements or cash postings 

competition 

although our regulated distribution operations are not currently in significant direct competition with any other distributors of natural gas to residential and commercial customers within our service areas we do compete with other natural gas suppliers and suppliers of alternative fuels for sales to industrial customers we compete in all aspects of our business with alternative energy sources including in particular electricity electric utilities offer electricity as a rival energy source and compete for the space heating water heating and cooking markets promotional incentives improved equipment efficiencies 

and promotional rates all contribute to the acceptability of electrical equipment the principal means to compete against alternative fuels is lower prices and natural gas historically has maintained its price advantage in the residential commercial and industrial markets 

our pipeline and storage operations have historically faced competition from other existing intrastate pipelines seeking to provide or arrange transportation storage and other services for customers in the last few years several new pipelines have been completed which has increased the level of competition in this segment of our business 

employees 

the corporate responsibility sustainability and safety committee of the board of directors oversees matters relating to equal employment opportunities diversity and inclusion human workplace rights employee health and safety and the company’s vision values and culture it oversees the companys policies practices and procedures relating to sustainability to support the alignment of the companys sustainability strategy with the companys corporate strategy 

part of our vision is to create a culture that respects and appreciates diversity for this reason we strive to have a workforce that reflects the communities we serve at september 30 2022 we had 4791 employees substantially unchanged from last year we monitor our workforce data on a calendar year basis as of december 31 2021 61 percent of our employees worked in field roles and 39 percent worked in supportshared services roles no employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement 

to recruit and hire individuals with a variety of skills talents backgrounds and experiences we value and cultivate our strong relationships with hundreds of community and diversity outreach sources we also target jobs fairs including those focused on minority veteran and women candidates and partner with local colleges and universities to identify and recruit qualified applicants in each of the cities and towns we serve over the last five calendar years we hired over 2000 employees our culture is also reflected in our employee benefits the physical mental and financial health of our employees and their families is a top priority for the company which is why we have a strong competitive benefits program to help employees and their families manage and protect their health wealth and time 

we perform succession planning annually to ensure that we develop and sustain a strong bench of talent capable of performing at the highest levels not only is talent identified but potential paths of development are discussed to ensure that employees have an opportunity to build their skills and are wellprepared for future roles the strength of our succession planning process is evident through our long history of promoting our leaders from within the organization

 item 1a risk factors tableend

our financial and operating results are subject to a number of risk factors many of which are not within our control investors should carefully consider the following discussion of risk factors as well as other information appearing in this report these factors include the following which are organized by category 

regulatory and legislative risks 

we are subject to federal state and local regulations that affect our operations and financial results 

we are subject to regulatory oversight from various federal state and local regulatory authorities in the eight states that we serve therefore our returns are continuously monitored and are subject to challenge for their reasonableness by the appropriate regulatory authorities or other thirdparty intervenors in the normal course of business as a regulated entity we often need to place assets in service and establish historical test periods before rate cases that seek to adjust our allowed returns to recover that investment can be filed further the regulatory review process can be lengthy in the context of traditional ratemaking because of this process we suffer the negative financial effects of having placed assets in service without the benefit of rate relief which is commonly referred to as “regulatory lag” 

regulatory authorities in the states we serve have approved various infrastructure and annual rate adjustment mechanisms to effectively reduce the regulatory lag inherent in the ratemaking process regulatory lag could significantly increase if the regulatory authorities modify or terminate these rate mechanisms the regulatory process also involves the risk that regulatory authorities may i review our purchases of natural gas and adjust the amount of our gas costs that we pass through to our customers or ii limit or disallow the costs we may have incurred from our cost of service that can be recovered from customers 

we are also subject to laws regulations and other legal requirements enacted or adopted by federal state and local governmental authorities relating to protection of the environment and health and safety matters including those that govern discharges of substances into the air and water the management and disposal of hazardous substances and waste the cleanup of contaminated sites groundwater quality and availability plant and wildlife protection as well as work practices related to employee health and safety environmental legislation also requires that our facilities sites and other properties associated with our operations be operated maintained abandoned and reclaimed to the satisfaction of applicable regulatory authorities failure to comply with these laws regulations permits and licenses may expose us to fines penalties or interruptions in our operations that could be significant to our financial results in addition existing environmental regulations may be revised or our operations may become subject to new regulations 

some of our operations are subject to increased federal regulatory oversight that could affect our operations and financial results 

ferc has regulatory authority over some of our operations including the use and release of interstate pipeline and storage capacity ferc has adopted rules designed to prevent market power abuse and market manipulation and to promote compliance with ferc’s other rules policies and orders by companies engaged in the sale purchase transportation or storage of natural 

gas in interstate commerce these rules carry increased penalties for violations although we have taken steps to structure current and future transactions to comply with applicable current ferc regulations changes in ferc regulations or their interpretation by ferc or additional regulations issued by ferc in the future could also adversely affect our business financial condition or financial results 

we may experience increased federal state and local regulation of the safety of our operations 

the safety and protection of the public our customers and our employees is our top priority we constantly monitor and maintain our pipeline and distribution systems to ensure that natural gas is delivered safely reliably and efficiently through our network of more than 75000 miles of distribution and transmission lines as in recent years natural gas distribution and pipeline companies are continuing to encounter increasing federal state and local oversight of the safety of their operations although we believe these are costs ultimately recoverable through our rates the costs of complying with new laws and regulations may have at least a shortterm adverse impact on our operating costs and financial results 

operational risks 

we may incur significant costs and liabilities resulting from pipeline integrity and other similar programs and related repairs 

phmsa requires pipeline operators to develop integrity management programs to comprehensively evaluate certain areas along their pipelines and to take additional measures to protect pipeline segments located in “high consequence areas” where a leak or rupture could potentially do the most harm as a pipeline operator the company is required to 

• perform ongoing assessments of pipeline integrity 

• identify and characterize applicable threats to pipeline segments that could impact a “high consequence area” 

• improve data collection integration and analysis 

• repair and remediate the pipeline as necessary and 

• implement preventative and mitigating actions 

the company incurs significant costs associated with its compliance with existing phmsa and comparable state regulations although we believe these are costs ultimately recoverable through our rates the costs of complying with new laws and regulations may have at least a shortterm adverse impact on our operating costs and financial results for example the adoption of new regulations requiring more comprehensive or stringent safety standards could require installation of new or modified safety controls new capital projects or accelerated maintenance programs all of which could require a potentially significant increase in operating costs 

distributing transporting and storing natural gas involve risks that may result in accidents and additional operating costs 

our operations involve a number of hazards and operating risks inherent in storing and transporting natural gas that could affect the public safety and reliability of our distribution system while atmos energy with the support from each of its regulatory commissions is accelerating the replacement of pipeline infrastructure operating issues such as leaks accidents equipment problems and incidents including explosions and fire could result in legal liability repair and remediation costs increased operating costs significant increased capital expenditures regulatory fines and penalties and other costs and a loss of customer confidence we maintain liability and property insurance coverage in place for many of these hazards and risks however because some of our transmission pipeline and storage facilities are near or are in populated areas any loss of human life or adverse financial results resulting from such events could be large if these events were not fully covered by our general liability and property insurance which policies are subject to certain limits and deductibles our operations or financial results could be adversely affected 

if contracted gas supplies interstate pipeline andor storage services are not available or delivered in a timely manner our ability to meet our customers’ natural gas requirements may be impaired and our financial condition may be adversely affected 

in order to meet our customers’ annual and seasonal natural gas demands we must obtain a sufficient supply of natural gas interstate pipeline capacity and storage capacity if we are unable to obtain these either from our suppliers’ inability to deliver the contracted commodity or the inability to secure replacement quantities our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected if a substantial disruption to or reduction in interstate natural gas pipelines’ transmission and storage capacity occurred due to operational failures or disruptions legislative or regulatory actions hurricanes tornadoes floods extreme cold weather terrorist or cyberattacks or acts of war our operations or financial results could be adversely affected 

our operations are subject to increased competition 

in residential and commercial customer markets our distribution operations compete with other energy products such as electricity and propane our primary product competition is with electricity for heating water heating and cooking increases in the price of natural gas could negatively impact our competitive position by decreasing the price benefits of natural gas to the consumer this could adversely impact our business if our customer growth slows or if our customers further conserve their use of gas resulting in reduced gas purchases and customer billings 

in the case of industrial customers such as manufacturing plants adverse economic conditions including higher gas costs could cause these customers to use alternative sources of energy such as electricity or bypass our systems in favor of special competitive contracts with lower perunit costs our pipeline and storage operations historically have faced limited competition from other existing intrastate pipelines and gas marketers seeking to provide or arrange transportation storage and other services for customers however in the last few years several new pipelines have been completed which has increased the level of competition in this segment of our business 

failure to attract and retain a qualified workforce could adversely affect our results of operations 

the competition for talent has become increasingly intense and we may experience increased employee turnover due to a tightening labor market if we are unable to recruit and retain an appropriately qualified workforce the company could encounter operating challenges primarily due to a loss of institutional knowledge and expertise errors due to inexperience or the lengthy time period typically required to adequately train replacement personnel in addition higher costs could result from loss of productivity increased safety compliance issues or cost of contract labor 

additionally our ability to operate is contingent on maintaining a healthy workforce and a safe working environment as a provider of essential services we have an obligation to provide natural gas services to customers incidents of covid19 or any other future pandemic in our workforce could challenge the availability of our workforce which could threaten the continuity of our business operations 

natural disasters terrorist activities or other significant events could adversely affect our operations or financial results 

natural disasters are always a threat to our assets and operations in addition the threat of terrorist activities could lead to increased economic instability and volatility in the price of natural gas that could affect our operations also companies in our industry may face a heightened risk of exposure to actual acts of terrorism which could subject our operations to increased risks as a result the availability of insurance covering such risks may become more limited which could increase the risk that an event could adversely affect our operations or financial results 

technology and cybersecurity risks 

increased dependence on technology may hinder the company’s business operations and adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations if such technologies fail 

over the last several years the company has implemented or acquired a variety of technological tools including both companyowned information technology and technological services provided by outside parties these tools and systems support critical functions including scheduling and dispatching of service technicians automated meter reading systems customer care and billing operational plant logistics management reporting and external financial reporting the failure of these or other similarly important technologies or the company’s inability to have these technologies supported updated expanded or integrated into other technologies could hinder its business operations and adversely impact its financial condition and results of operations 

although the company has when possible developed alternative sources of technology and built redundancy into its computer networks and tools there can be no assurance that these efforts would protect against all potential issues related to the loss of any such technologies 

cyberattacks or acts of cyberterrorism could disrupt our business operations and information technology systems or result in the loss or exposure of confidential or sensitive customer employee or company information 

our business operations and information technology systems may be vulnerable to an attack by individuals or organizations intending to disrupt our business operations and information technology systems even though the company has implemented policies procedures and controls to prevent and detect these activities we use our information technology systems to manage our distribution and intrastate pipeline and storage operations and other business processes disruption of those systems could adversely impact our ability to safely deliver natural gas to our customers operate our pipeline and storage systems or serve our customers timely accordingly if such an attack or act of terrorism were to occur our operations and financial results could be adversely affected 

in addition we use our information technology systems to protect confidential or sensitive customer employee and company information developed and maintained in the normal course of our business any attack on such systems that would 

result in the unauthorized release of customer employee or other confidential or sensitive data could have a material adverse effect on our business reputation increase our costs and expose us to additional material legal claims and liability even though we have insurance coverage in place for many of these cyberrelated risks if such an attack or act of terrorism were to occur our operations and financial results could be adversely affected to the extent not fully covered by such insurance coverage 

compliance with and changes in cybersecurity requirements have a cost and operational impact on our business and failure to comply with such laws and regulations could adversely impact our reputation results of operations financial condition andor cash flows 

as cyberattacks are becoming more sophisticated us government warnings have indicated that critical infrastructure assets including pipeline infrastructure may be specifically targeted by certain groups in 2021 the transportation security administration tsa announced two new security directives in response to a ransomware attack on the colonial pipeline that occurred earlier in the year these directives require critical pipeline owners to comply with mandatory reporting measures designate a cybersecurity coordinator provide vulnerability assessments and ensure compliance with certain cybersecurity requirements such directives or other requirements may require expenditure of significant additional resources to respond to cyberattacks to continue to modify or enhance protective measures or to assess investigate and remediate any critical infrastructure security vulnerabilities any failure to comply with such government regulations or failure in our cybersecurity protective measures may result in enforcement actions that may have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition in addition there is no certainty that costs incurred related to securing against threats will be recovered through rates 

climate risks 

adverse weather conditions could affect our operations or financial results 

we have weathernormalized rates for approximately 96 percent of our residential and commercial revenues in our distribution operations which substantially mitigates the adverse effects of warmerthannormal weather for meters in those service areas however there is no assurance that we will continue to receive such regulatory protection from adverse weather in our rates in the future the loss of such weathernormalized rates could have an adverse effect on our operations and financial results in addition our operating results may continue to vary somewhat with the actual temperatures during the winter heating season additionally sustained cold weather could challenge our ability to adequately meet customer demand in our operations 

greenhouse gas emissions or other legislation or regulations intended to address climate change could increase our operating costs adversely affecting our financial results growth cash flows and results of operations 

six of the eight states in which we operate have passed legislation to block attempts by local governments to limit the types of energy available to customers however federal regional andor state legislative andor regulatory initiatives may attempt to control or limit the causes of climate change including greenhouse gas emissions such as carbon dioxide and methane such laws or regulations could impose costs tied to greenhouse gas emissions operational requirements or restrictions or additional charges to fund energy efficiency activities they could also provide a cost advantage to alternative energy sources impose costs or restrictions on end users of natural gas or result in other costs or requirements such as costs associated with the adoption of new infrastructure and technology to respond to new mandates the focus on climate change could adversely impact the reputation of fossil fuel products or services the occurrence of the foregoing events could put upward pressure on the cost of natural gas relative to other energy sources increase our costs and the prices we charge to customers reduce the demand for natural gas or cause fuel switching to other energy sources and impact the competitive position of natural gas and the ability to serve new or existing customers adversely affecting our business results of operations and cash flows 

the operations and financial results of the company could be adversely impacted as a result of climate change 

as climate change occurs our businesses could be adversely impacted to the extent climate change results in temperatures that differ materially from temperatures we are currently experiencing financial results could be adversely affected through lower gas volumes and revenues climate change could also cause shifts in population including customers moving away from our service territories 

it could also result in more frequent and more severe weather events such as hurricanes and tornadoes which could increase our costs to repair damaged facilities and restore service to our customers or impact the cost of gas if we were unable to deliver natural gas to our customers our financial results would be impacted by lost revenues and we generally would have to seek approval from regulators to recover restoration costs to the extent we would be unable to recover those costs or if higher rates resulting from our recovery of such costs would result in reduced demand for our services our future business financial condition or financial results could be adversely impacted 

financial economic and market risks 

our growth in the future may be limited by the nature of our business which requires extensive capital spending 

our operations are capitalintensive we must make significant capital expenditures on a longterm basis to modernize our distribution and transmission system and to comply with the safety rules and regulations issued by the regulatory authorities responsible for the service areas we operate in addition we must continually build new capacity to serve the growing needs of the communities we serve the magnitude of these expenditures may be affected by a number of factors including new regulations the general state of the economy and weather 

the liquidity required to fund our working capital capital expenditures and other cash needs is provided from a combination of internally generated cash flows and external debt and equity financing the cost and availability of borrowing funds from third party lenders or issuing equity is dependent on the liquidity of the credit markets interest rates and other market conditions this in turn may limit the amount of funds we can invest in our infrastructure 

the company is dependent on continued access to the credit and capital markets to execute our business strategy 

our longterm debt is currently rated as “investment grade” by standard  poor’s corporation and moody’s investors service inc similar to most companies we rely upon access to both shortterm and longterm credit and capital markets to satisfy our liquidity requirements if adverse credit conditions were to cause a significant limitation on our access to the private credit and public capital markets we could see a reduction in our liquidity a significant reduction in our liquidity could in turn trigger a negative change in our ratings outlook or even a reduction in our credit ratings by one or more of the credit rating agencies such a downgrade could further limit our access to private credit andor public capital markets and increase our costs of borrowing 

while we believe we can meet our capital requirements from our operations and the sources of financing available to us we can provide no assurance that we will continue to be able to do so in the future especially if the market price of natural gas increases significantly the future effects on our business liquidity and financial results of a deterioration of current conditions in the credit and capital markets could be material and adverse to us both in the ways described above or in other ways that we do not currently anticipate 

we are exposed to market risks that are beyond our control which could adversely affect our financial results 

we are subject to market risks beyond our control including i commodity price volatility caused by market supply and demand dynamics counterparty performance or counterparty creditworthiness and ii interest rate risk we are generally insulated from commodity price risk through our purchased gas cost mechanisms with respect to interest rate risk increases in interest rates could adversely affect our future financial results to the extent that we do not recover our actual interest expense in our rates 

the concentration of our operations in the state of texas exposes our operations and financial results to economic conditions weather patterns and regulatory decisions in texas 

approximately 70 percent of our consolidated operations are located in the state of texas this concentration of our business in texas means that our operations and financial results may be significantly affected by changes in the texas economy in general weather patterns and regulatory decisions by state and local regulatory authorities in texas 

a deterioration in economic conditions could adversely affect our customers and negatively impact our financial results 

any adverse changes in economic conditions in the states in which we operate could adversely affect the financial resources of many domestic households as a result our customers could seek to use less gas and it may be more difficult for them to pay their gas bills this would likely lead to slower collections and higher than normal levels of accounts receivable this in turn could increase our financing requirements additionally should economic conditions deteriorate our industrial customers could seek alternative energy sources which could result in lower transportation volumes 

increased gas costs could adversely impact our customer base and customer collections and increase our level of indebtedness 

rapid increases in the costs of purchased gas would cause us to experience a significant increase in shortterm or longterm debt we must pay suppliers for gas when it is purchased which can be significantly in advance of when these costs may be recovered through the collection of monthly customer bills for gas delivered increases in purchased gas costs also slow our natural gas distribution collections as customers are more likely to delay the payment of their gas bills leading to higher than normal accounts receivable this could result in higher shortterm debt levels greater collection efforts and increased bad debt expense 

the costs of providing health care benefits pension and postretirement health care benefits and related funding requirements may increase substantially 

we provide health care benefits a cashbalance pension plan and postretirement health care benefits to eligible fulltime employees the costs of providing health care benefits to our employees could significantly increase over time due to rapidly increasing health care inflation and any future legislative changes related to the provision of health care benefits the impact of additional costs which are likely to be passed on to the company is difficult to measure at this time 

the costs of providing a cashbalance pension plan to eligible fulltime employees prior to 2011 and postretirement health care benefits to eligible fulltime employees and related funding requirements could be influenced by changes in the market value of the assets funding our pension and postretirement health care plans any significant declines in the value of these investments due to sustained declines in equity markets or a reduction in bond yields could increase the costs of our pension and postretirement health care plans and related funding requirements in the future further our costs of providing such benefits and related funding requirements are also subject to a number of factors including i changing demographics including longer life expectancy of beneficiaries and an expected increase in the number of eligible former employees over the next five to ten years ii various actuarial calculations and assumptions which may differ materially from actual results due primarily to changing market and economic conditions including changes in interest rates and higher or lower withdrawal rates and iii future government regulation 

the costs to the company of providing these benefits and related funding requirements could also increase materially in the future should there be a material reduction in the amount of the recovery of these costs through our rates or should significant delays develop in the timing of the recovery of such costs which could adversely affect our financial results

critical accounting policies 

our consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and the related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ from estimates 

our significant accounting policies are discussed in note 2 to our consolidated financial statements the accounting policies discussed below are both important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and require management to make difficult subjective or complex accounting estimates accordingly these critical accounting policies are reviewed periodically by the audit committee of the board of directors 





nongaap financial measures 

as described further in note 14 to the consolidated financial statements due to the passage of kansas house bill 2585 we remeasured our deferred tax liability and updated our state deferred tax rate as a result we recorded a noncash income tax benefit of 210 million for the fiscal year ended september 30 2020 due to the nonrecurring nature of this benefit we believe that net income and diluted net income per share before the noncash income tax benefit provide a more relevant measure to analyze our financial performance than net income and diluted net income per share in order to allow investors to better analyze our core results and allow the information to be presented on a comparative basis accordingly the following discussion and analysis of our financial performance will reference adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share nongaap measures which are calculated as follows 



results of operations 

overview 

atmos energy strives to operate its businesses safely and reliably while delivering superior shareholder value our commitment to modernizing our natural gas distribution and transmission systems requires a significant level of capital spending we have the ability to begin recovering a significant portion of these investments timely through rate designs and mechanisms that reduce or eliminate regulatory lag and separate the recovery of our approved rate from customer usage patterns the execution of our capital spending program the ability to recover these investments timely and our ability to access the capital markets to satisfy our financing needs are the primary drivers that affect our financial performance 

the following table details our consolidated net income by segment during the last three fiscal years 



during fiscal 2022 we recorded net income of 7744 million or 560 per diluted share compared to net income of 6656 million or 512 per diluted share in the prior year the yearoveryear increase in net income of 1088 million largely reflects positive rate outcomes driven by safety and reliability spending and distribution customer growth partially offset by an increase in employee related costs increased spending on system maintenance activities and an increase in depreciation expense and property taxes associated with increased capital investments 

during the year ended september 30 2022 we implemented ratemaking regulatory actions which resulted in an increase in annual operating income of 1749 million excluding the impact of the refund of excess deferred income taxes resulting from previously enacted tax reform legislation our total fiscal 2022 rate outcomes were 2156 million additionally we had ratemaking efforts in progress at september 30 2022 seeking a total increase in annual operating income of 1445 million 

during fiscal year 2022 we refunded 1678 million in excess deferred tax liabilities to customers the refunds reduced operating income and reduced our annual effective income tax rate to 91 in fiscal 2022 compared with 188 in fiscal 2021 

capital expenditures for fiscal 2022 were 24 billion over 85 percent was invested to improve the safety and reliability of our distribution and transportation systems with a significant portion of this investment incurred under regulatory mechanisms that reduce regulatory lag to six months or less 

during fiscal 2022 we completed approximately 16 billion of longterm debt and equity financing as of september 30 2022 our equity capitalization was 536 percent excluding the 22 billion of incremental financing issued in conjunction with winter storm uri our equity capitalization was 613 percent as of september 30 2022 we had approximately 31 billion in total liquidity consisting of 516 million in cash and cash equivalents 7766 million in funds available through equity forward sales agreements and 23094 million in undrawn capacity under our credit facilities 

as a result of the continued stability of our earnings cash flows and capital structure our board of directors increased the quarterly dividend by 88 percent for fiscal 2023 

distribution segment 

the distribution segment is primarily comprised of our regulated natural gas distribution and related sales operations in eight states the primary factors that impact the results of our distribution operations are our ability to earn our authorized rates of return competitive factors in the energy industry and economic conditions in our service areas 

our ability to earn our authorized rates is based primarily on our ability to improve the rate design in our various ratemaking jurisdictions to minimize regulatory lag and ultimately separate the recovery of our approved rates from customer usage patterns improving rate design is a longterm process and is further complicated by the fact that we operate in multiple rate jurisdictions the “ratemaking activity” section of this form 10k describes our current rate strategy progress towards implementing that strategy and recent ratemaking initiatives in more detail during fiscal 2022 we completed regulatory proceedings in our distribution segment resulting in a 962 million increase in annual operating income excluding the impact of the refund of excess deferred income taxes resulting from previously enacted tax reform legislation our total fiscal 2022 annualized rate outcomes in our distribution segment were 1368 million 

our distribution operations are also affected by the cost of natural gas we are generally able to pass the cost of gas through to our customers without markup under purchased gas cost adjustment mechanisms therefore increases in the cost of gas are offset by a corresponding increase in revenues revenues in our texas and mississippi service areas include franchise fees and gross receipts taxes which are calculated as a percentage of revenue inclusive of gas costs therefore the amount of these taxes included in revenues is influenced by the cost of gas and the level of gas sales volumes we record the associated tax expense as a component of taxes other than income 

the cost of gas typically does not have a direct impact on our operating income because these costs are recovered through our purchased gas cost adjustment mechanisms however higher gas costs may adversely impact our accounts receivable collections resulting in higher bad debt expense this risk is currently mitigated by rate design that allows us to collect from our customers the gas cost portion of our bad debt expense on approximately 81 percent of our residential and commercial revenues additionally higher gas costs may require us to increase borrowings under our credit facilities resulting in higher interest expense finally higher gas costs as well as competitive factors in the industry and general economic conditions may cause customers to conserve or in the case of industrial consumers to use alternative energy sources 

review of financial and operating results 

financial and operational highlights for our distribution segment for the fiscal years ended september 30 2022 2021 and 2020 are presented below 



1 see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for further information 

fiscal year ended september 30 2022 compared with fiscal year ended september 30 2021 

operating income for our distribution segment decreased two percent increased refunds of excess deferred taxes to customers decreased yearoveryear operating income 985 million and reduced the effective income tax rate for this segment to 71 compared to 206 in the prior year additional key drivers for the change in operating income include 

• a 1499 million increase in rate adjustments primarily in our midtex west texas and louisiana divisions 

• a 152 million increase due to an increase in the number of customers served primarily in our midtex division 

• a 249 million decrease in bad debt expense primarily due to the resumption of collection activities in late fiscal 2021 following the expiration of pandemicrelated collection moratoriums 

partially offset by 

• a 504 million increase in depreciation expense and property taxes associated with increased capital investments 

• a 173 million decrease in consumption net of wna primarily due to the decline in residential consumption during the second fiscal quarter 

• an 88 million increase in system maintenance and related activities 

• a 255 million increase in employee related costs driven by increased headcount increased number of service orders performed and higher benefits costs 

• an 89 million increase in insurance premiums 

the yearoveryear change in other nonoperating income expense of 276 million primarily reflects lower nonservice costs related to our postretirement medical plan partially offset by an increase in unrealized losses on equity investments interest charges increased 133 million due to the issuance of longterm debt during fiscal 2022 and interest expense recognized in fiscal 2022 related to debt incurred as a result of winter storm uri as described in note 9 to the consolidated financial statements interest related to the incremental financing incurred as a result of winter storm uri was deferred through december 31 2021 pursuant to a regulatory order issued by the state of texas 

the fiscal year ended september 30 2021 compared with fiscal year ended september 30 2020 for our distribution segment is described in item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of our annual report on form 10k for the fiscal year ended september 30 2021 

the following table shows our operating income by distribution division in order of total rate base for the fiscal years ended september 30 2022 2021 and 2020 the presentation of our distribution operating income is included for financial reporting purposes and may not be appropriate for ratemaking purposes 



pipeline and storage segment 

our pipeline and storage segment consists of the pipeline and storage operations of our atmos pipeline–texas division apt and our natural gas transmission operations in louisiana apt is one of the largest intrastate pipeline operations in texas with a heavy concentration in the established natural gas producing areas of central northern and eastern texas extending into or near the major producing areas of the barnett shale the texas gulf coast and the permian basin of west texas apt provides transportation and storage services to our midtex division other thirdparty local distribution companies industrial and electric generation customers as well as marketers and producers over 80 percent of this segments revenues are derived from these services as part of its pipeline operations apt owns and operates five underground storage facilities in texas 

our natural gas transmission operations in louisiana are comprised of a 21mile pipeline located in the new orleans louisiana area that is primarily used to aggregate gas supply for our distribution division in louisiana under a longterm contract and on a more limited basis to third parties the demand fee charged to our louisiana distribution division for these services is subject to regulatory approval by the louisiana public service commission we also manage two asset management plans which have been approved by applicable state regulatory commissions generally these asset management plans require us to share with our distribution customers a significant portion of the cost savings earned from these arrangements 

our pipeline and storage segment is impacted by seasonal weather patterns competitive factors in the energy industry and economic conditions in our texas and louisiana service areas natural gas prices do not directly impact the results of this segment as revenues are derived from the transportation and storage of natural gas however natural gas prices and demand for natural gas could influence the level of drilling activity in the supply areas that we serve which may influence the level of throughput we may be able to transport on our pipelines further natural gas price differences between the various hubs that we serve in texas could influence the volumes of gas transported for shippers through our texas pipeline system and rates for such transportation 

the results of apt are also significantly impacted by the natural gas requirements of its local distribution company customers additionally its operations may be impacted by the timing of when costs and expenses are incurred and when these costs and expenses are recovered through its tariffs 

apt annually uses grip to recover capital costs incurred in the prior calendar year on february 11 2022 apt made a grip filing that covered changes in net property plant and equipment investment from january 1 2021 through december 31 2021 with a requested increase in operating income of 788 million on may 18 2022 the texas railroad commission approved the companys grip filing 

the demand fee our louisiana natural gas transmission pipeline charges to our louisiana distribution division increases five percent annually and has been approved by the louisiana public service commission until september 30 2027 

review of financial and operating results 

financial and operational highlights for our pipeline and storage segment for the fiscal years ended september 30 2022 2021 and 2020 are presented below 



1 see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for further information 

fiscal year ended september 30 2022 compared with fiscal year ended september 30 2021 

operating income for our pipeline and storage segment increased 10 percent increased refunds of excess deferred taxes to customers decreased yearoveryear operating income by 133 million and reduced the effective income tax rate for this segment to 131 compared to 149 in the prior year additional drivers for the change in operating income include 

• a 704 million increase due to rate adjustments from grip filings approved in may 2021 and 2022 the increase in rates was driven by increased safety and reliability spending 

partially offset by 

• an 84 million increase in system maintenance expense primarily due to spending on hydrostatic testing 

• a 154 million increase in depreciation expense and property taxes associated with increased capital investments 

the yearoveryear change in other nonoperating income and interest charges of 23 million reflects increased allowance for funds used during construction afudc primarily due to increased capital spending partially offset by an increase in interest expense due to the issuance of longterm debt during fiscal 2022 

the fiscal year ended september 30 2021 compared with fiscal year ended september 30 2020 for our pipeline and storage segment is described in item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of our annual report on form 10k for the fiscal year ended september 30 2021 

inflation reduction act of 2022 

in august 2022 the us government enacted the inflation reduction act of 2022 the inflation reduction act into law the inflation reduction act includes a new corporate alternative minimum tax the corporate amt of 15 on the adjusted financial statement income afsi of corporations with average afsi exceeding 10 billion over a threeyear period we currently anticipate this tax will apply to us within the next four to five years the impact on our financial position results of operations and cash flows is dependent on future guidance from the us government also the inflation reduction act imposes a methane emissions charge for methane emissions in excess of 25000 metric tons carbon dioxide equivalent per year based on our preliminary evaluation of the regulations we currently do not anticipate this provision of the inflation reduction act will have a material impact on our financial position results of operations or cash flows additionally the inflation 

reduction act imposes an excise tax of 1 tax on the fair market value of net stock repurchases made after december 31 2022 the impact of this provision will be dependent on the extent of share repurchases made in future periods 

liquidity and capital resources 

the liquidity required to fund our working capital capital expenditures and other cash needs is provided from a combination of internally generated cash flows and external debt and equity financing additionally we have a 15 billion commercial paper program and four committed revolving credit facilities with 25 billion in total availability from thirdparty lenders the commercial paper program and credit facilities provide costeffective shortterm financing until it can be replaced with a balance of longterm debt and equity financing that achieves the companys desired capital structure with an equitytototalcapitalization ratio between 50 and 60 inclusive of longterm and shortterm debt additionally we have various uncommitted trade credit lines with our gas suppliers that we utilize to purchase natural gas on a monthly basis 

we have a shelf registration statement on file with the securities and exchange commission sec that allows us to issue up to 50 billion in common stock andor debt securities as of the date of this report approximately 14 billion of securities remained available for issuance under the shelf registration statement which expires june 29 2024 

we also have an atthemarket atm equity sales program that allows us to issue and sell shares of our common stock up to an aggregate offering price of 10 billion including shares of common stock that may be sold pursuant to forward sale agreements entered into in connection with the atm equity sales program which expires june 29 2024 at september 30 2022 approximately 4817 million of equity is available for issuance under this atm equity sales program additionally as of september 30 2022 we had 7766 million in available proceeds from outstanding forward sale agreements 

on september 27 2022 we settled 500 million of forward starting interest rate swaps associated with a planned debt issuance that was completed on october 3 2022 the following table summarizes our existing forward starting interest rate swaps as of september 30 2022 



the liquidity provided by these sources is expected to be sufficient to fund the companys working capital needs and capital expenditures program additionally we expect to continue to be able to obtain financing upon reasonable terms as necessary 

the following table presents our capitalization as of september 30 2022 and 2021 



1 inclusive of our finance leases 

2 excluding the 22 billion of incremental financing issued to pay for the purchased gas costs incurred during winter storm uri our equity capitalization ratio would have been 613 and 606 at september 30 2022 and 2021 

cash flows 

our internally generated funds may change in the future due to a number of factors some of which we cannot control these factors include regulatory changes the price for our services the demand for such products and services margin requirements resulting from significant changes in commodity prices operational risks and other factors 

cash flows from operating investing and financing activities for the years ended september 30 2022 2021 and 2020 are presented below 



cash flows for the fiscal year ended september 30 2021 compared with fiscal year ended september 30 2020 is described in item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of our annual report on form 10k for the fiscal year ended september 30 2021 

cash flows from operating activities 

for the fiscal year ended september 30 2022 cash flow provided by operating activities was 9776 million compared with cash flow used in operating activities of 11 billion in the prior year fiscal 2021 operating cash flow included 21 billion of cash paid for gas costs incurred during winter storm uri excluding this cash outflow operating cash flow in fiscal 2021 was 9961 million the yearoveryear decrease in operating cash flow reflects the refund of excess deferred tax liabilities increased purchases of gas stored underground and the timing of gas cost recoveries partially offset by increased customer collections and the positive effects of successful rate case outcomes achieved in fiscal 2021 and 2022 

cash flows from investing activities 

our capital expenditures are primarily used to improve the safety and reliability of our distribution and transmission system through pipeline replacement and system modernization and to enhance and expand our system to meet customer needs over the last three fiscal years approximately 88 percent of our capital spending has been committed to improving the safety and reliability of our system 

for the fiscal year ended september 30 2022 we had 24 billion in capital expenditures compared with 20 billion for the fiscal year ended september 30 2021 capital spending increased by 4749 million or 24 percent as a result of planned increases to modernize our system 

cash flows from financing activities 

our financing activities provided 14 billion and 31 billion in cash for fiscal years 2022 and 2021 

during the fiscal year ended september 30 2022 we received 16 billion in net proceeds from the issuance of longterm debt and equity we completed a public offering of 600 million of 285 senior notes due 2052 we also completed a public offering of 200 million of 2625 senior notes due 2029 that were used to repay our 200 million floatingrate term loan additionally during the year ended september 30 2022 we settled 7907833 shares that had been sold on a forward basis for net proceeds of 7768 million the net proceeds were used primarily to support capital spending and for other general corporate purposes we also received 1971 million from the settlement of forward starting interest rate swaps related to a debt issuance completed in october 2022 additionally cash dividends increased due to an 88 percent increase in our dividend rate and an increase in shares outstanding

the following table shows the number of shares issued for the fiscal years ended september 30 2022 2021 and 2020 



1 share amounts do not include shares issued under forward sale agreements until the shares have been settled 

credit ratings 

our credit ratings directly affect our ability to obtain shortterm and longterm financing in addition to the cost of such financing in determining our credit ratings the rating agencies consider a number of quantitative factors including but not limited to debt to total capitalization operating cash flow relative to outstanding debt operating cash flow coverage of interest and operating cash flow less dividends to debt in addition the rating agencies consider qualitative factors such as consistency of our earnings over time the risks associated with our business and the regulatory structures that govern our rates in the states where we operate 

our debt is rated by two rating agencies standard  poor’s corporation sp and moody’s investors service moody’s as a result of the impacts of winter storm uri during the second quarter of fiscal 2021 sp lowered our longterm and shortterm credit ratings by one notch and placed our ratings under negative outlook additionally moodys placed our ratings under negative outlook in february 2022 moody’s reaffirmed its longterm and shortterm credit ratings and revised our outlook from negative to stable 

as of september 30 2022 our outlook and current debt ratings which are all considered investment grade are as follows 



a significant degradation in our operating performance or a significant reduction in our liquidity caused by more limited access to the private and public credit markets as a result of deteriorating global or national financial and credit conditions could trigger a negative change in our ratings outlook or even a reduction in our credit ratings by the two credit rating agencies this would mean more limited access to the private and public credit markets and an increase in the costs of such borrowings

risk management activities 

in our distribution and pipeline and storage segments we use a combination of physical storage fixed physical contracts and fixed financial contracts to reduce our exposure to unusually large winterperiod gas price increases additionally we manage interest rate risk by entering into financial instruments to effectively fix the treasury yield component of the interest cost associated with anticipated financings 

we record our financial instruments as a component of risk management assets and liabilities which are classified as current or noncurrent based upon the anticipated settlement date of the underlying financial instrument substantially all of our financial instruments are valued using external market quotes and indices 

the following table shows the components of the change in fair value of our financial instruments for the fiscal year ended september 30 2022 in thousands

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend

we are exposed to risks associated with commodity prices and interest rates commodity price risk is the potential loss that we may incur as a result of changes in the fair value of a particular instrument or commodity interestrate risk is the potential increased cost we could incur when we issue debt instruments or to provide financing and liquidity for our business activities additionally interestrate risk could affect our ability to issue cost effective equity instruments 

we conduct risk management activities in our distribution and pipeline and storage segments in our distribution segment we use a combination of physical storage fixedprice forward contracts and financial instruments primarily overthecounter swap and option contracts in an effort to minimize the impact of natural gas price volatility on our customers during the winter heating season our risk management activities and related accounting treatment are described in further detail in note 15 to the consolidated financial statements additionally our earnings are affected by changes in shortterm interest rates as a result of our issuance of shortterm commercial paper and our other shortterm borrowings 

commodity price risk 

we purchase natural gas for our distribution operations substantially all of the costs of gas purchased for distribution operations are recovered from our customers through purchased gas cost adjustment mechanisms therefore our distribution operations have limited commodity price risk exposure 

interest rate risk 

our earnings are exposed to changes in shortterm interest rates associated with our shortterm commercial paper program and other shortterm borrowings we use a sensitivity analysis to estimate our shortterm interest rate risk for purposes of this analysis we estimate our shortterm interest rate risk as the difference between our actual interest expense for the period and estimated interest expense for the period assuming a hypothetical average one percent increase in the interest rates associated with our shortterm borrowings had interest rates associated with our shortterm borrowings increased by an average of one percent our interest expense would not have materially increased during 2022

 item 1 business tableend

overview and strategy 

atmos energy corporation headquartered in dallas texas and incorporated in texas and virginia is the country’s largest naturalgasonly distributor based on number of customers we safely deliver reliable affordable efficient and abundant natural gas through regulated sales and transportation arrangements to over three million residential commercial public authority and industrial customers in eight states located primarily in the south we also operate one of the largest intrastate pipelines in texas based on miles of pipe 

atmos energys vision is to be the safest provider of natural gas services we intend to achieve this vision by 

• operating our business exceptionally well 

• investing in safety innovation and environmental sustainability and 

• achieving superior financial results 

since 2011 our operating strategy has focused on modernizing our distribution and transmission system while reducing regulatory lag this operating strategy has allowed us to increase our capital expenditures approximately 13 percent per year to improve safety and reliability and to reduce methane emissions from our system 

our core values include focusing on our employees and customers while conducting our business with honesty and integrity we continue to strengthen our culture through ongoing communications with our employees and enhanced employee training 

operating segments 

as of september 30 2021 we manage and review our consolidated operations through the following reportable segments 

• the distribution segment is primarily comprised of our regulated natural gas distribution and related sales operations in eight states 

• the pipeline and storage segment is comprised primarily of the pipeline and storage operations of our atmos pipelinetexas division and our natural gas transmission operations in louisiana 

distribution segment overview 

the following table summarizes key information about our six regulated natural gas distribution divisions presented in order of total rate base 



we operate in our service areas under terms of nonexclusive franchise agreements granted by the various cities and towns that we serve at september 30 2021 we held 1025 franchises having terms generally ranging from five to 35 years a 

significant number of our franchises expire each year which require renewal prior to the end of their terms historically we have successfully renewed these franchises and believe that we will continue to be able to renew our franchises as they expire 

revenues in this operating segment are established by regulatory authorities in the states in which we operate these rates are intended to be sufficient to cover the costs of conducting business including a reasonable return on invested capital in addition we transport natural gas for others through our distribution systems 

rates established by regulatory authorities often include cost adjustment mechanisms for costs that i are subject to significant price fluctuations compared to our other costs ii represent a large component of our cost of service and iii are generally outside our control 

purchased gas cost adjustment mechanisms represent a traditional and common form of cost adjustment mechanism purchased gas cost adjustment mechanisms provide a method of recovering purchased gas costs on an ongoing basis without filing a rate case because they provide a dollarfordollar offset to increases or decreases in the cost of natural gas therefore although substantially all of our distribution operating revenues fluctuate with the cost of gas that we purchase distribution operating income is generally not affected by fluctuations in the cost of gas 

additionally some jurisdictions have performancebased ratemaking adjustments to provide incentives to minimize purchased gas costs through improved storage management and use of financial instruments to reduce volatility in gas costs under the performancebased ratemaking adjustments purchased gas costs savings are shared between the company and its customers 

our supply of natural gas is provided by a variety of suppliers including independent producers and marketers the gas is delivered into our systems by various pipeline companies withdrawals of gas from proprietary and contracted storage assets and base load and peaking arrangements as needed 

supply arrangements consist of both base load and peaking quantities and are contracted from our suppliers on a firm basis with various terms at market prices base load quantities are those that flow at a constant level throughout the month and peaking quantities provide the flexibility to change daily quantities to match increases or decreases in requirements related to weather conditions 

except for local production purchases we select our natural gas suppliers through a competitive bidding process by periodically requesting proposals from suppliers we select these suppliers based on their ability to reliably deliver gas supply to our designated firm pipeline receipt points at the lowest reasonable cost major suppliers during fiscal 2021 were castleton commodities merchant trading lp cima energy lp concord energy llc enlink gas marketing lp etc gas marketing ltd hartree partners lp kinder morgan texas pipeline llc symmetry energy solutions llc targa gas marketing llc and twin eagle resources management llc 

the combination of base load and peaking agreements coupled with the withdrawal of gas held in storage allows us the flexibility to adjust to changes in weather which minimizes our need to enter into longterm firm commitments we estimate our peakday availability of natural gas supply to be approximately 44 bcf the peakday demand for our distribution operations in fiscal 2021 was on february 14 2021 when sales to customers reached approximately 43 bcf 

currently our distribution divisions utilize 35 pipeline transportation companies both interstate and intrastate to transport our natural gas the pipeline transportation agreements are firm and many of them have “pipeline nonotice” storage service which provides for daily balancing between system requirements and nominated flowing supplies these agreements have been negotiated with the shortest term necessary while still maintaining our right of first refusal the natural gas supply for our midtex division is delivered primarily by our apt division 

to maintain our deliveries to high priority customers we have the ability and have exercised our right to interrupt or curtail service to certain customers pursuant to contracts and applicable state regulations or statutes our customers’ demand on our system is not necessarily indicative of our ability to meet current or anticipated market demands or immediate delivery requirements because of factors such as the physical limitations of gathering storage and transmission systems the duration and severity of cold weather the availability of gas reserves from our suppliers the ability to purchase additional supplies on a shortterm basis and actions by federal and state regulatory authorities interruption and curtailment rights provide us the flexibility to meet the humanneeds requirements of our customers on a reliable basis priority allocations imposed by federal and state regulatory agencies as well as other factors beyond our control may affect our ability to meet the demands of some of our customers 

pipeline and storage segment overview 

our pipeline and storage segment consists of the pipeline and storage operations of apt and our natural gas transmission operations in louisiana apt is one of the largest intrastate pipeline operations in texas with a heavy concentration in the established natural gasproducing areas of central northern and eastern texas extending into or near the major producing areas of the barnett shale the texas gulf coast and the permian basin of west texas through its system apt provides transportation and storage services to our midtex division other third party local distribution companies industrial and 

electric generation customers marketers and producers as part of its pipeline operations apt owns and operates five underground storage reservoirs in texas 

revenues earned from transportation and storage services for apt are subject to traditional ratemaking governed by the rrc rates are updated through periodic filings made under texas’ grip grip allows us to include in our rate base annually approved capital costs incurred in the prior calendar year provided that we file a complete rate case at least once every five years the most recent of which was completed in august 2017 apt’s existing regulatory mechanisms allow certain transportation and storage services to be provided under marketbased rates 

our natural gas transmission operations in louisiana are comprised of a 21mile pipeline located in the new orleans louisiana area that is primarily used to aggregate gas supply for our distribution division in louisiana under a longterm contract and on a more limited basis to third parties the demand fee charged to our louisiana distribution division for these services is subject to regulatory approval by the louisiana public service commission we also manage two asset management plans in louisiana that serve distribution affiliates of the company which have been approved by applicable state regulatory commissions generally these asset management plans require us to share with our distribution customers a significant portion of the cost savings earned from these arrangements 

ratemaking activity 

overview 

the method of determining regulated rates varies among the states in which our regulated businesses operate the regulatory authorities have the responsibility of ensuring that utilities in their jurisdictions operate in the best interests of customers while providing utility companies the opportunity to earn a reasonable return on their investment generally each regulatory authority reviews rate requests and establishes a rate structure intended to generate revenue sufficient to cover the costs of conducting business including a reasonable return on invested capital 

our rate strategy focuses on reducing or eliminating regulatory lag obtaining adequate returns and providing stable predictable margins which benefit both our customers and the company as a result of our ratemaking efforts in recent years atmos energy has 

• formula rate mechanisms in place in four states that provide for an annual rate review and adjustment to rates 

• infrastructure programs in place in all of our states that provide for an annual adjustment to rates for qualifying capital expenditures through our annual formula rate mechanisms and infrastructure programs we have the ability to recover approximately 90 percent of our capital expenditures within six months and substantially all of our capital expenditures within twelve months 

• authorization in tariffs statute or commission rules that allows us to defer certain elements of our cost of service such as depreciation ad valorem taxes and pension costs until they are included in rates 

• wna mechanisms in seven states that serve to minimize the effects of weather on approximately 96 percent of our distribution residential and commercial revenues 

• the ability to recover the gas cost portion of bad debts in five states

5 the midtex rate base represents a “systemwide” or 100 percent of the midtex division’s rate base 

6 the midtex cities approved the formula rate mechanism filing with rates effective december 1 2021 which included a rate base of 43945 million an authorized return of 736 a debtequity ratio of 4258 and an authorized roe of 980

although substantial progress has been made in recent years to improve rate design and recovery of investment across our service areas we are continuing to seek improvements in rate design to address cost variations and pursue tariffs that reduce regulatory lag associated with investments further potential changes in federal energy policy federal safety regulations and changing economic conditions will necessitate continued vigilance by the company and our regulators in meeting the challenges presented by these external factors 

recent ratemaking activity 

the amounts described in the following sections represent the annual operating income that was requested or received in each rate filing which may not necessarily reflect the stated amount referenced in the final order as certain operating costs may have changed as a result of the commissions or other governmental authoritys final ruling the following table summarizes the annualized ratemaking outcomes we implemented in each of the last three fiscal years 



additionally the ratemaking outcomes for the rate activity in fiscal 2021 include the refund of excess deferred income taxes resulting from previously enacted tax reform legislation and do not reflect the true economic benefit of the outcomes because they do not include the corresponding income tax benefit excluding these amounts our total fiscal 2021 rate outcomes for ratemaking activities were 2262 million 

the following ratemaking efforts seeking 565 million in annual operating income were initiated during fiscal 2021 but had not been completed or implemented as of september 30 2021

our recent ratemaking activity is discussed in greater detail below 

annual formula rate mechanisms 

as an instrument to reduce regulatory lag formula rate mechanisms allow us to refresh our rates on an annual basis without filing a formal rate case however these filings still involve discovery by the appropriate regulatory authorities prior to the final determination of rates under these mechanisms we currently have specific infrastructure programs in substantially all of our distribution divisions with tariffs in place to permit the investment associated with these programs to have their surcharge rate adjusted annually to recover approved capital costs incurred in a prior testyear period the following table summarizes our annual formula rate mechanisms by state 



1 infrastructure mechanisms in texas louisiana and tennessee allow for the deferral of all expenses associated with capital expenditures incurred pursuant to these rules which primarily consists of interest depreciation and other taxes texas only until the next rate proceeding rate case or annual rate filing at which time investment and costs would be recoverable through base rates 

the following table summarizes our annual formula rate mechanisms with effective dates during the fiscal years ended september 30 2021 2020 and 2019 





1 beginning in fiscal 2020 our trans la and lgs filings were combined into one filing per commission order 

2 the rate increases for these filings were approved based on the effective dates herein however the new rates were implemented beginning september 1 2021 

3 the rate increases for our texas grip filings were approved based on the effective date herein however the new rates were implemented beginning september 1 2020

rate case filings 

a rate case is a formal request from atmos energy to a regulatory authority to increase rates that are charged to customers rate cases may also be initiated when the regulatory authorities request us to justify our rates this process is referred to as a “show cause” action adequate rates are intended to provide for recovery of the company’s costs as well as a reasonable rate of return to our shareholders and ensure that we continue to safely deliver reliable reasonably priced natural gas service to our customers 

the following table summarizes our recent rate cases 



1 the rate change for the west texas aldc filing includes 12 million related to the refund of excess deferred income taxes which will be offset by lower income tax expense excluding this amount related to the refund of excess deferred income taxes the increase to operating income for this filing was 63 million 

other ratemaking activity 

the following table summarizes other ratemaking activity during the fiscal years ended september 30 2021 2020 and 2019 



  

1 the ad valorem filing relates to property taxes that are either over or undercollected compared to the amount included in our kansas service areas base rates 

other regulation 

we are regulated by various state or local public utility authorities we are also subject to regulation by the united states department of transportation with respect to safety requirements in the operation and maintenance of our transmission and distribution facilities in addition our operations are also subject to various state and federal laws regulating environmental matters from time to time we receive inquiries regarding various environmental matters we believe that our properties and operations comply with and are operated in conformity with applicable safety and environmental statutes and regulations there are no administrative or judicial proceedings arising under environmental quality statutes pending or known to be contemplated by governmental agencies which would have a material adverse effect on us or our operations the pipeline and hazardous materials safety administration phmsa within the us department of transportation develops and enforces regulations for the safe reliable and environmentally sound operation of the pipeline transportation system the phmsa pipeline safety statutes provide for states to assume safety authority over intrastate natural transmission and distribution gas pipelines state pipeline safety programs are responsible for adopting and enforcing the federal and state pipeline safety regulations for intrastate natural gas transmission and distribution pipelines 

the federal energy regulatory commission ferc allows pursuant to section 311 of the natural gas policy act ngpa gas transportation services through our apt assets “on behalf of” interstate pipelines or local distribution companies served by interstate pipelines without subjecting these assets to the jurisdiction of the ferc under the ngpa additionally the ferc has regulatory authority over the use and release of interstate pipeline and storage capacity the ferc also has authority to detect and prevent market manipulation and to enforce compliance with ferc’s other rules policies and orders by companies engaged in the sale purchase transportation or storage of natural gas in interstate commerce we have taken what we believe are the necessary and appropriate steps to comply with these regulations 

the sec and the commodities futures trading commission pursuant to the dodd–frank act established numerous regulations relating to us financial markets we enacted procedures and modified existing business practices and contractual arrangements to comply with such regulations there are however some rulemaking proceedings that have not yet been finalized including those relating to capital and margin rules for non–cleared swaps we do not expect these rules to directly impact our business practices or collateral requirements however depending on the substance of these final rules in addition to certain international regulatory requirements still under development that are similar to dodd–frank our swap counterparties could be subject to additional and potentially significant capitalization requirements these regulations could motivate counterparties to increase our collateral requirements or cash postings 

competition 

although our regulated distribution operations are not currently in significant direct competition with any other distributors of natural gas to residential and commercial customers within our service areas we do compete with other natural gas suppliers and suppliers of alternative fuels for sales to industrial customers we compete in all aspects of our business with alternative energy sources including in particular electricity electric utilities offer electricity as a rival energy source and compete for the space heating water heating and cooking markets promotional incentives improved equipment efficiencies and promotional rates all contribute to the acceptability of electrical equipment the principal means to compete against alternative fuels is lower prices and natural gas historically has maintained its price advantage in the residential commercial and industrial markets 

our pipeline and storage operations have historically faced competition from other existing intrastate pipelines seeking to provide or arrange transportation storage and other services for customers in the last few years several new pipelines have been completed which has increased the level of competition in this segment of our business

 item 1a risk factors tableend

our financial and operating results are subject to a number of risk factors many of which are not within our control investors should carefully consider the following discussion of risk factors as well as other information appearing in this report these factors include the following which are organized by category 

regulatory and legislative risks 

we are subject to federal state and local regulations that affect our operations and financial results 

we are subject to regulatory oversight from various federal state and local regulatory authorities in the eight states that we serve therefore our returns are continuously monitored and are subject to challenge for their reasonableness by the appropriate regulatory authorities or other thirdparty intervenors in the normal course of business as a regulated entity we often need to place assets in service and establish historical test periods before rate cases that seek to adjust our allowed returns to recover that investment can be filed further the regulatory review process can be lengthy in the context of traditional ratemaking because of this process we suffer the negative financial effects of having placed assets in service without the benefit of rate relief which is commonly referred to as “regulatory lag” 

however in the last several years a number of regulatory authorities in the states we serve have approved rate mechanisms that provide for annual adjustments to rates that allow us to recover the cost of investments made to replace existing infrastructure or reflect changes in our cost of service these mechanisms work to effectively reduce the regulatory lag inherent in the ratemaking process however regulatory lag could significantly increase if the regulatory authorities modify or terminate these rate mechanisms the regulatory process also involves the risk that regulatory authorities may i review our purchases of natural gas and adjust the amount of our gas costs that we pass through to our customers or ii limit the costs we may have incurred from our cost of service that can be recovered from customers 

we are also subject to laws regulations and other legal requirements enacted or adopted by federal state and local governmental authorities relating to protection of the environment and health and safety matters including those that govern discharges of substances into the air and water the management and disposal of hazardous substances and waste the cleanup of contaminated sites groundwater quality and availability plant and wildlife protection as well as work practices related to employee health and safety environmental legislation also requires that our facilities sites and other properties associated with our operations be operated maintained abandoned and reclaimed to the satisfaction of applicable regulatory authorities failure to comply with these laws regulations permits and licenses may expose us to fines penalties or interruptions in our operations that could be significant to our financial results in addition existing environmental regulations may be revised or our operations may become subject to new regulations 

some of our operations are subject to increased federal regulatory oversight that could affect our operations and financial results 

ferc has regulatory authority over some of our operations including the use and release of interstate pipeline and storage capacity ferc has adopted rules designed to prevent market power abuse and market manipulation and to promote compliance with ferc’s other rules policies and orders by companies engaged in the sale purchase transportation or storage of natural gas in interstate commerce these rules carry increased penalties for violations although we have taken steps to structure current and future transactions to comply with applicable current ferc regulations changes in ferc regulations or their interpretation by ferc or additional regulations issued by ferc in the future could also adversely affect our business financial condition or financial results 

we may experience increased federal state and local regulation of the safety of our operations 

the safety and protection of the public our customers and our employees is our top priority we constantly monitor and maintain our pipeline and distribution systems to ensure that natural gas is delivered safely reliably and efficiently through our network of more than 75000 miles of distribution and transmission lines as in recent years natural gas distribution and pipeline companies are continuing to encounter increasing federal state and local oversight of the safety of their operations although we believe these are costs ultimately recoverable through our rates the costs of complying with new laws and regulations may have at least a shortterm adverse impact on our operating costs and financial results 

greenhouse gas emissions or other legislation or regulations intended to address climate change could increase our operating costs adversely affecting our financial results growth cash flows and results of operations 

six of the eight states in which we operate have passed legislation to block attempts by local governments to limit the types of energy available to customers however federal regional andor state legislative andor regulatory initiatives may attempt to control or limit the causes of climate change including greenhouse gas emissions such as carbon dioxide and methane such laws or regulations could impose costs tied to greenhouse gas emissions operational requirements or restrictions or additional charges to fund energy efficiency activities they could also provide a cost advantage to alternative energy sources impose 

costs or restrictions on end users of natural gas or result in other costs or requirements such as costs associated with the adoption of new infrastructure and technology to respond to new mandates the focus on climate change could adversely impact the reputation of fossil fuel products or services the occurrence of the foregoing events could put upward pressure on the cost of natural gas relative to other energy sources increase our costs and the prices we charge to customers reduce the demand for natural gas or cause fuel switching to other energy sources and impact the competitive position of natural gas and the ability to serve new or existing customers adversely affecting our business results of operations and cash flows 

operational risks 

we may incur significant costs and liabilities resulting from pipeline integrity and other similar programs and related repairs 

phmsa requires pipeline operators to develop integrity management programs to comprehensively evaluate certain areas along their pipelines and to take additional measures to protect pipeline segments located in “high consequence areas” where a leak or rupture could potentially do the most harm as a pipeline operator the company is required to 

• perform ongoing assessments of pipeline integrity 

• identify and characterize applicable threats to pipeline segments that could impact a “high consequence area” 

• improve data collection integration and analysis 

• repair and remediate the pipeline as necessary and 

• implement preventative and mitigating actions 

the company incurs significant costs associated with its compliance with existing phmsa and comparable state regulations although we believe these are costs ultimately recoverable through our rates the costs of complying with new laws and regulations may have at least a shortterm adverse impact on our operating costs and financial results for example the adoption of new regulations requiring more comprehensive or stringent safety standards could require installation of new or modified safety controls new capital projects or accelerated maintenance programs all of which could require a potentially significant increase in operating costs 

distributing transporting and storing natural gas involve risks that may result in accidents and additional operating costs 

our operations involve a number of hazards and operating risks inherent in storing and transporting natural gas that could affect the public safety and reliability of our distribution system while atmos energy with the support from each of its regulatory commissions is accelerating the replacement of pipeline infrastructure operating issues such as leaks accidents equipment problems and incidents including explosions and fire could result in legal liability repair and remediation costs increased operating costs significant increased capital expenditures regulatory fines and penalties and other costs and a loss of customer confidence we maintain liability and property insurance coverage in place for many of these hazards and risks however because some of our transmission pipeline and storage facilities are near or are in populated areas any loss of human life or adverse financial results resulting from such events could be large if these events were not fully covered by our general liability and property insurance which policies are subject to certain limits and deductibles our operations or financial results could be adversely affected 

if contracted gas supplies interstate pipeline andor storage services are not available or delivered in a timely manner our ability to meet our customers’ natural gas requirements may be impaired and our financial condition may be adversely affected 

in order to meet our customers’ annual and seasonal natural gas demands we must obtain a sufficient supply of natural gas interstate pipeline capacity and storage capacity if we are unable to obtain these either from our suppliers’ inability to deliver the contracted commodity or the inability to secure replacement quantities our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected if a substantial disruption to or reduction in interstate natural gas pipelines’ transmission and storage capacity occurred due to operational failures or disruptions legislative or regulatory actions hurricanes tornadoes floods extreme cold weather terrorist or cyberattacks or acts of war our operations or financial results could be adversely affected 

our operations are subject to increased competition 

in residential and commercial customer markets our distribution operations compete with other energy products such as electricity and propane our primary product competition is with electricity for heating water heating and cooking increases in the price of natural gas could negatively impact our competitive position by decreasing the price benefits of natural gas to the consumer this could adversely impact our business if our customer growth slows or if our customers further conserve their use of gas resulting in reduced gas purchases and customer billings 

in the case of industrial customers such as manufacturing plants adverse economic conditions including higher gas costs could cause these customers to use alternative sources of energy such as electricity or bypass our systems in favor of special 

competitive contracts with lower perunit costs our pipeline and storage operations historically have faced limited competition from other existing intrastate pipelines and gas marketers seeking to provide or arrange transportation storage and other services for customers however in the last few years several new pipelines have been completed which has increased the level of competition in this segment of our business 

adverse weather conditions could affect our operations or financial results 

we have weathernormalized rates for approximately 96 percent of our residential and commercial revenues in our distribution operations which substantially mitigates the adverse effects of warmerthannormal weather for meters in those service areas however there is no assurance that we will continue to receive such regulatory protection from adverse weather in our rates in the future the loss of such weathernormalized rates could have an adverse effect on our operations and financial results in addition our operating results may continue to vary somewhat with the actual temperatures during the winter heating season additionally sustained cold weather could challenge our ability to adequately meet customer demand in our operations 

the operations and financial results of the company could be adversely impacted as a result of climate change 

as climate change occurs our businesses could be adversely impacted although we believe it is likely that any such resulting impacts would occur very gradually over a long period of time and thus would be difficult to quantify with any degree of specificity to the extent climate change results in temperatures that differ materially from temperatures we are currently experiencing financial results could be adversely affected through lower gas volumes and revenues climate change could also cause shifts in population including customers moving away from our service territories 

it could also result in more frequent and more severe weather events such as hurricanes and tornadoes which could increase our costs to repair damaged facilities and restore service to our customers or impact the cost of gas if we were unable to deliver natural gas to our customers our financial results would be impacted by lost revenues and we generally would have to seek approval from regulators to recover restoration costs to the extent we would be unable to recover those costs or if higher rates resulting from our recovery of such costs would result in reduced demand for our services our future business financial condition or financial results could be adversely impacted 

the inability to continue to hire train and retain operational technical and managerial personnel could adversely affect our results of operations 

although the average age of the employee base of atmos energy is not significantly changing year over year there are still a number of employees who will become eligible to retire within the next five to 10 years if we were unable to hire appropriate personnel or contractors to fill future needs the company could encounter operating challenges and increased costs primarily due to a loss of knowledge errors due to inexperience or the lengthy time period typically required to adequately train replacement personnel in addition higher costs could result from loss of productivity or increased safety compliance issues the inability to hire train and retain new operational technical and managerial personnel adequately and to transfer institutional knowledge and expertise could adversely affect our ability to manage and operate our business if we were unable to hire train and retain appropriately qualified personnel our results of operations could be adversely affected 

increased dependence on technology may hinder the company’s business operations and adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations if such technologies fail 

over the last several years the company has implemented or acquired a variety of technological tools including both companyowned information technology and technological services provided by outside parties these tools and systems support critical functions including scheduling and dispatching of service technicians automated meter reading systems customer care and billing operational plant logistics management reporting and external financial reporting the failure of these or other similarly important technologies or the company’s inability to have these technologies supported updated expanded or integrated into other technologies could hinder its business operations and adversely impact its financial condition and results of operations 

although the company has when possible developed alternative sources of technology and built redundancy into its computer networks and tools there can be no assurance that these efforts would protect against all potential issues related to the loss of any such technologies 

cyberattacks or acts of cyberterrorism could disrupt our business operations and information technology systems or result in the loss or exposure of confidential or sensitive customer employee or company information 

our business operations and information technology systems may be vulnerable to an attack by individuals or organizations intending to disrupt our business operations and information technology systems even though the company has implemented policies procedures and controls to prevent and detect these activities we use our information technology systems to manage our distribution and intrastate pipeline and storage operations and other business processes disruption of those systems could adversely impact our ability to safely deliver natural gas to our customers operate our pipeline and storage 

systems or serve our customers timely accordingly if such an attack or act of terrorism were to occur our operations and financial results could be adversely affected 

in addition we use our information technology systems to protect confidential or sensitive customer employee and company information developed and maintained in the normal course of our business any attack on such systems that would result in the unauthorized release of customer employee or other confidential or sensitive data could have a material adverse effect on our business reputation increase our costs and expose us to additional material legal claims and liability even though we have insurance coverage in place for many of these cyberrelated risks if such an attack or act of terrorism were to occur our operations and financial results could be adversely affected to the extent not fully covered by such insurance coverage 

natural disasters terrorist activities or other significant events could adversely affect our operations or financial results 

natural disasters are always a threat to our assets and operations in addition the threat of terrorist activities could lead to increased economic instability and volatility in the price of natural gas that could affect our operations also companies in our industry may face a heightened risk of exposure to actual acts of terrorism which could subject our operations to increased risks as a result the availability of insurance covering such risks may become more limited which could increase the risk that an event could adversely affect our operations or financial results 

financial economic and market risks 

our growth in the future may be limited by the nature of our business which requires extensive capital spending 

our operations are capitalintensive we must make significant capital expenditures on a longterm basis to modernize our distribution and transmission system and to comply with the safety rules and regulations issued by the regulatory authorities responsible for the service areas we operate in addition we must continually build new capacity to serve the growing needs of the communities we serve the magnitude of these expenditures may be affected by a number of factors including new regulations the general state of the economy and weather 

the liquidity required to fund our working capital capital expenditures and other cash needs is provided from a combination of internally generated cash flows and external debt and equity financing the cost and availability of borrowing funds from third party lenders or issuing equity is dependent on the liquidity of the credit markets interest rates and other market conditions this in turn may limit the amount of funds we can invest in our infrastructure 

the company is dependent on continued access to the credit and capital markets to execute our business strategy 

our longterm debt is currently rated as “investment grade” by standard  poor’s corporation and moody’s investors service inc similar to most companies we rely upon access to both shortterm and longterm credit and capital markets to satisfy our liquidity requirements if adverse credit conditions were to cause a significant limitation on our access to the private credit and public capital markets we could see a reduction in our liquidity a significant reduction in our liquidity could in turn trigger a negative change in our ratings outlook or even a reduction in our credit ratings by one or more of the credit rating agencies such a downgrade could further limit our access to private credit andor public capital markets and increase our costs of borrowing 

while we believe we can meet our capital requirements from our operations and the sources of financing available to us we can provide no assurance that we will continue to be able to do so in the future especially if the market price of natural gas increases significantly the future effects on our business liquidity and financial results of a deterioration of current conditions in the credit and capital markets could be material and adverse to us both in the ways described above or in other ways that we do not currently anticipate 

we are exposed to market risks that are beyond our control which could adversely affect our financial results 

we are subject to market risks beyond our control including i commodity price volatility caused by market supply and demand dynamics counterparty performance or counterparty creditworthiness and ii interest rate risk we are generally insulated from commodity price risk through our purchased gas cost mechanisms with respect to interest rate risk we have been operating in a relatively low interestrate environment in recent years compared to historical norms for both short and longterm interest rates however increases in interest rates could adversely affect our future financial results to the extent that we do not recover our actual interest expense in our rates 

the concentration of our operations in the state of texas exposes our operations and financial results to economic conditions weather patterns and regulatory decisions in texas 

approximately 70 percent of our consolidated operations are located in the state of texas this concentration of our business in texas means that our operations and financial results may be significantly affected by changes in the texas economy in general weather patterns and regulatory decisions by state and local regulatory authorities in texas 

a deterioration in economic conditions could adversely affect our customers and negatively impact our financial results 

any adverse changes in economic conditions in the united states especially in the states in which we operate could adversely affect the financial resources of many domestic households as a result our customers could seek to use less gas and it may be more difficult for them to pay their gas bills this would likely lead to slower collections and higher than normal levels of accounts receivable this in turn could increase our financing requirements additionally should economic conditions deteriorate our industrial customers could seek alternative energy sources which could result in lower transportation volumes 

increased gas costs could adversely impact our customer base and customer collections and increase our level of indebtedness 

rapid increases in the costs of purchased gas would cause us to experience a significant increase in shortterm or longterm debt we must pay suppliers for gas when it is purchased which can be significantly in advance of when these costs may be recovered through the collection of monthly customer bills for gas delivered increases in purchased gas costs also slow our natural gas distribution collection efforts as customers are more likely to delay the payment of their gas bills leading to higher than normal accounts receivable this could result in higher shortterm debt levels greater collection efforts and increased bad debt expense 

the costs of providing health care benefits pension and postretirement health care benefits and related funding requirements may increase substantially 

we provide health care benefits a cashbalance pension plan and postretirement health care benefits to eligible fulltime employees the costs of providing health care benefits to our employees could significantly increase over time due to rapidly increasing health care inflation and any future legislative changes related to the provision of health care benefits the impact of additional costs which are likely to be passed on to the company is difficult to measure at this time 

the costs of providing a cashbalance pension plan to eligible fulltime employees prior to 2011 and postretirement health care benefits to eligible fulltime employees and related funding requirements could be influenced by changes in the market value of the assets funding our pension and postretirement health care plans any significant declines in the value of these investments due to sustained declines in equity markets or a reduction in bond yields could increase the costs of our pension and postretirement health care plans and related funding requirements in the future further our costs of providing such benefits and related funding requirements are also subject to a number of factors including i changing demographics including longer life expectancy of beneficiaries and an expected increase in the number of eligible former employees over the next five to ten years ii various actuarial calculations and assumptions which may differ materially from actual results due primarily to changing market and economic conditions including changes in interest rates and higher or lower withdrawal rates and iii future government regulation 

the costs to the company of providing these benefits and related funding requirements could also increase materially in the future should there be a material reduction in the amount of the recovery of these costs through our rates or should significant delays develop in the timing of the recovery of such costs which could adversely affect our financial results 

the outbreak of covid19 or any other pandemic and their impact on business and economic conditions could negatively affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

the scale and scope of the covid19 outbreak the resulting pandemic any other future pandemic and their impact on the economy and financial markets could adversely affect the company’s business results of operations and financial condition regarding covid19 as an essential business the company continues to provide natural gas services and has implemented business continuity and emergency response plans to continue to provide natural gas services to customers and support the company’s operations while taking health and safety measures such as implementing worker distancing measures and using a remote workforce where possible however there is no assurance that the continued spread of covid19 and efforts to contain the virus will not materially impact our business results of operations and financial condition

introduction 

this section provides management’s discussion of the financial condition changes in financial condition and results of operations of atmos energy corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries with specific information on results of operations and liquidity and capital resources it includes management’s interpretation of our financial results the factors affecting these results the major factors expected to affect future operating results and future investment and financing plans this discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 

several factors exist that could influence our future financial performance some of which are described in item 1a above “risk factors” they should be considered in connection with evaluating forwardlooking statements contained in this report or otherwise made by or on behalf of us since these factors could cause actual results and conditions to differ materially from those set out in such forwardlooking statements 

cautionary statement for the purposes of the safe harbor under the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 

the statements contained in this annual report on form 10k may contain “forwardlooking statements” within the meaning of section 27a of the securities act of 1933 and section 21e of the securities exchange act of 1934 all statements other than statements of historical fact included in this report are forwardlooking statements made in good faith by us and are intended to qualify for the safe harbor from liability established by the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 when used in this report or any other of our documents or oral presentations the words “anticipate” “believe” “estimate” “expect” “forecast” “goal” “intend” “objective” “plan” “projection” “seek” “strategy” or similar words are intended to identify forwardlooking statements such forwardlooking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the statements relating to our strategy operations markets services rates recovery of costs availability of gas supply and other factors these risks and uncertainties include the following federal state and local regulatory and political trends and decisions including the impact of rate proceedings before 

various state regulatory commissions increased federal regulatory oversight and potential penalties possible increased federal state and local regulation of the safety of our operations the impact of greenhouse gas emissions or other legislation or regulations intended to address climate change possible significant costs and liabilities resulting from pipeline integrity and other similar programs and related repairs the inherent hazards and risks involved in distributing transporting and storing natural gas the availability and accessibility of contracted gas supplies interstate pipeline andor storage services increased competition from energy suppliers and alternative forms of energy adverse weather conditions the impact of climate change the inability to continue to hire train and retain operational technical and managerial personnel increased dependence on technology that may hinder the companys business if such technologies fail the threat of cyberattacks or acts of cyberterrorism that could disrupt our business operations and information technology systems or result in the loss or exposure of confidential or sensitive customer employee or company information natural disasters terrorist activities or other events and other risks and uncertainties discussed herein all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond our control the capitalintensive nature of our business our ability to continue to access the credit and capital markets to execute our business strategy market risks beyond our control affecting our risk management activities including commodity price volatility counterparty performance or creditworthiness and interest rate risk the concentration of our operations in texas the impact of adverse economic conditions on our customers changes in the availability and price of natural gas increased costs of providing health care benefits along with pension and postretirement health care benefits and increased funding requirements and the outbreak of covid19 and its impact on business and economic conditions accordingly while we believe these forwardlooking statements to be reasonable there can be no assurance that they will approximate actual experience or that the expectations derived from them will be realized further we undertake no obligation to update or revise any of our forwardlooking statements whether as a result of new information future events or otherwise 

critical accounting policies 

our consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and the related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ from estimates 

our significant accounting policies are discussed in note 2 to our consolidated financial statements the accounting policies discussed below are both important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and require management to make difficult subjective or complex accounting estimates accordingly these critical accounting policies are reviewed periodically by the audit committee of the board of directors 







nongaap financial measures 

as described further in note 14 to the consolidated financial statements due to the passage of kansas house bill 2585 we remeasured our deferred tax liability and updated our state deferred tax rate as a result we recorded a noncash income tax benefit of 210 million for the fiscal year ended september 30 2020 due to the nonrecurring nature of this benefit we believe that net income and diluted net income per share before the noncash income tax benefit provide a more relevant measure to analyze our financial performance than net income and diluted net income per share in order to allow investors to better analyze our core results and allow the information to be presented on a comparative basis accordingly the following discussion and analysis of our financial performance will reference adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share nongaap measures which are calculated as follows 



results of operations 

overview 

atmos energy strives to operate its businesses safely and reliably while delivering superior shareholder value our commitment to modernizing our natural gas distribution and transmission systems requires a significant level of capital spending we have the ability to begin recovering a significant portion of these investments timely through rate designs and mechanisms that reduce or eliminate regulatory lag and separate the recovery of our approved rate from customer usage patterns the execution of our capital spending program the ability to recover these investments timely and our ability to access the capital markets to satisfy our financing needs are the primary drivers that affect our financial performance 

the following table details our consolidated net income by segment during the last three fiscal years 



during fiscal 2021 we recorded net income of 6656 million or 512 per diluted share compared to net income of 6014 million or 489 per diluted share in the prior year after adjusting for a nonrecurring income tax benefit recognized during fiscal 2020 adjusted net income was 5805 million or 472 per diluted share in the prior year the yearoveryear increase in adjusted net income of 851 million largely reflects positive rate outcomes driven by safety and reliability spending and distribution customer growth partially offset by lower service order revenues and higher bad debt expense in our distribution segment due to the temporary suspension of collection activities during the pandemic and increased spending on system maintenance activities 

during the year ended september 30 2021 we implemented ratemaking regulatory actions which resulted in an increase in annual operating income of 1857 million excluding the impact of the refund of excess deferred income taxes resulting from previously enacted tax reform legislation our total fiscal 2021 rate outcomes were 2262 million additionally we had ratemaking efforts in progress at september 30 2021 seeking a total increase in annual operating income of 565 million as of the date of this report we have received approval to implement 250 million of this amount in the first quarter of fiscal 2022 excluding the impact of the refund of excess deferred income taxes resulting from previously enacted tax reform legislation we have received approval to implement 685 million during the first quarter of fiscal 2022 

during fiscal year 2021 we refunded 559 million in excess deferred tax liabilities to customers the refunds reduced operating income and reduced our annual effective income tax rate to 188 in fiscal 2021 compared with 195 in fiscal 2020 

capital expenditures for fiscal 2021 increased 2 percent periodoverperiod to 20 billion over 85 percent was invested to improve the safety and reliability of our distribution and transportation systems with a significant portion of this investment incurred under regulatory mechanisms that reduce regulatory lag to six months or less 

during fiscal 2021 we completed over 34 billion of longterm debt and equity financing including 22 billion of incremental financing issued to pay for the purchased gas costs incurred during winter storm uri as of september 30 2021 our equity capitalization was 519 percent excluding the 22 billion of incremental financing our equity capitalization was 606 percent as of september 30 2021 we had approximately 29 billion in total liquidity including cash and cash equivalents and funds available through equity forward sales agreements 

as a result of the continued stability of our earnings cash flows and capital structure our board of directors increased the quarterly dividend by 88 percent for fiscal 2022 

distribution segment 

the distribution segment is primarily comprised of our regulated natural gas distribution and related sales operations in eight states the primary factors that impact the results of our distribution operations are our ability to earn our authorized rates of return competitive factors in the energy industry and economic conditions in our service areas 

our ability to earn our authorized rates is based primarily on our ability to improve the rate design in our various ratemaking jurisdictions to minimize regulatory lag and ultimately separate the recovery of our approved rates from customer usage patterns improving rate design is a longterm process and is further complicated by the fact that we operate in multiple rate jurisdictions the “ratemaking activity” section of this form 10k describes our current rate strategy progress towards implementing that strategy and recent ratemaking initiatives in more detail during fiscal 2021 we completed regulatory proceedings in our distribution segment resulting in a 1418 million increase in annual operating income excluding the impact of the refund of excess deferred income taxes resulting from previously enacted tax reform legislation our total fiscal 2021 annualized rate outcomes in our distribution segment were 1823 million 

our distribution operations are also affected by the cost of natural gas we are generally able to pass the cost of gas through to our customers without markup under purchased gas cost adjustment mechanisms therefore increases in the cost of gas are offset by a corresponding increase in revenues revenues in our texas and mississippi service areas include franchise fees and gross receipts taxes which are calculated as a percentage of revenue inclusive of gas costs therefore the amount of these taxes included in revenues is influenced by the cost of gas and the level of gas sales volumes we record the associated tax expense as a component of taxes other than income 

the cost of gas typically does not have a direct impact on our operating income because these costs are recovered through our purchased gas cost adjustment mechanisms however higher gas costs may adversely impact our accounts receivable collections resulting in higher bad debt expense this risk is currently mitigated by rate design that allows us to collect from our customers the gas cost portion of our bad debt expense on approximately 79 percent of our residential and commercial revenues additionally higher gas costs may require us to increase borrowings under our credit facilities resulting in higher interest expense finally higher gas costs as well as competitive factors in the industry and general economic conditions may cause customers to conserve or in the case of industrial consumers to use alternative energy sources 

review of financial and operating results 

financial and operational highlights for our distribution segment for the fiscal years ended september 30 2021 2020 and 2019 are presented below 



1 see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for further information 

fiscal year ended september 30 2021 compared with fiscal year ended september 30 2020 

operating income for our distribution segment increased 17 percent which primarily reflects 

• a 1506 million increase in rate adjustments primarily in our midtex mississippi louisiana and west texas divisions 

• a 192 million increase from customer growth primarily in our midtex division 

• a 38 million decrease in employee related costs 

• a 50 million decrease in travel and entertainment expense 

partially offset by 

• a 436 million increase in depreciation expense and property taxes associated with increased capital investments 

• an 182 million increase in bad debt expense primarily due to the temporary suspension of collection activities 

• a 128 million increase in pipeline maintenance and related activities 

• a 51 million increase in insurance expense 

• an 84 million decrease in service order revenues primarily due to the temporary suspension of collection activities 

the yearover year change in other nonoperating expense and interest charges of 224 million primarily reflects increased amortization of prior service cost associated with our retiree medical plan as presented in note 12 to the consolidated financial statements 

during fiscal 2021 we refunded 294 million in excess deferred taxes in the distribution segment which reduced operating income year over year and reduced the annual effective income tax rate for this segment to 206 compared with 216 in the prior year 

the fiscal year ended september 30 2020 compared with fiscal year ended september 30 2019 for our distribution segment is described in item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of our annual report on form 10k for the fiscal year ended september 30 2020 

the following table shows our operating income by distribution division in order of total rate base for the fiscal years ended september 30 2021 2020 and 2019 the presentation of our distribution operating income is included for financial reporting purposes and may not be appropriate for ratemaking purposes 



pipeline and storage segment 

our pipeline and storage segment consists of the pipeline and storage operations of our atmos pipeline–texas division apt and our natural gas transmission operations in louisiana apt is one of the largest intrastate pipeline operations in texas with a heavy concentration in the established natural gas producing areas of central northern and eastern texas extending into or near the major producing areas of the barnett shale the texas gulf coast and the permian basin of west texas apt provides transportation and storage services to our midtex division other thirdparty local distribution companies industrial and electric generation customers as well as marketers and producers over 80 percent of this segments revenues are derived from these services as part of its pipeline operations apt owns and operates five underground storage facilities in texas 

our natural gas transmission operations in louisiana are comprised of a 21mile pipeline located in the new orleans louisiana area that is primarily used to aggregate gas supply for our distribution division in louisiana under a longterm contract and on a more limited basis to third parties the demand fee charged to our louisiana distribution division for these services is subject to regulatory approval by the louisiana public service commission we also manage two asset management plans which have been approved by applicable state regulatory commissions generally these asset management plans require us to share with our distribution customers a significant portion of the cost savings earned from these arrangements 

our pipeline and storage segment is impacted by seasonal weather patterns competitive factors in the energy industry and economic conditions in our texas and louisiana service areas natural gas prices do not directly impact the results of this segment as revenues are derived from the transportation and storage of natural gas however natural gas prices and demand for natural gas could influence the level of drilling activity in the supply areas that we serve which may influence the level of throughput we may be able to transport on our pipelines further natural gas price differences between the various hubs that we serve in texas could influence the volumes of gas transported for shippers through our texas pipeline system and rates for such transportation 

the results of apt are also significantly impacted by the natural gas requirements of its local distribution company customers additionally its operations may be impacted by the timing of when costs and expenses are incurred and when these costs and expenses are recovered through its tariffs 

apt annually uses grip to recover capital costs incurred in the prior calendar year on february 12 2021 apt made a grip filing that covered changes in net property plant and equipment investment from january 1 2020 through december 31 2020 with a requested increase in operating income of 440 million on may 11 2021 the texas railroad commission approved an increase in operating income of 439 million in february 2021 the rrc approved a reduction in revenue of 1066 million to refund excess deferred tax liabilities to customers over 35 months 

on december 21 2016 the louisiana public service commission approved an annual increase of five percent to the demand fee charged by our natural gas transmission pipeline for each of the next 10 years effective october 1 2017 

review of financial and operating results 

financial and operational highlights for our pipeline and storage segment for the fiscal years ended september 30 2021 2020 and 2019 are presented below 



1 see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for further information 

fiscal year ended september 30 2021 compared with fiscal year ended september 30 2020 

operating income for our pipeline and storage segment decreased three percent which primarily reflects 

• an 82 million net decrease in apts thrusystem activities primarily associated with the tightening of regional spreads driven by increased competing takeaway capacity in the permian basin 

• a 171 million increase in system maintenance expense primarily due to spending on hydro testing and inline inspections 

• a 170 million increase in depreciation expense and property taxes associated with increased capital investments 

partially offset by 

• a 562 million increase due to rate adjustments from the grip filings approved in may 2020 and 2021 the increase in rates was driven by increased safety and reliability spending 

the yearover year change in other nonoperating income and interest charges of 80 million reflects increased allowance for funds used during construction afudc primarily due to increased capital spending partially offset by an increase in interest expense due to the issuance of longterm debt during fiscal 2021 

during fiscal 2021 we refunded 265 million in excess deferred taxes in our pipeline and storage segment which reduced operating income year over year and reduced the annual effective tax rate for this segment to 149 compared with 236 in the prior year 

the fiscal year ended september 30 2020 compared with fiscal year ended september 30 2019 for our pipeline and storage segment is described in item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of our annual report on form 10k for the fiscal year ended september 30 2020 

liquidity and capital resources 

the liquidity required to fund our working capital capital expenditures and other cash needs is provided from a combination of internally generated cash flows and external debt and equity financing additionally we have a 15 billion commercial paper program and four committed revolving credit facilities with 25 billion in total availability from thirdparty 

lenders the commercial paper program and credit facilities provide costeffective shortterm financing until it can be replaced with a balance of longterm debt and equity financing that achieves the companys desired capital structure with an equitytototalcapitalization ratio between 50 and 60 inclusive of longterm and shortterm debt additionally we have various uncommitted trade credit lines with our gas suppliers that we utilize to purchase natural gas on a monthly basis 

we have a shelf registration statement on file with the securities and exchange commission sec that allows us to issue up to 50 billion in common stock andor debt securities as of the date of this report approximately 34 billion of securities remained available for issuance under the shelf registration statement which expires june 29 2024 

we also have an atthemarket atm equity sales program that allows us to issue and sell shares of our common stock up to an aggregate offering price of 10 billion including shares of common stock that may be sold pursuant to forward sale agreements entered into in connection with the atm equity sales program which expires june 29 2024 at september 30 2021 approximately 760 million of equity is available for issuance under this atm equity sales program additionally as of september 30 2021 we had 3020 million in available proceeds from outstanding forward sale agreements that must be settled during fiscal 2022 

during fiscal 2021 we entered into forward starting interest rate swaps to effectively fix the treasury yield component associated with 14 billion of planned issuances of unsecured senior notes during fiscal 2021 we settled swaps of 600 million with a net receipt of 622 million on october 1 2021 the notes were issued as planned 

the following table summarizes our existing forward starting interest rate swaps as of september 30 2021 



the liquidity provided by these sources is expected to be sufficient to fund the companys working capital needs and capital expenditures program additionally we expect to continue to be able to obtain financing upon reasonable terms as necessary 

the following table presents our capitalization as of september 30 2021 and 2020 



1 inclusive of our finance leases 

2 excluding the 22 billion of incremental financing issued to pay for the purchased gas costs incurred during winter storm uri our equity capitalization ratio would have been 606 

cash flows 

our internally generated funds may change in the future due to a number of factors some of which we cannot control these factors include regulatory changes the price for our services the demand for such products and services margin requirements resulting from significant changes in commodity prices operational risks and other factors 

cash flows from operating investing and financing activities for the years ended september 30 2021 2020 and 2019 are presented below 



cash flows for the fiscal year ended september 30 2020 compared with fiscal year ended september 30 2019 is described in item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of our annual report on form 10k for the fiscal year ended september 30 2020 

cash flows from operating activities 

for the fiscal year ended september 30 2021 cash flow used from operating activities was 11 billion compared with cash flows generated from operating activities of 10 billion in the prior year the yearoveryear decrease in operating cash flows reflects gas costs incurred during winter storm uri and the timing of customer collections partially offset by the positive effects of successful rate case outcomes achieved in fiscal 2020 and 2021 

cash flows from investing activities 

our capital expenditures are primarily used to improve the safety and reliability of our distribution and transmission system through pipeline replacement and system modernization and to enhance and expand our system to meet customer needs over the last three fiscal years approximately 88 percent of our capital spending has been committed to improving the safety and reliability of our system 

for the fiscal year ended september 30 2021 we had 197 billion in capital expenditures compared with 194 billion for the fiscal year ended september 30 2020 capital spending increased by 338 million or two percent as a result of planned increases to modernize our system 

cash flows from financing activities 

our financing activities provided 31 billion and 8838 million in cash for fiscal years 2021 and 2020 

during the fiscal year ended september 30 2021 we received 34 billion in net proceeds from the issuance of longterm debt and equity we completed a public offering of 600 million of 150 senior notes due 2031 11 billion of 0625 senior notes due 2023 and 11 billion floating rate senior notes due 2023 net proceeds from the latter two notes were used to pay for gas costs incurred during winter storm uri additionally during the year ended september 30 2021 we settled 6130875 shares that had been sold on a forward basis for net proceeds of 6067 million the net proceeds were used primarily to support capital spending and for other general corporate purposes including the payment of natural gas purchases additionally cash dividends increased due to an 87 percent increase in our dividend rate and an increase in shares outstanding 

during the fiscal year ended september 30 2020 we received 16 billion in net proceeds from the issuance of longterm debt and equity we completed a public offering of 300 million of 2625 senior notes due 2029 and 500 million of 3375 senior notes due 2049 and entered into a two year 200 million term loan we received net proceeds from these offerings after the underwriting discount and offering expenses of 7917 million additionally we settled 6101916 shares that had been sold on a forward basis for net proceeds of approximately 624 million the net proceeds were used primarily to support capital spending reduce shortterm debt and other general corporate purposes cash dividends increased due to a 95 percent increase in our dividend rate and an increase in shares outstanding 

the following table shows the number of shares issued for the fiscal years ended september 30 2021 2020 and 2019 



1 share amounts do not include shares issued under forward sale agreements until the shares have been settled 

credit ratings 

our credit ratings directly affect our ability to obtain shortterm and longterm financing in addition to the cost of such financing in determining our credit ratings the rating agencies consider a number of quantitative factors including but not limited to debt to total capitalization operating cash flow relative to outstanding debt operating cash flow coverage of interest and operating cash flow less dividends to debt in addition the rating agencies consider qualitative factors such as consistency of our earnings over time the risks associated with our business and the regulatory structures that govern our rates in the states where we operate 

our debt is rated by two rating agencies standard  poor’s corporation sp and moody’s investors service moody’s as a result of the impacts of winter storm uri during the second quarter of fiscal 2021 sp lowered our longterm and shortterm credit ratings by one notch and placed our ratings under negative outlook and moodys reaffirmed its longterm and shortterm credit ratings and placed our ratings under negative outlook 

as of september 30 2021 our outlook and current debt ratings which are all considered investment grade are as follows 



a significant degradation in our operating performance or a significant reduction in our liquidity caused by more limited access to the private and public credit markets as a result of deteriorating global or national financial and credit conditions could trigger a negative change in our ratings outlook or even a reduction in our credit ratings by the two credit rating agencies this would mean more limited access to the private and public credit markets and an increase in the costs of such borrowings 

a credit rating is not a recommendation to buy sell or hold securities the highest investment grade credit rating is aaa for sp and aaa for moody’s the lowest investment grade credit rating is bbb for sp and baa3 for moody’s our credit ratings may be revised or withdrawn at any time by the rating agencies and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating there can be no assurance that a rating will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if in its judgment circumstances so warrant

risk management activities 

in our distribution and pipeline and storage segments we use a combination of physical storage fixed physical contracts and fixed financial contracts to reduce our exposure to unusually large winterperiod gas price increases additionally we manage interest rate risk by entering into financial instruments to effectively fix the treasury yield component of the interest cost associated with anticipated financings 

we record our financial instruments as a component of risk management assets and liabilities which are classified as current or noncurrent based upon the anticipated settlement date of the underlying financial instrument substantially all of our financial instruments are valued using external market quotes and indices

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend

we are exposed to risks associated with commodity prices and interest rates commodity price risk is the potential loss that we may incur as a result of changes in the fair value of a particular instrument or commodity interestrate risk is the potential increased cost we could incur when we issue debt instruments or to provide financing and liquidity for our business activities additionally interestrate risk could affect our ability to issue cost effective equity instruments 

we conduct risk management activities in our distribution and pipeline and storage segments in our distribution segment we use a combination of physical storage fixedprice forward contracts and financial instruments primarily overthecounter swap and option contracts in an effort to minimize the impact of natural gas price volatility on our customers during the winter heating season our risk management activities and related accounting treatment are described in further detail in note 15 to the consolidated financial statements additionally our earnings are affected by changes in shortterm interest rates as a result of our issuance of shortterm commercial paper and our other shortterm borrowings 

commodity price risk 

we purchase natural gas for our distribution operations substantially all of the costs of gas purchased for distribution operations are recovered from our customers through purchased gas cost adjustment mechanisms therefore our distribution operations have limited commodity price risk exposure 

interest rate risk 

our earnings are exposed to changes in shortterm interest rates associated with our shortterm commercial paper program and other shortterm borrowings we use a sensitivity analysis to estimate our shortterm interest rate risk for purposes of this analysis we estimate our shortterm interest rate risk as the difference between our actual interest expense for the period and estimated interest expense for the period assuming a hypothetical average one percent increase in the interest rates associated with our shortterm borrowings had interest rates associated with our shortterm borrowings increased by an average of one percent our interest expense would not have materially increased during 2021

atmos energys vision is to be the safest provider of natural gas services we intend to achieve this vision by 

 since 2011 our operating strategy has focused on modernizing our distribution and transmission system to improve safety and reliability this operating strategy also allows us to reduce methane emissions from our system since that time our capital expenditures have increased approximately 14 percent annually additionally during this period we have added new or modified existing regulatory mechanisms to reduce regulatory lag 

our core values include focusing on our employees and customers while conducting our business with honesty and integrity we continue to strengthen our culture through ongoing communications with our employees and enhanced employee training 

operating segments 

as of september 30 2020  we manage and review our consolidated operations through the following reportable segments 

 distribution segment overview 

the following table summarizes key information about our six regulated natural gas distribution divisions presented in order of total rate base 



we operate in our service areas under terms of nonexclusive franchise agreements granted by the various cities and towns that we serve at september 30 2020  we held 1023 franchises having terms generally ranging from five to 35 years a significant number of our franchises expire each year which require renewal prior to the end of their terms historically we have successfully renewed these franchises and believe that we will continue to be able to renew our franchises as they expire 

revenues in this operating segment are established by regulatory authorities in the states in which we operate these rates are intended to be sufficient to cover the costs of conducting business including a reasonable return on invested capital in addition we transport natural gas for others through our distribution systems 

rates established by regulatory authorities often include cost adjustment mechanisms for costs that i are subject to significant price fluctuations compared to our other costs ii represent a large component of our cost of service and iii are generally outside our control 

purchased gas cost adjustment mechanisms represent a common form of cost adjustment mechanism purchased gas cost adjustment mechanisms provide a method of recovering purchased gas costs on an ongoing basis without filing a rate case because they provide a dollarfordollar offset to increases or decreases in the cost of natural gas therefore although substantially all of our distribution operating revenues fluctuate with the cost of gas that we purchase distribution operating income is generally not affected by fluctuations in the cost of gas 

additionally some jurisdictions have performancebased ratemaking adjustments to provide incentives to minimize purchased gas costs through improved storage management and use of financial instruments to reduce volatility in gas costs under the performancebased ratemaking adjustments purchased gas costs savings are shared between the company and its customers 

our supply of natural gas is provided by a variety of suppliers including independent producers marketers and pipeline companies withdrawals of gas from proprietary and contracted storage assets and peaking and spot purchase agreements as needed 

supply arrangements consist of both base load and swing supply peaking quantities and are contracted from our suppliers on a firm basis with various terms at market prices base load quantities are those that flow at a constant level throughout the month and swing supply quantities provide the flexibility to change daily quantities to match increases or decreases in requirements related to weather conditions 

except for local production purchases we select our natural gas suppliers through a competitive bidding process by periodically requesting proposals from suppliers that have demonstrated that they can provide reliable service we select these suppliers based on their ability to deliver gas supply to our designated firm pipeline receipt points at the lowest reasonable cost major suppliers during fiscal 2020 were castleton commodities merchant trading lp centerpoint energy services inc conocophillips company devon gas services lp enlink gas marketing lp hartree partners lp symmetry energy solutions llc targa gas marketing llc texla energy management inc and twin eagle resources management llc 

the combination of base load peaking and spot purchase agreements coupled with the withdrawal of gas held in storage allows us the flexibility to adjust to changes in weather which minimizes our need to enter into longterm firm commitments we estimate our peakday availability of natural gas supply to be approximately 44 bcf the peakday demand for our distribution operations in fiscal 2020 was on november 12 2019 when sales to customers reached approximately 27 bcf 

currently our distribution divisions utilize 37 pipeline transportation companies both interstate and intrastate to transport our natural gas the pipeline transportation agreements are firm and many of them have “pipeline nonotice” storage service which provides for daily balancing between system requirements and nominated flowing supplies these agreements have been negotiated with the shortest term necessary while still maintaining our right of first refusal the natural gas supply for our midtex division is delivered primarily by our apt division 

to maintain our deliveries to high priority customers we have the ability and have exercised our right to curtail deliveries to certain customers under the terms of interruptible contracts or applicable state regulations or statutes our customers’ demand on our system is not necessarily indicative of our ability to meet current or anticipated market demands or immediate delivery requirements because of factors such as the physical limitations of gathering storage and transmission systems the duration and severity of cold weather the availability of gas reserves from our suppliers the ability to purchase additional supplies on a shortterm basis and actions by federal and state regulatory authorities curtailment rights provide us the flexibility to meet the humanneeds requirements of our customers on a firm basis priority allocations imposed by federal and state regulatory agencies as well as other factors beyond our control may affect our ability to meet the demands of our customers we do not anticipate any problems with obtaining additional gas supply as needed for our customers 

pipeline and storage segment overview 

our pipeline and storage segment consists of the pipeline and storage operations of apt and our natural gas transmission operations in louisiana apt is one of the largest intrastate pipeline operations in texas with a heavy concentration in the established natural gasproducing areas of central northern and eastern texas extending into or near the major producing areas 

of the barnett shale the texas gulf coast and the permian basin of west texas through its system apt provides transportation and storage services to our midtex division other third party local distribution companies industrial and electric generation customers marketers and producers as part of its pipeline operations apt owns and operates five underground storage reservoirs in texas 

revenues earned from transportation and storage services for apt are subject to traditional ratemaking governed by the rrc rates are updated through periodic filings made under texas’ grip grip allows us to include in our rate base annually approved capital costs incurred in the prior calendar year provided that we file a complete rate case at least once every five years the most recent of which was completed in august 2017 apt’s existing regulatory mechanisms allow certain transportation and storage services to be provided under marketbased rates 

our natural gas transmission operations in louisiana are comprised of a 21mile pipeline located in the new orleans louisiana area that is primarily used to aggregate gas supply for our distribution division in louisiana under a longterm contract and on a more limited basis to third parties the demand fee charged to our louisiana distribution division for these services is subject to regulatory approval by the louisiana public service commission we also manage two asset management plans in louisiana that serve distribution affiliates of the company which have been approved by applicable state regulatory commissions generally these asset management plans require us to share with our distribution customers a significant portion of the cost savings earned from these arrangements 

ratemaking activity 

overview 

the method of determining regulated rates varies among the states in which our regulated businesses operate the regulatory authorities have the responsibility of ensuring that utilities in their jurisdictions operate in the best interests of customers while providing utility companies the opportunity to earn a reasonable return on their investment generally each regulatory authority reviews rate requests and establishes a rate structure intended to generate revenue sufficient to cover the costs of conducting business including a reasonable return on invested capital 

our rate strategy focuses on reducing or eliminating regulatory lag obtaining adequate returns and providing stable predictable margins which benefit both our customers and the company as a result of our ratemaking efforts in recent years atmos energy has 



the following table provides a jurisdictional rate summary for our regulated operations as of september 30 2020  this information is for regulatory purposes only and may not be representative of our actual financial position 



  



  

 although substantial progress has been made in recent years to improve rate design and recovery of investment across our service areas we are continuing to seek improvements in rate design to address cost variations and pursue tariffs that reduce regulatory lag associated with investments further potential changes in federal energy policy federal safety regulations and changing economic conditions will necessitate continued vigilance by the company and our regulators in meeting the challenges presented by these external factors 

recent ratemaking activity 

the amounts described in the following sections represent the annual operating income that was requested or received in each rate filing which may not necessarily reflect the stated amount referenced in the final order as certain operating costs may have changed as a result of the commissions or other governmental authoritys final ruling the following table summarizes the annualized ratemaking outcomes we implemented in each of the last three fiscal years 



additionally the following ratemaking efforts seeking 1319 million in annual operating income were initiated during fiscal 2020 but had not been completed or implemented as of september 30 2020  



 4 the mississippi public service commission approved an increase in operating income of 106 million for the sir filing and 59 million for the srf filing new rates were implemented november 1 2020 

 

our recent ratemaking activity is discussed in greater detail below 

annual formula rate mechanisms 

as an instrument to reduce regulatory lag formula rate mechanisms allow us to refresh our rates on an annual basis without filing a formal rate case however these filings still involve discovery by the appropriate regulatory authorities prior to the final determination of rates under these mechanisms the following table summarizes our annual formula rate mechanisms by state 



 the following table summarizes our annual formula rate mechanisms with effective dates during the fiscal years ended september 30 2020  2019 and 2018  





 rate case filings 

a rate case is a formal request from atmos energy to a regulatory authority to increase rates that are charged to customers rate cases may also be initiated when the regulatory authorities request us to justify our rates this process is referred to as a “show cause” action adequate rates are intended to provide for recovery of the company’s costs as well as a reasonable rate of return to our shareholders and ensure that we continue to safely deliver reliable reasonably priced natural gas service to our customers 

the following table summarizes our recent rate cases 



other ratemaking activity 

the following table summarizes other ratemaking activity during the fiscal years ended september 30 2020  2019 and 2018  



  

 other regulation 

we are regulated by various state or local public utility authorities we are also subject to regulation by the united states department of transportation with respect to safety requirements in the operation and maintenance of our transmission and distribution facilities in addition our operations are also subject to various state and federal laws regulating environmental matters from time to time we receive inquiries regarding various environmental matters we believe that our properties and operations comply with and are operated in conformity with applicable safety and environmental statutes and regulations there are no administrative or judicial proceedings arising under environmental quality statutes pending or known to be contemplated by governmental agencies which would have a material adverse effect on us or our operations the pipeline and hazardous materials safety administration phmsa within the us department of transportation develops and enforces regulations for the safe reliable and environmentally sound operation of the pipeline transportation system the phmsa 

pipeline safety statutes provide for states to assume safety authority over intrastate natural transmission and distribution gas pipelines state pipeline safety programs are responsible for adopting and enforcing the federal and state pipeline safety regulations for intrastate natural gas transmission and distribution pipelines 

the federal energy regulatory commission ferc allows pursuant to section 311 of the natural gas policy act nga gas transportation services through our apt assets “on behalf of” interstate pipelines or local distribution companies served by interstate pipelines without subjecting these assets to the jurisdiction of the ferc under the nga additionally the ferc has regulatory authority over the use and release of interstate pipeline and storage capacity the ferc also has authority to detect and prevent market manipulation and to enforce compliance with ferc’s other rules policies and orders by companies engaged in the sale purchase transportation or storage of natural gas in interstate commerce we have taken what we believe are the necessary and appropriate steps to comply with these regulations 

the sec and the commodities futures trading commission pursuant to the dodd–frank act established numerous regulations relating to us financial markets we enacted procedures and modified existing business practices and contractual arrangements to comply with such regulations there are however some rulemaking proceedings that have not yet been finalized including those relating to capital and margin rules for non–cleared swaps we do not expect these rules to directly impact our business practices or collateral requirements however depending on the substance of these final rules in addition to certain international regulatory requirements still under development that are similar to dodd–frank our swap counterparties could be subject to additional and potentially significant capitalization requirements these regulations could motivate counterparties to increase our collateral requirements or cash postings 

competition 

although our regulated distribution operations are not currently in significant direct competition with any other distributors of natural gas to residential and commercial customers within our service areas we do compete with other natural gas suppliers and suppliers of alternative fuels for sales to industrial customers we compete in all aspects of our business with alternative energy sources including in particular electricity electric utilities offer electricity as a rival energy source and compete for the space heating water heating and cooking markets promotional incentives improved equipment efficiencies and promotional rates all contribute to the acceptability of electrical equipment the principal means to compete against alternative fuels is lower prices and natural gas historically has maintained its price advantage in the residential commercial and industrial markets 

our pipeline and storage operations have historically faced competition from other existing intrastate pipelines seeking to provide or arrange transportation storage and other services for customers in the last few years several new pipelines have been completed which has increased the level of competition in this segment of our business 

employees 

the corporate responsibility sustainability and safety committee of the board of directors oversees matters relating to equality diversity and inclusion human workplace rights employee health and safety and the company’s vision values and culture it also assists management in integrating responsibility and sustainability into strategic business activities to create longterm shareholder value 

our culture respects and appreciates inclusion and diversity thus we strive to have a workforce that reflects the unique 1400 communities that we serve at september 30 2020 we had 4694 employees substantially unchanged from last year we monitor our workforce data on a calendar year basis as of december 31 2019 61 percent of our employees worked in field roles and 39 percent worked in supportshared services roles 

to recruit and hire individuals with a variety of skills talents backgrounds and experiences we value and cultivate our strong relationships with hundreds of community and diversity outreach sources we also target jobs fairs including those focused on minority veteran and women candidates and partner with local colleges and universities to identify and recruit qualified applicants in each of the cities and towns we serve over the last five calendar years we hired over 1800 employees 

we perform succession planning annually to ensure that we develop and sustain a strong bench of talent capable of performing at the highest levels not only is talent identified but potential paths of development are discussed to ensure that employees have an opportunity to build their skills and are wellprepared for future roles the strength of our succession planning process is evident through our long history of promoting our leaders from within the organization

 item 1a 

risk factors 

tableend

our financial and operating results are subject to a number of risk factors many of which are not within our control investors should carefully consider the following discussion of risk factors as well as other information appearing in this report these factors include the following which are organized by category 

regulatory and legislative risks 

we are subject to federal state and local regulations that affect our operations and financial results 

we are subject to regulatory oversight from various federal state and local regulatory authorities in the eight states that we serve therefore our returns are continuously monitored and are subject to challenge for their reasonableness by the appropriate regulatory authorities or other thirdparty intervenors in the normal course of business as a regulated entity we often need to place assets in service and establish historical test periods before rate cases that seek to adjust our allowed returns to recover that investment can be filed further the regulatory review process can be lengthy in the context of traditional ratemaking because of this process we suffer the negative financial effects of having placed assets in service without the benefit of rate relief which is commonly referred to as “regulatory lag” 

however in the last several years a number of regulatory authorities in the states we serve have approved rate mechanisms that provide for annual adjustments to rates that allow us to recover the cost of investments made to replace existing infrastructure or reflect changes in our cost of service these mechanisms work to effectively reduce the regulatory lag inherent in the ratemaking process however regulatory lag could significantly increase if the regulatory authorities modify or terminate these rate mechanisms the regulatory process also involves the risk that regulatory authorities may i review our purchases of natural gas and adjust the amount of our gas costs that we pass through to our customers or ii limit the costs we may have incurred from our cost of service that can be recovered from customers 

we are also subject to laws regulations and other legal requirements enacted or adopted by federal state and local governmental authorities relating to protection of the environment and health and safety matters including those that govern discharges of substances into the air and water the management and disposal of hazardous substances and waste the cleanup of contaminated sites groundwater quality and availability plant and wildlife protection as well as work practices related to employee health and safety environmental legislation also requires that our facilities sites and other properties associated with our operations be operated maintained abandoned and reclaimed to the satisfaction of applicable regulatory authorities failure to comply with these laws regulations permits and licenses may expose us to fines penalties or interruptions in our operations that could be significant to our financial results in addition existing environmental regulations may be revised or our operations may become subject to new regulations 

some of our operations are subject to increased federal regulatory oversight that could affect our operations and financial results 

ferc has regulatory authority over some of our operations including the use and release of interstate pipeline and storage capacity ferc has adopted rules designed to prevent market power abuse and market manipulation and to promote compliance with ferc’s other rules policies and orders by companies engaged in the sale purchase transportation or storage of natural gas in interstate commerce these rules carry increased penalties for violations although we have taken steps to structure current and future transactions to comply with applicable current ferc regulations changes in ferc regulations or their interpretation by ferc or additional regulations issued by ferc in the future could also adversely affect our business financial condition or financial results 

we may experience increased federal state and local regulation of the safety of our operations 

the safety and protection of the public our customers and our employees is our top priority we constantly monitor and maintain our pipeline and distribution systems to ensure that natural gas is delivered safely reliably and efficiently through our network of more than 75000 miles of distribution and transmission lines as in recent years natural gas distribution and pipeline companies are continuing to encounter increasing federal state and local oversight of the safety of their operations although we believe these are costs ultimately recoverable through our rates the costs of complying with new laws and regulations may have at least a shortterm adverse impact on our operating costs and financial results 

greenhouse gas emissions or other legislation or regulations intended to address climate change could increase our operating costs adversely affecting our financial results growth cash flows and results of operations 

federal regional andor state legislative andor regulatory initiatives may attempt to control or limit the causes of climate change including greenhouse gas emissions such as carbon dioxide and methane such laws or regulations could impose costs tied to greenhouse gas emissions operational requirements or restrictions or additional charges to fund energy efficiency activities they could also provide a cost advantage to alternative energy sources impose costs or restrictions on end users of natural gas or result in other costs or requirements such as costs associated with the adoption of new infrastructure and technology to respond to new mandates the focus on climate change could adversely impact the reputation of fossil fuel products or services the occurrence of the foregoing events could put upward pressure on the cost of natural gas relative to other energy sources increase our costs and the prices we charge to customers reduce the demand for natural gas or cause fuel switching to other energy sources and impact the competitive position of natural gas and the ability to serve new or existing customers adversely affecting our business results of operations and cash flows 

operational risks 

we may incur significant costs and liabilities resulting from pipeline integrity and other similar programs and related repairs 

phmsa requires pipeline operators to develop integrity management programs to comprehensively evaluate certain areas along their pipelines and to take additional measures to protect pipeline segments located in “high consequence areas” where a leak or rupture could potentially do the most harm as a pipeline operator the company is required to 

• perform ongoing assessments of pipeline integrity 

• identify and characterize applicable threats to pipeline segments that could impact a “high consequence area” 

• improve data collection integration and analysis 

• repair and remediate the pipeline as necessary and 

• implement preventative and mitigating actions 

the company incurs significant costs associated with its compliance with existing phmsa and comparable state regulations although we believe these are costs ultimately recoverable through our rates the costs of complying with new laws and regulations may have at least a shortterm adverse impact on our operating costs and financial results for example the adoption of new regulations requiring more comprehensive or stringent safety standards could require installation of new or modified safety controls new capital projects or accelerated maintenance programs all of which could require a potentially significant increase in operating costs 

distributing transporting and storing natural gas involve risks that may result in accidents and additional operating costs 

our operations involve a number of hazards and operating risks inherent in storing and transporting natural gas that could affect the public safety and reliability of our distribution system while atmos energy with the support from each of its regulatory commissions is accelerating the replacement of aging pipeline infrastructure operating issues such as leaks accidents equipment problems and incidents including explosions and fire could result in legal liability repair and remediation costs increased operating costs significant increased capital expenditures regulatory fines and penalties and other costs and a loss of customer confidence we maintain liability and property insurance coverage in place for many of these hazards and risks however because some of our transmission pipeline and storage facilities are near or are in populated areas any loss of human life or adverse financial results resulting from such events could be large if these events were not fully covered by our general liability and property insurance which policies are subject to certain limits and deductibles our operations or financial results could be adversely affected 

if contracted gas supplies interstate pipeline andor storage services are not available or delivered in a timely manner our ability to meet our customers’ natural gas requirements may be impaired and our financial condition may be adversely affected 

in order to meet our customers’ annual and seasonal natural gas demands we must obtain a sufficient supply of natural gas interstate pipeline capacity and storage capacity if we are unable to obtain these either from our suppliers’ inability to deliver the contracted commodity or the inability to secure replacement quantities our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected if a substantial disruption to or reduction in interstate natural gas pipelines’ transmission and storage capacity occurred due to operational failures or disruptions legislative or regulatory actions hurricanes tornadoes floods terrorist or cyberattacks or acts of war our operations or financial results could be adversely affected 

our operations are subject to increased competition 

in residential and commercial customer markets our distribution operations compete with other energy products such as electricity and propane our primary product competition is with electricity for heating water heating and cooking increases in the price of natural gas could negatively impact our competitive position by decreasing the price benefits of natural gas to the consumer this could adversely impact our business if our customer growth slows or if our customers further conserve their use of gas resulting in reduced gas purchases and customer billings 

in the case of industrial customers such as manufacturing plants adverse economic conditions including higher gas costs could cause these customers to use alternative sources of energy such as electricity or bypass our systems in favor of special competitive contracts with lower perunit costs our pipeline and storage operations historically have faced limited competition from other existing intrastate pipelines and gas marketers seeking to provide or arrange transportation storage and other services for customers however in the last few years several new pipelines have been completed which has increased the level of competition in this segment of our business 

adverse weather conditions could affect our operations or financial results 

we have weathernormalized rates for approximately 97 percent of our residential and commercial revenues in our distribution operations which substantially mitigates the adverse effects of warmerthannormal weather for meters in those service areas however there is no assurance that we will continue to receive such regulatory protection from adverse weather in our rates in the future the loss of such weathernormalized rates could have an adverse effect on our operations and financial results in addition our operating results may continue to vary somewhat with the actual temperatures during the winter heating season additionally sustained cold weather could challenge our ability to adequately meet customer demand in our operations 

the operations and financial results of the company could be adversely impacted as a result of climate change 

as climate change occurs our businesses could be adversely impacted although we believe it is likely that any such resulting impacts would occur very gradually over a long period of time and thus would be difficult to quantify with any degree of specificity such climate change could cause shifts in population including customers moving away from our service territories 

it could also result in more frequent and more severe weather events such as hurricanes and tornadoes which could increase our costs to repair damaged facilities and restore service to our customers if we were unable to deliver natural gas to our customers our financial results would be impacted by lost revenues and we generally would have to seek approval from regulators to recover restoration costs to the extent we would be unable to recover those costs or if higher rates resulting from our recovery of such costs would result in reduced demand for our services our future business financial condition or financial results could be adversely impacted 

the inability to continue to hire train and retain operational technical and managerial personnel could adversely affect our results of operations 

although the average age of the employee base of atmos energy is not significantly changing year over year there are still a number of employees who will become eligible to retire within the next five to 10 years if we were unable to hire appropriate personnel or contractors to fill future needs the company could encounter operating challenges and increased costs primarily due to a loss of knowledge errors due to inexperience or the lengthy time period typically required to adequately train replacement personnel in addition higher costs could result from loss of productivity or increased safety compliance issues the inability to hire train and retain new operational technical and managerial personnel adequately and to transfer institutional knowledge and expertise could adversely affect our ability to manage and operate our business if we were unable to hire train and retain appropriately qualified personnel our results of operations could be adversely affected 

increased dependence on technology may hinder the company’s business operations and adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations if such technologies fail 

over the last several years the company has implemented or acquired a variety of technological tools including both companyowned information technology and technological services provided by outside parties these tools and systems support critical functions including scheduling and dispatching of service technicians automated meter reading systems customer care and billing operational plant logistics management reporting and external financial reporting the failure of these or other similarly important technologies or the company’s inability to have these technologies supported updated expanded or integrated into other technologies could hinder its business operations and adversely impact its financial condition and results of operations 

although the company has when possible developed alternative sources of technology and built redundancy into its computer networks and tools there can be no assurance that these efforts would protect against all potential issues related to the loss of any such technologies 

cyberattacks or acts of cyberterrorism could disrupt our business operations and information technology systems or result in the loss or exposure of confidential or sensitive customer employee or company information 

our business operations and information technology systems may be vulnerable to an attack by individuals or organizations intending to disrupt our business operations and information technology systems even though the company has implemented policies procedures and controls to prevent and detect these activities we use our information technology systems to manage our distribution and intrastate pipeline and storage operations and other business processes disruption of those systems could adversely impact our ability to safely deliver natural gas to our customers operate our pipeline and storage systems or serve our customers timely accordingly if such an attack or act of terrorism were to occur our operations and financial results could be adversely affected 

in addition we use our information technology systems to protect confidential or sensitive customer employee and company information developed and maintained in the normal course of our business any attack on such systems that would result in the unauthorized release of customer employee or other confidential or sensitive data could have a material adverse effect on our business reputation increase our costs and expose us to additional material legal claims and liability even though we have insurance coverage in place for many of these cyberrelated risks if such an attack or act of terrorism were to occur our operations and financial results could be adversely affected to the extent not fully covered by such insurance coverage 

natural disasters terrorist activities or other significant events could adversely affect our operations or financial results 

natural disasters are always a threat to our assets and operations in addition the threat of terrorist activities could lead to increased economic instability and volatility in the price of natural gas that could affect our operations also companies in our industry may face a heightened risk of exposure to actual acts of terrorism which could subject our operations to increased 

risks as a result the availability of insurance covering such risks may become more limited which could increase the risk that an event could adversely affect our operations or financial results 

financial economic and market risks 

our growth in the future may be limited by the nature of our business which requires extensive capital spending 

our operations are capitalintensive we must make significant capital expenditures on a longterm basis to modernize our distribution and transmission system and to comply with the safety rules and regulations issued by the regulatory authorities responsible for the service areas we operate in addition we must continually build new capacity to serve the growing needs of the communities we serve the magnitude of these expenditures may be affected by a number of factors including new regulations the general state of the economy and weather 

the liquidity required to fund our working capital capital expenditures and other cash needs is provided from a combination of internally generated cash flows and external debt and equity financing the cost and availability of borrowing funds from third party lenders or issuing equity is dependent on the liquidity of the credit markets interest rates and other market conditions this in turn may limit the amount of funds we can invest in our infrastructure 

the company is dependent on continued access to the credit and capital markets to execute our business strategy 

our longterm debt is currently rated as “investment grade” by standard  poor’s corporation and moody’s investors service inc similar to most companies we rely upon access to both shortterm and longterm credit and capital markets to satisfy our liquidity requirements if adverse credit conditions were to cause a significant limitation on our access to the private credit and public capital markets we could see a reduction in our liquidity a significant reduction in our liquidity could in turn trigger a negative change in our ratings outlook or even a reduction in our credit ratings by one or more of the credit rating agencies such a downgrade could further limit our access to private credit andor public capital markets and increase our costs of borrowing 

while we believe we can meet our capital requirements from our operations and the sources of financing available to us we can provide no assurance that we will continue to be able to do so in the future especially if the market price of natural gas increases significantly the future effects on our business liquidity and financial results of a deterioration of current conditions in the credit and capital markets could be material and adverse to us both in the ways described above or in other ways that we do not currently anticipate 

we are exposed to market risks that are beyond our control which could adversely affect our financial results 

we are subject to market risks beyond our control including i commodity price volatility caused by market supply and demand dynamics counterparty performance or counterparty creditworthiness and ii interest rate risk we are generally insulated from commodity price risk through our purchased gas cost mechanisms with respect to interest rate risk we have been operating in a relatively low interestrate environment in recent years compared to historical norms for both short and longterm interest rates however increases in interest rates could adversely affect our future financial results to the extent that we do not recover our actual interest expense in our rates 

the concentration of our operations in the state of texas exposes our operations and financial results to economic conditions weather patterns and regulatory decisions in texas 

approximately 70 percent of our consolidated operations are located in the state of texas this concentration of our business in texas means that our operations and financial results may be significantly affected by changes in the texas economy in general weather patterns and regulatory decisions by state and local regulatory authorities in texas 

a deterioration in economic conditions could adversely affect our customers and negatively impact our financial results 

any adverse changes in economic conditions in the united states especially in the states in which we operate could adversely affect the financial resources of many domestic households as a result our customers could seek to use less gas and it may be more difficult for them to pay their gas bills this would likely lead to slower collections and higher than normal levels of accounts receivable this in turn could increase our financing requirements additionally should economic conditions deteriorate our industrial customers could seek alternative energy sources which could result in lower sales volumes 

increased gas costs could adversely impact our customer base and customer collections and increase our level of indebtedness 

rapid increases in the costs of purchased gas would cause us to experience a significant increase in shortterm debt we must pay suppliers for gas when it is purchased which can be significantly in advance of when these costs may be recovered through the collection of monthly customer bills for gas delivered increases in purchased gas costs also slow our natural gas distribution collection efforts as customers are more likely to delay the payment of their gas bills leading to higher than normal 

accounts receivable this could result in higher shortterm debt levels greater collection efforts and increased bad debt expense 

the costs of providing health care benefits pension and postretirement health care benefits and related funding requirements may increase substantially 

we provide health care benefits a cashbalance pension plan and postretirement health care benefits to eligible fulltime employees the costs of providing health care benefits to our employees could significantly increase over time due to rapidly increasing health care inflation and any future legislative changes related to the provision of health care benefits the impact of additional costs which are likely to be passed on to the company is difficult to measure at this time 

the costs of providing a cashbalance pension plan to eligible fulltime employees prior to 2011 and postretirement health care benefits to eligible fulltime employees and related funding requirements could be influenced by changes in the market value of the assets funding our pension and postretirement health care plans any significant declines in the value of these investments due to sustained declines in equity markets or a reduction in bond yields could increase the costs of our pension and postretirement health care plans and related funding requirements in the future further our costs of providing such benefits and related funding requirements are also subject to a number of factors including i changing demographics including longer life expectancy of beneficiaries and an expected increase in the number of eligible former employees over the next five to ten years ii various actuarial calculations and assumptions which may differ materially from actual results due primarily to changing market and economic conditions including changes in interest rates and higher or lower withdrawal rates and iii future government regulation 

the costs to the company of providing these benefits and related funding requirements could also increase materially in the future should there be a material reduction in the amount of the recovery of these costs through our rates or should significant delays develop in the timing of the recovery of such costs which could adversely affect our financial results 

the outbreak of covid19 and its impact on business and economic conditions could negatively affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

the scale and scope of the recent covid19 outbreak the resulting pandemic and the impact on the economy and financial markets could adversely affect the company’s business results of operations and financial condition as an essential business the company continues to provide natural gas services and has implemented business continuity and emergency response plans to continue to provide natural gas services to customers and support the company’s operations while taking health and safety measures such as implementing worker distancing measures and using a remote workforce where possible however there is no assurance that the continued spread of covid19 and efforts to contain the virus including but not limited to voluntary and mandatory quarantines restrictions on travel limiting gatherings of people and reduced operations and extended closures of many businesses and institutions will not materially impact our business results of operations and financial condition in particular the continued spread of covid19 and efforts to contain the virus could 

 the situation surrounding covid19 remains fluid and the likelihood of an impact on the company that could be material increases the longer the virus impacts activity levels in the united states therefore it is difficult to predict with certainty the potential impact of the virus on the company’s business results of operations and financial condition 

to the extent the covid19 pandemic has an adverse impact on the company’s business results of operations and financial condition it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risk factors disclosed herein such as those relating to our ability to continue to access the credit and capital markets to execute our business strategy market risks beyond our control affecting our risk management activities including commodity price volatility counterparty performance or creditworthiness and interest rate risk and the impact of adverse economic conditions on our customers

several factors exist that could influence our future financial performance some of which are described in item 1a above “risk factors” they should be considered in connection with evaluating forwardlooking statements contained in this report or otherwise made by or on behalf of us since these factors could cause actual results and conditions to differ materially from those set out in such forwardlooking statements 

cautionary statement for the purposes of the safe harbor under the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 

the statements contained in this annual report on form 10k may contain “forwardlooking statements” within the meaning of section 27a of the securities act of 1933 and section 21e of the securities exchange act of 1934 all statements other than statements of historical fact included in this report are forwardlooking statements made in good faith by us and are intended to qualify for the safe harbor from liability established by the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 when used in this report or any other of our documents or oral presentations the words “anticipate” “believe” “estimate” “expect” “forecast” “goal” “intend” “objective” “plan” “projection” “seek” “strategy” or similar words are intended to identify forwardlooking statements such forwardlooking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the statements relating to our strategy operations markets services rates recovery of costs availability of gas supply and other factors these risks and uncertainties include the following federal state and local regulatory and political trends and decisions including the impact of rate proceedings before various state regulatory commissions increased federal regulatory oversight and potential penalties possible increased federal state and local regulation of the safety of our operations the impact of greenhouse gas emissions or other legislation or regulations intended to address climate change possible significant costs and liabilities resulting from pipeline integrity and other similar programs and related repairs the inherent hazards and risks involved in distributing transporting and storing natural gas the availability and accessibility of contracted gas supplies interstate pipeline andor storage services increased competition from energy suppliers and alternative forms of energy adverse weather conditions the impact of climate change the inability to continue to hire train and retain operational technical and managerial personnel increased dependence on technology that may hinder the companys business if such technologies fail the threat of cyberattacks or acts of cyberterrorism that could disrupt our business operations and information technology systems or result in the loss or exposure of confidential or sensitive customer employee or company information natural disasters terrorist activities or other events and other risks and uncertainties discussed herein all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond our control the capitalintensive nature of our business our ability to continue to access the credit and capital markets to execute our business strategy market risks beyond our control affecting our risk management activities including commodity price volatility counterparty performance or creditworthiness and interest rate risk the concentration of our operations in texas the impact of adverse economic conditions on our customers changes in the availability and price of natural gas increased costs of providing health care benefits along with pension and postretirement health care benefits and increased funding requirements the outbreak of covid19 and its impact on business and economic conditions accordingly while we believe these forwardlooking statements to be reasonable there can be no assurance that they will approximate actual experience or that the expectations derived from them will be realized further we undertake no obligation to update or revise any of our forwardlooking statements whether as a result of new information future events or otherwise 

critical accounting policies 

our consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and the related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ from estimates 

our significant accounting policies are discussed in note 2 to our consolidated financial statements the accounting policies discussed below are both important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and require management to make difficult subjective or complex accounting estimates accordingly these critical accounting policies are reviewed periodically by the audit committee of the board of directors 





nongaap financial measures 

as described further in note 13 to the consolidated financial statements due to the passage of kansas house bill 2585 we remeasured our deferred tax liability and updated our state deferred tax rate as a result we recorded a noncash income tax benefit of 210 million for the fiscal year ended september 30 2020 additionally the enactment of the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 the tcja required us to remeasure our deferred tax assets and liabilities at our new federal statutory income tax rate as of december 22 2017 the remeasurement of our net deferred tax liabilities resulted in the recognition of a noncash income tax benefit of 1588 million for the fiscal year ended september 30 2018 due to the nonrecurring nature of these benefits we believe that net income and diluted net income per share before the noncash income tax benefits provide a more relevant measure to analyze our financial performance than net income and diluted net income per share in order to allow investors to better analyze our core results and allow the information to be presented on a comparative basis accordingly the following discussion and analysis of our financial performance will reference adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share nongaap measures which are calculated as follows 



results of operations 

overview 

atmos energy strives to operate its businesses safely and reliably while delivering superior shareholder value our commitment to modernizing our natural gas distribution and transmission systems requires a significant level of capital spending we have the ability to begin recovering a significant portion of these investments timely through rate designs and mechanisms that reduce or eliminate regulatory lag and separate the recovery of our approved rate from customer usage patterns the execution of our capital spending program the ability to recover these investments timely and our ability to access the capital markets to satisfy our financing needs are the primary drivers that affect our financial performance 

we continue to execute our strategy well while managing the ongoing impacts of the coronavirus disease 2019 covid19 pandemic approximately 95 percent of our employees continue to work remotely as we provide essential services to ensure the safety and functionality of our critical infrastructure while taking precautions to provide a safe work environment for employees and customers 

during fiscal 2020  we recorded net income of 6014 million  or 489 per diluted share compared to net income of 5114 million  or 435 per diluted share in the prior year after adjusting for a nonrecurring income tax benefit recognized during fiscal 2020 we recorded adjusted net income of 5805 million  or 472 per diluted share for the year ended september 30 2020  

the following table details our consolidated net income by segment during the last three fiscal years 



the yearoveryear increase in adjusted net income of 691 million  or 14 percent largely reflects positive rate outcomes driven by safety and reliability spending and customer growth in our distribution business we did not experience a material change in yearoveryear residential revenue in our distribution segment due to covid19 however we did experience a 10 

percent yearoveryear decline in nonresidential revenue including service and other revenues primarily during the third and fourth fiscal quarter the decline is partially offset by a reduction in certain operating and maintenance expenses 

during the year ended september 30 2020  we implemented ratemaking regulatory actions which resulted in an increase in annual operating income of 1602 million and had ratemaking efforts in progress at september 30 2020  seeking a total increase in annual operating income of 1319 million  as of the date of this report we have received approval to implement 1066 million of this amount in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 

capital expenditures for fiscal 2020 increased 14 percent periodoverperiod to 19 billion  over 85 percent was invested to improve the safety and reliability of our distribution and transmission systems with a significant portion of this investment incurred under regulatory mechanisms that reduce regulatory lag to six months or less 

during fiscal 2020 we completed over 16 billion of longterm debt and equity financing as of september 30 2020  our equity capitalization was 60 percent and we had approximately 26 billion in total liquidity including cash and cash equivalents and funds available through equity forward sales agreements 

as a result of the continued contribution and stability of our earnings cash flows and capital structure our board of directors increased the quarterly dividend by 87 percent for fiscal 2021 

distribution segment 

the distribution segment is primarily comprised of our regulated natural gas distribution and related sales operations in eight states the primary factors that impact the results of our distribution operations are our ability to earn our authorized rates of return competitive factors in the energy industry and economic conditions in our service areas 

our ability to earn our authorized rates is based primarily on our ability to improve the rate design in our various ratemaking jurisdictions to minimize regulatory lag and ultimately separate the recovery of our approved rates from customer usage patterns improving rate design is a longterm process and is further complicated by the fact that we operate in multiple rate jurisdictions the “ratemaking activity” section of this form 10k describes our current rate strategy progress towards implementing that strategy and recent ratemaking initiatives in more detail 

revenues in our texas and mississippi service areas include franchise fees and gross receipt taxes which are calculated as a percentage of revenue inclusive of gas costs therefore the amount of these taxes included in revenue is influenced by the cost of gas and the level of gas sales volumes we record the associated tax expense as a component of taxes other than income 

the cost of gas typically does not have a direct impact on our operating income because these costs are recovered through our purchased gas cost adjustment mechanisms however higher gas costs may adversely impact our accounts receivable collections resulting in higher bad debt expense this risk is currently mitigated by rate design that allows us to collect from our customers the gas cost portion of our bad debt expense on approximately 78 percent of our residential and commercial revenues additionally higher gas costs may require us to increase borrowings under our credit facilities resulting in higher interest expense finally higher gas costs as well as competitive factors in the industry and general economic conditions may cause customers to conserve or in the case of industrial consumers to use alternative energy sources 

during fiscal 2020  we completed 17 regulatory proceedings in our distribution segment resulting in a 1109 million increase in annual operating income 

review of financial and operating results 

financial and operational highlights for our distribution segment for the fiscal years ended september 30 2020  2019 and 2018 are presented below 



 

fiscal year ended september 30 2020 compared with fiscal year ended september 30 2019 

operating income for our distribution segment increased 12 percent which primarily reflects 

 partially offset by 

 the yearoveryear change in other nonoperating expense and interest charges of 129 million primarily reflects increased capitalized interest and afudc primarily due to increased capitalized spending partially offset by an increase in interest expense due to the issuance of longterm debt during fiscal 2020 an increase in community support spending and an increase in pension and other postretirement nonservice costs 

the fiscal year ended september 30 2019 compared with fiscal year ended september 30 2018 for our distribution segment is described in item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of our annual report on form 10k for the fiscal year ended september 30 2019 

the following table shows our operating income by distribution division in order of total rate base for the fiscal years ended september 30 2020  2019 and 2018  the presentation of our distribution operating income is included for financial reporting purposes and may not be appropriate for ratemaking purposes 



pipeline and storage segment 

our pipeline and storage segment consists of the pipeline and storage operations of our apt division and our natural gas transmission operations in louisiana over 80 percent of this segments revenues are derived from transportation and storage services provided by apt to our midtex division other third party local distribution companies industrial and electric generation customers as well as marketers and producers 

our pipeline and storage segment is impacted by seasonal weather patterns competitive factors in the energy industry and economic conditions in our texas and louisiana service areas natural gas prices do not directly impact the results of this segment as revenues are derived from the transportation and storage of natural gas however natural gas prices and demand for natural gas could influence the level of drilling activity in the supply areas that we serve which may influence the level of throughput we may be able to transport on our pipelines further natural gas price differences between the various hubs that we serve in texas could influences the volumes of gas transported for shippers through texas pipeline systems and rates for such transportation 

the results of apt are also significantly impacted by the natural gas requirements of its local distribution company customers additionally its operations may be impacted by the timing of when costs and expenses are incurred and when these costs and expenses are recovered through its tariffs 

apt annually uses grip to recover capital costs incurred in the prior calendar year on february 14 2020 apt made a grip filing that covered changes in net investment from january 1 2019 through december 31 2019 with a requested increase in operating income of 493 million on may 20 2020 the rrc approved the companys grip filing 

on december 21 2016 the louisiana public service commission approved an annual increase of five percent to the demand fee charged by our natural gas transmission pipeline for each of the next 10 years effective october 1 2017 

review of financial and operating results 

financial and operational highlights for our pipeline and storage segment for the fiscal years ended september 30 2020  2019 and 2018 are presented below 



 fiscal year ended september 30 2020 compared with fiscal year ended september 30 2019 

operating income for our pipeline and storage segment increased seven percent which primarily reflects 

 partially offset by 

 the yearoveryear change in other nonoperating income and interest charges of 56 million reflects increased afudc primarily due to increased capital spending partially offset by an increase in interest expense due to the issuance of longterm debt during fiscal 2020 

the fiscal year ended september 30 2019 compared with fiscal year ended september 30 2018 for our pipeline and storage segment is described in item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of our annual report on form 10k for the fiscal year ended september 30 2019  

liquidity and capital resources 

the liquidity required to fund our working capital capital expenditures and other cash needs is provided from a combination of internally generated cash flows and external debt and equity financing as of september 30 2020 external debt financing is provided primarily through the issuance of longterm debt a 15 billion commercial paper program and four committed revolving credit facilities with a total availability from thirdparty lenders of approximately 22 billion the commercial paper program and credit facilities provide costeffective shortterm financing until it can be replaced with a balance of longterm debt and equity financing that achieves the companys desired capital structure with an equitytototalcapitalization ratio between 50 and 60  inclusive of longterm and shortterm debt additionally we have various uncommitted trade credit lines with our gas suppliers that we utilize to purchase natural gas on a monthly basis 

we have a shelf registration statement on file with the securities and exchange commission sec that allows us to issue up to 40 billion in common stock andor debt securities as of the date of this report approximately 24 billion of securities remained available for issuance under the shelf registration statement which expires february 11 2023 

we also have an atthemarket atm equity sales program that allows us to issue and sell shares of our common stock up to an aggregate offering price of 10 billion  which expires february 11 2023 at september 30 2020  approximately 552 million of equity is available for issuance under this atm equity sales program additionally as of september 30 2020  we have 3452 million in proceeds from previously executed forward sale agreements that must be settled during fiscal 2021 

the liquidity provided by these sources is expected to be sufficient to fund the companys working capital needs and capital expenditures program 

the following table presents our capitalization as of september 30 2020 and 2019  





cash flows 

our internally generated funds may change in the future due to a number of factors some of which we cannot control these factors include regulatory changes the price for our services the demand for such products and services margin requirements resulting from significant changes in commodity prices operational risks and other factors 

cash flows from operating investing and financing activities for the years ended september 30 2020  2019 and 2018 are presented below 



cash flows for the fiscal year ended september 30 2019 compared with fiscal year ended september 30 2018 is described in item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of our annual report on form 10k for the fiscal year ended september 30 2019  

cash flows from operating activities 

for the fiscal year ended september 30 2020  we generated cash flow from operating activities of 10380 million compared with 9688 million in the prior year the yearoveryear increase in operating cash flows reflects positive cash effects of rate case outcomes achieved in fiscal 2019 and working capital changes primarily as a result of the timing of gas cost recoveries under our purchase gas cost mechanisms 

cash flows from investing activities 

our capital expenditures are primarily used to improve the safety and reliability of our distribution and transmission system through pipeline replacement and system modernization and to enhance and expand our system to meet customer needs over the last three fiscal years approximately 87 percent of our capital spending has been committed to improving the safety and reliability of our system 

we allocate our capital spending among our service areas using risk management models and subject matter experts to identify assess and develop a plan of action to address our highest risk facilities we have regulatory mechanisms in most of our service areas that provide the opportunity to include approved capital costs in rate base on a periodic basis without being required to file a rate case these mechanisms permit us a reasonable opportunity to earn a fair return on our investment without compromising safety or reliability 

for the fiscal year ended september 30 2020  we had 19 billion in capital expenditures compared with 17 billion for the fiscal year ended september 30 2019  capital spending increased by 2422 million or 14 percent as a result of planned increases to modernize our system 

cash flows from financing activities 

our financing activities provided 8838 million and 7257 million in cash for fiscal years 2020 and 2019  

during the fiscal year ended september 30 2020  we received 16 billion in net proceeds from the issuance of longterm debt and equity we completed a public offering of 300 million of 2625 senior notes due 2029 and 500 million of 3375 senior notes due 2049 and entered into a two year 200 million term loan we received net proceeds from these offerings after the underwriting discount and offering expenses of 7917 million additionally during the fiscal year ended september 30 2020  we settled 6101916 shares that had been sold on a forward basis for net proceeds of approximately 624 million the net proceeds were used primarily to support capital spending reduce shortterm debt and other general corporate purposes 

additionally cash dividends increased due to a 95 percent increase in our dividend rate and an increase in shares outstanding 

during the fiscal year ended september 30 2019  we received 17 billion in net proceeds from the issuance of longterm debt and equity a portion of the net proceeds was used to repay at maturity our 450 million 850 unsecured senior notes and the related settlement of our interest rate swaps for 901 million to repay at maturity our 125 million floating rate term loan to reduce shortterm debt to support our capital spending and for other general corporate purposes cash dividends increased due to an 82 percent increase in our dividend rate and an increase in shares outstanding 

the following table shows the number of shares issued for the fiscal years ended september 30 2020  2019 and 2018  





credit ratings 

our credit ratings directly affect our ability to obtain shortterm and longterm financing in addition to the cost of such financing in determining our credit ratings the rating agencies consider a number of quantitative factors including but not limited to debt to total capitalization operating cash flow relative to outstanding debt operating cash flow coverage of interest and operating cash flow less dividends to debt in addition the rating agencies consider qualitative factors such as consistency of our earnings over time the risks associated with our business and the regulatory structures that govern our rates in the states where we operate 

our debt is rated by two rating agencies standard  poor’s corporation sp and moody’s investors service moody’s on december 16 2019 moodys upgraded our senior unsecured longterm debt rating to a1 and changed their outlook to stable citing our strong credit metrics as a result of continued improvement in rate design to minimize regulatory lag and our balanced fiscal policy 

as of september 30 2020  our outlook and current debt ratings which are all considered investment grade are as follows 



a significant degradation in our operating performance or a significant reduction in our liquidity caused by more limited access to the private and public credit markets as a result of deteriorating global or national financial and credit conditions could trigger a negative change in our ratings outlook or even a reduction in our credit ratings by the two credit rating agencies this would mean more limited access to the private and public credit markets and an increase in the costs of such borrowings 

a credit rating is not a recommendation to buy sell or hold securities the highest investment grade credit rating is aaa for sp and aaa for moody’s the lowest investment grade credit rating is bbb for sp and baa3 for moody’s our credit ratings may be revised or withdrawn at any time by the rating agencies and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating there can be no assurance that a rating will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if in its judgment circumstances so warrant 

debt covenants 

we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants as of september 30 2020  our debt covenants are described in note 7 to the consolidated financial statements 

contractual obligations and commercial commitments 

the following table provides information about contractual obligations and commercial commitments at september 30 2020  



  

 

we maintain supply contracts with several vendors that generally cover a period of up to one year commitments for estimated base gas volumes are established under these contracts on a monthly basis at contractually negotiated prices commitments for incremental daily purchases are made as necessary during the month in accordance with the terms of individual contracts our midtex division also maintains a limited number of longterm supply contracts to ensure a reliable source of gas for our customers in its service area which obligate it to purchase specified volumes at market and fixed prices 

at september 30 2020  we were committed to purchase 593 bcf within one year 570 bcf within two to three years and 01 bcf beyond three years under indexed contracts 

risk management activities 

in our distribution and pipeline and storage segments we use a combination of physical storage fixed physical contracts and fixed financial contracts to reduce our exposure to unusually large winterperiod gas price increases additionally we manage interest rate risk by entering into financial instruments to effectively fix the treasury yield component of the interest cost associated with anticipated financings 

we record our financial instruments as a component of risk management assets and liabilities which are classified as current or noncurrent based upon the anticipated settlement date of the underlying financial instrument substantially all of our financial instruments are valued using external market quotes and indices 

the following table shows the components of the change in fair value of our financial instruments for the fiscal year ended september 30 2020 in thousands

we are exposed to risks associated with commodity prices and interest rates commodity price risk is the potential loss that we may incur as a result of changes in the fair value of a particular instrument or commodity interestrate risk is the potential increased cost we could incur when we issue debt instruments or to provide financing and liquidity for our business activities additionally interestrate risk could affect our ability to issue cost effective equity instruments 

we conduct risk management activities in our distribution and pipeline and storage segments in our distribution segment we use a combination of physical storage fixedprice forward contracts and financial instruments primarily overthecounter swap and option contracts in an effort to minimize the impact of natural gas price volatility on our customers during the winter heating season our risk management activities and related accounting treatment are described in further detail in note 14 to the consolidated financial statements additionally our earnings are affected by changes in shortterm interest rates as a result of our issuance of shortterm commercial paper and our other shortterm borrowings 

commodity price risk 

we purchase natural gas for our distribution operations substantially all of the costs of gas purchased for distribution operations are recovered from our customers through purchased gas cost adjustment mechanisms therefore our distribution operations have limited commodity price risk exposure 

interest rate risk 

our earnings are exposed to changes in shortterm interest rates associated with our shortterm commercial paper program and other shortterm borrowings we use a sensitivity analysis to estimate our shortterm interest rate risk for purposes of this analysis we estimate our shortterm interest rate risk as the difference between our actual interest expense for the period and estimated interest expense for the period assuming a hypothetical average one percent increase in the interest rates associated with our shortterm borrowings had interest rates associated with our shortterm borrowings increased by an average of one percent our interest expense would not have materially increased during 2020

overview and strategy 

atmos energy corporation headquartered in dallas texas and incorporated in texas and virginia is one of the country’s largest naturalgasonly distributors based on number of customers we deliver safe clean reliable efficient affordable and abundant natural gas through regulated sales and transportation arrangements to over three million residential commercial public authority and industrial customers in eight states located primarily in the south we also operate one of the largest intrastate pipelines in texas based on miles of pipe 

atmos energys vision is to be the safest provider of natural gas services we intend to achieve this vision by 

 since 2011 our operating strategy has focused on modernizing our distribution and transmission system to improve safety and reliability since that time our capital expenditures have increased approximately 14 annually additionally during this period we have added new or modified existing regulatory mechanisms to reduce regulatory lag our ability to increase capital spending annually to modernize our system has increased our rate base which has resulted in rising earnings per share and shareholder value 

our core values include focusing on our employees and customers while conducting our business with honesty and integrity we continue to strengthen our culture through ongoing communications with our employees and enhanced employee training 

operating segments 

as of september 30 2019  we manage and review our consolidated operations through the following reportable segments which are discussed in further detail below 

 prior to disposition the natural gas marketing segment which was comprised of our natural gas marketing business was also a reportable segment 

distribution segment overview 

the following table summarizes key information about our six regulated natural gas distribution divisions presented in order of total rate base 



we operate in our service areas under terms of nonexclusive franchise agreements granted by the various cities and towns that we serve at september 30 2019  we held 1017 franchises having terms generally ranging from five to 35 years a significant number of our franchises expire each year which require renewal prior to the end of their terms historically we have successfully renewed these franchises and believe that we will continue to be able to renew our franchises as they expire 

revenues in this operating segment are established by regulatory authorities in the states in which we operate these rates are intended to be sufficient to cover the costs of conducting business including a reasonable return on invested capital in addition we transport natural gas for others through our distribution systems 

rates established by regulatory authorities often include cost adjustment mechanisms for costs that i are subject to significant price fluctuations compared to our other costs ii represent a large component of our cost of service and iii are generally outside our control 

purchased gas cost adjustment mechanisms represent a common form of cost adjustment mechanism purchased gas cost adjustment mechanisms provide a method of recovering purchased gas costs on an ongoing basis without filing a rate case because they provide a dollarfordollar offset to increases or decreases in the cost of natural gas therefore although substantially all of our distribution operating revenues fluctuate with the cost of gas that we purchase distribution contribution margin is generally not affected by fluctuations in the cost of gas 

additionally some jurisdictions have performancebased ratemaking adjustments to provide incentives to minimize purchased gas costs through improved storage management and use of financial instruments to reduce volatility in gas costs under the performancebased ratemaking adjustments purchased gas costs savings are shared between the company and its customers 

our supply of natural gas is provided by a variety of suppliers including independent producers marketers and pipeline companies withdrawals of gas from proprietary and contracted storage assets and peaking and spot purchase agreements as needed 

supply arrangements consist of both base load and swing supply peaking quantities and are contracted from our suppliers on a firm basis with various terms at market prices base load quantities are those that flow at a constant level throughout the month and swing supply quantities provide the flexibility to change daily quantities to match increases or decreases in requirements related to weather conditions 

except for local production purchases we select our natural gas suppliers through a competitive bidding process by periodically requesting proposals from suppliers that have demonstrated that they can provide reliable service we select these suppliers based on their ability to deliver gas supply to our designated firm pipeline receipt points at the lowest reasonable cost major suppliers during fiscal 2019 were castleton commodities merchant trading lp centerpoint energy services inc concord energy llc conocophillips company devon gas services lp hartree partners lp targa gas marketing llc tenaska marketing ventures  gas storage llc texla energy management inc and united energy trading llc 

the combination of base load peaking and spot purchase agreements coupled with the withdrawal of gas held in storage allows us the flexibility to adjust to changes in weather which minimizes our need to enter into longterm firm commitments 

we estimate our peakday availability of natural gas supply to be approximately 44 bcf the peakday demand for our distribution operations in fiscal 2019 was on march 4 2019 when sales to customers reached approximately 33 bcf 

currently our distribution divisions utilize 37 pipeline transportation companies both interstate and intrastate to transport our natural gas the pipeline transportation agreements are firm and many of them have “pipeline nonotice” storage service which provides for daily balancing between system requirements and nominated flowing supplies these agreements have been negotiated with the shortest term necessary while still maintaining our right of first refusal the natural gas supply for our midtex division is delivered primarily by our apt division 

to maintain our deliveries to high priority customers we have the ability and have exercised our right to curtail deliveries to certain customers under the terms of interruptible contracts or applicable state regulations or statutes our customers’ demand on our system is not necessarily indicative of our ability to meet current or anticipated market demands or immediate delivery requirements because of factors such as the physical limitations of gathering storage and transmission systems the duration and severity of cold weather the availability of gas reserves from our suppliers the ability to purchase additional supplies on a shortterm basis and actions by federal and state regulatory authorities curtailment rights provide us the flexibility to meet the humanneeds requirements of our customers on a firm basis priority allocations imposed by federal and state regulatory agencies as well as other factors beyond our control may affect our ability to meet the demands of our customers we do not anticipate any problems with obtaining additional gas supply as needed for our customers 

pipeline and storage segment overview 

our pipeline and storage segment consists of the pipeline and storage operations of apt and our natural gas transmission operations in louisiana apt is one of the largest intrastate pipeline operations in texas with a heavy concentration in the established natural gasproducing areas of central northern and eastern texas extending into or near the major producing areas of the barnett shale the texas gulf coast and the permian basin of west texas through its system apt provides transportation and storage services to our midtex division other third party local distribution companies industrial and electric generation customers marketers and producers as part of its pipeline operations apt owns and operates five underground storage reservoirs in texas 

revenues earned from transportation and storage services for apt are subject to traditional ratemaking governed by the rrc rates are updated through periodic filings made under texas’ grip grip allows us to include in our rate base annually approved capital costs incurred in the prior calendar year provided that we file a complete rate case at least once every five years the most recent of which was completed in august 2017 apt’s existing regulatory mechanisms allow certain transportation and storage services to be provided under marketbased rates 

our natural gas transmission operations in louisiana are comprised of a 21mile pipeline located in the new orleans louisiana area that is primarily used to aggregate gas supply for our distribution division in louisiana under a longterm contract and on a more limited basis to third parties the demand fee charged to our louisiana distribution division for these services is subject to regulatory approval by the louisiana public service commission we also manage two asset management plans in louisiana that serve distribution affiliates of the company which have been approved by applicable state regulatory commissions generally these asset management plans require us to share with our distribution customers a significant portion of the cost savings earned from these arrangements 

natural gas marketing segment overview 

through december 31 2016 we were engaged in a nonregulated natural gas marketing business which was conducted by atmos energy marketing aem aem’s primary business was to aggregate and purchase gas supply arrange transportation and storage logistics and ultimately deliver gas to customers at competitive prices additionally aem utilized proprietary and customerowned transportation and storage assets to provide various services to its customers as requested 

as more fully described in note 16  effective january 1 2017 we sold all of the equity interests of aem to centerpoint energy services inc ces a subsidiary of centerpoint energy inc as a result of the sale atmos energy fully exited the nonregulated natural gas marketing business accordingly these operations have been reported as discontinued operations 

ratemaking activity 

overview 

the method of determining regulated rates varies among the states in which our regulated businesses operate the regulatory authorities have the responsibility of ensuring that utilities in their jurisdictions operate in the best interests of customers while providing utility companies the opportunity to earn a reasonable return on their investment generally each regulatory authority reviews rate requests and establishes a rate structure intended to generate revenue sufficient to cover the costs of conducting business including a reasonable return on invested capital 

our rate strategy focuses on reducing or eliminating regulatory lag obtaining adequate returns and providing stable predictable margins which benefit both our customers and the company as a result of our ratemaking efforts in recent years atmos energy has 

 the following table provides a jurisdictional rate summary for our regulated operations as of september 30 2019  this information is for regulatory purposes only and may not be representative of our actual financial position 



  



  

 although substantial progress has been made in recent years to improve rate design and recovery of investment across our service areas we are continuing to seek improvements in rate design to address cost variations and pursue tariffs that reduce regulatory lag associated with investments further potential changes in federal energy policy federal safety regulations and changing economic conditions will necessitate continued vigilance by the company and our regulators in meeting the challenges presented by these external factors 

recent ratemaking activity 

the amounts described in the following sections represent the operating income that was requested or received in each rate filing which may not necessarily reflect the stated amount referenced in the final order as certain operating costs may have changed as a result of the commissions or other governmental authoritys final ruling the following table summarizes our ratemaking outcomes for the last three fiscal years the ratemaking outcomes for fiscal 2019 and 2018 include the effect of tax reform legislation enacted effective january 1 2018 and do not reflect the true economic benefit of the outcomes because they do not include the corresponding income tax benefit we will receive due to the decrease in our statutory tax rate 



additionally the following ratemaking efforts seeking 812 million in annual operating income were initiated during fiscal 2019 but had not been completed as of september 30 2019  



 4 the mississippi public service commission approved an increase in operating income of 76 million for the sir filing and 69 million for the srf filing new rates were implemented november 1 2019 

 

our recent ratemaking activity is discussed in greater detail below 

annual formula rate mechanisms 

as an instrument to reduce regulatory lag formula rate mechanisms allow us to refresh our rates on an annual basis without filing a formal rate case however these filings still involve discovery by the appropriate regulatory authorities prior to the final determination of rates under these mechanisms the following table summarizes our annual formula rate mechanisms by state 





the following table summarizes our annual formula rate mechanisms with effective dates during the fiscal years ended september 30 2019  2018 and 2017  





 rate case filings 

a rate case is a formal request from atmos energy to a regulatory authority to increase rates that are charged to customers rate cases may also be initiated when the regulatory authorities request us to justify our rates this process is referred to as a “show cause” action adequate rates are intended to provide for recovery of the company’s costs as well as a reasonable rate of return to our shareholders and ensure that we continue to safely deliver reliable reasonably priced natural gas service to our customers the following table summarizes our recent rate cases 



other ratemaking activity 

the following table summarizes other ratemaking activity during the fiscal years ended september 30 2019  2018 and 2017  



  

 other regulation 

we are regulated by various state or local public utility authorities we are also subject to regulation by the united states department of transportation with respect to safety requirements in the operation and maintenance of our transmission and distribution facilities in addition our operations are also subject to various state and federal laws regulating environmental matters from time to time we receive inquiries regarding various environmental matters we believe that our properties and operations comply with and are operated in conformity with applicable safety and environmental statutes and regulations there are no administrative or judicial proceedings arising under environmental quality statutes pending or known to be contemplated by governmental agencies which would have a material adverse effect on us or our operations our environmental claims have arisen primarily from former manufactured gas plant sites the pipeline and hazardous materials safety administration phmsa within the us department of transportation develops and enforces regulations for the safe reliable and environmentally sound operation of the pipeline transportation system the phmsa pipeline safety statutes provide for states to assume safety authority over intrastate natural transmission and distribution gas pipelines state pipeline safety programs are responsible for adopting and enforcing the federal and state pipeline safety regulations for intrastate natural gas transmission and distribution pipelines 

the federal energy regulatory commission ferc allows pursuant to section 311 of the natural gas policy act nga gas transportation services through our apt assets “on behalf of” interstate pipelines or local distribution companies served by interstate pipelines without subjecting these assets to the jurisdiction of the ferc under the nga additionally the ferc has regulatory authority over the use and release of interstate pipeline and storage capacity the ferc also has authority to detect and prevent market manipulation and to enforce compliance with ferc’s other rules policies and orders by companies engaged in the sale purchase transportation or storage of natural gas in interstate commerce we have taken what we believe are the necessary and appropriate steps to comply with these regulations 

the sec and the commodities futures trading commission pursuant to the dodd–frank act established numerous regulations relating to us financial markets we enacted procedures and modified existing business practices and contractual arrangements to comply with such regulations there are however some rulemaking proceedings that have not yet been finalized including those relating to capital and margin rules for non–cleared swaps we do not expect these rules to directly impact our business practices or collateral requirements however depending on the substance of these final rules in addition to certain international regulatory requirements still under development that are similar to dodd–frank our swap counterparties could be subject to additional and potentially significant capitalization requirements these regulations could motivate counterparties to increase our collateral requirements or cash postings 

competition 

although our regulated distribution operations are not currently in significant direct competition with any other distributors of natural gas to residential and commercial customers within our service areas we do compete with other natural gas suppliers and suppliers of alternative fuels for sales to industrial customers we compete in all aspects of our business with alternative energy sources including in particular electricity electric utilities offer electricity as a rival energy source and 

compete for the space heating water heating and cooking markets promotional incentives improved equipment efficiencies and promotional rates all contribute to the acceptability of electrical equipment the principal means to compete against alternative fuels is lower prices and natural gas historically has maintained its price advantage in the residential commercial and industrial markets 

our pipeline and storage operations have historically faced competition from other existing intrastate pipelines seeking to provide or arrange transportation storage and other services for customers in the last few years several new pipelines have been completed which has increased the level of competition in this segment of our business 

employees 

at september 30 2019  we had 4776 employees consisting of 4645 employees in our distribution operations and 131 employees in our pipeline and storage operations

 item 1a 

risk factors 

tableend

our financial and operating results are subject to a number of risk factors many of which are not within our control investors should carefully consider the following discussion of risk factors as well as other information appearing in this report these factors include the following 

we are subject to state and local regulations that affect our operations and financial results 

we are subject to regulatory oversight from various state and local regulatory authorities in the eight states that we serve therefore our returns are continuously monitored and are subject to challenge for their reasonableness by the appropriate regulatory authorities or other thirdparty intervenors in the normal course of business as a regulated entity we often need to place assets in service and establish historical test periods before rate cases that seek to adjust our allowed returns to recover that investment can be filed further the regulatory review process can be lengthy in the context of traditional ratemaking because of this process we suffer the negative financial effects of having placed assets in service without the benefit of rate relief which is commonly referred to as “regulatory lag” 

however in the last several years a number of regulatory authorities in the states we serve have approved rate mechanisms that provide for annual adjustments to rates that allow us to recover the cost of investments made to replace existing infrastructure or reflect changes in our cost of service these mechanisms work to effectively reduce the regulatory lag inherent in the ratemaking process however regulatory lag could significantly increase if the regulatory authorities modify or terminate these rate mechanisms the regulatory process also involves the risk that regulatory authorities may i review our 

purchases of natural gas and adjust the amount of our gas costs that we pass through to our customers or ii limit the costs we may have incurred from our cost of service that can be recovered from customers 

we are also subject to laws regulations and other legal requirements enacted or adopted by federal state and local governmental authorities relating to protection of the environment and health and safety matters including those that govern discharges of substances into the air and water the management and disposal of hazardous substances and waste the cleanup of contaminated sites groundwater quality and availability plant and wildlife protection as well as work practices related to employee health and safety environmental legislation also requires that our facilities sites and other properties associated with our operations be operated maintained abandoned and reclaimed to the satisfaction of applicable regulatory authorities failure to comply with these laws regulations permits and licenses may expose us to fines penalties or interruptions in our operations that could be significant to our financial results in addition existing environmental regulations may be revised or our operations may become subject to new regulations 

some of our operations are subject to increased federal regulatory oversight that could affect our operations and financial results 

ferc has regulatory authority over some of our operations including the use and release of interstate pipeline and storage capacity ferc has adopted rules designed to prevent market power abuse and market manipulation and to promote compliance with ferc’s other rules policies and orders by companies engaged in the sale purchase transportation or storage of natural gas in interstate commerce these rules carry increased penalties for violations although we have taken steps to structure current and future transactions to comply with applicable current ferc regulations changes in ferc regulations or their interpretation by ferc or additional regulations issued by ferc in the future could also adversely affect our business financial condition or financial results 

we may experience increased federal state and local regulation of the safety of our operations 

the safety and protection of the public our customers and our employees is our top priority we constantly monitor and maintain our pipeline and distribution systems to ensure that natural gas is delivered safely reliably and efficiently through our network of more than 75000 miles of distribution and transmission lines as in recent years natural gas distribution and pipeline companies are continuing to encounter increasing federal state and local oversight of the safety of their operations although we believe these are costs ultimately recoverable through our rates the costs of complying with new laws and regulations may have at least a shortterm adverse impact on our operating costs and financial results 

we may incur significant costs and liabilities resulting from pipeline integrity and other similar programs and related repairs 

phmsa requires pipeline operators to develop integrity management programs to comprehensively evaluate certain areas along their pipelines and to take additional measures to protect pipeline segments located in “high consequence areas” where a leak or rupture could potentially do the most harm as pipeline operator the company will be required to 

• perform ongoing assessments of pipeline integrity 

• identify and characterize applicable threats to pipeline segments that could impact a “high consequence area” 

• improve data collection integration and analysis 

• repair and remediate the pipeline as necessary and 

• implement preventative and mitigating actions 

the company incurs significant costs associated with its compliance with existing phmsa and comparable state regulations although we believe these are costs ultimately recoverable through our rates the costs of complying with new laws and regulations may have at least a shortterm adverse impact on our operating costs and financial results for example the adoption of new regulations requiring more comprehensive or stringent safety standards could require installation of new or modified safety controls new capital projects or accelerated maintenance programs all of which could require a potentially significant increase in operating costs 

distributing transporting and storing natural gas involve risks that may result in accidents and additional operating costs 

our operations involve a number of hazards and operating risks inherent in storing and transporting natural gas that could affect the public safety and reliability of our distribution system while atmos energy with the support from each of its regulatory commissions is accelerating the replacement of aging pipeline infrastructure operating issues such as as leaks accidents equipment problems and incidents including explosions and fire could result in legal liability repair and remediation costs increased operating costs significant increased capital expenditures regulatory fines and penalties and other costs and a loss of customer confidence we maintain liability and property insurance coverage in place for many of these hazards and risks however because some of our transmission pipeline and storage facilities are near or are in populated areas 

any loss of human life or adverse financial results resulting from such events could be large if these events were not fully covered by our general liability and property insurance which policies are subject to certain limits and deductibles our operations or financial results could be adversely affected 

our growth in the future may be limited by the nature of our business which requires extensive capital spending 

our operations are capitalintensive we must make significant capital expenditures on a longterm basis to modernize our distribution and transmission system to improve the safety and reliability and to comply with the safety rules and regulations issued by the regulatory authorities responsible for the service areas we operate in addition we must continually build new capacity to serve the growing needs of the communities we serve the magnitude of these expenditures may be affected by a number of factors including new regulations the general state of the economy and weather 

the liquidity required to fund our working capital capital expenditures and other cash needs is provided from a combination of internally generated cash flows and external debt and equity financing the cost and availability of borrowing funds from third party lenders or issuing equity is dependent on the liquidity of the credit markets interest rates and other market conditions this in turn may limit the amount of funds we can invest in our infrastructure 

the company is dependent on continued access to the credit and capital markets to execute our business strategy 

our longterm debt is currently rated as “investment grade” by standard  poor’s corporation and moody’s investors service inc similar to most companies we rely upon access to both shortterm and longterm credit and capital markets to satisfy our liquidity requirements if adverse credit conditions were to cause a significant limitation on our access to the private credit and public capital markets we could see a reduction in our liquidity a significant reduction in our liquidity could in turn trigger a negative change in our ratings outlook or even a reduction in our credit ratings by one or more of the credit rating agencies such a downgrade could further limit our access to private credit andor public capital markets and increase our costs of borrowing 

while we believe we can meet our capital requirements from our operations and the sources of financing available to us we can provide no assurance that we will continue to be able to do so in the future especially if the market price of natural gas increases significantly in the near term the future effects on our business liquidity and financial results of a deterioration of current conditions in the credit and capital markets could be material and adverse to us both in the ways described above or in other ways that we do not currently anticipate 

we are exposed to market risks that are beyond our control which could adversely affect our financial results 

we are subject to market risks beyond our control including i commodity price volatility caused by market supply and demand dynamics counterparty performance or counterparty creditworthiness and ii interest rate risk we are generally insulated from commodity price risk through our purchased gas cost mechanisms with respect to interest rate risk we have been operating in a relatively low interestrate environment in recent years compared to historical norms for both short and longterm interest rates however increases in interest rates could adversely affect our future financial results to the extent that we do not recover our actual interest expense in our rates 

the concentration of our operations in the state of texas exposes our operations and financial results to economic conditions weather patterns and regulatory decisions in texas 

approximately 70 percent of our consolidated operations are located in the state of texas this concentration of our business in texas means that our operations and financial results may be significantly affected by changes in the texas economy in general weather patterns and regulatory decisions by state and local regulatory authorities in texas 

a deterioration in economic conditions could adversely affect our customers and negatively impact our financial results 

any adverse changes in economic conditions in the united states especially in the states in which we operate could adversely affect the financial resources of many domestic households as a result our customers could seek to use less gas and it may be more difficult for them to pay their gas bills this would likely lead to slower collections and higher than normal levels of accounts receivable this in turn could increase our financing requirements additionally should economic conditions deteriorate our industrial customers could seek alternative energy sources which could result in lower sales volumes 

increased gas costs could adversely impact our customer base and customer collections and increase our level of indebtedness 

rapid increases in the costs of purchased gas would cause us to experience a significant increase in shortterm debt we must pay suppliers for gas when it is purchased which can be significantly in advance of when these costs may be recovered through the collection of monthly customer bills for gas delivered increases in purchased gas costs also slow our natural gas distribution collection efforts as customers are more likely to delay the payment of their gas bills leading to higher than normal 

accounts receivable this could result in higher shortterm debt levels greater collection efforts and increased bad debt expense 

if contracted gas supplies interstate pipeline andor storage services are not available or delivered in a timely manner our ability to meet our customers’ natural gas requirements may be impaired and our financial condition may be adversely affected 

in order to meet our customers’ annual and seasonal natural gas demands we must obtain a sufficient supply of natural gas interstate pipeline capacity and storage capacity if we are unable to obtain these either from our suppliers’ inability to deliver the contracted commodity or the inability to secure replacement quantities our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected if a substantial disruption to or reduction in interstate natural gas pipelines’ transmission and storage capacity occurred due to operational failures or disruptions legislative or regulatory actions hurricanes tornadoes floods terrorist or cyberattacks or acts of war our operations or financial results could be adversely affected 

our operations are subject to increased competition 

in residential and commercial customer markets our distribution operations compete with other energy products such as electricity and propane our primary product competition is with electricity for heating water heating and cooking increases in the price of natural gas could negatively impact our competitive position by decreasing the price benefits of natural gas to the consumer this could adversely impact our business if our customer growth slows or if our customers further conserve their use of gas resulting in reduced gas purchases and customer billings 

in the case of industrial customers such as manufacturing plants adverse economic conditions including higher gas costs could cause these customers to use alternative sources of energy such as electricity or bypass our systems in favor of special competitive contracts with lower perunit costs our pipeline and storage operations historically have faced limited competition from other existing intrastate pipelines and gas marketers seeking to provide or arrange transportation storage and other services for customers however in the last few years several new pipelines have been completed which has increased the level of competition in this segment of our business 

adverse weather conditions could affect our operations or financial results 

we have weathernormalized rates for approximately 97 percent of our residential and commercial meters in our distribution operations which substantially mitigates the adverse effects of warmerthannormal weather for meters in those service areas however there is no assurance that we will continue to receive such regulatory protection from adverse weather in our rates in the future the loss of such weathernormalized rates could have an adverse effect on our operations and financial results in addition our operating results may continue to vary somewhat with the actual temperatures during the winter heating season additionally sustained cold weather could challenge our ability to adequately meet customer demand in our operations 

the costs of providing health care benefits pension and postretirement health care benefits and related funding requirements may increase substantially 

we provide health care benefits a cashbalance pension plan and postretirement health care benefits to eligible fulltime employees the costs of providing health care benefits to our employees could significantly increase over time due to rapidly increasing health care inflation and any future legislative changes related to the provision of health care benefits the impact of additional costs which are likely to be passed on to the company is difficult to measure at this time 

the costs of providing a cashbalance pension plan to eligible fulltime employees prior to 2011 and postretirement health care benefits to eligible fulltime employees and related funding requirements could be influenced by changes in the market value of the assets funding our pension and postretirement health care plans any significant declines in the value of these investments due to sustained declines in equity markets or a reduction in bond yields could increase the costs of our pension and postretirement health care plans and related funding requirements in the future further our costs of providing such benefits and related funding requirements are also subject to a number of factors including i changing demographics including longer life expectancy of beneficiaries and an expected increase in the number of eligible former employees over the next five to ten years ii various actuarial calculations and assumptions which may differ materially from actual results due primarily to changing market and economic conditions including changes in interest rates and higher or lower withdrawal rates and iii future government regulation 

the costs to the company of providing these benefits and related funding requirements could also increase materially in the future should there be a material reduction in the amount of the recovery of these costs through our rates or should significant delays develop in the timing of the recovery of such costs which could adversely affect our financial results 

the inability to continue to hire train and retain operational technical and managerial personnel could adversely affect our results of operations 

although the average age of the employee base of atmos energy is not significantly changing year over year there are still a number of employees who will become eligible to retire within the next five to 10 years if we were unable to hire appropriate personnel or contractors to fill future needs the company could encounter operating challenges and increased costs primarily due to a loss of knowledge errors due to inexperience or the lengthy time period typically required to adequately train replacement personnel in addition higher costs could result from loss of productivity or increased safety compliance issues the inability to hire train and retain new operational technical and managerial personnel adequately and to transfer institutional knowledge and expertise could adversely affect our ability to manage and operate our business if we were unable to hire train and retain appropriately qualified personnel our results of operations could be adversely affected 

the operations and financial results of the company could be adversely impacted as a result of climate change 

as climate change occurs our businesses could be adversely impacted although we believe it is likely that any such resulting impacts would occur very gradually over a long period of time and thus would be difficult to quantify with any degree of specificity such climate change could cause shifts in population including customers moving away from our service territories 

it could also result in more frequent and more severe weather events such as hurricanes and tornadoes which could increase our costs to repair damaged facilities and restore service to our customers if we were unable to deliver natural gas to our customers our financial results would be impacted by lost revenues and we generally would have to seek approval from regulators to recover restoration costs to the extent we would be unable to recover those costs or if higher rates resulting from our recovery of such costs would result in reduced demand for our services our future business financial condition or financial results could be adversely impacted 

greenhouse gas emissions or other legislation or regulations intended to address climate change could increase our operating costs adversely affecting our financial results growth cash flows and results of operations 

federal regional andor state legislative andor regulatory initiatives may attempt to control or limit the causes of climate change including greenhouse gas emissions such as carbon dioxide and methane such laws or regulations could impose costs tied to greenhouse gas emissions operational requirements or restrictions or additional charges to fund energy efficiency activities they could also provide a cost advantage to alternative energy sources impose costs or restrictions on end users of natural gas or result in other costs or requirements such as costs associated with the adoption of new infrastructure and technology to respond to new mandates the focus on climate change could adversely impact the reputation of fossil fuel products or services the occurrence of the foregoing events could put upward pressure on the cost of natural gas relative to other energy sources increase our costs and the prices we charge to customers reduce the demand for natural gas or cause fuel switching to other energy sources and impact the competitive position of natural gas and the ability to serve new or existing customers adversely affecting our business results of operations and cash flows 

increased dependence on technology may hinder the company’s business operations and adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations if such technologies fail 

over the last several years the company has implemented or acquired a variety of technological tools including both companyowned information technology and technological services provided by outside parties these tools and systems support critical functions including scheduling and dispatching of service technicians automated meter reading systems customer care and billing operational plant logistics management reporting and external financial reporting the failure of these or other similarly important technologies or the company’s inability to have these technologies supported updated expanded or integrated into other technologies could hinder its business operations and adversely impact its financial condition and results of operations 

although the company has when possible developed alternative sources of technology and built redundancy into its computer networks and tools there can be no assurance that these efforts would protect against all potential issues related to the loss of any such technologies 

cyberattacks or acts of cyberterrorism could disrupt our business operations and information technology systems or result in the loss or exposure of confidential or sensitive customer employee or company information 

our business operations and information technology systems may be vulnerable to an attack by individuals or organizations intending to disrupt our business operations and information technology systems even though the company has implemented policies procedures and controls to prevent and detect these activities we use our information technology systems to manage our distribution and intrastate pipeline and storage operations and other business processes disruption of those systems could adversely impact our ability to safely deliver natural gas to our customers operate our pipeline and storage 

systems or serve our customers timely accordingly if such an attack or act of terrorism were to occur our operations and financial results could be adversely affected 

in addition we use our information technology systems to protect confidential or sensitive customer employee and company information developed and maintained in the normal course of our business any attack on such systems that would result in the unauthorized release of customer employee or other confidential or sensitive data could have a material adverse effect on our business reputation increase our costs and expose us to additional material legal claims and liability even though we have insurance coverage in place for many of these cyberrelated risks if such an attack or act of terrorism were to occur our operations and financial results could be adversely affected to the extent not fully covered by such insurance coverage 

natural disasters terrorist activities or other significant events could adversely affect our operations or financial results 

natural disasters are always a threat to our assets and operations in addition the threat of terrorist activities could lead to increased economic instability and volatility in the price of natural gas that could affect our operations also companies in our industry may face a heightened risk of exposure to actual acts of terrorism which could subject our operations to increased risks as a result the availability of insurance covering such risks may become more limited which could increase the risk that an event could adversely affect our operations or financial results

introduction 

this section provides management’s discussion of the financial condition changes in financial condition and results of operations of atmos energy corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries with specific information on results of operations and liquidity and capital resources it includes management’s interpretation of our financial results the factors affecting these results the major factors expected to affect future operating results and future investment and financing plans this discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 

several factors exist that could influence our future financial performance some of which are described in item 1a above “risk factors” they should be considered in connection with evaluating forwardlooking statements contained in this report or otherwise made by or on behalf of us since these factors could cause actual results and conditions to differ materially from those set out in such forwardlooking statements 

cautionary statement for the purposes of the safe harbor under the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 

the statements contained in this annual report on form 10k may contain “forwardlooking statements” within the meaning of section 27a of the securities act of 1933 and section 21e of the securities exchange act of 1934 all statements other than statements of historical fact included in this report are forwardlooking statements made in good faith by us and are intended to qualify for the safe harbor from liability established by the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 when used in this report or any other of our documents or oral presentations the words “anticipate” “believe” “estimate” “expect” “forecast” “goal” “intend” “objective” “plan” “projection” “seek” “strategy” or similar words are intended to identify forwardlooking statements such forwardlooking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the statements relating to our strategy operations markets services rates recovery of costs availability of gas supply and other factors these risks and uncertainties include the following state and local regulatory trends and decisions including the impact of rate proceedings before various state regulatory commissions increased federal regulatory oversight and potential penalties possible increased federal state and local regulation of the safety of our operations possible significant costs and liabilities resulting from pipeline integrity and other similar programs and related repairs the inherent hazards and risks involved in distributing transporting and storing natural gas the capitalintensive nature of our business our ability to continue to access the credit and capital markets to execute our business strategy market risks beyond our control affecting our risk management activities including commodity price volatility counterparty performance or creditworthiness and interest rate risk the concentration of our operations in texas the impact of adverse economic conditions on our customers changes in the availability and price of natural gas the availability and accessibility of contracted gas supplies interstate pipeline andor storage services increased competition from energy suppliers and alternative forms of energy adverse weather conditions increased costs of providing health care benefits along with pension and postretirement health care benefits and increased funding requirements the inability to continue to hire train and retain operational technical and managerial personnel the impact of climate change the impact of greenhouse gas emissions or other legislation or regulations intended to address climate change increased dependence on technology that may hinder the companys business if such technologies fail the threat of cyberattacks or acts of cyberterrorism that could disrupt our business operations and information technology systems or result in the loss or exposure of confidential or sensitive customer employee or company information natural disasters terrorist activities or other events and other risks and uncertainties discussed herein all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond our control accordingly while we believe these forwardlooking statements to be reasonable there can be no assurance that they will approximate actual experience or that the expectations derived from them will be realized further we undertake no obligation to update or revise any of our forwardlooking statements whether as a result of new information future events or otherwise 

critical accounting policies 

our consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and the related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ from estimates 

our significant accounting policies are discussed in notes 2 and 16 to our consolidated financial statements the accounting policies discussed below are both important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and require management to make difficult subjective or complex accounting estimates accordingly these critical accounting policies are reviewed periodically by the audit committee of the board of directors 





nongaap financial measures 

our operations are affected by the cost of natural gas which is passed through to our customers without markup and includes commodity price transportation storage injection and withdrawal fees and settlements of financial instruments used to mitigate commodity price risk these costs are reflected in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income as purchased gas cost therefore increases in the cost of gas are offset by a corresponding increase in revenues accordingly we believe contribution margin a nongaap financial measure defined as operating revenues less purchased gas cost is a more useful and relevant measure to analyze our financial performance than operating revenues as such the following discussion and analysis of our financial performance will reference contribution margin rather than operating revenues and purchased gas cost individually further the term contribution margin is not intended to represent operating income the most comparable gaap financial measure as an indicator of operating performance and is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies 

as described further in note 13  the enactment of the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 the tcja required us to remeasure our deferred tax assets and liabilities at our new federal statutory income tax rate as of december 22 2017 the remeasurement of our net deferred tax liabilities resulted in the recognition of a noncash income tax benefit of 1588 million for the fiscal year ended september 30 2018  due to the nonrecurring nature of this benefit we believe that net income and diluted net income per share before the noncash income tax benefit provide a more relevant measure to analyze our financial performance than net income and diluted net income per share in order to allow investors to better analyze our core results and allow the information to be presented on a comparative basis to the prior year accordingly the following discussion and analysis of our financial performance will reference adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share nongaap measures which are calculated as follows 



results of operations 

overview 

atmos energy strives to operate its businesses safely and reliably while delivering superior shareholder value our commitment to modernizing our natural gas distribution and transmission systems requires a significant level of capital spending we have the ability to begin recovering a significant portion of these investments timely through rate designs and mechanisms that reduce or eliminate regulatory lag and separate the recovery of our approved rate from customer usage patterns the execution of our capital spending program the ability to recover these investments timely and our ability to access the capital markets to satisfy our financing needs are the primary drivers that affect our financial performance 

during fiscal 2019  we recorded net income of 5114 million  or 435 per diluted share compared to net income of 6031 million  or 543 per diluted share in the prior year after adjusting for the nonrecurring benefit recognized after implementing the tcja in fiscal 2018 we recorded adjusted net income of 4443 million  or 400 per diluted share for the year ended september 30 2018  

the following table details our consolidated net income by segment during the last three fiscal years 



the yearoveryear increase in adjusted net income of 671 million  or 15 percent largely reflects positive rate outcomes driven by safety and reliability spending customer growth in our distribution business positive contribution margin in our pipeline and storage business primarily due to positive supply and demand dynamics affecting the permian basin due to wider spreads and the impact of the tcja on our effective income tax rate during the year ended september 30 2019  we implemented ratemaking regulatory actions which resulted in an increase in annual operating income of 1167 million and had nine ratemaking efforts in progress at september 30 2019  seeking a total increase in annual operating income of 812 million  

capital expenditures for fiscal 2019 increased 15 percent periodoverperiod to 17 billion  over 80 percent was invested to improve the safety and reliability of our distribution and transmission systems with a significant portion of this investment incurred under regulatory mechanisms that reduce regulatory lag to six months or less we funded a portion of our currentyear capital expenditures program through operating cash flows of 9688 million  additionally we completed over 2 billion in external financing during the year ended september 30 2019 with the issuance of 11 billion in 30year senior notes and over 10 billion of common stock of which approximately 470 million was allocated to forward sale agreements which have not yet been settled the net proceeds from these issuances together with available cash were used to repay at maturity our 450 million 85 unsecured senior notes to repay shortterm debt under our commercial paper program to fund capital spending and for general corporate purposes 

additionally on october 2 2019 we completed a public offering of 300 million of 2625 senior notes due 2029 and 500 million of 3375 senior notes due 2049 we received net proceeds from the offering after underwriting discount and estimated offering expenses of approximately 7916 million  that were used for general corporate purposes including the repayment of working capital borrowings pursuant to our commercial paper program the effective interest rate of these notes is 272 and 342 after giving effect to the offering costs 

as a result of the continued contribution and stability of our earnings cash flows and capital structure our board of directors increased the quarterly dividend by 95 percent for fiscal 2020 

distribution segment 

the distribution segment is primarily comprised of our regulated natural gas distribution and related sales operations in eight states the primary factors that impact the results of our distribution operations are our ability to earn our authorized rates of return competitive factors in the energy industry and economic conditions in our service areas 

our ability to earn our authorized rates is based primarily on our ability to improve the rate design in our various ratemaking jurisdictions to minimize regulatory lag and ultimately separate the recovery of our approved rates from customer usage patterns improving rate design is a longterm process and is further complicated by the fact that we operate in multiple rate jurisdictions the “ratemaking activity” section of this form 10k describes our current rate strategy progress towards implementing that strategy and recent ratemaking initiatives in more detail 

we are generally able to pass the cost of gas through to our customers without markup under purchased gas cost adjustment mechanisms therefore increases in the cost of gas are offset by a corresponding increase in revenues contribution margin in our texas and mississippi service areas include franchise fees and gross receipt taxes which are calculated as a percentage of revenue inclusive of gas costs therefore the amount of these taxes included in revenue is influenced by the cost of gas and the level of gas sales volumes we record the associated tax expense as a component of taxes other than income although changes in revenue related taxes arising from changes in gas costs affect contribution margin over time the impact is offset within operating income 

although the cost of gas typically does not have a direct impact on our contribution margin higher gas costs may adversely impact our accounts receivable collections resulting in higher bad debt expense and may require us to increase borrowings under our credit facilities resulting in higher interest expense in addition higher gas costs as well as competitive factors in the industry and general economic conditions may cause customers to conserve or in the case of industrial consumers to use alternative energy sources currently gas cost risk has been mitigated by rate design that allows us to collect 

from our customers the gas cost portion of our bad debt expense on approximately 76 percent of our residential and commercial margins 

during fiscal 2019  we completed 22 regulatory proceedings in our distribution segment resulting in a 675 million increase in annual operating income 

review of financial and operating results 

financial and operational highlights for our distribution segment for the fiscal years ended september 30 2019  2018 and 2017 are presented below 



 

fiscal year ended september 30 2019 compared with fiscal year ended september 30 2018 

income before income taxes for our distribution segment increased slightly primarily due to a 337 million increase in contribution margin and a combined 187 million decrease in other nonoperating expense and interest charges partially offset by a  486 million increase in operating expenses the yeartodate increase in contribution margin primarily reflects 

 operating expenses which include operating and maintenance expense provision for doubtful accounts depreciation and amortization expense and taxes other than income increased 486 million primarily due to 



the yearoveryear decrease in other nonoperating expense and interest charges of 187 million is primarily due to increased capitalized interest and afudc as well as decreases due to the adoption of new accounting standards as discussed further in note 2 we are now required to recognize changes in the fair value of our equity securities formerly designated as availableforsale on our consolidated statements of comprehensive income and the components of net periodic cost other than the service cost component are included in other nonoperating expense in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income these decreases are partially offset by an increase in interest expense due to the issuance of longterm debt during fiscal 2019 

the decrease in income tax expense reflects a reduction in our effective tax rate from 261 to 211 as a result of the tcja 

the fiscal year ended september 30 2018 compared with fiscal year ended september 30 2017 for our distribution segment is described in item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of our annual report on form 10k for the fiscal year ended september 30 2018 

the following table shows our operating income by distribution division in order of total rate base for the fiscal years ended september 30 2019  2018 and 2017  the presentation of our distribution operating income is included for financial reporting purposes and may not be appropriate for ratemaking purposes 



pipeline and storage segment 

our pipeline and storage segment consists of the pipeline and storage operations of apt and our natural gas transmission operations in louisiana apt is one of the largest intrastate pipeline operations in texas with a heavy concentration in the established natural gas producing areas of central northern and eastern texas extending into or near the major producing areas of the barnett shale the texas gulf coast and the permian basin of west texas apt provides transportation and storage services to our midtex division other third party local distribution companies industrial and electric generation customers as well as marketers and producers as part of its pipeline operations apt owns and operates five underground storage facilities in texas 

our natural gas transmission operations in louisiana are comprised of a 21mile pipeline located in the new orleans louisiana area that is primarily used to aggregate gas supply for our distribution division in louisiana under a longterm contract and on a more limited basis to third parties the demand fee charged to our louisiana distribution division for these services is subject to regulatory approval by the louisiana public service commission we also manage two asset management plans which have been approved by applicable state regulatory commissions generally these asset management plans require us to share with our distribution customers a significant portion of the cost savings earned from these arrangements 

our pipeline and storage segment is impacted by seasonal weather patterns competitive factors in the energy industry and economic conditions in our texas and louisiana service areas natural gas prices do not directly impact the results of this segment as revenues are derived from the transportation and storage of natural gas however natural gas prices and demand for natural gas could influence the level of drilling activity in the supply areas that we serve which may influence the level of throughput we may be able to transport on our pipelines further natural gas price differences between the various hubs that we serve in texas could influences the volumes of gas transported for shippers through texas pipeline systems and rates for such transportation 

the results of apt are also significantly impacted by the natural gas requirements of its local distribution company customers additionally its operations may be impacted by the timing of when costs and expenses are incurred and when these costs and expenses are recovered through its tariffs 

apt annually uses grip to recover capital costs incurred in the prior calendar year on february 15 2019 apt made a grip filing that covered changes in net investment from january 1 2018 through december 31 2018 with a requested increase in operating income of 492 million on may 7 2019 the rrc approved the companys grip filing 

on december 21 2016 the louisiana public service commission approved an annual increase of five percent to the demand fee charged by our natural gas transmission pipeline for each of the next 10 years effective october 1 2017 

review of financial and operating results 

financial and operational highlights for our pipeline and storage segment for the fiscal years ended september 30 2019  2018 and 2017 are presented below 



fiscal year ended september 30 2019 compared with fiscal year ended september 30 2018 

income before income taxes for our pipeline and storage segment increased 18 percent primarily due to a 616 million increase in contribution margin partially offset by a 286 million increase in operating expenses the increase in contribution margin primarily reflects 

 the increase in operating expenses is primarily due to higher depreciation expense of 116 million associated with increased capital investments and higher system maintenance expense of 153 million primarily due to spending on hydro testing and inline inspections 

the decrease in income tax expense primarily reflects a reduction in our effective tax rate from 298 to 217 as a result of the tcja 

the fiscal year ended september 30 2018 compared with fiscal year ended september 30 2017 for our pipeline and storage segment is described in item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of our annual report on form 10k for the fiscal year ended september 30 2018 

natural gas marketing segment 

through december 31 2016 we were engaged in an unregulated natural gas marketing business which was conducted by atmos energy marketing aem aem’s primary business was to aggregate and purchase gas supply arrange transportation and storage logistics and ultimately deliver gas to customers at competitive prices 

as more fully described in note 16  effective january 1 2017 we sold all of the equity interests of aem to centerpoint energy services inc ces a subsidiary of centerpoint energy inc as a result of the sale atmos energy fully exited the nonregulated natural gas marketing business accordingly a gain on sale from discontinued operations for 27 million was recorded and net income of 110 million for aem is reported as discontinued operations for the year ended september 30 2017 

the fiscal year ended september 30 2018 compared with fiscal year ended september 30 2017 for our natural gas marketing segment is described in item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of our annual report on form 10k for the fiscal year ended september 30 2018 

liquidity and capital resources 

the liquidity required to fund our working capital capital expenditures and other cash needs is provided from a combination of internally generated cash flows and external debt and equity financing external debt financing is provided primarily through the issuance of longterm debt a 15 billion commercial paper program and three committed revolving credit facilities with a total availability from thirdparty lenders of approximately 15 billion the commercial paper program and credit facilities provide costeffective shortterm financing until it can be replaced with a balance of longterm debt and equity financing that achieves the companys desired capital structure with an equitytototalcapitalization ratio between 50 and 60  inclusive of longterm and shortterm debt additionally we have various uncommitted trade credit lines with our gas suppliers that we utilize to purchase natural gas on a monthly basis the liquidity provided by these sources is expected to be sufficient to fund the companys working capital needs and capital expenditures program for fiscal year 2020 and beyond 

to support our capital market activities we filed a registration statement with the sec on november 13 2018 that permits us to issue a total of 30 billion in common stock andor debt securities the registration statement replaced our previous registration statement that was effectively exhausted in october 2018 at september 30 2019  approximately 13 billion of securities remained available for issuance under the shelf registration statement 

on november 19 2018 we filed a prospectus supplement under the registration statement relating to an atthemarket atm equity sales program under which we may issue and sell shares of our common stock up to an aggregate offering price of 500 million including shares of common stock that may be sold pursuant to forward sale agreements entered into concurrently with the atm equity sales program at september 30 2019  approximately 75 million remained available under the atm equity sales program 

for the year ended september 30 2019  we completed over 2 billion of longterm debt and equity financing during fiscal 2019 we executed forward sales with various forward sellers who borrowed and sold 6813135 shares of our common stock for initial aggregate proceeds of approximately 673 million 

the following table summarizes the remaining availability under our various forward sales as of september 30 2019  



the following table presents our capitalization as of september 30 2019 and 2018  



cash flows 

our internally generated funds may change in the future due to a number of factors some of which we cannot control these factors include regulatory changes the price for our services the demand for such products and services margin requirements resulting from significant changes in commodity prices operational risks and other factors 

cash flows from operating investing and financing activities for the years ended september 30 2019  2018 and 2017 are presented below 



cash flows for the fiscal year ended september 30 2018 compared with fiscal year ended september 30 2017 is described in item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of our annual report on form 10k for the fiscal year ended september 30 2018 

cash flows from operating activities 

for the fiscal year ended september 30 2019  we generated cash flow from operating activities of 9688 million compared with 11247 million in the prior year the yearoveryear decrease is primarily attributable to the change in net income and working capital changes particularly in our distribution segment resulting from the timing of payments for natural gas purchases and deferred gas cost recoveries 

cash flows from investing activities 

our capital expenditures are primarily used to improve the safety and reliability of our distribution and transmission system through pipeline replacement and system modernization and to enhance and expand our system to meet customer needs over the last three fiscal years approximately 84 percent of our capital spending has been committed to improving the safety and reliability of our system 

we allocate our capital spending among our service areas using risk management models and subject matter experts to identify assess and develop a plan of action to address our highest risk facilities we have regulatory mechanisms in most of our service areas that provide the opportunity to include approved capital costs in rate base on a periodic basis without being required to file a rate case these mechanisms permit us a reasonable opportunity to earn a fair return on our investment without compromising safety or reliability 

for the fiscal year ended september 30 2019  we had 17 billion in capital expenditures compared with 15 billion for the fiscal year ended september 30 2018  capital spending increased by 2259 million or 15 as a result of planned increases in our distribution segment to repair and replace vintage pipe and increases in spending in our pipeline and storage segment to improve the reliability of gas service to our local distribution company customers 

cash flows from financing activities 

our financing activities provided 7257 million and 3263 million in cash for fiscal years 2019 and 2018  our significant financing activities for the fiscal years ended september 30 2019 and 2018 are summarized as follows 

during the fiscal year ended september 30 2019  we received 17 billion in net proceeds from the issuance and repayment of longterm debt and issuance of equity this activity is summarized below 

 

 

 

 

 

additionally cash dividends increased due to an 82 percent increase in our dividend rate and an increase in shares outstanding 

during the fiscal year ended september 30 2018  we used 3951 million in net proceeds from equity financing to reduce shortterm debt to support our capital spending and for other general corporate purposes 

the following table shows the number of shares issued for the fiscal years ended september 30 2019  2018 and 2017  





credit ratings 

our credit ratings directly affect our ability to obtain shortterm and longterm financing in addition to the cost of such financing in determining our credit ratings the rating agencies consider a number of quantitative factors including but not limited to debt to total capitalization operating cash flow relative to outstanding debt operating cash flow coverage of interest and operating cash flow less dividends to debt in addition the rating agencies consider qualitative factors such as consistency of our earnings over time the risks associated with our business and the regulatory structures that govern our rates in the states where we operate 

our debt is rated by two rating agencies standard  poor’s corporation sp and moody’s investors service moody’s on december 14 2018 moodys affirmed our debt ratings and changed their outlook from stable to positive citing improvements to our regulatory construct that reduce investment recovery lag and our balanced fiscal policy as of september 30 2019  sp maintained a stable outlook our current debt ratings are all considered investment grade and are as follows 



a significant degradation in our operating performance or a significant reduction in our liquidity caused by more limited access to the private and public credit markets as a result of deteriorating global or national financial and credit conditions could trigger a negative change in our ratings outlook or even a reduction in our credit ratings by the two credit rating agencies this would mean more limited access to the private and public credit markets and an increase in the costs of such borrowings 

a credit rating is not a recommendation to buy sell or hold securities the highest investment grade credit rating is aaa for sp and aaa for moody’s the lowest investment grade credit rating is bbb for sp and baa3 for moody’s our credit ratings may be revised or withdrawn at any time by the rating agencies and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating there can be no assurance that a rating will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if in its judgment circumstances so warrant 

debt covenants 

we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants as of september 30 2019  our debt covenants are described in note 6 to the consolidated financial statements 

contractual obligations and commercial commitments 

the following table provides information about contractual obligations and commercial commitments at september 30 2019  



  

 

we maintain supply contracts with several vendors that generally cover a period of up to one year commitments for estimated base gas volumes are established under these contracts on a monthly basis at contractually negotiated prices commitments for incremental daily purchases are made as necessary during the month in accordance with the terms of individual contracts our midtex division also maintains a limited number of longterm supply contracts to ensure a reliable source of gas for our customers in its service area which obligate it to purchase specified volumes at market and fixed prices at september 30 2019  we were committed to purchase 401 bcf within one year and 16 bcf within two to three years under indexed contracts 

the change in deferred taxes related to our cost of service ratemaking referred to as excess deferred taxes was reclassified into a regulatory liability and will be returned to ratepayers in accordance with regulatory requirements at september 30 2019  this liability totaled 7263 million  we received approval from regulators to return excess deferred taxes in most of our jurisdictions in accordance with regulatory proceedings on a provisional basis over periods ranging from 13 to 

51 years in our remaining jurisdictions the treatment of the effects of the tcja in rates is being addressed in ongoing or will be addressed in future regulatory proceedings see note 13 for further information 

risk management activities 

in our distribution and pipeline and storage segments we use a combination of physical storage fixed physical contracts and fixed financial contracts to reduce our exposure to unusually large winterperiod gas price increases in the past we managed interest rate risk by entering into financial instruments to effectively fix the treasury yield component of the interest cost associated with anticipated financings 

we record our financial instruments as a component of risk management assets and liabilities which are classified as current or noncurrent based upon the anticipated settlement date of the underlying financial instrument substantially all of our financial instruments are valued using external market quotes and indices 

the following table shows the components of the change in fair value of our financial instruments for the fiscal year ended september 30 2019 in thousands 



the fair value of our financial instruments at september 30 2019  is presented below by time period and fair value source

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend

we are exposed to risks associated with commodity prices and interest rates commodity price risk is the potential loss that we may incur as a result of changes in the fair value of a particular instrument or commodity interestrate risk is the potential increased cost we could incur when we issue debt instruments or to provide financing and liquidity for our business activities additionally interestrate risk could affect our ability to issue cost effective equity instruments 

we conduct risk management activities in our distribution and pipeline and storage segments in our distribution segment we use a combination of physical storage fixedprice forward contracts and financial instruments primarily overthecounter swap and option contracts in an effort to minimize the impact of natural gas price volatility on our customers during the winter heating season our risk management activities and related accounting treatment are described in further detail in note 14 to the consolidated financial statements additionally our earnings are affected by changes in shortterm interest rates as a result of our issuance of shortterm commercial paper and our other shortterm borrowings 

commodity price risk 

we purchase natural gas for our distribution operations substantially all of the costs of gas purchased for distribution operations are recovered from our customers through purchased gas cost adjustment mechanisms therefore our distribution operations have limited commodity price risk exposure 

interest rate risk 

our earnings are exposed to changes in shortterm interest rates associated with our shortterm commercial paper program and other shortterm borrowings we use a sensitivity analysis to estimate our shortterm interest rate risk for purposes of this analysis we estimate our shortterm interest rate risk as the difference between our actual interest expense for the period and estimated interest expense for the period assuming a hypothetical average one percent increase in the interest rates associated with our shortterm borrowings had interest rates associated with our shortterm borrowings increased by an average of one percent our interest expense would not have been materially increased during 2019

business

overview and strategy 

atmos energy corporation headquartered in dallas texas and incorporated in texas and virginia is one of the country’s largest naturalgasonly distributors based on number of customers we deliver safe clean reliable efficient affordable and abundant natural gas through regulated sales and transportation arrangements to over three million residential commercial public authority and industrial customers in eight states located primarily in the south we also operate one of the largest intrastate pipelines in texas based on miles of pipe 

atmos energys vision is to be the safest provider of natural gas services we intend to achieve this vision by 

 since 2011 our operating strategy has focused on modernizing our distribution and transmission system to improve safety and reliability since that time our capital expenditures have increased approximately 13 annually additionally during this period we have added new or modified existing regulatory mechanisms to reduce regulatory lag our ability to increase capital spending annually to modernize our system has increased our rate base which has resulted in rising earnings per share and shareholder value 

our core values include focusing on our employees and customers while conducting our business with honesty and integrity we continue to strengthen our culture through ongoing communications with our employees and enhanced employee training 

operating segments 

as of september 30 2018  we manage and review our consolidated operations through the following three reportable segments 

 these operating segments are described in greater detail below 

distribution segment overview 

our distribution segment is primarily comprised of our regulated natural gas distribution and related sales operations in eight states the following table summarizes key information about our six regulated natural gas distribution divisions presented in order of total rate base 



we operate in our service areas under terms of nonexclusive franchise agreements granted by the various cities and towns that we serve at september 30 2018  we held 1013 franchises having terms generally ranging from five to 35 years a significant number of our franchises expire each year which require renewal prior to the end of their terms historically we have successfully renewed these franchises and believe that we will continue to be able to renew our franchises as they expire 

revenues in this operating segment are established by regulatory authorities in the states in which we operate these rates are intended to be sufficient to cover the costs of conducting business including a reasonable return on invested capital in addition we transport natural gas for others through our distribution systems 

rates established by regulatory authorities often include cost adjustment mechanisms for costs that i are subject to significant price fluctuations compared to our other costs ii represent a large component of our cost of service and iii are generally outside our control 

purchased gas cost adjustment mechanisms represent a common form of cost adjustment mechanism purchased gas cost adjustment mechanisms provide natural gas distribution companies a method of recovering purchased gas costs on an ongoing basis without filing a rate case because they provide a dollarfordollar offset to increases or decreases in the cost natural gas therefore although substantially all of our distribution operating revenues fluctuate with the cost of gas that we purchase distribution contribution margin a nongaap measure defined as operating revenues less purchased gas cost is generally not affected by fluctuations in the cost of gas 

additionally some jurisdictions have performancebased ratemaking adjustments to provide incentives to distribution companies to minimize purchased gas costs through improved storage management and use of financial instruments to lock in gas costs under the performancebased ratemaking adjustments purchased gas costs savings are shared between the utility and its customers 

our supply of natural gas is provided by a variety of suppliers including independent producers marketers and pipeline companies withdrawals of gas from proprietary and contracted storage assets and peaking and spot purchase agreements as needed 

supply arrangements consist of both base load and swing supply peaking quantities and are contracted from our suppliers on a firm basis with various terms at market prices base load quantities are those that flow at a constant level throughout the month and swing supply quantities provide the flexibility to change daily quantities to match increases or decreases in requirements related to weather conditions 

except for local production purchases we select our natural gas suppliers through a competitive bidding process by periodically requesting proposals from suppliers that have demonstrated that they can provide reliable service we select these suppliers based on their ability to deliver gas supply to our designated firm pipeline receipt points at the lowest reasonable cost major suppliers during fiscal 2018  were castleton commodities merchant trading lp centerpoint energy services inc concord energy llc conocophillips company devon gas services lp dte energy trading inc mieco inc sequent energy management lp targa gas marketing llc and tenaska gas storage  marketing ventures llc 

the combination of base load peaking and spot purchase agreements coupled with the withdrawal of gas held in storage allows us the flexibility to adjust to changes in weather which minimizes our need to enter into longterm firm commitments we estimate our peakday availability of natural gas supply to be approximately 44 bcf the peakday demand for our distribution operations in fiscal 2018  was on january 16 2018 when sales to customers reached approximately 38 bcf 

currently our distribution divisions utilize 38 pipeline transportation companies both interstate and intrastate to transport our natural gas the pipeline transportation agreements are firm and many of them have “pipeline nonotice” storage service which provides for daily balancing between system requirements and nominated flowing supplies these agreements have been negotiated with the shortest term necessary while still maintaining our right of first refusal the natural gas supply for our midtex division is delivered primarily by our atmos pipeline — texas division apt 

to maintain our deliveries to high priority customers we have the ability and have exercised our right to curtail deliveries to certain customers under the terms of interruptible contracts or applicable state regulations or statutes our customers’ demand on our system is not necessarily indicative of our ability to meet current or anticipated market demands or immediate delivery requirements because of factors such as the physical limitations of gathering storage and transmission systems the duration and severity of cold weather the availability of gas reserves from our suppliers the ability to purchase additional supplies on a shortterm basis and actions by federal and state regulatory authorities curtailment rights provide us the flexibility to meet the humanneeds requirements of our customers on a firm basis priority allocations imposed by federal and state regulatory agencies as well as other factors beyond our control may affect our ability to meet the demands of our customers we do not anticipate any problems with obtaining additional gas supply as needed for our customers 

pipeline and storage segment overview 

our pipeline and storage segment consists of the pipeline and storage operations of apt and our natural gas transmission operations in louisiana apt is one of the largest intrastate pipeline operations in texas with a heavy concentration in the established natural gasproducing areas of central northern and eastern texas extending into or near the major producing areas of the barnett shale the texas gulf coast and the delaware and val verde basins of west texas through its system apt provides transportation and storage services to our midtex division other third party local distribution companies industrial and electric generation customers marketers and producers as part of its pipeline operations apt owns and operates five underground storage reservoirs in texas 

revenues earned from transportation and storage services for apt are subject to traditional ratemaking governed by the rrc rates are updated through periodic filings made under texas’ gas reliability infrastructure program grip grip allows us to include in our rate base annually approved capital costs incurred in the prior calendar year provided that we file a complete rate case at least once every five years the most recent of which was completed in august 2017 apt’s existing regulatory mechanisms allow certain transportation and storage services to be provided under marketbased rates 

our natural gas transmission operations in louisiana are comprised of a proprietary 21mile pipeline located in the new orleans louisiana area that is primarily used to aggregate gas supply for our distribution division in louisiana under a longterm contract and on a more limited basis to third parties the demand fee charged to our louisiana distribution division for these services is subject to regulatory approval by the louisiana public service commission we also manage two asset management plans in louisiana that serve distribution affiliates of the company which have been approved by applicable state regulatory commissions generally these asset management plans require us to share with our distribution customers a significant portion of the cost savings earned from these arrangements 

natural gas marketing segment overview 

through december 31 2016 we were engaged in a nonregulated natural gas marketing business which was conducted by atmos energy marketing aem aem’s primary business was to aggregate and purchase gas supply arrange transportation and storage logistics and ultimately deliver gas to customers at competitive prices additionally aem utilized proprietary and customerowned transportation and storage assets to provide various services to its customers requested 

as more fully described in note 15 effective january 1 2017 we sold all of the equity interests of aem to centerpoint energy services inc ces a subsidiary of centerpoint energy inc as a result of the sale atmos energy has fully exited the nonregulated natural gas marketing business accordingly these operations have been reported as discontinued operations 

ratemaking activity 

overview 

the method of determining regulated rates varies among the states in which our regulated businesses operate the regulatory authorities have the responsibility of ensuring that utilities in their jurisdictions operate in the best interests of customers while providing utility companies the opportunity to earn a reasonable return on their investment generally each regulatory authority reviews rate requests and establishes a rate structure intended to generate revenue sufficient to cover the costs of conducting business including a reasonable return on invested capital 

our rate strategy focuses on reducing or eliminating regulatory lag obtaining adequate returns and providing stable predictable margins which benefit both our customers and the company as a result of our ratemaking efforts in recent years atmos energy has 



 the following table provides a jurisdictional rate summary for our regulated operations as of september 30 2018  this information is for regulatory purposes only and may not be representative of our actual financial position 



  



  

 although substantial progress has been made in recent years to improve rate design and recovery of investment across our service areas we are continuing to seek improvements in rate design to address cost variations and pursue tariffs that reduce regulatory lag associated with investments further potential changes in federal energy policy federal safety regulations and changing   economic conditions will necessitate continued vigilance by the company and our regulators in meeting the challenges presented by these external factors 

recent ratemaking activity 

net operating income increases resulting from ratemaking activity totaling 801 million  1042 million  and 1225 million  became effective in fiscal 2018  2017  and 2016  as summarized below the ratemaking outcomes for fiscal 2018 include the effect of tax reform legislation enacted effective january 1 2018 and do not reflect the true economic benefit of the outcomes because they do not include the corresponding income tax benefit we will receive due to the decrease in our statutory tax rate 



additionally the following ratemaking efforts seeking 528 million  in annual operating income were initiated during fiscal 2018  but had not been completed as of september 30 2018  



 

our recent ratemaking activity is discussed in greater detail below 

annual formula rate mechanisms 

as an instrument to reduce regulatory lag formula rate mechanisms allow us to refresh our rates on an annual basis without filing a formal rate case however these filings still involve discovery by the appropriate regulatory authorities prior to the final determination of rates under these mechanisms the following table summarizes our annual formula rate mechanisms by state 





the following table summarizes our annual formula rate mechanisms with effective dates during the fiscal years ended september 30 2018  2017  and 2016  





 rate case filings 

a rate case is a formal request from atmos energy to a regulatory authority to increase rates that are charged to customers rate cases may also be initiated when the regulatory authorities request us to justify our rates this process is referred to as a “show cause” action adequate rates are intended to provide for recovery of the company’s costs as well as a fair rate of return to our shareholders and ensure that we continue to safely deliver reliable reasonably priced natural gas service to our customers the following table summarizes our recent rate cases

other ratemaking activity 

the following table summarizes other ratemaking activity during the fiscal years ended september 30 2018  2017  and 2016  



  

 other regulation 

we are regulated by various state or local public utility authorities we are also subject to regulation by the united states department of transportation with respect to safety requirements in the operation and maintenance of our transmission and distribution facilities in addition our operations are also subject to various state and federal laws regulating environmental matters from time to time we receive inquiries regarding various environmental matters we believe that our properties and operations substantially comply with and are operated in substantial conformity with applicable safety and environmental statutes and regulations there are no administrative or judicial proceedings arising under environmental quality statutes pending or known to be contemplated by governmental agencies which would have a material adverse effect on us or our operations our environmental claims have arisen primarily from former manufactured gas plant sites the pipeline and hazardous materials safety administration phmsa within the us department of transportation develops and enforces regulations for the safe reliable and environmentally sound operation of the pipeline transportation system the phmsa pipeline safety statutes provide for states to assume safety authority over intrastate and natural gas pipelines state pipeline safety programs are responsible for adopting and enforcing the federal and state pipeline safety regulations for intrastate natural gas transmission and distribution pipelines 

the federal energy regulatory commission ferc allows pursuant to section 311 of the natural gas policy act nga gas transportation services through our atmos pipeline—texas assets “on behalf of” interstate pipelines or local distribution companies served by interstate pipelines without subjecting these assets to the jurisdiction of the ferc under the nga additionally the ferc has regulatory authority over the use and release of interstate pipeline and storage capacity the ferc also has authority to detect and prevent market manipulation and to enforce compliance with ferc’s other rules policies and orders by companies engaged in the sale purchase transportation or storage of natural gas in interstate commerce we have taken what we believe are the necessary and appropriate steps to comply with these regulations 

the sec and the commodities futures trading commission pursuant to the dodd–frank act established numerous regulations relating to us financial markets we enacted procedures and modified existing business practices and contractual arrangements to comply with such regulations there are however some rulemaking proceedings that have not yet been finalized including those relating to capital and margin rules for non–cleared swaps we do not expect these rules to directly impact our business practices or collateral requirements however depending on the substance of these final rules in addition to certain international regulatory requirements still under development that are similar to dodd–frank our swap counterparties could be subject to additional and potentially significant capitalization requirements these regulations could motivate counterparties to increase our collateral requirements or cash postings 

competition 

although our regulated distribution operations are not currently in significant direct competition with any other distributors of natural gas to residential and commercial customers within our service areas we do compete with other natural gas suppliers and suppliers of alternative fuels for sales to industrial customers we compete in all aspects of our business with 

alternative energy sources including in particular electricity electric utilities offer electricity as a rival energy source and compete for the space heating water heating and cooking markets promotional incentives improved equipment efficiencies and promotional rates all contribute to the acceptability of electrical equipment the principal means to compete against alternative fuels is lower prices and natural gas historically has maintained its price advantage in the residential commercial and industrial markets 

our pipeline and storage operations have historically faced competition from other existing intrastate pipelines seeking to provide or arrange transportation storage and other services for customers in the last few years several new pipelines have been completed which has increased the level of competition in this segment of our business 

employees 

at september 30 2018  we had 4628 employees consisting of 4564 employees in our distribution operations and 64 employees in our pipeline and storage operations

risk factors 

tableend

our financial and operating results are subject to a number of risk factors many of which are not within our control although we have tried to discuss key risk factors below please be aware that other or new risks may prove to be important in the future investors should carefully consider the following discussion of risk factors as well as other information appearing in this report these factors include the following 

we are subject to state and local regulations that affect our operations and financial results 

we are subject to regulatory oversight from various state and local regulatory authorities in the eight states that we serve therefore our returns are continuously monitored and are subject to challenge for their reasonableness by the appropriate regulatory authorities or other thirdparty intervenors in the normal course of business as a regulated entity we often need to place assets in service and establish historical test periods before rate cases that seek to adjust our allowed returns to recover that investment can be filed further the regulatory review process can be lengthy in the context of traditional ratemaking because of this process we suffer the negative financial effects of having placed assets in service without the benefit of rate relief which is commonly referred to as “regulatory lag” 

however in the last several years a number of regulatory authorities in the states we serve have approved rate mechanisms that provide for annual adjustments to rates that allow us to recover the cost of investments made to replace existing infrastructure or reflect changes in our cost of service these mechanisms work to effectively reduce the regulatory lag 

inherent in the ratemaking process however regulatory lag could significantly increase if the regulatory authorities modify or terminate these rate mechanisms the regulatory process also involves the risk that regulatory authorities may i review our purchases of natural gas and adjust the amount of our gas costs that we pass through to our customers or ii limit the costs we may have incurred from our cost of service that can be recovered from customers 

we are also subject to laws regulations and other legal requirements enacted or adopted by federal state and local governmental authorities relating to protection of the environment and health and safety matters including those that govern discharges of substances into the air and water the management and disposal of hazardous substances and waste the cleanup of contaminated sites groundwater quality and availability plant and wildlife protection as well as work practices related to employee health and safety environmental legislation also requires that our facilities sites and other properties associated with our operations be operated maintained abandoned and reclaimed to the satisfaction of applicable regulatory authorities failure to comply with these laws regulations permits and licenses may expose us to fines penalties or interruptions in our operations that could be significant to our financial results in addition existing environmental regulations may be revised or our operations may become subject to new regulations 

some of our operations are subject to increased federal regulatory oversight that could affect our operations and financial results 

ferc has regulatory authority over some of our operations including the use and release of interstate pipeline and storage capacity ferc has adopted rules designed to prevent market power abuse and market manipulation and to promote compliance with ferc’s other rules policies and orders by companies engaged in the sale purchase transportation or storage of natural gas in interstate commerce these rules carry increased penalties for violations although we have taken steps to structure current and future transactions to comply with applicable current ferc regulations changes in ferc regulations or their interpretation by ferc or additional regulations issued by ferc in the future could also adversely affect our business financial condition or financial results 

we may experience increased federal state and local regulation of the safety of our operations 

the safety and protection of the public our customers and our employees is our top priority we constantly monitor and maintain our pipeline and distribution systems to ensure that natural gas is delivered safely reliably and efficiently through our network of more than 75000 miles of distribution and transmission lines however in recent years natural gas distribution and pipeline companies have faced increasing federal state and local oversight of the safety of their operations although we believe these costs should be ultimately recoverable through our rates the costs of complying with new laws and regulations may have at least a shortterm adverse impact on our operating costs and financial results 

distributing transporting and storing natural gas involve risks that may result in accidents and additional operating costs 

our operations involve a number of hazards and operating risks inherent in storing and transporting natural gas that could affect the public safety and reliability of our distribution system while atmos energy with the support from each of its regulatory commissions is accelerating the replacement of aging pipeline infrastructure operating issues such as as leaks accidents equipment problems and incidents including explosions and fire could result in legal liability repair and remediation costs increased operating costs significant increased capital expenditures regulatory fines and penalties and other costs and a loss of customer confidence we maintain liability and property insurance coverage in place for many of these hazards and risks however because some of our transmission pipeline and storage facilities are near or are in populated areas any loss of human life or adverse financial results resulting from such events could be large if these events were not fully covered by our general liability and property insurance which policies are subject to certain limits and deductibles our operations or financial results could be adversely affected 

our growth in the future may be limited by the nature of our business which requires extensive capital spending 

our operations are capitalintensive we must make significant capital expenditures on a longterm basis to modernize our distribution and transmission system to improve the safety and reliability and to comply with the safety rules and regulations issued by the regulatory authorities responsible for the service areas we operate in addition we must continually build new capacity to serve the growing needs of the communities we serve the magnitude of these expenditures may be affected by a number of factors including new regulations the general state of the economy and weather 

  the liquidity required to fund our working capital capital expenditures and other cash needs is provided from a combination of internally generated cash flows and external debt and equity financing the cost and availability of borrowing funds from third party lenders or issuing equity is dependent on the liquidity of the credit markets interest rates and other market conditions this in turn may limit the amount of funds we can invest in our infrastructure 

the company is dependent on continued access to the credit and capital markets to execute our business strategy 

our longterm debt is currently rated as “investment grade” by standard  poor’s corporation and moody’s investors service inc similar to most companies we rely upon access to both shortterm and longterm credit and capital markets to 

satisfy our liquidity requirements if adverse credit conditions were to cause a significant limitation on our access to the private credit and public capital markets we could see a reduction in our liquidity a significant reduction in our liquidity could in turn trigger a negative change in our ratings outlook or even a reduction in our credit ratings by one or more of the credit rating agencies such a downgrade could further limit our access to private credit andor public capital markets and increase our costs of borrowing 

while we believe we can meet our capital requirements from our operations and the sources of financing available to us we can provide no assurance that we will continue to be able to do so in the future especially if the market price of natural gas increases significantly in the near term the future effects on our business liquidity and financial results of a deterioration of current conditions in the credit and capital markets could be material and adverse to us both in the ways described above or in other ways that we do not currently anticipate 

we are exposed to market risks that are beyond our control which could adversely affect our financial results 

we are subject to market risks beyond our control including i commodity price volatility caused by market supply and demand dynamics counterparty performance or counterparty creditworthiness and ii interest rate risk we are generally insulated from commodity price risk through our purchased gas cost mechanisms with respect to interest rate risk we have been operating in a relatively low interestrate environment in recent years compared to historical norms for both short and longterm interest rates however increases in interest rates could adversely affect our future financial results to the extent that we do not recover our actual interest expense in our rates 

the concentration of our operations in the state of texas exposes our operations and financial results to economic conditions weather patterns and regulatory decisions in texas 

approximately 70 percent of our consolidated operations are located in the state of texas this concentration of our business in texas means that our operations and financial results may be significantly affected by changes in the texas economy in general weather patterns and regulatory decisions by state and local regulatory authorities in texas 

a deterioration in economic conditions could adversely affect our customers and negatively impact our financial results 

any adverse changes in economic conditions in the united states especially in the states in which we operate could adversely affect the financial resources of many domestic households as a result our customers could seek to use less gas and it may be more difficult for them to pay their gas bills this would likely lead to slower collections and higher than normal levels of accounts receivable this in turn could increase our financing requirements additionally should economic conditions deteriorate our industrial customers could seek alternative energy sources which could result in lower sales volumes 

increased gas costs could adversely impact our customer base and customer collections and increase our level of indebtedness 

rapid increases in the costs of purchased gas would cause us to experience a significant increase in shortterm debt we must pay suppliers for gas when it is purchased which can be significantly in advance of when these costs may be recovered through the collection of monthly customer bills for gas delivered increases in purchased gas costs also slow our natural gas distribution collection efforts as customers are more likely to delay the payment of their gas bills leading to higher than normal accounts receivable this could result in higher shortterm debt levels greater collection efforts and increased bad debt expense 

if contracted gas supplies interstate pipeline andor storage services are not available or delivered in a timely manner our ability to meet our customers’ natural gas requirements may be impaired and our financial condition may be adversely affected 

in order to meet our customers’ annual and seasonal natural gas demands we must obtain a sufficient supply of natural gas interstate pipeline capacity and storage capacity if we are unable to obtain these either from our suppliers’ inability to deliver the contracted commodity or the inability to secure replacement quantities our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected if a substantial disruption to or reduction in interstate natural gas pipelines’ transmission and storage capacity occurred due to operational failures or disruptions legislative or regulatory actions hurricanes tornadoes floods terrorist or cyberattacks or acts of war our operations or financial results could be adversely affected 

our operations are subject to increased competition 

in residential and commercial customer markets our distribution operations compete with other energy products such as electricity and propane our primary product competition is with electricity for heating water heating and cooking increases in the price of natural gas could negatively impact our competitive position by decreasing the price benefits of natural gas to the consumer this could adversely impact our business if our customer growth slows or if our customers further conserve their use of gas resulting in reduced gas purchases and customer billings 

in the case of industrial customers such as manufacturing plants adverse economic conditions including higher gas costs could cause these customers to use alternative sources of energy such as electricity or bypass our systems in favor of special competitive contracts with lower perunit costs our pipeline and storage operations historically have faced limited competition from other existing intrastate pipelines and gas marketers seeking to provide or arrange transportation storage and other services for customers however in the last few years several new pipelines have been completed which has increased the level of competition in this segment of our business 

adverse weather conditions could affect our operations or financial results 

we have weathernormalized rates for approximately 97 percent of our residential and commercial meters in our distribution operations which substantially mitigates the adverse effects of warmerthannormal weather for meters in those service areas however there is no assurance that we will continue to receive such regulatory protection from adverse weather in our rates in the future the loss of such weathernormalized rates could have an adverse effect on our operations and financial results in addition our operating results may continue to vary somewhat with the actual temperatures during the winter heating season additionally sustained cold weather could challenge our ability to adequately meet customer demand in our operations 

the costs of providing health care benefits pension and postretirement health care benefits and related funding requirements may increase substantially 

we provide health care benefits a cashbalance pension plan and postretirement health care benefits to eligible fulltime employees the costs of providing health care benefits to our employees could significantly increase over time due to rapidly increasing health care inflation and any future legislative changes related to the provision of health care benefits the impact of additional costs which are likely to be passed on to the company is difficult to measure at this time 

the costs of providing a cashbalance pension plan to eligible fulltime employees prior to 2011 and postretirement health care benefits to eligible fulltime employees and related funding requirements could be influenced by changes in the market value of the assets funding our pension and postretirement health care plans any significant declines in the value of these investments due to sustained declines in equity markets or a reduction in bond yields could increase the costs of our pension and postretirement health care plans and related funding requirements in the future further our costs of providing such benefits and related funding requirements are also subject to a number of factors including i changing demographics including longer life expectancy of beneficiaries and an expected increase in the number of eligible former employees over the next five to ten years ii various actuarial calculations and assumptions which may differ materially from actual results due primarily to changing market and economic conditions including changes in interest rates and higher or lower withdrawal rates and iii future government regulation 

the costs to the company of providing these benefits and related funding requirements could also increase materially in the future should there be a material reduction in the amount of the recovery of these costs through our rates or should significant delays develop in the timing of the recovery of such costs which could adversely affect our financial results 

the inability to continue to hire train and retain operational technical and managerial personnel could adversely affect our results of operations 

although the average age of the employee base of atmos energy is not significantly changing year over year there are still a number of employees who will become eligible to retire within the next five to 10 years if we were unable to hire appropriate personnel or contractors to fill future needs the company could encounter operating challenges and increased costs primarily due to a loss of knowledge errors due to inexperience or the lengthy time period typically required to adequately train replacement personnel in addition higher costs could result from loss of productivity or increased safety compliance issues the inability to hire train and retain new operational technical and managerial personnel adequately and to transfer institutional knowledge and expertise could adversely affect our ability to manage and operate our business if we were unable to hire train and retain appropriately qualified personnel our results of operations could be adversely affected 

the operations and financial results of the company could be adversely impacted as a result of climate change or related additional legislation or regulation in the future 

to the extent climate change occurs our businesses could be adversely impacted although we believe it is likely that any such resulting impacts would occur very gradually over a long period of time and thus would be difficult to quantify with any degree of specificity to the extent climate change would result in warmer temperatures in our service territories financial results could be adversely affected through lower gas volumes and revenues such climate change could also cause shifts in population including customers moving away from our service territories near the gulf coast in louisiana and mississippi 

another possible climate change would be more frequent and more severe weather events such as hurricanes and tornadoes which could increase our costs to repair damaged facilities and restore service to our customers if we were unable to deliver natural gas to our customers our financial results would be impacted by lost revenues and we generally would have to 

seek approval from regulators to recover restoration costs to the extent we would be unable to recover those costs or if higher rates resulting from our recovery of such costs would result in reduced demand for our services our future business financial condition or financial results could be adversely impacted 

in addition there have been a number of federal and state legislative and regulatory initiatives proposed in recent years in an attempt to control or limit the effects of global warming and overall climate change including greenhouse gas emissions such as carbon dioxide the adoption of this type of legislation by congress or similar legislation by states or the adoption of related regulations by federal or state governments mandating a substantial reduction in greenhouse gas emissions in the future could have farreaching and significant impacts on the energy industry such new legislation or regulations could result in increased compliance costs for us or additional operating restrictions on our business affect the demand for natural gas or impact the prices we charge to our customers at this time we cannot predict the potential impact of such laws or regulations that may be adopted on our future business financial condition or financial results 

cyberattacks or acts of cyberterrorism could disrupt our business operations and information technology systems or result in the loss or exposure of confidential or sensitive customer employee or company information 

our business operations and information technology systems may be vulnerable to an attack by individuals or organizations intending to disrupt our business operations and information technology systems even though the company has implemented policies procedures and controls to prevent and detect these activities we use our information technology systems to manage our distribution and intrastate pipeline and storage operations and other business processes disruption of those systems could adversely impact our ability to safely deliver natural gas to our customers operate our pipeline and storage systems or serve our customers timely accordingly if such an attack or act of terrorism were to occur our operations and financial results could be adversely affected 

in addition we use our information technology systems to protect confidential or sensitive customer employee and company information developed and maintained in the normal course of our business any attack on such systems that would result in the unauthorized release of customer employee or other confidential or sensitive data could have a material adverse effect on our business reputation increase our costs and expose us to additional material legal claims and liability even though we have insurance coverage in place for many of these cyberrelated risks if such an attack or act of terrorism were to occur our operations and financial results could be adversely affected to the extent not fully covered by such insurance coverage 

natural disasters terrorist activities or other significant events could adversely affect our operations or financial results 

natural disasters are always a threat to our assets and operations in addition the threat of terrorist activities could lead to increased economic instability and volatility in the price of natural gas that could affect our operations also companies in our industry may face a heightened risk of exposure to actual acts of terrorism which could subject our operations to increased risks as a result the availability of insurance covering such risks may become more limited which could increase the risk that an event could adversely affect our operations or financial results

introduction 

this section provides management’s discussion of the financial condition changes in financial condition and results of operations of atmos energy corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries with specific information on results of operations and liquidity and capital resources it includes management’s interpretation of our financial results the factors affecting these results the major factors expected to affect future operating results and future investment and financing plans this discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 

several factors exist that could influence our future financial performance some of which are described in item 1a above “risk factors” they should be considered in connection with evaluating forwardlooking statements contained in this report or otherwise made by or on behalf of us since these factors could cause actual results and conditions to differ materially from those set out in such forwardlooking statements 

cautionary statement for the purposes of the safe harbor under the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 

the statements contained in this annual report on form 10k may contain “forwardlooking statements” within the meaning of section 27a of the securities act of 1933 and section 21e of the securities exchange act of 1934 all statements other than statements of historical fact included in this report are forwardlooking statements made in good faith by us and are intended to qualify for the safe harbor from liability established by the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 when used in this report or any other of our documents or oral presentations the words “anticipate” “believe” “estimate” “expect” “forecast” “goal” “intend” “objective” “plan” “projection” “seek” “strategy” or similar words are intended to identify forwardlooking statements such forwardlooking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the statements relating to our strategy operations markets services rates recovery of costs availability of gas supply and other factors these risks and uncertainties include the following state and local regulatory trends and decisions including the impact of rate proceedings before various state regulatory commissions increased federal regulatory oversight and potential penalties possible increased federal state and local regulation of the safety of our operations the inherent hazards and risks involved in distributing transporting and storing natural gas the capitalintensive nature of our business our ability to continue to access the credit and capital markets to execute our business strategy market risks beyond our control affecting our risk management activities including commodity price volatility counterparty performance or creditworthiness and interest rate risk the concentration of our operations in texas the impact of adverse economic conditions on our customers changes in the availability and price of natural gas the availability and accessibility of contracted gas supplies interstate pipeline andor storage services increased competition from energy suppliers and alternative forms of energy adverse weather conditions increased costs of providing health care benefits along with pension and postretirement health care benefits and increased funding requirements the inability to continue to hire train and retain operational technical and managerial personnel the impact of climate change or related additional legislation or regulation in the future the threat of cyberattacks or acts of cyberterrorism that could disrupt our business operations and information technology systems or result in the loss or exposure of confidential or sensitive customer employee or company information natural disasters terrorist activities or other events and other risks and uncertainties discussed herein all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond our control accordingly while we believe these forwardlooking statements to be reasonable there can be no assurance that they will approximate actual experience or that the expectations derived from them will be realized further we undertake no obligation to update or revise any of our forwardlooking statements whether as a result of new information future events or otherwise 

critical accounting policies 

our consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and the related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ from estimates 

our significant accounting policies are discussed in notes 2  and 15 to our consolidated financial statements the accounting policies discussed below are both important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and require management to make difficult subjective or complex accounting estimates accordingly these critical accounting policies are reviewed periodically by the audit committee of the board of directors 





nongaap financial measures 

our operations are affected by the cost of natural gas which is passed through to our customers without markup and includes commodity price transportation storage injection and withdrawal fees and settlements of financial instruments used to mitigate commodity price risk these costs are reflected in the income statement as purchased gas cost therefore increases in the cost of gas are offset by a corresponding increase in revenues accordingly we believe contribution margin a nongaap financial measure defined as operating revenues less purchased gas cost is a more useful and relevant measure to analyze our financial performance than operating revenues as such the following discussion and analysis of our financial performance will reference contribution margin rather than operating revenues and purchased gas cost individually further the term contribution margin is not intended to represent operating income the most comparable gaap financial measure as an indicator of operating performance and is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies 

as described further in note 12 the enactment of the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 the tcja required us to remeasure our deferred tax assets and liabilities at our new federal statutory income tax rate as of december 22 2017 the remeasurement of our net deferred tax liabilities resulted in the recognition of a noncash income tax benefit of 1588 million  for the fiscal year ended september 30 2018  due to the nonrecurring nature of this benefit we believe that income from continuing operations and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations before the noncash income tax benefit provide a more relevant measure to analyze our financial performance than income from continuing operations and consolidated diluted earnings per share from continuing operations in order to allow investors to better analyze our core results and allow the information to be presented on a comparative basis to the prior year accordingly the following discussion and analysis of our financial performance will reference adjusted income from continuing operations and diluted earnings per share which is calculated as follows 



results of operations 

overview 

atmos energy strives to operate its businesses safely and reliably while delivering superior shareholder value our commitment to modernizing our natural gas distribution and transmission systems requires a significant level of capital spending we have the ability to begin recovering a significant portion of these investments timely through rate designs and mechanisms that reduce or eliminate regulatory lag and separate the recovery of our approved rate from customer usage patterns the execution of our capital spending program the ability to recover these investments timely and our ability to access the capital markets to satisfy our financing needs are the primary drivers that affect our financial performance 

during fiscal 2018  we recorded income from continuing operations of 6031 million  or 543  per diluted share compared to income from continuing operations of 3827 million  or 360  per diluted share in the prior year 

after adjusting for the nonrecurring benefit recognized after implementing the tcja we recognized adjusted income from continuing operations of 4443 million  or 400  per diluted share for the year ended september 30 2018  compared to adjusted income from continuing operations of 3827 million  or 360  per diluted share for the year ended september 30 2017  the yearoveryear increase of 616 million  or 16 percent largely reflects rate increases driven by safety and reliability spending weather that was 36 percent colder than the prior year customer growth in our distribution business and the impact of the tcja on our effective income tax rate partially offset by reduced revenues as a result of implementing the tcja during the year ended september 30 2018  we completed 18 regulatory proceedings resulting in an increase in annual operating income of 801 million  and had 11 ratemaking efforts in progress at september 30 2018  seeking a total increase in annual operating income of 528 million  

capital expenditures for fiscal 2018  totaled 14676 million  over 80 percent was invested to improve the safety and reliability of our distribution and transmission systems with a significant portion of this investment incurred under regulatory mechanisms that reduce regulatory lag to six months or less we funded our currentyear capital expenditures program primarily through operating cash flows of 11247 million  additionally we issued 400 million of common stock during the year ended september 30 2018  the net proceeds from the issuance were primarily used to repay shortterm debt under our commercial paper program to fund capital spending and for general corporate purposes on october 4 2018 we completed a public offering of 600 million 430 senior notes due 2048 we received net proceeds from the offering after underwriting discount and estimated offering expenses of approximately 591 million that were used to repay working capital borrowings pursuant to our commercial paper program the effective interest rate of these notes is 437 after giving effect to the offering costs 

as a result of the continued contribution and stability of our earnings cash flows and capital structure our board of directors increased the quarterly dividend by 82 percent for fiscal 2019 

tcja impact 

the tcja introduced several significant changes to corporate income tax laws in the united states which have been reflected in our consolidated financial statements for the year ended september 30 2018  as a rate regulated entity the effects of lower tax rates included in our cost of service rates will ultimately flow through to our utility customers in the form of adjusted rates therefore the favorable impact of the reduction in our federal statutory income tax rate on our financial performance will be limited to items that impact our income before income taxes in the current period that have not yet been reflected in our rates most notably increases to and decreases in commissionapproved regulatory assets and liabilities recorded on our consolidated balance sheet and marketbased revenues that are earned from customers who utilize our assets note 12 to the consolidated financial statements details the various impacts of the tcja on our financial position and results from operations the most significant changes are summarized as follows 

 

consolidated results 

the following table presents our consolidated financial highlights for the fiscal years ended september 30 2018  2017  and 2016  

  

our consolidated net income during the last three fiscal years was earned across our business segments as follows 





see the following discussion regarding the results of operations for each of our business operating segments 

distribution  segment 

the distribution segment is primarily comprised of our regulated natural gas distribution and related sales operations in eight states the primary factors that impact the results of our distribution operations are our ability to earn our authorized rates of return competitive factors in the energy industry and economic conditions in our service areas 

our ability to earn our authorized rates is based primarily on our ability to improve the rate design in our various ratemaking jurisdictions to minimize regulatory lag and ultimately separate the recovery of our approved rates from customer usage patterns improving rate design is a longterm process and is further complicated by the fact that we operate in multiple rate jurisdictions the “ratemaking activity” section of this form 10k describes our current rate strategy progress towards implementing that strategy and recent ratemaking initiatives in more detail 

we are generally able to pass the cost of gas through to our customers without markup under purchased gas cost adjustment mechanisms therefore increases in the cost of gas are offset by a corresponding increase in revenues contribution margin in our texas and mississippi service areas include franchise fees and gross receipt taxes which are calculated as a percentage of revenue inclusive of gas costs therefore the amount of these taxes included in revenue is influenced by the cost of gas and the level of gas sales volumes we record the associated tax expense as a component of taxes other than 

income although changes in revenue related taxes arising from changes in gas costs affect contribution margin over time the impact is offset within operating income 

although the cost of gas typically does not have a direct impact on our contribution margin higher gas costs may adversely impact our accounts receivable collections resulting in higher bad debt expense and may require us to increase borrowings under our credit facilities resulting in higher interest expense in addition higher gas costs as well as competitive factors in the industry and general economic conditions may cause customers to conserve or in the case of industrial consumers to use alternative energy sources currently gas cost risk has been mitigated by rate design that allows us to collect from our customers the gas cost portion of our bad debt expense on approximately 76 percent of our residential and commercial margins 

during fiscal 2018  we completed 16  regulatory proceedings in our distribution  segment resulting in an 89 million  increase in annual operating income 

review of financial and operating results 

financial and operational highlights for our distribution  segment for the fiscal years ended september 30 2018  2017  and 2016  are presented below 



fiscal year ended september 30 2018  compared with fiscal year ended september 30 2017   

income before income taxes for our distribution  segment decreased three percent primarily due to an  883 million  increase in operating expenses partially offset by a 635 million  increase in contribution margin the yeartodate increase in contribution margin primarily reflects 



 the increase in operating expenses which include operation and maintenance expense bad debt expense depreciation and amortization expense and taxes other than income largely reflects expenses incurred after we decided to undertake a planned outage of our natural gas distribution system in northwest dallas that affected approximately 2400 homes while the system was replaced we provided financial assistance to the affected residents and incurred other related costs of approximately 24 million 

the remaining increase in operating expenses is primarily attributable to an increase in employeerelated costs and incremental system integrity activities of 193 million increased revenuerelated taxes as discussed above and increased depreciation and property taxes of 225 million associated with increased capital investments 

interest charges decreased 139 million  primarily from interest deferrals associated with our infrastructure spending activities in texas and louisiana 

the decrease in income tax expense primarily reflects a reduction in our effective tax rate from 367 to 261 as a result of the tcja during fiscal 2018 in certain jurisdictions we began amortizing the excess deferred income taxes in the amount of 16 million 

fiscal year ended september 30 2017  compared with fiscal year ended september 30 2016   

income before income taxes for our distribution  segment increased 16 percent primarily due to a 985 million  increase in contribution margin partially offset by a 348 million  increase in operating expenses the yearoveryear increase in contribution margin primarily reflects 

 the increase in operating expenses was primarily due to increased depreciation expense and property taxes associated with increased capital investments higher employeerelated costs increased revenuerelated taxes as discussed above and higher pipeline maintenance and related activities partially offset by lower legal costs 

the following table shows our operating income by distribution division in order of total rate base for the fiscal years ended september 30 2018  2017  and 2016  the presentation of our distribution operating income is included for financial reporting purposes and may not be appropriate for ratemaking purposes 



pipeline and storage  segment 

our pipeline and storage  segment consists of the pipeline and storage operations of atmos pipelinetexas division apt and our natural gas transmission operations in louisiana apt is one of the largest intrastate pipeline operations in texas with a heavy concentration in the established natural gas producing areas of central northern and eastern texas extending into or near the major producing areas of the barnett shale the texas gulf coast and the delaware and midland basins of west texas apt provides transportation and storage services to our midtex division other third party local distribution companies industrial and electric generation customers as well as marketers and producers as part of its pipeline operations apt owns and operates five underground storage facilities in texas 

our natural gas transmission operations in louisiana are comprised of a proprietary 21mile pipeline located in the new orleans louisiana area that is primarily used to aggregate gas supply for our distribution division in louisiana under a longterm contract and on a more limited basis to third parties the demand fee charged to our louisiana distribution division for these services is subject to regulatory approval by the louisiana public service commission we also manage two asset management plans which have been approved by applicable state regulatory commissions generally these asset management plans require us to share with our distribution customers a significant portion of the cost savings earned from these arrangements 

our pipeline and storage  segment is impacted by seasonal weather patterns competitive factors in the energy industry and economic conditions in our texas and louisiana service areas natural gas prices do not directly impact the results of this segment as revenues are derived from the transportation and storage of natural gas however natural gas prices and demand for natural gas could influence the level of drilling activity in the supply areas that we serve which may influence the level of throughput we may be able to transport on our pipelines further natural gas price differences between the various hubs that we serve in texas could influences the volumes of gas transported for shippers through texas pipeline systems and rates for such transportation 

the results of apt are also significantly impacted by the natural gas requirements of its local distribution company customers additionally its operations may be impacted by the timing of when costs and expenses are incurred and when these costs and expenses are recovered through its tariffs 

apt annually uses the gas reliability infrastructure program grip to recover capital costs incurred in the prior calendar year following the conclusion of its rate case in august 2017 apt made a grip filing that covered changes in net investment from october 1 2016 through december 31 2016 with a requested increase in operating income of 290 million on december 5 2017 the filing was approved on february 15 2018 apt made a grip filing that covered changes in net investment from january 1 2017 through december 31 2017 with a requested increase in operating income of 422 million on may 22 2018 the filing was approved

review of financial and operating results 

financial and operational highlights for our pipeline and storage  segment for the fiscal years ended september 30 2018  2017  and 2016  are presented below 



fiscal year ended september 30 2018  compared with fiscal year ended september 30 2017 

income before income taxes for our pipeline and storage  segment increased ten percent primarily due to a 512 million  increase in contribution margin partially offset by a 308 million  increase in operating expenses the increase in contribution margin primarily reflects 

 the increase in operating expenses is primarily due to higher depreciation expense of 258 million associated with increased capital investments and an increase in employeerelated costs 

the decrease in income tax expense primarily reflects a reduction in our effective tax rate from 365 to 298 as a result of the tcja 

fiscal year ended september 30 2017  compared with fiscal year ended september 30 2016 

income before income taxes for our pipeline and storage  segment increased slightly primarily due to a 273 million  increase in contribution margin partially offset by a 207 million  increase in operating expenses the increase in contribution margin primarily reflects a 246 million increase in rates from the approved 2016 grip filing and the rate case finalized in august 2017 and higher through system revenue of 83 million largely related to higher basis spreads due to increased production in the permian basin and incremental throughput on a pipeline acquired in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 partially offsetting these increases was a decrease in contribution margin of 23 million due to lower excess retention gas sales in the current year as noted above as a result of the annual rate case we did not file our annual grip filing during the second quarter of fiscal 2017 which influenced this segments performance yearoveryear 

operating expenses increased 207 million  primarily due to increased depreciation expense and property taxes associated with increased capital investments 

natural gas marketing  segment 

through december 31 2016 we were engaged in an unregulated natural gas marketing business which was conducted by atmos energy marketing aem aem’s primary business was to aggregate and purchase gas supply arrange transportation and storage logistics and ultimately deliver gas to customers at competitive prices 

as more fully described in note 15 effective january 1 2017 we sold all of the equity interests of aem to centerpoint energy services inc ces a subsidiary of centerpoint energy inc as a result of the sale atmos energy has fully exited the nonregulated natural gas marketing business accordingly a gain on sale from discontinued operations for 27 million  was recorded and net income of 110 million  for aem is reported as discontinued operations for the year ended september 30 2017  compared to net income of 46 million  for aem reported for discontinued operations for the year ended september 30 2016  

review of financial and operating results 

financial and operational highlights for our natural gas marketing  segment for the fiscal years ended september 30 2017  and 2016  are presented below 



fiscal year ended september 30 2017  compared with fiscal year ended september 30 2016 

the 91 million  yearoveryear increase in net income from discontinued operations primarily reflects the recognition of a net 66 million noncash gain from unwinding hedge accounting for certain of the natural gas marketing businesss financial positions in connection with the sale of aem additionally we recognized a 27 million  net gain on sale upon completion of the sale of aem to ces in january 2017 

liquidity and capital resources 

the liquidity required to fund our working capital capital expenditures and other cash needs is provided from a combination of internally generated cash flows and external debt and equity financing external debt financing is provided primarily through the issuance of longterm debt a 15 billion commercial paper program and three committed revolving credit facilities with a total availability from thirdparty lenders of approximately 15 billion the commercial paper program and credit facilities provide costeffective shortterm financing until it can be replaced with a balance of longterm debt and equity financing that achieves the companys desired capital structure with an equitytototalcapitalization ratio between 50  and 60  inclusive of longterm and shortterm debt additionally we have various uncommitted trade credit lines with our gas suppliers that we utilize to purchase natural gas on a monthly basis the liquidity provided by these sources is expected to be sufficient to fund the companys working capital needs and capital expenditures program for fiscal year 2019 and beyond please refer to the tcja impact section above regarding anticipated impacts on our liquidity capital resources and cash flows 

to support our capital market activities we have a registration statement on file with the sec that permits us to issue a total of 25 billion  in common stock andor debt securities the shelf registration statement expires on march 26 2019 under 

the shelf registration statement in november 2017 we filed a prospectus supplement for an atthemarket atm equity distribution program under which we may issue and sell shares of our common stock up to an aggregate offering price of 500 million  

at september 30 2018  approximately 6500 million  of securities remained available for issuance under the shelf registration statement on october 4 2018 we completed a public offering of 600 million of 430 senior notes due 2048 the effective rate of this note is 437 after giving effect to the offering costs we received net proceeds from the offering after underwriting discount and estimated offering expenses of approximately 591 million that were used to repay working capital borrowings pursuant to our commercial paper program the issuance of these notes effectively exhausted our existing shelf registration statement 

during the first quarter of fiscal 2019 we intend to file a new registration statement for the issuance from time to time of up to 30 billion in common stock andor debt securities in addition during the first quarter of fiscal 2019 we plan to enter into a new atm equity distribution agreement under which we may issue and sell shares of our common stock up to an aggregate offering price of 500 million under the new shelf registration statement 

the following table presents our capitalization as of september 30 2018  and 2017  



cash flows 

our internally generated funds may change in the future due to a number of factors some of which we cannot control these factors include regulatory changes the price for our services the demand for such products and services margin requirements resulting from significant changes in commodity prices operational risks and other factors 

cash flows from operating investing and financing activities for the years ended september 30 2018  2017  and 2016  are presented below 



cash flows from operating activities 

yearoveryear changes in our operating cash flows primarily are attributable to changes in net income and working capital changes particularly within our distribution segment resulting from changes in the price of natural gas and the timing of customer collections payments for natural gas purchases and deferred gas cost recoveries 

fiscal year ended september 30 2018  compared with fiscal year ended september 30 2017   

for the fiscal year ended september 30 2018  we generated operating cash flows of 11247 million  compared with 8671 million  in the prior year the yearoveryear increase  primarily reflects the positive cash effects of successful rate case outcomes achieved in fiscal 2017 driven primarily by increased safety and reliability spending and changes in working capital primarily as a result of the timing of gas cost recoveries under our purchase gas cost mechanisms as a result of a yearoveryear increase in sale volumes this increase in sales volumes also contributed to the yearoveryear increase in operating cash flow 

fiscal year ended september 30 2017  compared with fiscal year ended september 30 2016   

for the fiscal year ended september 30 2017  we generated operating cash flows of 8671 million  compared with 7950 million  in fiscal 2016  the yearoveryear increase primarily reflects the positive cash effect of successful rate case outcomes achieved in fiscal 2016 

cash flows from investing activities 

in recent years we have used substantial amounts of cash to fund our ongoing construction program which enables us to improve safety and reliability by modernizing our distribution and transmission system used to provide distribution services to our existing customer base expand our natural gas distribution services into new markets enhance the integrity of our pipelines and more recently expand our intrastate pipeline network over the last three fiscal years approximately 82 percent of our capital spending has been committed to improving the safety and reliability of our system 

in executing our regulatory strategy we target our capital spending on regulatory mechanisms that permit us to earn an adequate return timely on our investment without compromising the safety or reliability of our system substantially all of our regulated jurisdictions have rate tariffs that provide the opportunity to include in their rate base approved capital costs on a periodic basis without being required to file a rate case 

 for the fiscal year ended september 30 2018  we had 14676 million  in capital expenditures compared with 11371 million  for the fiscal year ended september 30 2017  and 10870 million  for the fiscal year ended september 30 2016  

fiscal year ended september 30 2018  compared with fiscal year ended september 30 2017   

the 3305 million increase in capital expenditures in fiscal 2018  compared to fiscal 2017  primarily reflects planned increases to modernize our distribution and transmission system and increases in spending in our pipeline and storage segment to improve the reliability of gas service to our local distribution company customers the yearoveryear increase also reflects the absence in the current year period of 1403 million in net proceeds received from the sale of aem 298 million in proceeds received from the completion of a state of texas use tax audit and the 861 million used to acquire a pipeline in december 2016 

fiscal year ended september 30 2017  compared with fiscal year ended september 30 2016 

the 501 million increase in capital expenditures in fiscal 2017  compared to fiscal 2016  primarily reflects a 

 cash flows from investing activities for the year ended september 30 2017  also include proceeds of 1403 million received from the sale of aem proceeds received from the completion of a state of texas use tax audit and 861 million used to purchase a pipeline in the first fiscal quarter of 2017 

cash flows from financing activities 

we generated a net amount of 3263 million  1681 million  and 3036 million  in cash from financing activities for fiscal years 2018  2017  and 2016  our significant financing activities for the fiscal years ended september 30 2018  2017  and 2016  are summarized as follows 

2018   

during the fiscal year ended september 30 2018  our financing activities generated  3263 million  of cash compared with  1681 million  of cash generated in the prior year the 1582 million  increase in cash provided by financing activities reflects higher net shortterm borrowings due to increased capital expenditures and periodoverperiod changes in working capital funding needs compared to the prior year as well as net proceeds received of 3951 million  from equity financing cash dividends increased due to a 78 increase in our dividend rate and an increase in shares outstanding 

2017   

during the fiscal year ended september 30 2017  our financing activities generated  1681 million  of cash compared with 3036 million  of cash generated in the prior year the 1355 million decrease in cash provided by financing activities is primarily due to the reduction in our short–term debt partially offset by an increase in our longterm debt 

during fiscal 2017 we completed approximately 975 million of debt and equity financing on june 8 2017 we completed a public offering of 500 million of 300 senior unsecured notes due 2027 and 250 million of 4125 senior unsecured notes due 2044 the net proceeds of approximately 753 million were used to repay our 250 million 635 senior unsecured notes at maturity on june 15 2017 and for general corporate purposes including the repayment of working capital 

borrowings pursuant to our commercial paper program in october 2016 we issued 125 million of longterm debt under our three year 200 million multidraw term loan agreement 

additionally during fiscal 2017 we issued 13 million shares under our atm program and received net proceeds of 988 million as of september 30 2017 substantially all of shares under this program had been issued 

2016   

during the fiscal year ended september 30 2016 our financing activities generated 3036 million  of cash compared with 1311 million of cash generated in fiscal 2015 the increase is primarily due to higher net shortterm borrowings due to increased capital expenditures and periodoverperiod changes in working capital funding needs compared to the prior year as well as proceeds received from the issuance of common stock under our atm program in the third fiscal quarter of 2016 

the following table shows the number of shares issued for the fiscal years ended september 30 2018  2017  and 2016  

  



credit ratings 

our credit ratings directly affect our ability to obtain shortterm and longterm financing in addition to the cost of such financing in determining our credit ratings the rating agencies consider a number of quantitative factors including debt to total capitalization operating cash flow relative to outstanding debt operating cash flow coverage of interest and pension liabilities and funding status in addition the rating agencies consider qualitative factors such as consistency of our earnings over time the quality of our management and business strategy and the regulatory environment in the states where we operate 

our debt is rated by two rating agencies standard  poor’s corporation sp and moody’s investors service moody’s as of september 30 2018  both rating agencies maintained a stable outlook 

our current debt ratings are all considered investment grade and are as follows 



 a significant degradation in our operating performance or a significant reduction in our liquidity caused by more limited access to the private and public credit markets as a result of deteriorating global or national financial and credit conditions could trigger a negative change in our ratings outlook or even a reduction in our credit ratings by the two credit rating agencies this would mean more limited access to the private and public credit markets and an increase in the costs of such borrowings 

a credit rating is not a recommendation to buy sell or hold securities the highest investment grade credit rating is aaa for sp and aaa for moody’s the lowest investment grade credit rating is bbb for sp and baa3 for moody’s our credit ratings may be revised or withdrawn at any time by the rating agencies and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating there can be no assurance that a rating will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if in its judgment circumstances so warrant 

debt covenants 

we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants as of september 30 2018  our debt covenants are described in note 5  to the consolidated financial statements 

contractual obligations and commercial commitments 

the following table provides information about contractual obligations and commercial commitments at september 30 2018  



  

 

we maintain supply contracts with several vendors that generally cover a period of up to one year commitments for estimated base gas volumes are established under these contracts on a monthly basis at contractually negotiated prices commitments for incremental daily purchases are made as necessary during the month in accordance with the terms of individual contracts our midtex division also maintains a limited number of longterm supply contracts to ensure a reliable source of gas for our customers in its service area which obligate it to purchase specified volumes at market and fixed prices at september 30 2018  we were committed to purchase 541  bcf within one year and 372  bcf within two to three years under indexed contracts 

the passage of the tcja resulted in the remeasurement of our net deferred tax liability at september 30 2018  we recorded 7449 million  which relates to our regulated operations and has been recorded as a regulatory liability the period and timing of the return of the excess deferred taxes is being determined by regulators in each of our jurisdictions see note 12 for further information 

risk management activities 

we use financial instruments to mitigate commodity price risk and periodically to manage interest rate risk in our distribution and pipeline and storage segments we use a combination of physical storage fixed physical contracts and fixed financial contracts to reduce our exposure to unusually large winterperiod gas price increases additionally we manage interest rate risk by entering into financial instruments to effectively fix the treasury yield component of the interest cost associated with anticipated financings 

we record our financial instruments as a component of risk management assets and liabilities which are classified as current or noncurrent based upon the anticipated settlement date of the underlying financial instrument substantially all of our financial instruments are valued using external market quotes and indices 

the following table shows the components of the change in fair value of our financial instruments for the fiscal year ended september 30 2018  in thousands 



the fair value of our financial instruments at september 30 2018  is presented below by time period and fair value source 



  

employee benefits programs 

an important element of our total compensation program and a significant component of our operation and maintenance expense is the offering of various benefits programs to our employees these programs include medical and dental insurance coverage and pension and postretirement programs 

medical and dental insurance 

we offer medical and dental insurance programs to substantially all of our employees we believe these programs are compliant with all current regulatory provisions and are consistent with other programs in our industry in recent years we have endeavored to actively manage our health care costs through the introduction of a wellness strategy that is focused on helping employees to identify health risks and to manage these risks through improved lifestyle choices 

over the last five fiscal years we have experienced annual medical and prescription inflation of approximately seven percent for fiscal 2019  we anticipate the medical and prescription drug inflation rate will increase at approximately six percent primarily due to the inflation of health care costs and normalization of large claim activity 

net periodic pension and postretirement benefit costs 

for the fiscal year ended september 30 2018  our total net periodic pension and other benefits costs was 414 million    compared with 490 million  and 460 million  for the fiscal years ended september 30 2017  and 2016  these costs are recoverable through our rates a portion of these costs is capitalized into our distribution rate base and the remaining costs are recorded as a component of operation and maintenance expense 

our fiscal 2018  costs were determined using a september 30 2017  measurement date at that date interest and corporate bond rates utilized to determine our discount rates were higher than the interest and corporate bond rates as of september 30 2016  the measurement date for our fiscal 2017 net periodic cost therefore we increased the discount rate used to measure our fiscal 2018 net periodic cost from 373 percent to 389 percent we lowered the expected return on plan assets from 700 percent to 675 percent in the determination of our fiscal 2018 net periodic pension cost based upon expected market returns for our targeted asset allocation on october 20 2017 the society of actuaries released its annuallyupdated mortality improvement scale for pension plans incorporating new assumptions surrounding life expectancies in the united states as of september 30 2017 we updated our assumed mortality rates to incorporate the updated mortality table as a result of the net impact of changes in these and other assumptions our fiscal 2018 pension and postretirement medical costs were higher than in the prior year 

our fiscal 2017 costs were determined using a september 30 2016 measurement date at that date interest and corporate bond rates utilized to determine our discount rates were lower than the interest and corporate bond rates as of september 30 

2015 the measurement date for our fiscal 2016 net periodic cost therefore we decreased the discount rate used to measure our fiscal 2017 net periodic cost from 455 percent to 373 percent we maintained the expected return on plan assets of 700 percent in the determination of our fiscal 2017 net periodic pension cost based upon expected market returns for our targeted asset allocation on october 20 2016 the society of actuaries released its annuallyupdated mortality improvement scale for pension plans incorporating new assumptions surrounding life expectancies in the united states as of september 30 2016 we updated our assumed mortality rates to incorporate the updated mortality table as a result of the net impact of changes in these and other assumptions our fiscal 2017 pension and postretirement medical costs were consistent with the prior year 

pension and postretirement plan funding 

generally our funding policy is to contribute annually an amount that will at least equal the minimum amount required to comply with the employee retirement income security act of 1974 erisa however additional voluntary contributions are made from time to time as considered necessary contributions are intended to provide not only for benefits attributed to service to date but also for those expected to be earned in the future 

in accordance with the pension protection act of 2006 ppa we determined the funded status of our plans as of january 1 2018  2017  and 2016  based on these valuations we have not had a minimum required contribution for the last three fiscal years however we made voluntary contributions of 70 million  50 million  and 150 million  to our pension plans during fiscal 2018  2017  and 2016  to achieve a desired ppa funding threshold 

we contributed 174 million  137 million  and 166 million  to our postretirement benefits plans for the fiscal years ended september 30 2018  2017  and 2016  the contributions represent the portion of the postretirement costs we are responsible for under the terms of our plan and minimum funding required by state regulatory commissions 

outlook for fiscal 2019  and beyond 

as of september 30 2018  interest and corporate bond rates were higher than the rates as of september 30 2017 therefore we increased the discount rate used to measure our fiscal 2019 net periodic cost from 389 percent to 438 percent the expected return on plan assets remained consistent with the prior year at 675 percent in the determination of our fiscal 2019 net periodic pension cost based upon expected market returns for our targeted asset allocation on october 23 2018  the society of actuaries released its annuallyupdated mortality improvement scale for pension plans incorporating new assumptions surrounding life expectancies in the united states as of september 30 2018 we updated our assumed mortality rates to incorporate the updated mortality table as a result of the net impact of changes in these and other assumptions we expect our fiscal 2019 net periodic pension cost to be lower than fiscal 2018 

based upon current market conditions the current funded position of the plans and the funding requirements under the ppa we do not anticipate a minimum required contribution for fiscal 2019  however we may consider whether a voluntary contribution is prudent to maintain certain funding levels the amount of this funding is contingent upon several factors including the issuance of new mortality tables by the us treasury department used to establish plan funding requirements with respect to our postretirement medical plans we anticipate contributing between 10 million  and 20 million  during fiscal 2019  

actual changes in the fair market value of plan assets and differences between the actual and expected return on plan assets could have a material effect on the amount of pension costs ultimately recognized a 025 percent change in our discount rate would impact our pension and postretirement costs by approximately 25 million a 025 percent change in our expected rate of return would impact our pension and postretirement costs by approximately 14 million 

the projected liability future funding requirements and the amount of expense or income recognized for each of our pension and other postretirement benefit plans are subject to change depending on the actuarial value of plan assets and the determination of future benefit obligations as of each subsequent calculation date these amounts are impacted by actual investment returns changes in interest rates changes in the demographic composition of the participants in the plans and other actuarial assumptions

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

we are exposed to risks associated with commodity prices and interest rates commodity price risk is the potential loss that we may incur as a result of changes in the fair value of a particular instrument or commodity interestrate risk is the potential increased cost we could incur when we issue debt instruments or to provide financing and liquidity for our business activities additionally interestrate risk could affect our ability to issue cost effective equity instruments 

we conduct risk management activities in our distribution and pipeline and storage segments in our distribution segment we use a combination of physical storage fixedprice forward contracts and financial instruments primarily overthecounter swap and option contracts in an effort to minimize the impact of natural gas price volatility on our customers during the winter heating season our risk management activities and related accounting treatment are described in further detail in note 13  to the consolidated financial statements additionally our earnings are affected by changes in shortterm interest rates as a result of our issuance of shortterm commercial paper and our other shortterm borrowings 

commodity price risk 

we purchase natural gas for our distribution operations substantially all of the costs of gas purchased for distribution operations are recovered from our customers through purchased gas cost adjustment mechanisms therefore our distribution operations have limited commodity price risk exposure 

interest rate risk 

our earnings are exposed to changes in shortterm interest rates associated with our shortterm commercial paper program and other shortterm borrowings we use a sensitivity analysis to estimate our shortterm interest rate risk for purposes of this analysis we estimate our shortterm interest rate risk as the difference between our actual interest expense for the period and estimated interest expense for the period assuming a hypothetical average one percent increase in the interest rates associated with our shortterm borrowings had interest rates associated with our shortterm borrowings increased by an average of one percent our net interest expense would have increased by approximately 02 million during 2018

overview and strategy 

atmos energy corporation headquartered in dallas texas and incorporated in texas and virginia is one of the country’s largest naturalgasonly distributors based on number of customers we deliver natural gas through regulated sales and transportation arrangements to over three million residential commercial public authority and industrial customers in eight states located primarily in the south we also operate one of the largest intrastate pipelines in texas based on miles of pipe 

through december 31 2016 we were also engaged in certain nonregulated businesses that provided natural gas management marketing transportation and storage services to municipalities local gas distribution companies including certain of our natural gas distribution divisions and industrial customers principally in the midwest and southeast effective january 1 2017 we sold all of the equity interests of atmos energy marketing llc aem to centerpoint energy services inc ces a subsidiary of centerpoint energy inc as a result of the sale atmos energy has fully exited the nonregulated gas marketing business 

atmos energys vision is to be the safest provider of natural gas services we intend to achieve this vision by 

 we believe the successful execution of this strategy has delivered excellent shareholder value over the last six years regulatory mechanisms designed to minimize regulatory lag have enabled us to make significant capital investments to fortify and upgrade our distribution and transmission systems the timely recovery of these investments has increased our rate base which has resulted in rising earnings per share during this time 

our core values include focusing on our employees and customers while conducting our business with honesty and integrity we continue to strengthen our culture through ongoing communications with our employees and enhanced employee training 

operating segments 

as of september 30 2017 we manage and review our consolidated operations through the following three reportable segments 

 these operating segments are described in greater detail below 

distribution segment overview 

our distribution segment is primarily comprised of the regulated natural gas distribution and related sales and storage operations in our six regulated natural gas distribution divisions which are used to support our regulated natural gas distribution operations in those states the following table summarizes key information about these divisions presented in order of total rate base we operate in our service areas under terms of nonexclusive franchise agreements granted by the various cities and towns that we serve at september 30 2017  we held 1008 franchises having terms generally ranging from five to 35 years a significant number of our franchises expire each year which require renewal prior to the end of their terms historically we have successfully renewed these franchises and believe that we will continue to be able to renew our franchises as they expire 



revenues in this operating segment are established by regulatory authorities in the states in which we operate these rates are intended to be sufficient to cover the costs of conducting business and to provide a reasonable return on invested capital in addition we transport natural gas for others through our distribution systems 

rates established by regulatory authorities often include cost adjustment mechanisms for costs that i are subject to significant price fluctuations compared to our other costs ii represent a large component of our cost of service and iii are generally outside our control 

purchased gas cost adjustment mechanisms represent a common form of cost adjustment mechanism purchased gas cost adjustment mechanisms provide natural gas distribution companies a method of recovering purchased gas costs on an ongoing basis without filing a rate case because they provide a dollarfordollar offset to increases or decreases in the cost natural gas therefore although substantially all of our distribution operating revenues fluctuate with the cost of gas that we purchase distribution gross profit which is defined as operating revenues less purchased gas cost is generally not affected by fluctuations in the cost of gas 

additionally some jurisdictions have performancebased ratemaking adjustments to provide incentives to distribution companies to minimize purchased gas costs through improved storage management and use of financial instruments to lock in gas costs under the performancebased ratemaking adjustments purchased gas costs savings are shared between the utility and its customers 

our supply of natural gas is provided by a variety of suppliers including independent producers marketers and pipeline companies withdrawals of gas from proprietary and contracted storage assets and peaking and spot purchase agreements as needed 

supply arrangements consist of both base load and swing supply peaking quantities and are contracted from our suppliers on a firm basis with various terms at market prices base load quantities are those that flow at a constant level throughout the month and swing supply quantities provide the flexibility to change daily quantities to match increases or decreases in requirements related to weather conditions 

except for local production purchases we select our natural gas suppliers through a competitive bidding process by periodically requesting proposals from suppliers that have demonstrated that they can provide reliable service we select these suppliers based on their ability to deliver gas supply to our designated firm pipeline receipt points at the lowest reasonable cost major suppliers during fiscal 2017  were bp energy company castleton commodities merchant trading lp centerpoint 

energy services inc concord energy llc conocophillips company devon gas services lp sequent energy management lp targa gas marketing llc tenaska gas storage llc and texla energy management inc 

the combination of base load peaking and spot purchase agreements coupled with the withdrawal of gas held in storage allows us the flexibility to adjust to changes in weather which minimizes our need to enter into longterm firm commitments we estimate our peakday availability of natural gas supply to be approximately 44 bcf the peakday demand for our distribution operations in fiscal 2017  was on january 6 2017 when sales to customers reached approximately 36 bcf 

currently our distribution divisions utilize 38 pipeline transportation companies both interstate and intrastate to transport our natural gas the pipeline transportation agreements are firm and many of them have “pipeline nonotice” storage service which provides for daily balancing between system requirements and nominated flowing supplies these agreements have been negotiated with the shortest term necessary while still maintaining our right of first refusal the natural gas supply for our midtex division is delivered primarily by our atmos pipeline — texas division apt 

to maintain our deliveries to high priority customers we have the ability and have exercised our right to curtail deliveries to certain customers under the terms of interruptible contracts or applicable state regulations or statutes our customers’ demand on our system is not necessarily indicative of our ability to meet current or anticipated market demands or immediate delivery requirements because of factors such as the physical limitations of gathering storage and transmission systems the duration and severity of cold weather the availability of gas reserves from our suppliers the ability to purchase additional supplies on a shortterm basis and actions by federal and state regulatory authorities curtailment rights provide us the flexibility to meet the humanneeds requirements of our customers on a firm basis priority allocations imposed by federal and state regulatory agencies as well as other factors beyond our control may affect our ability to meet the demands of our customers we do not anticipate any problems with obtaining additional gas supply as needed for our customers 

pipeline and storage segment overview 

our pipeline and storage segment consists of the pipeline and storage operations of apt and our natural gas transmission operations in louisiana apt is one of the largest intrastate pipeline operations in texas with a heavy concentration in the established natural gasproducing areas of central northern and eastern texas extending into or near the major producing areas of the barnett shale the texas gulf coast and the delaware and val verde basins of west texas through its system apt provides transportation and storage services to our midtex division other third party local distribution companies industrial and electric generation customers marketers and producers as part of its pipeline operations apt owns and operates five underground storage reservoirs in texas 

gross profit earned from transportation and storage services for apt is subject to traditional ratemaking governed by the rrc rates are updated through periodic filings made under texas’ gas reliability infrastructure program grip grip allows us to include in our rate base annually approved capital costs incurred in the prior calendar year provided that we file a complete rate case at least once every five years the most recent filing was completed in 2017 apt’s existing regulatory mechanisms allow certain transportation and storage services to be provided under marketbased rates 

our natural gas transmission operations in louisiana are comprised of a proprietary 21mile pipeline located in new orleans louisiana that is primarily used to aggregate gas supply for our distribution division in louisiana under a longterm contract and on a more limited basis to third parties the demand fee charged to our louisiana distribution division for these services is subject to regulatory approval by the louisiana public service commission we also manage two asset management plans in louisiana with distribution affiliates of the company which have been approved by applicable state regulatory commissions generally these asset management plans require us to share with our distribution customers a significant portion of the cost savings earned from these arrangements 

natural gas marketing segment overview 

through december 31 2016 we were engaged in a nonregulated natural gas marketing business which was conducted by atmos energy marketing aem aem’s primary business was to aggregate and purchase gas supply arrange transportation and storage logistics and ultimately deliver gas to customers at competitive prices 

as more fully described in note 15 effective january 1 2017 we sold all of the equity interests of aem to centerpoint energy services inc a subsidiary of centerpoint energy inc as a result of the sale atmos energy has fully exited the nonregulated natural gas marketing business accordingly these operations have been reported as discontinued operations 

ratemaking activity 

overview 

the method of determining regulated rates varies among the states in which our regulated businesses operate the regulatory authorities have the responsibility of ensuring that utilities in their jurisdictions operate in the best interests of customers while providing utility companies the opportunity to earn a reasonable return on their investment generally each 

regulatory authority reviews rate requests and establishes a rate structure intended to generate revenue sufficient to cover the costs of conducting business and to provide a reasonable return on invested capital 

our rate strategy focuses on reducing or eliminating regulatory lag obtaining adequate returns and providing stable predictable margins which benefit both our customers and the company as a result of our ratemaking efforts in recent years atmos energy has 

 the following table provides a jurisdictional rate summary for our regulated operations this information is for regulatory purposes only and may not be representative of our actual financial position 



  



  

 although substantial progress has been made in recent years by improving rate design and recovery of investment across atmos energy’s operating areas we will continue to seek improvements in rate design to address cost variations and pursue tariffs that reduce regulatory lag associated with investments further potential changes in federal energy policy federal safety regulations and adverse economic conditions will necessitate continued vigilance by the company and our regulators in meeting the challenges presented by these external factors 

recent ratemaking activity 

substantially all of our regulated revenues in the fiscal years ended september 30 2017  2016  and 2015  were derived from sales at rates set by or subject to approval by local or state authorities net operating income increases resulting from ratemaking activity totaling 1042 million  1225 million  and 1145 million  became effective in fiscal 2017  2016  and 2015  as summarized below 



additionally the following ratemaking efforts seeking 594 million  in annual operating income were initiated during fiscal 2017  but had not been completed as of september 30 2017  



  

 

our recent ratemaking activity is discussed in greater detail below 

annual formula rate mechanisms 

as an instrument to reduce regulatory lag formula rate mechanisms allow us to refresh our rates on an annual basis without filing a formal rate case however these filings still involve discovery by the appropriate regulatory authorities prior to the final determination of rates under these mechanisms we currently have formula rate mechanisms in our louisiana mississippi and tennessee operations and in substantially all of our texas divisions additionally we have specific infrastructure programs in substantially all of our distribution divisions and our atmos pipeline  texas division with tariffs in place to permit the investment associated with these programs to have their surcharge rate adjusted annually to recover approved capital costs incurred in a prior testyear period the following table summarizes our annual formula rate mechanisms by state 





the following table summarizes our annual formula rate mechanisms with effective dates during the fiscal years ended september 30 2017  2016  and 2015  





   rate case filings 

a rate case is a formal request from atmos energy to a regulatory authority to increase rates that are charged to customers rate cases may also be initiated when the regulatory authorities request us to justify our rates this process is referred to as a “show cause” action adequate rates are intended to provide for recovery of the company’s costs as well as a fair rate of return to our shareholders and ensure that we continue to safely deliver reliable reasonably priced natural gas service to our customers the following table summarizes our recent rate cases 



  

other ratemaking activity 

the following table summarizes other ratemaking activity during the fiscal years ended september 30 2017  2016  and 2015  



  

 other regulation 

we are regulated by various state or local public utility authorities we are also subject to regulation by the united states department of transportation with respect to safety requirements in the operation and maintenance of our transmission and distribution facilities in addition our operations are also subject to various state and federal laws regulating environmental matters from time to time we receive inquiries regarding various environmental matters we believe that our properties and operations substantially comply with and are operated in substantial conformity with applicable safety and environmental statutes and regulations there are no administrative or judicial proceedings arising under environmental quality statutes pending or known to be contemplated by governmental agencies which would have a material adverse effect on us or our operations our environmental claims have arisen primarily from former manufactured gas plant sites 

the federal energy regulatory commission ferc allows pursuant to section 311 of the natural gas policy act gas transportation services through our atmos pipeline—texas assets “on behalf of” interstate pipelines or local distribution companies served by interstate pipelines without subjecting these assets to the jurisdiction of the ferc under the nga additionally the ferc has regulatory authority over the use and release of interstate pipeline and storage capacity the ferc also has authority to detect and prevent market manipulation and to enforce compliance with ferc’s other rules policies and orders by companies engaged in the sale purchase transportation or storage of natural gas in interstate commerce we have taken what we believe are the necessary and appropriate steps to comply with these regulations 

in july 2010 the doddfrank act was enacted representing an extensive overhaul of the framework for regulation of us financial markets the doddfrank act required various regulatory agencies including the sec and the commodities futures trading commission to establish regulations for implementation of many of the provisions of the doddfrank act a number of those regulations were adopted we enacted procedures and modified existing business practices and contractual arrangements to comply with such regulations 

competition 

although our regulated distribution operations are not currently in significant direct competition with any other distributors of natural gas to residential and commercial customers within our service areas we do compete with other natural gas suppliers and suppliers of alternative fuels for sales to industrial customers we compete in all aspects of our business with alternative energy sources including in particular electricity electric utilities offer electricity as a rival energy source and compete for the space heating water heating and cooking markets promotional incentives improved equipment efficiencies and promotional rates all contribute to the acceptability of electrical equipment the principal means to compete against alternative fuels is lower prices and natural gas historically has maintained its price advantage in the residential commercial and industrial markets 

our pipeline and storage operations historically faced competition from other existing intrastate pipelines seeking to provide or arrange transportation storage and other services for customers in the last few years several new pipelines have been completed which has increased the level of competition in this segment of our business 

within our discontinued natural gas marketing operations aem competed with other natural gas marketers to provide natural gas management and other related services primarily to smaller customers requiring higher levels of balancing scheduling and other related management services aem experienced increased competition in recent years primarily from investment banks and major integrated oil and natural gas companies who offer lower cost basic services the increased competition has reduced margins most notably on its highvolume accounts 

employees 

at september 30 2017  we had 4565 employees consisting of 4504 employees in our distribution operations and 61 employees in our pipeline and storage operations

risk factors 

tableend

our financial and operating results are subject to a number of risk factors many of which are not within our control although we have tried to discuss key risk factors below please be aware that other or new risks may prove to be important in the future investors should carefully consider the following discussion of risk factors as well as other information appearing in this report these factors include the following 

the company is dependent on continued access to the credit and capital markets to execute our business strategy 

our longterm debt is currently rated as “investment grade” by standard  poor’s corporation and moody’s investors service inc similar to most companies we rely upon access to both shortterm and longterm credit and capital markets to satisfy our liquidity requirements if adverse credit conditions were to cause a significant limitation on our access to the private credit and public capital markets we could see a reduction in our liquidity a significant reduction in our liquidity could in turn trigger a negative change in our ratings outlook or even a reduction in our credit ratings by one or more of the credit rating agencies such a downgrade could further limit our access to private credit andor public capital markets and increase our costs of borrowing 

while we believe we can meet our capital requirements from our operations and the sources of financing available to us we can provide no assurance that we will continue to be able to do so in the future especially if the market price of natural gas increases significantly in the near term the future effects on our business liquidity and financial results of a deterioration of current conditions in the credit and capital markets could be material and adverse to us both in the ways described above or in other ways that we do not currently anticipate 

we are subject to state and local regulations that affect our operations and financial results 

we are subject to regulatory oversight from various state and local regulatory authorities in the eight states that we serve therefore our returns are continuously monitored and are subject to challenge for their reasonableness by the appropriate regulatory authorities or other thirdparty intervenors in the normal course of business as a regulated entity we often need to place assets in service and establish historical test periods before rate cases that seek to adjust our allowed returns to recover that investment can be filed further the regulatory review process can be lengthy in the context of traditional ratemaking because of this process we suffer the negative financial effects of having placed assets in service without the benefit of rate relief which is commonly referred to as “regulatory lag” 

however in the last several years a number of regulatory authorities in the states we serve have approved rate mechanisms that provide for annual adjustments to rates that allow us to recover the cost of investments made to replace existing infrastructure or reflect changes in our cost of service these mechanisms work to effectively reduce the regulatory lag inherent in the ratemaking process however regulatory lag could significantly increase if the regulatory authorities modify or terminate these rate mechanisms the regulatory process also involves the risk that regulatory authorities may i review our purchases of natural gas and adjust the amount of our gas costs that we pass through to our customers or ii limit the costs we may have incurred from our cost of service that can be recovered from customers 

a deterioration in economic conditions could adversely affect our customers and negatively impact our financial results 

any adverse changes in economic conditions in the united states especially in the states in which we operate could adversely affect the financial resources of many domestic households and lead to an increase in mortgage defaults and significant decreases in the values of our customers’ homes and investment assets as a result our customers could seek to use less gas and make it more difficult for them to pay their gas bills this would likely lead to slower collections and higher than normal levels of accounts receivable this in turn could increase our financing requirements additionally should economic conditions deteriorate our industrial customers could seek alternative energy sources which could result in lower sales volumes 

inflation and increased gas costs could adversely impact our customer base and customer collections and increase our level of indebtedness 

over time inflation has caused increases in some of our operating expenses and has required assets to be replaced at higher costs we have a process in place to continually review the adequacy of our gas rates in relation to the increasing cost of providing service and the inherent regulatory lag in adjusting those gas rates historically we have been able to budget and control operating expenses and investments within the amounts authorized to be collected in rates and intend to continue to do so however the ability to control expenses is an important factor that could impact future financial results 

in addition rapid increases in the costs of purchased gas would cause us to experience a significant increase in shortterm debt we must pay suppliers for gas when it is purchased which can be significantly in advance of when these costs may be recovered through the collection of monthly customer bills for gas delivered increases in purchased gas costs also slow our natural gas distribution collection efforts as customers are more likely to delay the payment of their gas bills leading to higher than normal accounts receivable this could result in higher shortterm debt levels greater collection efforts and increased bad debt expense 

if contracted gas supplies interstate pipeline andor storage services are not available or delivered in a timely manner our ability to meet our customers’ natural gas requirements may be impaired and our financial condition may be adversely affected 

in order to meet our customers’ annual and seasonal natural gas demands we must obtain a sufficient supply of natural gas interstate pipeline capacity and storage capacity if we are unable to obtain these either from our suppliers’ inability to deliver the contracted commodity or the inability to secure replacement quantities our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected if a substantial disruption to or reduction in interstate natural gas pipelines’ transmission and storage capacity occurred due to operational failures or disruptions legislative or regulatory actions hurricanes tornadoes floods terrorist or cyberattacks or acts of war our operations or financial results could be adversely affected 

we are exposed to market risks that are beyond our control which could adversely affect our financial results and capital requirements 

we are subject to market risks beyond our control including i commodity price volatility caused by market supply and demand dynamics counterparty performance or counterparty creditworthiness and ii interest rate risk we are generally insulated from commodity price risk through our purchased gas cost mechanisms with respect to interest rate risk we have been operating in a relatively low interestrate environment in recent years compared to historical norms for both short and longterm interest rates however increases in interest rates could adversely affect our future financial results to the extent that we do not recover our actual interest expense in our rates 

the concentration of our operations in the state of texas exposes our operations and financial results to economic conditions weather patterns and regulatory decisions in texas 

over 50 percent of our distribution customers and most of our pipeline and storage assets and operations are located in the state of texas this concentration of our business in texas means that our operations and financial results may be significantly affected by changes in the texas economy in general weather patterns and regulatory decisions by state and local regulatory authorities in texas 

our operations are subject to increased competition  

in residential and commercial customer markets our distribution operations compete with other energy products such as electricity and propane our primary product competition is with electricity for heating water heating and cooking increases in the price of natural gas could negatively impact our competitive position by decreasing the price benefits of natural gas to the consumer this could adversely impact our business if as a result our customer growth slows reducing our ability to make capital expenditures or if our customers further conserve their use of gas resulting in reduced gas purchases and customer billings 

in the case of industrial customers such as manufacturing plants adverse economic conditions including higher gas costs could cause these customers to use alternative sources of energy such as electricity or bypass our systems in favor of special competitive contracts with lower perunit costs our pipeline and storage operations historically have faced limited competition from other existing intrastate pipelines and gas marketers seeking to provide or arrange transportation storage and other services for customers however in the last few years several new pipelines have been completed which has increased the level of competition in this segment of our business 

adverse weather conditions could affect our operations or financial results 

we have weathernormalized rates for over 95 percent of our residential and commercial meters in our distribution operations which substantially mitigates the adverse effects of warmerthannormal weather for meters in those service areas however there is no assurance that we will continue to receive such regulatory protection from adverse weather in our rates in the future the loss of such weathernormalized rates could have an adverse effect on our operations and financial results in addition our operating results may continue to vary somewhat with the actual temperatures during the winter heating season additionally sustained cold weather could challenge our ability to adequately meet customer demand in our operations 

our growth in the future may be limited by the nature of our business which requires extensive capital spending 

our operations are capitalintensive we must make significant capital expenditures to renew or replace our facilities on a longterm basis to improve the safety and reliability of our facilities and to comply with the safety rules and regulations issued by the regulatory authorities responsible for the service areas we operate in addition we must continually build new capacity to serve the growing needs of the communities we serve the magnitude of these expenditures may be affected by a number of factors including new regulations the general state of the economy and weather 

  the liquidity required to fund our working capital capital expenditures and other cash needs is provided from a combination of internally generated cash flows and external debt and equity financing the cost and availability of borrowing funds from third party lenders or issuing equity is dependent on the liquidity of the credit markets interest rates and other market conditions this in turn may limit the amount of funds we can invest in our infrastructure 

the costs of providing health care benefits pension and postretirement health care benefits and related funding requirements may increase substantially 

we provide health care benefits a cashbalance pension plan and postretirement health care benefits to eligible fulltime employees the costs of providing health care benefits to our employees could significantly increase over time due to rapidly increasing health care inflation and any future legislative changes related to the provision of health care benefits the impact of additional costs which are likely to be passed on to the company is difficult to measure at this time 

the costs of providing a cashbalance pension plan to eligible fulltime employees prior to 2011 and postretirement health care benefits to eligible fulltime employees and related funding requirements could be influenced by changes in the market value of the assets funding our pension and postretirement health care plans any significant declines in the value of these investments due to sustained declines in equity markets or a reduction in bond yields could increase the costs of our pension and postretirement health care plans and related funding requirements in the future further our costs of providing such benefits and related funding requirements are also subject to a number of factors including i changing demographics including longer life expectancy of beneficiaries and an expected increase in the number of eligible former employees over the next five to ten years ii various actuarial calculations and assumptions which may differ materially from actual results due primarily to changing market and economic conditions including changes in interest rates and higher or lower withdrawal rates and iii future government regulation 

the costs to the company of providing these benefits and related funding requirements could also increase materially in the future should there be a material reduction in the amount of the recovery of these costs through our rates or should significant delays develop in the timing of the recovery of such costs which could adversely affect our financial results 

the inability to continue to hire train and retain operational technical and managerial personnel could adversely affect our results of operations 

the average age of the employee base of atmos energy has been increasing for a number of years with a number of employees becoming eligible to retire within the next five to 10 years if we were unable to hire appropriate personnel to fill future needs the company could encounter operating challenges and increased costs primarily due to a loss of knowledge errors due to inexperience or the lengthy time period typically required to adequately train replacement personnel in addition higher costs could result from the increased use of contractors to replace retiring employees loss of productivity or increased safety compliance issues the inability to hire train and retain new operational technical and managerial personnel adequately and to transfer institutional knowledge and expertise could adversely affect our ability to manage and operate our business if we were unable to hire train and retain appropriately qualified personnel our results of operations could be adversely affected 

we may experience increased federal state and local regulation of the safety of our operations 

the safety and protection of the public our customers and our employees is our top priority we constantly monitor and maintain our pipeline and distribution systems to ensure that natural gas is delivered safely reliably and efficiently through our network of more than 75000 miles of pipeline and distribution lines however in recent years natural gas distribution and pipeline companies have continued to face increasing federal state and local oversight of the safety of their operations although we believe these costs should be ultimately recoverable through our rates the costs of complying with new laws and regulations may have at least a shortterm adverse impact on our operating costs and financial results 

some of our operations are subject to increased federal regulatory oversight that could affect our operations and financial results 

ferc has regulatory authority over some of our operations including the use and release of interstate pipeline and storage capacity ferc has adopted rules designed to prevent market power abuse and market manipulation and to promote compliance with ferc’s other rules policies and orders by companies engaged in the sale purchase transportation or storage of natural gas in interstate commerce these rules carry increased penalties for violations although we have taken steps to structure current and future transactions to comply with applicable current ferc regulations changes in ferc regulations or their interpretation by ferc or additional regulations issued by ferc in the future could also adversely affect our business financial condition or financial results 

we are subject to environmental regulations which could adversely affect our operations or financial results 

we are subject to laws regulations and other legal requirements enacted or adopted by federal state and local governmental authorities relating to protection of the environment and health and safety matters including those that govern discharges of substances into the air and water the management and disposal of hazardous substances and waste the cleanup of contaminated sites groundwater quality and availability plant and wildlife protection as well as work practices related to employee health and safety environmental legislation also requires that our facilities sites and other properties associated with our operations be operated maintained abandoned and reclaimed to the satisfaction of applicable regulatory authorities failure to comply with these laws regulations permits and licenses may expose us to fines penalties or interruptions in our operations that could be significant to our financial results in addition existing environmental regulations may be revised or our operations may become subject to new regulations 

the operations and financial results of the company could be adversely impacted as a result of climate change or related additional legislation or regulation in the future 

to the extent climate change occurs our businesses could be adversely impacted although we believe it is likely that any such resulting impacts would occur very gradually over a long period of time and thus would be difficult to quantify with any degree of specificity to the extent climate change would result in warmer temperatures in our service territories financial results could be adversely affected through lower gas volumes and revenues such climate change could also cause shifts in population including customers moving away from our service territories near the gulf coast in louisiana and mississippi 

another possible climate change would be more frequent and more severe weather events such as hurricanes and tornadoes which could increase our costs to repair damaged facilities and restore service to our customers if we were unable to deliver natural gas to our customers our financial results would be impacted by lost revenues and we generally would have to seek approval from regulators to recover restoration costs to the extent we would be unable to recover those costs or if higher rates resulting from our recovery of such costs would result in reduced demand for our services our future business financial condition or financial results could be adversely impacted 

in addition there have been a number of federal and state legislative and regulatory initiatives proposed in recent years in an attempt to control or limit the effects of global warming and overall climate change including greenhouse gas emissions such as carbon dioxide the adoption of this type of legislation by congress or similar legislation by states or the adoption of related regulations by federal or state governments mandating a substantial reduction in greenhouse gas emissions in the future could have farreaching and significant impacts on the energy industry such new legislation or regulations could result in increased compliance costs for us or additional operating restrictions on our business affect the demand for natural gas or impact the prices we charge to our customers at this time we cannot predict the potential impact of such laws or regulations that may be adopted on our future business financial condition or financial results 

distributing transporting and storing natural gas involve risks that may result in accidents and additional operating costs 

our operations involve a number of hazards and operating risks that cannot be completely avoided such as leaks accidents and operational problems which could cause loss of human life as well as substantial financial losses resulting from property damage damage to the environment and to our operations we maintain liability and property insurance coverage in place for many of these hazards and risks however because some of our transmission pipeline and storage facilities are near or are in populated areas any loss of human life or adverse financial results resulting from such events could be large if these events were not fully covered by our general liability and property insurance which policies are subject to certain limits and deductibles our operations or financial results could be adversely affected 

cyberattacks or acts of cyberterrorism could disrupt our business operations and information technology systems or result in the loss or exposure of confidential or sensitive customer employee or company information 

our business operations and information technology systems may be vulnerable to an attack by individuals or organizations intending to disrupt our business operations and information technology systems even though the company has implemented policies procedures and controls to prevent and detect these activities we use our information technology systems to manage our distribution and intrastate pipeline and storage operations and other business processes disruption of those systems could adversely impact our ability to safely deliver natural gas to our customers operate our pipeline and storage systems or serve our customers timely accordingly if such an attack or act of terrorism were to occur our operations and financial results could be adversely affected 

in addition we use our information technology systems to protect confidential or sensitive customer employee and company information developed and maintained in the normal course of our business any attack on such systems that would result in the unauthorized release of customer employee or other confidential or sensitive data could have a material adverse effect on our business reputation increase our costs and expose us to additional material legal claims and liability even though we have insurance coverage in place for many of these cyberrelated risks if such an attack or act of terrorism were to occur our operations and financial results could be adversely affected to the extent not fully covered by such insurance coverage 

natural disasters terrorist activities or other significant events could adversely affect our operations or financial results 

natural disasters are always a threat to our assets and operations in addition the threat of terrorist activities could lead to increased economic instability and volatility in the price of natural gas that could affect our operations also companies in our industry may face a heightened risk of exposure to actual acts of terrorism which could subject our operations to increased risks as a result the availability of insurance covering such risks may become more limited which could increase the risk that an event could adversely affect our operations or financial results

our significant accounting policies are discussed in notes 2  and 15 to our consolidated financial statements the accounting policies discussed below are both important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and require management to make difficult subjective or complex accounting estimates accordingly these critical accounting policies are reviewed periodically by the audit committee of the board of directors 





nongaap financial measure 

our operations are affected by the cost of natural gas the cost of gas is passed through to our customers without markup and includes commodity price transportation storage injection and withdrawal fees and settlements of financial instruments used to mitigate commodity price risk these costs are reflected in the income statement as purchased gas cost therefore increases in the cost of gas are offset by a corresponding increase in revenues accordingly we believe gross profit a nongaap financial measure defined as operating revenues less purchased gas cost is a better indicator of our financial performance than operating revenues as it provides a useful and more relevant measure to analyze our financial performance as such the following discussion and analysis of our financial performance will reference gross profit rather than operating revenues and purchased gas cost individually 

results of operations 

overview 

atmos energy strives to operate our businesses safely and reliably while delivering superior shareholder value in recent years we have implemented rate designs that reduce or eliminate regulatory lag and separate the recovery of our approved rate from customer usage patterns additionally we have significantly increased investments in the safety and reliability of our natural gas distribution and transmission infrastructure this increased level of investment and timely recovery of these investments through our various regulatory mechanisms has resulted in increased earnings and operating cash flow in recent years 

this trend continued during fiscal 2017  as net income increased to 3964 million  or 373  per diluted share for the year ended september 30 2017  compared with net income of 3501 million  or 338  per diluted share in the prior year the yearoveryear increase largely reflects positive rate outcomes which more than offset weather that was 12 percent warmer than the prior year results for fiscal 2017 include 013 per diluted share from discontinued operations in january 2017 we completed the sale of our nonregulated natural gas marketing business we received 1403 million in cash proceeds including working capital and recognized a net gain of 003 per diluted share on the sale in the second quarter of fiscal 2017 the proceeds from the sale were redeployed to fund infrastructure investments in our remaining businesses as a result of the sale we have fully exited the nonregulated gas marketing business 

capital expenditures for fiscal 2017  totaled 11371 million  over 80 percent was invested to improve the safety and reliability of our distribution and transmission systems with a significant portion of this investment incurred under regulatory mechanisms that reduce regulatory lag to six months or less fiscal 2016 and 2017 spending under these and other mechanisms enabled the company to complete 19 regulatory filings during fiscal 2017 that should increase annual operating income from regulated operations by 1042 million  we funded over 75 percent of our currentyear capital expenditure program primarily through operating cash flows of 8671 million  

in addition we acquired enlink pipeline in the first fiscal quarter of 2017 for an all–cash price of 861 million inclusive of working capital the acquisition of enlink pipeline increased the capacity on our apt intrastate pipeline to serve transportation customers in north texas which continues to experience significant population growth 

as we continue to invest in the safety and reliability of our distribution and transmission systems we expect our capital spending will increase in future periods we intend to fund future investments through a combination of internally generated cash flows and external debt and equity financing during fiscal 2017 we received net proceeds of 885 million through the issuance of longterm debt and 99 million through the issuance of common stock the net proceeds from these issuances were primarily used to repay maturing longterm debt reduce shortterm debt and for general corporate purposes including funding a portion of our fiscal 2017 capital expenditures 

as a result of the continued contribution and stability of our earnings cash flows and capital structure our board of directors increased the quarterly dividend by 78 percent for fiscal 2018 

consolidated results 

the following table presents our consolidated financial highlights for the fiscal years ended september 30 2017  2016  and 2015  

  

our consolidated net income during the last three fiscal years was earned across our business segments as follows 





see the following discussion regarding the results of operations for each of our business operating segments 

distribution  segment 

the distribution segment is primarily comprised of our regulated natural gas distribution and related sales operations in eight states the primary factors that impact the results of our distribution operations are our ability to earn our authorized rates of return competitive factors in the energy industry and economic conditions in our service areas 

our ability to earn our authorized rates is based primarily on our ability to improve the rate design in our various ratemaking jurisdictions to minimize regulatory lag and ultimately separate the recovery of our approved rates from customer usage patterns improving rate design is a longterm process and is further complicated by the fact that we operate in multiple rate jurisdictions the “ratemaking activity” section of this form 10k describes our current rate strategy progress towards implementing that strategy and recent ratemaking initiatives in more detail 

we are generally able to pass the cost of gas through to our customers without markup under purchased gas cost adjustment mechanisms therefore increases in the cost of gas are offset by a corresponding increase in revenues gross profit in our texas and mississippi service areas include franchise fees and gross receipt taxes which are calculated as a percentage of revenue inclusive of gas costs therefore the amount of these taxes included in revenue is influenced by the cost of gas and the level of gas sales volumes we record the associated tax expense as a component of taxes other than income although changes in revenue related taxes arising from changes in gas costs affect gross profit over time the impact is offset within operating income 

although the cost of gas typically does not have a direct impact on our gross profit higher gas costs may adversely impact our accounts receivable collections resulting in higher bad debt expense and may require us to increase borrowings 

under our credit facilities resulting in higher interest expense in addition higher gas costs as well as competitive factors in the industry and general economic conditions may cause customers to conserve or in the case of industrial consumers to use alternative energy sources currently gas cost risk has been mitigated by rate design that allows us to collect from our customers the gas cost portion of our bad debt expense on approximately 76 percent of our residential and commercial margins 

during fiscal 2017  we completed 18 regulatory proceedings in our distribution  segment which should result in a 912 million increase in annual operating income 

review of financial and operating results 

financial and operational highlights for our distribution  segment for the fiscal years ended september 30 2017  2016  and 2015  are presented below 



fiscal year ended september 30 2017  compared with fiscal year ended september 30 2016   

net income for our distribution  segment increased 15 percent primarily due to a 985 million  increase in gross profit partially offset by a  348 million  increase in operating expenses the yeartodate increase in gross profit primarily reflects 

 the increase in operating expenses which include operation and maintenance expense bad debt expense depreciation and amortization expense and taxes other than income was primarily due to increased depreciation expense and property taxes associated with increased capital investments higher employeerelated costs increased revenuerelated taxes as discussed above and higher pipeline maintenance and related activities partially offset by lower legal costs 

fiscal year ended september 30 2016  compared with fiscal year ended september 30 2015   

net income for our distribution  segment increased 14 percent primarily due to a 343 million  increase in gross profit partially offset by a 151 million  increase in operating expenses the yearoveryear increase in gross profit primarily reflects 

 the increase in operating expenses which include operation and maintenance expense bad debt expense depreciation and amortization expense and taxes other than income was primarily due to pipeline maintenance and related activities and increased depreciation expense associated with increased capital investments 

net income for the year ended september 30 2016 included a 50 million income tax benefit for equity awards that vested during the current year as a result of adopting the new stockbased accounting guidance as described in note 2 to our consolidated financial statements 

the following table shows our operating income by distribution division in order of total rate base for the fiscal years ended september 30 2017  2016  and 2015  the presentation of our distribution operating income is included for financial reporting purposes and may not be appropriate for ratemaking purposes 



pipeline and storage  segment 

our pipeline and storage  segment consists of the pipeline and storage operations of atmos pipelinetexas division apt and our natural gas transmission operations in louisiana which were previously included in our former nonregulated segment apt is one of the largest intrastate pipeline operations in texas with a heavy concentration in the established natural gas producing areas of central northern and eastern texas extending into or near the major producing areas of the barnett shale the texas gulf coast and the delaware and val verde basins of west texas apt provides transportation and storage services to our midtex division other third party local distribution companies industrial and electric generation customers marketers and producers as part of its pipeline operations apt manages five underground storage reservoirs in texas 

our natural gas transmission operations in louisiana are comprised of a proprietary 21mile pipeline located in new orleans louisiana that is primarily used to aggregate gas supply for our distribution division in louisiana under a longterm contract and on a more limited basis to third parties the demand fee charged to our louisiana distribution division for these services is subject to regulatory approval by the louisiana public service commission we also manage two asset management plans which have been approved by applicable state regulatory commissions generally these asset management plans require us to share with our distribution customers a significant portion of the cost savings earned from these arrangements 

our pipeline and storage  segment is impacted by seasonal weather patterns competitive factors in the energy industry and economic conditions in apts service area natural gas prices do not directly impact the results of this segment as revenues 

are derived from the transportation of natural gas however natural gas prices and demand for natural gas could influence the level of drilling activity in the markets that we serve which may influence the level of throughput we may be able to transport on our pipeline further natural gas price differences between the various hubs that we serve determine the market value for transportation services between those geographic areas 

the results of apt are also significantly impacted by the natural gas requirements of the midtex division because apt is the midtex divisions primary transporter of natural gas 

apt annually uses the gas reliability infrastructure program grip to recover capital costs incurred in the prior calendar year however grip also requires a utility to file a statement of intent at least once every five years to review its costs and expenses including capital costs filed for recovery under grip on august 1 2017 a final order was issued in our most recent apt rate case resulting in a 13 million increase in annual operating income on september 1 2017 apt filed its 2016 grip filing covering changes in net investment from october 1 2016 through december 31 2016 with a requested increase in operating income of 290 million 

on december 21 2016 the louisiana public service commission approved an annual increase of five percent to the demand fee charged by our natural gas transmission pipeline for each of the next 10 years effective october 1 2017 this agreement replaces the existing agreement that expired in september 2017 

finally as a regulated pipeline the operations of apt may be impacted by the timing of when costs and expenses are incurred and when these costs and expenses are recovered through its tariffs 

review of financial and operating results 

financial and operational highlights for our pipeline and storage  segment for the fiscal years ended september 30 2017  2016  and 2015  are presented below 



fiscal year ended september 30 2017  compared with fiscal year ended september 30 2016 

net income for our pipeline and storage  segment increased two percent primarily due to a 273 million  increase in gross profit partially offset by a 207 million  increase in operating expenses the increase in gross profit primarily reflects a 246 million increase in rates from the approved 2016 grip filing and the rate case finalized in august 2017 and higher through system revenue of 83 million largely related to higher basis spreads due to increased production in the permian basin and incremental throughput on the enlink pipeline which was acquired in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 partially offsetting these increases was a decrease in gross profit of 23 million due to lower excess retention gas sales in the current year as noted above as a result of the annual rate case we did not file our annual grip filing during the second quarter of fiscal 2017 which influenced this segments performance yearoveryear 

operating expenses increased 207 million  primarily due to increased depreciation expense and property taxes associated with increased capital investments 

fiscal year ended september 30 2016  compared with fiscal year ended september 30 2015 

net income for our pipeline and storage  segment increased 12 percent primarily due to a 429 million  increase in gross profit partially offset by a 171 million  increase in operating expenses the increase in gross profit primarily reflects a 396 million increase in rates from the approved 2015 and 2016 grip filings additionally gross profit reflects a 36 million increase from the sale of excess retention gas which was offset by a 40 million decrease in throughsystem volumes and lower storage and blending fees due to warmer weather in the current year compared to the prior year 

operating expenses increased 171 million  primarily due to increased levels of pipeline maintenance activities to improve the safety and reliability of our system and increased property taxes and depreciation expense associated with increased capital investments 

natural gas marketing  segment 

through december 31 2016 we were engaged in an unregulated natural gas marketing business which was conducted by atmos energy marketing aem aem’s primary business was to aggregate and purchase gas supply arrange transportation and storage logistics and ultimately deliver gas to customers at competitive prices 

as more fully described in note 15 effective january 1 2017 we sold all of the equity interests of aem to centerpoint energy services inc ces a subsidiary of centerpoint energy inc as a result of the sale atmos energy has fully exited the nonregulated natural gas marketing business accordingly these operations have been reported as discontinued operations 

review of financial and operating results 

financial and operational highlights for our natural gas marketing  segment for the fiscal years ended september 30 2017  2016  and 2015  are presented below 



  fiscal year ended september 30 2017  compared with fiscal year ended september 30 2016 

the 91 million  yearoveryear increase in net income from discontinued operations primarily reflects the recognition of a net 66 million noncash gain from unwinding hedge accounting for certain of the natural gas marketing businesss financial positions in connection with the sale of aem additionally we recognized a 27 million  net gain on sale upon completion of the sale of aem to ces in january 2017 

fiscal year ended september 30 2016  compared with fiscal year ended september 30 2015 

net income for our natural gas marketing segment decreased 52 percent compared to fiscal 2015 primarily due to lower gross profit 

the 123 million  yearoveryear decrease in gross profit was primarily due to a decrease in asset optimization margins combined with a decrease in delivered gas margins as a result of warmer weather we modified storage positions to meet customer needs throughout the winter and captured less favorable spread values on the related supply repurchases additionally we experienced an increase in storage demand fees related primarily to higher park and loan activity delivered gas margins decreased primarily due to a three percent decrease in consolidated sales volumes due to warmer weather however lower net transportation costs and other variable costs driven by fewer deliveries resulted in perunit margins of 12 cents per mcf which is consistent with fiscal 2015 perunit margins 

operating expenses decreased 39 million  primarily due to lower administrative expenses 

liquidity and capital resources 

the liquidity required to fund our working capital capital expenditures and other cash needs is provided from a combination of internally generated cash flows and external debt and equity financing external debt financing is provided primarily through the issuance of longterm debt a 15 billion commercial paper program and three committed revolving credit facilities with a total availability from thirdparty lenders of approximately 15 billion the commercial paper program and credit facilities provide costeffective shortterm financing until it can be replaced with a balance of longterm debt and equity financing that achieves the company’s desired capital structure with an equitytocapitalization ratio between 50 and 60 inclusive of longterm and shortterm debt additionally we have various uncommitted trade credit lines with our gas suppliers that we utilize to purchase natural gas on a monthly basis the liquidity provided by these sources is expected to be sufficient to fund the companys working capital needs and capital expenditure program for fiscal year 2018 and beyond 

to support our capital market activities we filed a registration statement with the sec on march 28 2016 to issue from time to time up to 25 billion in common stock andor debt securities at september 30 2017 approximately 16 billion of securities remained available for issuance under the shelf registration statement which expires march 26 2019 

the following table presents our capitalization as of september 30 2017  and 2016  



cash flows 

our internally generated funds may change in the future due to a number of factors some of which we cannot control these factors include regulatory changes the price for our services the demand for such products and services margin requirements resulting from significant changes in commodity prices operational risks and other factors 

cash flows from operating investing and financing activities for the years ended september 30 2017  2016  and 2015  are presented below 



cash flows from operating activities 

yearoveryear changes in our operating cash flows primarily are attributable to changes in net income working capital changes particularly within our distribution segment resulting from changes in the price of natural gas and the timing of customer collections payments for natural gas purchases and deferred gas cost recoveries 

fiscal year ended september 30 2017  compared with fiscal year ended september 30 2016   

for the fiscal year ended september 30 2017  we generated operating cash flows of 8671 million  compared with 7950 million  in the prior year the yearoveryear increase  primarily reflects the positive cash effect of successful rate case outcomes achieved in fiscal 2016 

fiscal year ended september 30 2016  compared with fiscal year ended september 30 2015   

for the fiscal year ended september 30 2016  we generated operating cash flows of 7950 million  compared with 8119 million  in fiscal 2015  the yearoveryear decrease primarily reflects the timing of deferred gas cost recoveries 

cash flows from investing activities 

in recent years we have used substantial amounts of cash to fund our ongoing construction program which enables us to enhance the safety and reliability of the system used to provide distribution services to our existing customer base expand our natural gas distribution services into new markets enhance the integrity of our pipelines and more recently expand our intrastate pipeline network over the last three fiscal years approximately 80 percent of our capital spending has been committed to improving the safety and reliability of our system 

in executing our regulatory strategy we target our capital spending on regulatory mechanisms that permit us to earn an adequate return timely on our investment without compromising the safety or reliability of our system substantially all of our regulated jurisdictions have rate tariffs that provide the opportunity to include in their rate base approved capital costs on a periodic basis without being required to file a rate case 

 for the fiscal year ended september 30 2017  we had 11371 million  in capital expenditures compared with 10870 million  for the fiscal year ended september 30 2016  and 9636 million  for the fiscal year ended september 30 2015  

fiscal year ended september 30 2017  compared with fiscal year ended september 30 2016   

the 501 million increase in capital expenditures in fiscal 2017  compared to fiscal 2016  primarily reflects 

 cash flows from investing activities for the year ended september 30 2017  also include proceeds of 1403 million received from the sale of aem proceeds received from the completion of a state of texas use tax audit and 861 million used to purchase enlink pipeline in the first fiscal quarter of 2017 

fiscal year ended september 30 2016  compared with fiscal year ended september 30 2015 

the 1234 million increase in capital expenditures in fiscal 2016  compared to fiscal 2015  primarily reflects 

 cash flows from financing activities 

we generated a net amount of 1681 million  3036 million  and 1311 million  in cash from financing activities for fiscal years 2017  2016  and 2015  our significant financing activities for the fiscal years ended september 30 2017  2016  and 2015  are summarized as follows 

2017   

during the fiscal year ended september 30 2017 our financing activities generated  1681 million  of cash compared with  3036 million  of cash generated in the prior year the 1355 million  decrease in cash provided by financing activities is primarily due to the reduction in our short–term debt partially offset by an increase in our longterm debt 

during fiscal 2017 we completed approximately 975 million of debt and equity financing on june 8 2017 we completed a public offering of 500 million of 300 senior unsecured notes due 2027 and 250 million of 4125 senior unsecured notes due 2044 the net proceeds of approximately 753 million were used to repay our 250 million 635 senior unsecured notes at maturity on june 15 2017 and for general corporate purposes including the repayment of working capital borrowings pursuant to our commercial paper program in october 2016 we issued 125 million of longterm debt under our three year 200 million multidraw term loan agreement 

additionally during fiscal 2017 we issued 13 million shares under our atm program and received net proceeds of 988 million as of september 30 2017 substantially all of shares under this program had been issued 

2016   

during the fiscal year ended september 30 2016  our financing activities generated 3036 million  of cash compared with 1311 million  of cash generated in fiscal 2015 the increase is primarily due to higher net shortterm borrowings due to increased capital expenditures and periodoverperiod changes in working capital funding needs compared to the prior year as well as proceeds received from the issuance of common stock under our atm program in the third fiscal quarter of 2016 

2015   

during the fiscal year ended september 30 2015 our financing activities generated 1311 million  of cash compared with 682 million of cash generated in fiscal 2014 the increase is primarily due to timing between shortterm debt borrowings and repayments during fiscal 2015 proceeds from the issuance of 500 million unsecured 4125 senior notes in october 2014 and the settlement of the associated forward starting interest rate swaps partially offsetting these increases were the repayment of 500 million 495 senior unsecured notes at maturity on october 15 2014 compared with shortterm debt borrowings and repayments in fiscal 2014 and proceeds generated from the equity offering completed in february 2014 

the following table shows the number of shares issued for the fiscal years ended september 30 2017  2016  and 2015  

  



the decrease  in the number of shares issued in fiscal 2017  compared with the number of shares issued in fiscal 2016   primarily reflects fewer shares issued under the retirement savings plan and the ltip at september 30 2017  of the 112 million  aggregate shares authorized for issuance from the ltip 2035861 shares remained available 

the increase in the number of shares issued in fiscal 2016 compared with the number of shares issued in fiscal 2015 primarily reflects shares issued under the atm program 

credit ratings 

our credit ratings directly affect our ability to obtain shortterm and longterm financing in addition to the cost of such financing in determining our credit ratings the rating agencies consider a number of quantitative factors including debt to total capitalization operating cash flow relative to outstanding debt operating cash flow coverage of interest and pension liabilities and funding status in addition the rating agencies consider qualitative factors such as consistency of our earnings over time the quality of our management and business strategy the risks associated with our regulated and nonregulated businesses and the regulatory environment in the states where we operate 

our debt is rated by two rating agencies standard  poor’s corporation sp and moody’s investors service moody’s as of september 30 2017  both rating agencies maintained a stable outlook 

our current debt ratings are all considered investment grade and are as follows 



 a significant degradation in our operating performance or a significant reduction in our liquidity caused by more limited access to the private and public credit markets as a result of deteriorating global or national financial and credit conditions could trigger a negative change in our ratings outlook or even a reduction in our credit ratings by the two credit rating agencies this would mean more limited access to the private and public credit markets and an increase in the costs of such borrowings 

a credit rating is not a recommendation to buy sell or hold securities the highest investment grade credit rating is aaa for sp and aaa for moody’s the lowest investment grade credit rating is bbb for sp and baa3 for moody’s our credit ratings may be revised or withdrawn at any time by the rating agencies and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating there can be no assurance that a rating will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if in its judgment circumstances so warrant 

debt covenants 

we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants as of september 30 2017  our debt covenants are described in note 5  to the consolidated financial statements 

contractual obligations and commercial commitments 

the following table provides information about contractual obligations and commercial commitments at september 30 2017  



  

 

our distribution and pipeline and storage segments maintain supply contracts with several vendors that generally cover a period of up to one year commitments for estimated base gas volumes are established under these contracts on a monthly basis at contractually negotiated prices commitments for incremental daily purchases are made as necessary during the month in accordance with the terms of individual contracts our midtex division also maintains a limited number of longterm supply contracts to ensure a reliable source of gas for our customers in its service area which obligate it to purchase specified volumes at market and fixed prices at september 30 2017  we were committed to purchase 209  bcf within one year 379  bcf within two to three years and 03  bcf after three years under indexed contracts 

risk management activities 

we use financial instruments to mitigate commodity price risk and periodically to manage interest rate risk in our distribution and pipeline and storage segments we use a combination of physical storage fixed physical contracts and fixed financial contracts to reduce our exposure to unusually large winterperiod gas price increases additionally we manage interest rate risk by entering into financial instruments to effectively fix the treasury yield component of the interest cost associated with anticipated financings through december 31 2016 we managed our exposure to the risk of natural gas price changes in our natural gas marketing segment by locking in our gross profit margin through a combination of storage and financial instruments including futures overthecounter and exchangetraded options and swap contracts with counterparties risk management assets and liabilities associated with our former natural gas marketing operations have been classified as held for sale at september 30 2016 the change in fair value of these risk management assets and liabilities are included below 

we record our financial instruments as a component of risk management assets and liabilities which are classified as current or noncurrent based upon the anticipated settlement date of the underlying financial instrument substantially all of our financial instruments are valued using external market quotes and indices 

the following table shows the components of the change in fair value of our financial instruments for the fiscal year ended september 30 2017  in thousands 



the fair value of our financial instruments at september 30 2017  is presented below by time period and fair value source 



  

employee benefits programs 

an important element of our total compensation program and a significant component of our operation and maintenance expense is the offering of various benefits programs to our employees these programs include medical and dental insurance coverage and pension and postretirement programs 

medical and dental insurance 

we offer medical and dental insurance programs to substantially all of our employeeswe believe these programs are compliant with all current regulatory provisions and are consistent with other programs in our industry in recent years we have endeavored to actively manage our health care costs through the introduction of a wellness strategy that is focused on helping employees to identify health risks and to manage these risks through improved lifestyle choices 

over the last five fiscal years we have experienced annual medical and prescription inflation of approximately six percent for fiscal 2018  we anticipate the medical and prescription drug inflation rate will continue at approximately six percent primarily due to the inflation of health care costs 

net periodic pension and postretirement benefit costs 

for the fiscal year ended september 30 2017  our total net periodic pension and other benefits costs was 490 million  compared with 460 million  and 589 million  for the fiscal years ended september 30 2016  and 2015  these costs are 

recoverable through our rates a portion of these costs is capitalized into our distribution rate base and the remaining costs are recorded as a component of operation and maintenance expense 

our fiscal 2017  costs were determined using a september 30 2016  measurement date at that date interest and corporate bond rates utilized to determine our discount rates were lower than the interest and corporate bond rates as of september 30 2015  the measurement date for our fiscal 2016 net periodic cost therefore we decreased the discount rate used to measure our fiscal 2017 net periodic cost from 455 percent to 373 percent we maintained the expected return on plan assets of 700 percent in the determination of our fiscal 2017 net periodic pension cost based upon expected market returns for our targeted asset allocation on october 20 2016 the society of actuaries released its annuallyupdated mortality improvement scale for pension plans incorporating new assumptions surrounding life expectancies in the united states as of september 30 2016 we updated our assumed mortality rates to incorporate the updated mortality table as a result of the net impact of changes in these and other assumptions our fiscal 2017 pension and postretirement medical costs were consistent with the prior year 

our fiscal 2016 costs were determined using a september 30 2015 measurement date at that date interest and corporate bond rates utilized to determine our discount rates were higher than the interest and corporate bond rates as of september 30 2014 the measurement date for our fiscal 2015 net periodic cost therefore we increased the discount rate used to measure our fiscal 2016 net periodic cost from 443 percent to 455 percent we lowered expected return on plan assets from 725 percent to 700 percent in the determination of our fiscal 2016 net periodic pension cost based upon expected market returns for our targeted asset allocation as a result of the net impact of these and other assumptions our fiscal 2016 pension and postretirement medical costs were lower than in the prior year 

pension and postretirement plan funding 

generally our funding policy is to contribute annually an amount that will at least equal the minimum amount required to comply with the employee retirement income security act of 1974 erisa however additional voluntary contributions are made from time to time as considered necessary contributions are intended to provide not only for benefits attributed to service to date but also for those expected to be earned in the future 

in accordance with the pension protection act of 2006 ppa we determined the funded status of our plans as of january 1 2017 based on this valuation we contributed cash of 50 million  150 million  and 380 million  to our pension plans during fiscal 2017  2016  and 2015  each contribution increased the level of our plan assets to achieve a desired ppa funding threshold 

we contributed 137 million  166 million  and 200 million  to our postretirement benefits plans for the fiscal years ended september 30 2017  2016  and 2015  the contributions represent the portion of the postretirement costs we are responsible for under the terms of our plan and minimum funding required by state regulatory commissions 

outlook for fiscal 2018  and beyond 

as of september 30 2017  interest and corporate bond rates were higher than the rates as of september 30 2016 therefore we increased the discount rate used to measure our fiscal 2018 net periodic cost from 373 percent to 389 percent we lowered the expected return on plan assets to 675 percent in the determination of our fiscal 2018 net periodic pension cost based upon expected market returns for our targeted asset allocation on october 20 2017 the society of actuaries released its annuallyupdated mortality improvement scale for pension plans incorporating new assumptions surrounding life expectancies in the united states as of september 30 2017 we updated our assumed mortality rates to incorporate the updated mortality table as a result of the net impact of changes in these and other assumptions we expect our fiscal 2018 net periodic pension cost to be approximately 25 percent lower than fiscal 2017 

based upon current market conditions the current funded position of the plans and the funding requirements under the ppa we do not anticipate a minimum required contribution for fiscal 2018  however we may consider whether a voluntary contribution is prudent to maintain certain funding levels the amount of this funding is contingent upon several factors including the issuance of new mortality tables by the us treasury department used to establish plan funding requirementswith respect to our postretirement medical plans we anticipate contributing between 10 million  and 20 million  during fiscal 2018  

actual changes in the fair market value of plan assets and differences between the actual and expected return on plan assets could have a material effect on the amount of pension costs ultimately recognized a 025 percent change in our discount rate would impact our pension and postretirement costs by approximately 30 million a 025 percent change in our expected rate of return would impact our pension and postretirement costs by approximately 13 million 

the projected liability future funding requirements and the amount of expense or income recognized for each of our pension and other postretirement benefit plans are subject to change depending on the actuarial value of plan assets and the determination of future benefit obligations as of each subsequent calculation date these amounts are impacted by actual 

investment returns changes in interest rates changes in the demographic composition of the participants in the plans and other actuarial assumptions

we are exposed to risks associated with commodity prices and interest rates commodity price risk is the potential loss that we may incur as a result of changes in the fair value of a particular instrument or commodity interestrate risk results from our portfolio of debt and equity instruments that we issue to provide financing and liquidity for our business activities 

we conduct risk management activities in our distribution pipeline and storage segments and formerly in our natural gas marketing segment in our distribution and pipeline and storage segments we use a combination of physical storage fixed physical contracts and fixed financial contracts to protect us and our customers against unusually large winter period gas price increases in our natural gas marketing segment we previously managed our exposure to the risk of natural gas price changes and locked in our gross profit margin through a combination of storage and financial instruments including futures overthecounter and exchangetraded options and swap contracts with counterparties our risk management activities and related accounting treatment are described in further detail in note 13  to the consolidated financial statements additionally our earnings are affected by changes in shortterm interest rates as a result of our issuance of shortterm commercial paper and our other shortterm borrowings 

commodity price risk 

we purchase natural gas for our distribution operations substantially all of the costs of gas purchased for distribution operations are recovered from our customers through purchased gas cost adjustment mechanisms therefore our distribution operations have limited commodity price risk exposure 

interest rate risk 

our earnings are exposed to changes in shortterm interest rates associated with our shortterm commercial paper program and other shortterm borrowings we use a sensitivity analysis to estimate our shortterm interest rate risk for purposes of this analysis we estimate our shortterm interest rate risk as the difference between our actual interest expense for the period and estimated interest expense for the period assuming a hypothetical average one percent increase in the interest rates associated with our shortterm borrowings had interest rates associated with our shortterm borrowings increased by an average of one percent our interest expense would have increased by approximately 43 million during 2017

overview and strategy 

atmos energy corporation headquartered in dallas texas and incorporated in texas and virginia is engaged primarily in the regulated natural gas distribution and pipeline businesses as well as other nonregulated natural gas businesses we deliver natural gas through regulated sales and transportation arrangements to over three million residential commercial public authority and industrial customers in eight states located primarily in the south which makes us one of the country’s largest naturalgasonly distributors based on number of customers we also operate one of the largest intrastate pipelines in texas based on miles of pipe 

our nonregulated businesses provide natural gas management marketing transportation and storage services to municipalities local gas distribution companies including certain of our natural gas distribution divisions and industrial customers principally in the midwest and southeast 

atmos energys vision is to be the safest provider of natural gas services we intend to achieve this vision by 

 we believe the successful execution of this strategy has delivered excellent shareholder value over the last five years we have achieved growth by making significant capital investments to fortify and upgrade our distribution and transmission systems and successfully recovering these investments through regulatory mechanisms designed to minimize regulatory lag 

our core values include focusing on our employees and customers while conducting our business with honesty and integrity we continue to strengthen our culture through ongoing communications with our employees and enhanced employee training 

operating segments 

we operate the company through the following three segments 

 

these operating segments are described in greater detail below 

regulated distribution segment overview 

our regulated distribution segment is comprised of our six regulated natural gas distribution divisions this segment represents approximately 65 percent of our consolidated net income the following table summarizes key information about these divisions presented in order of total rate base we operate in our service areas under terms of nonexclusive franchise agreements granted by the various cities and towns that we serve at september 30 2016  we held 1003 franchises having terms generally ranging from five to 35 years a significant number of our franchises expire each year which require renewal prior to the end of their terms historically we have successfully renewed these franchises and believe that we will continue to be able to renew our franchises as they expire 



revenues in this operating segment are established by regulatory authorities in the states in which we operate these rates are intended to be sufficient to cover the costs of conducting business and to provide a reasonable return on invested capital in addition we transport natural gas for others through our distribution system 

rates established by regulatory authorities often include cost adjustment mechanisms for costs that i are subject to significant price fluctuations compared to our other costs ii represent a large component of our cost of service and iii are generally outside our control 

purchased gas cost adjustment mechanisms represent a common form of cost adjustment mechanism purchased gas cost adjustment mechanisms provide natural gas distribution companies a method of recovering purchased gas costs on an ongoing basis without filing a rate case because they provide a dollarfordollar offset to increases or decreases in natural gas distribution gas costs therefore although substantially all of our distribution operating revenues fluctuate with the cost of gas that we purchase distribution gross profit which is defined as operating revenues less purchased gas cost is generally not affected by fluctuations in the cost of gas 

additionally some jurisdictions have performancebased ratemaking adjustments to provide incentives to distribution companies to minimize purchased gas costs through improved storage management and use of financial instruments to lock in gas costs under the performancebased ratemaking adjustment purchased gas costs savings are shared between the utility and its customers 

our supply of natural gas is provided by a variety of suppliers including independent producers marketers and pipeline companies and withdrawals of gas from proprietary and contracted storage assets additionally the natural gas supply for our midtex division includes peaking and spot purchase agreements 

supply arrangements consist of both base load and swing supply peaking quantities and are contracted from our suppliers on a firm basis with various terms at market prices base load quantities are those that flow at a constant level throughout the month and swing supply quantities provide the flexibility to change daily quantities to match increases or decreases in requirements related to weather conditions 

except for local production purchases we select our natural gas suppliers through a competitive bidding process by periodically requesting proposals from suppliers that have demonstrated that they can provide reliable service we select these suppliers based on their ability to deliver gas supply to our designated firm pipeline receipt points at the lowest reasonable cost major suppliers during fiscal 2016  were concord energy llc conocophillips company devon gas services lp gulf south pipeline company lp sequent energy management lp targa gas marketing llc tenaska gas storage llc texas 

gas transmission corporation texla energy management inc and atmos energy marketing llc and trans louisiana gas pipeline inc which are wholly owned subsidiaries in our nonregulated segment 

the combination of base load peaking and spot purchase agreements coupled with the withdrawal of gas held in storage allows us the flexibility to adjust to changes in weather which minimizes our need to enter into longterm firm commitments we estimate our peakday availability of natural gas supply to be approximately 44 bcf the peakday demand for our distribution operations in fiscal 2016  was on january 10 2016 when sales to customers reached approximately 25 bcf 

currently our distribution divisions except for our midtex division utilize 40 pipeline transportation companies both interstate and intrastate to transport our natural gas the pipeline transportation agreements are firm and many of them have “pipeline nonotice” storage service which provides for daily balancing between system requirements and nominated flowing supplies these agreements have been negotiated with the shortest term necessary while still maintaining our right of first refusal the natural gas supply for our midtex division is delivered primarily by our atmos pipeline — texas division apt 

to maintain our deliveries to high priority customers we have the ability and have exercised our right to curtail deliveries to certain customers under the terms of interruptible contracts or applicable state regulations or statutes our customers’ demand on our system is not necessarily indicative of our ability to meet current or anticipated market demands or immediate delivery requirements because of factors such as the physical limitations of gathering storage and transmission systems the duration and severity of cold weather the availability of gas reserves from our suppliers the ability to purchase additional supplies on a shortterm basis and actions by federal and state regulatory authorities curtailment rights provide us the flexibility to meet the humanneeds requirements of our customers on a firm basis priority allocations imposed by federal and state regulatory agencies as well as other factors beyond our control may affect our ability to meet the demands of our customers we do not anticipate any problems with obtaining additional gas supply as needed for our customers 

regulated pipeline segment overview 

our regulated pipeline segment consists of the regulated pipeline and storage operations of apt apt is one of the largest intrastate pipeline operations in texas with a heavy concentration in the established natural gasproducing areas of central northern and eastern texas extending into or near the major producing areas of the barnett shale the texas gulf coast and the delaware and val verde basins of west texas through it apt provides transportation and storage services to our midtex division other third party local distribution companies industrial and electric generation customers marketers and producers as part of its pipeline operations apt owns and operates five underground storage reservoirs in texas this segment represents approximately 30 percent of our consolidated operations 

gross profit earned from transportation and storage services for apt is subject to traditional ratemaking governed by the rrc rates are updated through periodic filings made under texas’ gas reliability infrastructure program grip grip allows us to include in our rate base annually approved capital costs incurred in the prior calendar year provided that we file a complete rate case at least once every five years apt’s existing regulatory mechanisms allow certain transportation and storage services to be provided under marketbased rates 

nonregulated segment overview 

our nonregulated operations are conducted through atmos energy holdings inc aeh a whollyowned subsidiary of atmos energy corporation and typically represent approximately five percent of our consolidated net income aehs primary business is to buy sell and deliver natural gas at competitive prices to approximately 1000 customers located primarily in the midwest and southeast areas of the united states aeh accomplishes this objective by aggregating and purchasing gas supply arranging transportation and storage logistics and effectively managing commodity price risk aeh also earns storage and transportation demand fees primarily from our regulated distribution operations in louisiana and kentucky these demand fees are subject to regulatory oversight and are renewed periodically 

ratemaking activity 

overview 

the method of determining regulated rates varies among the states in which our regulated businesses operate the regulatory authorities have the responsibility of ensuring that utilities in their jurisdictions operate in the best interests of customers while providing utility companies the opportunity to earn a reasonable return on their investment generally each regulatory authority reviews rate requests and establishes a rate structure intended to generate revenue sufficient to cover the costs of conducting business and to provide a reasonable return on invested capital 

our rate strategy focuses on reducing or eliminating regulatory lag obtaining adequate returns and providing stable predictable margins which benefit both our customers and the company as a result of our ratemaking efforts in recent years atmos energy has 



 the following table provides a jurisdictional rate summary for our regulated operations this information is for regulatory purposes only and may not be representative of our actual financial position 



  



  

 although substantial progress has been made in recent years by improving rate design and recovery of investment across atmos energy’s operating areas we will continue to seek improvements in rate design to address cost variations and pursue tariffs that reduce regulatory lag associated with investments further potential changes in federal energy policy federal safety regulations and adverse economic conditions will necessitate continued vigilance by the company and our regulators in meeting the challenges presented by these external factors 

recent ratemaking activity 

substantially all of our regulated revenues in the fiscal years ended september 30 2016  2015  and 2014  were derived from sales at rates set by or subject to approval by local or state authorities net operating income increases resulting from ratemaking activity totaling 1225 million  1145 million  and 933 million  became effective in fiscal 2016  2015  and 2014  as summarized below 



additionally the following ratemaking efforts were initiated during fiscal 2016  but had not been completed as of september 30 2016  



  

 

our recent ratemaking activity is discussed in greater detail below 

annual formula rate mechanisms 

as an instrument to reduce regulatory lag formula rate mechanisms allow us to refresh our rates on an annual basis without filing a formal rate case however these filings still involve discovery by the appropriate regulatory authorities prior to the final determination of rates under these mechanisms we currently have formula rate mechanisms in our louisiana mississippi and tennessee operations and in substantially all of our texas divisions additionally we have specific infrastructure programs in substantially all of our distribution divisions and our atmos pipeline  texas division with tariffs in place to permit the investment associated with these programs to have their surcharge rate adjusted annually to recover approved capital costs incurred in a prior testyear period the following table summarizes our annual formula rate mechanisms by state 



 the following table summarizes our annual formula rate mechanisms with effective dates during the fiscal years ended september 30 2016  2015  and 2014  





 rate case filings 

a rate case is a formal request from atmos energy to a regulatory authority to increase rates that are charged to customers rate cases may also be initiated when the regulatory authorities request us to justify our rates this process is referred to as a “show cause” action adequate rates are intended to provide for recovery of the company’s costs as well as a fair rate of return to our shareholders and ensure that we continue to safely deliver reliable reasonably priced natural gas service to our customers the following table summarizes our recent rate cases 



  



other ratemaking activity 

the following table summarizes other ratemaking activity during the fiscal years ended september 30 2016  2015  and 2014  



  

 other regulation 

each of our regulated distribution divisions and our regulated pipeline division is regulated by various state or local public utility authorities we are also subject to regulation by the united states department of transportation with respect to safety requirements in the operation and maintenance of our transmission and distribution facilities in addition our regulated operations are also subject to various state and federal laws regulating environmental matters from time to time we receive inquiries regarding various environmental matters we believe that our properties and operations substantially comply with and are operated in substantial conformity with applicable safety and environmental statutes and regulations there are no administrative or judicial proceedings arising under environmental quality statutes pending or known to be contemplated by governmental agencies which would have a material adverse effect on us or our operations our environmental claims have arisen primarily from former manufactured gas plant sites 

the federal energy regulatory commission ferc allows pursuant to section 311 of the natural gas policy act gas transportation services through our atmos pipeline—texas assets “on behalf of” interstate pipelines or local distribution companies served by interstate pipelines without subjecting these assets to the jurisdiction of the ferc additionally the ferc has regulatory authority over the sale of natural gas in the wholesale gas market and the use and release of interstate pipeline and storage capacity the ferc also has authority to detect and prevent market manipulation and to enforce compliance with ferc’s other rules policies and orders by companies engaged in the sale purchase transportation or storage of natural gas in interstate commerce we have taken what we believe are the necessary and appropriate steps to comply with these regulations 

in july 2010 the doddfrank act was enacted representing an extensive overhaul of the framework for regulation of us financial markets the doddfrank act required various regulatory agencies including the sec and the commodities futures trading commission to establish regulations for implementation of many of the provisions of the doddfrank act a number of those regulations have been adopted we have enacted new procedures and modified existing business practices and contractual arrangements to comply with such regulations we expect additional regulations to be issued which should provide additional clarity regarding the extent of the impact of this legislation on us the costs of participating in financial markets for hedging certain risks inherent in our business may be further increased when these expected additional regulations are adopted we also anticipate that the commodities futures trading commission will issue additional regulations related to reporting and disclosure obligations 

competition 

although our regulated distribution operations are not currently in significant direct competition with any other distributors of natural gas to residential and commercial customers within our service areas we do compete with other natural gas suppliers and suppliers of alternative fuels for sales to industrial customers we compete in all aspects of our business with alternative energy sources including in particular electricity electric utilities offer electricity as a rival energy source and compete for the space heating water heating and cooking markets promotional incentives improved equipment efficiencies and promotional rates all contribute to the acceptability of electrical equipment the principal means to compete against 

alternative fuels is lower prices and natural gas historically has maintained its price advantage in the residential commercial and industrial markets 

our regulated pipeline operations historically faced competition from other existing intrastate pipelines seeking to provide or arrange transportation storage and other services for customers in the last few years several new pipelines have been completed which has increased the level of competition in this segment of our business 

within our nonregulated operations aem competes with other natural gas marketers to provide natural gas management and other related services primarily to smaller customers requiring higher levels of balancing scheduling and other related management services aem has experienced increased competition in recent years primarily from investment banks and major integrated oil and natural gas companies who offer lower cost basic services the increased competition has reduced margins most notably on its highvolume accounts 

employees 

at september 30 2016  we had 4747 employees consisting of 4639 employees in our regulated operations and 108 employees in our nonregulated operations

risk factors 

tableend

our financial and operating results are subject to a number of risk factors many of which are not within our control although we have tried to discuss key risk factors below please be aware that other or new risks may prove to be important in the future investors should carefully consider the following discussion of risk factors as well as other information appearing in this report these factors include the following 

the company is dependent on continued access to the credit and capital markets to execute our business strategy 

our longterm debt is currently rated as “investment grade” by standard  poor’s corporation moody’s investors service inc and fitch ratings ltd similar to most companies we rely upon access to both shortterm and longterm credit and capital markets to satisfy our liquidity requirements if adverse credit conditions were to cause a significant limitation on our access to the private and public capital markets we could see a reduction in our liquidity a significant reduction in our liquidity could in turn trigger a negative change in our ratings outlook or even a reduction in our credit ratings by one or more of the three credit rating agencies such a downgrade could further limit our access to private credit andor public capital markets and increase our costs of borrowing 

further if our credit ratings were downgraded we could be required to provide additional liquidity to our nonregulated segment because the commodity financial instrument markets could become unavailable to us our nonregulated segment depends primarily upon an intercompany lending facility between aeh and atmos energy to finance its working capital needs supplemented by two small credit facilities with outside lenders our ability to provide this liquidity to aeh for our nonregulated operations is limited by the terms of the lending arrangement with aeh which is subject to annual approval by one state regulatory commission 

while we believe we can meet our capital requirements from our operations and the sources of financing available to us we can provide no assurance that we will continue to be able to do so in the future especially if the market price of natural gas increases significantly in the near term the future effects on our business liquidity and financial results of a deterioration of current conditions in the credit and capital markets could be material and adverse to us both in the ways described above or in other ways that we do not currently anticipate 

we are subject to state and local regulations that affect our operations and financial results 

our regulated distribution and regulated pipeline segments are subject to regulatory oversight from various state and local regulatory authorities in the eight states that we serve in our regulated distribution and pipeline segments therefore our returns are continuously monitored and are subject to challenge for their reasonableness by the appropriate regulatory authorities or other thirdparty intervenors in the normal course of business as a regulated entity we often need to place assets in service and establish historical test periods before rate cases that seek to adjust our allowed returns to recover that investment can be filed further the regulatory review process can be lengthy in the context of traditional ratemaking because of this process we suffer the negative financial effects of having placed assets in service without the benefit of rate relief which is commonly referred to as “regulatory lag” 

however in the last several years a number of regulatory authorities in the states we serve have approved rate mechanisms that provide for annual adjustments to rates that allow us to recover the cost of investments made to replace existing infrastructure or reflect changes in our cost of service these mechanisms work to effectively reduce the regulatory lag inherent in the ratemaking process however regulatory lag could significantly increase if the regulatory authorities modify or terminate these rate mechanisms the regulatory process also involves the risk that regulatory authorities may i review our purchases of natural gas and adjust the amount of our gas costs that we pass through to our customers or ii limit the costs we may have incurred from our cost of service that can be recovered from customers 

a deterioration in economic conditions could adversely affect our customers and negatively impact our financial results 

any adverse changes in economic conditions in the united states especially in the states in which we operate could adversely affect the financial resources of many domestic households and lead to an increase in mortgage defaults and significant decreases in the values of our customers’ homes and investment assets as a result our customers could seek to use even less gas and make it more difficult for them to pay their gas bills this would likely lead to slower collections and higher than normal levels of accounts receivable this in turn would probably increase our financing requirements additionally should economic conditions deteriorate our industrial customers could seek alternative energy sources which could result in lower sales volumes 

inflation and increased gas costs could adversely impact our customer base and customer collections and increase our level of indebtedness 

over time inflation has caused increases in some of our operating expenses and has required assets to be replaced at higher costs we have a process in place to continually review the adequacy of our distribution gas rates in relation to the increasing cost of providing service and the inherent regulatory lag in adjusting those gas rates historically we have been able to budget and control operating expenses and investments within the amounts authorized to be collected in rates and intend to continue to do so however the ability to control expenses is an important factor that could impact future financial results 

in addition rapid increases in the costs of purchased gas would cause us to experience a significant increase in shortterm debt we must pay suppliers for gas when it is purchased which can be significantly in advance of when these costs may be recovered through the collection of monthly customer bills for gas delivered increases in purchased gas costs also slow our natural gas distribution collection efforts as customers are more likely to delay the payment of their gas bills leading to higher than normal accounts receivable this could result in higher shortterm debt levels greater collection efforts and increased bad debt expense 

if contracted gas supplies interstate pipeline andor storage services are not available or delivered in a timely manner our ability to meet our customers’ natural gas requirements may be impaired and our financial condition may be adversely affected 

in order to meet our customers’ annual and seasonal natural gas demands we must obtain a sufficient supply of natural gas interstate pipeline capacity and storage capacity if we are unable to obtain these either from our suppliers’ inability to deliver 

the contracted commodity or the inability to secure replacement quantities our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected if a substantial disruption to or reduction in interstate natural gas pipelines’ transmission and storage capacity occurred due to operational failures or disruptions legislative or regulatory actions hurricanes tornadoes floods terrorist or cyberattacks or acts of war our operations or financial results could be adversely affected 

we are exposed to market risks that are beyond our control which could adversely affect our financial results and capital requirements 

we are subject to market risks beyond our control including i commodity price volatility caused by market supply and demand dynamics counterparty performance or counterparty creditworthiness and ii interest rate risk 

our regulated operations are generally insulated from commodity price risk through its purchased gas cost mechanisms although our nonregulated operations represent only about five percent of our consolidated financial results commodity price volatility experienced in this business segment could lead to some minor volatility in our earnings our nonregulated segment manages margins and limits risk exposure on the sale of natural gas inventory or the offsetting fixedprice purchase or sale commitments for physical quantities of natural gas through the use of a variety of financial instruments however contractual limitations could adversely affect our ability to withdraw gas from storage which could cause us to purchase gas at spot prices in a rising market to obtain sufficient volumes to fulfill customer contracts we could also realize financial losses on our efforts to limit risk as a result of volatility in the market prices of the underlying commodities or if a counterparty fails to perform under a contract 

with respect to interest rate risk we have been operating in a relatively low interestrate environment in recent years compared to historical norms for both short and longterm interest rates however increases in interest rates could adversely affect our future financial results 

the concentration of our distribution pipeline and storage operations in the state of texas exposes our operations and financial results to economic conditions weather patterns and regulatory decisions in texas 

over 50 percent of our regulated distribution customers and most of our regulated pipeline assets and operations are located in the state of texas this concentration of our business in texas means that our operations and financial results may be significantly affected by changes in the texas economy in general weather patterns and regulatory decisions by state and local regulatory authorities in texas 

our operations are subject to increased competition  

in residential and commercial customer markets our regulated distribution operations compete with other energy products such as electricity and propane our primary product competition is with electricity for heating water heating and cooking increases in the price of natural gas could negatively impact our competitive position by decreasing the price benefits of natural gas to the consumer this could adversely impact our business if as a result our customer growth slows reducing our ability to make capital expenditures or if our customers further conserve their use of gas resulting in reduced gas purchases and customer billings 

in the case of industrial customers such as manufacturing plants adverse economic conditions including higher gas costs could cause these customers to use alternative sources of energy such as electricity or bypass our systems in favor of special competitive contracts with lower perunit costs our regulated pipeline operations historically have faced limited competition from other existing intrastate pipelines and gas marketers seeking to provide or arrange transportation storage and other services for customers however in the last few years several new pipelines have been completed which has increased the level of competition in this segment of our business 

finally within our nonregulated operations aem competes with other natural gas marketers to provide natural gas management and other related services primarily to smaller customers requiring higher levels of balancing scheduling and other related management services aem has experienced increased competition in recent years from competitors who offer lower cost basic services 

adverse weather conditions could affect our operations or financial results 

we have weathernormalized rates for over 95 percent of our residential and commercial meters in our regulated distribution business which substantially mitigates the adverse effects of warmerthannormal weather for meters in those service areas however there is no assurance that we will continue to receive such regulatory protection from adverse weather in our rates in the future the loss of such weathernormalized rates could have an adverse effect on our operations and financial results in addition our regulated distribution and regulated pipeline operating results may continue to vary somewhat with the actual temperatures during the winter heating season sustained cold weather could adversely affect our nonregulated operations as we may be required to purchase gas at spot rates in a rising market to obtain sufficient volumes to fulfill some customer contracts additionally sustained cold weather could challenge our ability to adequately meet customer demand in our natural gas distribution and pipeline and storage operations 

our growth in the future may be limited by the nature of our business which requires extensive capital spending 

the regulated natural gas distribution and pipeline business is capitalintensive we must make significant capital expenditures to renew or replace our facilities on a longterm basis to improve the safety and reliability of our facilities and to comply with the safety rules and regulations issued by the regulatory authorities responsible for the service areas we operate in addition we must continually build new capacity in our regulated distribution and regulated pipeline operations to serve the growing needs of the communities we serve the magnitude of these expenditures may be affected by a number of factors including new regulations the general state of the economy and weather 

  the liquidity required to fund our capital expenditures and other cash needs is provided from a variety of sources including our cash flows from operations borrowings under our shortterm lending facilities and from time to time funds raised from the public debt and equity capital markets the cost and availability of borrowing funds from third party lenders or issuing equity is dependent on the liquidity of the credit markets interest rates and other market conditions this in turn may limit the amount of funds we can invest in our infrastructure 

the costs of providing health care benefits pension and postretirement health care benefits and related funding requirements may increase substantially 

we provide health care benefits a cashbalance pension plan and postretirement health care benefits to eligible fulltime employees the costs of providing health care benefits to our employees could significantly increase over time due to rapidly increasing health care inflation and any future legislative changes related to the provision of health care benefits the impact of additional costs which are likely to be passed on to the company are difficult to measure at this time 

the costs of providing a cashbalance pension plan to eligible fulltime employees prior to 2011 and postretirement health care benefits to eligible fulltime employees and related funding requirements could be influenced by changes in the market value of the assets funding our pension and postretirement health care plans any significant declines in the value of these investments due to sustained declines in equity markets or a reduction in bond yields could increase the costs of our pension and postretirement health care plans and related funding requirements in the future further our costs of providing such benefits and related funding requirements are also subject to a number of factors including i changing demographics including longer life expectancy of beneficiaries and an expected increase in the number of eligible former employees over the next five to ten years ii various actuarial calculations and assumptions which may differ materially from actual results due primarily to changing market and economic conditions including changes in interest rates and higher or lower withdrawal rates and iii future government regulation 

the costs to the company of providing these benefits and related funding requirements could also increase materially in the future should there be a material reduction in the amount of the recovery of these costs through our rates or should significant delays develop in the timing of the recovery of such costs which could adversely affect our financial results 

the inability to continue to hire train and retain operational technical and managerial personnel could adversely affect our results of operations 

the average age of the employee base of atmos energy has been increasing for a number of years with a number of employees becoming eligible to retire within the next five to 10 years if we were unable to hire appropriate personnel to fill future needs the company could encounter operating challenges and increased costs primarily due to a loss of knowledge errors due to inexperience or the lengthy time period typically required to adequately train replacement personnel in addition higher costs could result from the increased use of contractors to replace retiring employees loss of productivity or increased safety compliance issues the inability to hire train and retain new operational technical and managerial personnel adequately and to transfer institutional knowledge and expertise could adversely affect our ability to manage and operate our business if we were unable to hire train and retain appropriately qualified personnel our results of operations could be adversely affected 

we may experience increased federal state and local regulation of the safety of our operations 

the safety and protection of the public our customers and our employees is our top priority we constantly monitor and maintain our pipeline and distribution system to ensure that natural gas is delivered safely reliably and efficiently through our network of more than 72000 miles of pipeline and distribution lines however in recent years natural gas distribution and pipeline companies have continued to face increasing federal state and local oversight of the safety of their operations although we believe these costs should be ultimately recoverable through our rates the costs of complying with new laws and regulations may have at least a shortterm adverse impact on our operating costs and financial results 

some of our operations are subject to increased federal regulatory oversight that could affect our operations and financial results 

ferc has regulatory authority over some of our operations including sales of natural gas in the wholesale gas market and the use and release of interstate pipeline and storage capacity ferc has adopted rules designed to prevent market power abuse and market manipulation and to promote compliance with ferc’s other rules policies and orders by companies engaged in the 

sale purchase transportation or storage of natural gas in interstate commerce these rules carry increased penalties for violations although we have taken steps to structure current and future transactions to comply with applicable current ferc regulations changes in ferc regulations or their interpretation by ferc or additional regulations issued by ferc in the future could also adversely affect our business financial condition or financial results 

we are subject to environmental regulations which could adversely affect our operations or financial results 

we are subject to laws regulations and other legal requirements enacted or adopted by federal state and local governmental authorities relating to protection of the environment and health and safety matters including those that govern discharges of substances into the air and water the management and disposal of hazardous substances and waste the cleanup of contaminated sites groundwater quality and availability plant and wildlife protection as well as work practices related to employee health and safety environmental legislation also requires that our facilities sites and other properties associated with our operations be operated maintained abandoned and reclaimed to the satisfaction of applicable regulatory authorities failure to comply with these laws regulations permits and licenses may expose us to fines penalties or interruptions in our operations that could be significant to our financial results in addition existing environmental regulations may be revised or our operations may become subject to new regulations 

the operations and financial results of the company could be adversely impacted as a result of climate changes or related additional legislation or regulation in the future 

to the extent climate changes occur our businesses could be adversely impacted although we believe it is likely that any such resulting impacts would occur very gradually over a long period of time and thus would be difficult to quantify with any degree of specificity to the extent climate changes would result in warmer temperatures in our service territories financial results could be adversely affected through lower gas volumes and revenues such climate changes could also cause shifts in population including customers moving away from our service territories near the gulf coast in louisiana and mississippi 

another possible climate change would be more frequent and more severe weather events such as hurricanes and tornadoes which could increase our costs to repair damaged facilities and restore service to our customers if we were unable to deliver natural gas to our customers our financial results would be impacted by lost revenues and we generally would have to seek approval from regulators to recover restoration costs to the extent we would be unable to recover those costs or if higher rates resulting from our recovery of such costs would result in reduced demand for our services our future business financial condition or financial results could be adversely impacted 

in addition there have been a number of federal and state legislative and regulatory initiatives proposed in recent years in an attempt to control or limit the effects of global warming and overall climate change including greenhouse gas emissions such as carbon dioxide the adoption of this type of legislation by congress or similar legislation by states or the adoption of related regulations by federal or state governments mandating a substantial reduction in greenhouse gas emissions in the future could have farreaching and significant impacts on the energy industry such new legislation or regulations could result in increased compliance costs for us or additional operating restrictions on our business affect the demand for natural gas or impact the prices we charge to our customers at this time we cannot predict the potential impact of such laws or regulations that may be adopted on our future business financial condition or financial results 

distributing transporting and storing natural gas involve risks that may result in accidents and additional operating costs 

our regulated distribution and regulated pipeline businesses involve a number of hazards and operating risks that cannot be completely avoided such as leaks accidents and operational problems which could cause loss of human life as well as substantial financial losses resulting from property damage damage to the environment and to our operations we maintain liability and property insurance coverage in place for many of these hazards and risks however because some of our pipeline storage and distribution facilities are near or are in populated areas any loss of human life or adverse financial results resulting from such events could be large if these events were not fully covered by our general liability and property insurance which policies are subject to certain limits and deductibles our operations or financial results could be adversely affected 

cyberattacks or acts of cyberterrorism could disrupt our business operations and information technology systems or result in the loss or exposure of confidential or sensitive customer employee or company information 

our business operations and information technology systems may be vulnerable to an attack by individuals or organizations intending to disrupt our business operations and information technology systems even though the company has implemented policies procedures and controls to prevent and detect these activities we use our information technology systems to manage our distribution and intrastate pipeline operations and other business processes disruption of those systems could adversely impact our ability to safely deliver natural gas to our customers operate our pipeline systems or serve our customers timely accordingly if such an attack or act of terrorism were to occur our operations and financial results could be adversely affected 

in addition we use our information technology systems to protect confidential or sensitive customer employee and company information developed and maintained in the normal course of our business any attack on such systems that would result in the unauthorized release of customer employee or other confidential or sensitive data could have a material adverse effect on our business reputation increase our costs and expose us to additional material legal claims and liability even though we have insurance coverage in place for many of these cyberrelated risks if such an attack or act of terrorism were to occur our operations and financial results could be adversely affected to the extent not fully covered by such insurance coverage 

natural disasters terrorist activities or other significant events could adversely affect our operations or financial results 

natural disasters are always a threat to our assets and operations in addition the threat of terrorist activities could lead to increased economic instability and volatility in the price of natural gas that could affect our operations also companies in our industry may face a heightened risk of exposure to actual acts of terrorism which could subject our operations to increased risks as a result the availability of insurance covering such risks may become more limited which could increase the risk that an event could adversely affect our operations or financial results

critical accounting policies 

our consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and the related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ from estimates 

our significant accounting policies are discussed in note 2  to our consolidated financial statements the accounting policies discussed below are both important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and require management to make difficult subjective or complex accounting estimates accordingly these critical accounting policies are reviewed periodically by the audit committee of the board of directors 









results of operations 

overview 

atmos energy corporation strives to operate its businesses safely and reliably while delivering superior shareholder value in recent years we have implemented rate designs that reduce or eliminate regulatory lag and separate the recovery of our approved rate from customer usage patterns additionally we have significantly increased investments in the safety and reliability of our natural gas distribution and transmission infrastructure this increased level of investment and timely recovery of these investments through our various regulatory mechanisms has resulted in increased earnings and operating cash flow in recent years 

this trend continued during fiscal 2016 as net income increased to 3501 million  or 338  per diluted share for the year ended september 30 2016  compared with net income of 3151 million  or 309  per diluted share in the prior year the yearoveryear increase largely reflects positive rate outcomes which more than offset weather that was 25 percent warmer than the prior year and increased pipeline maintenance and integrity spending 

capital expenditures for fiscal 2016 totaled 10870 million  over 80 percent was invested to improve the safety and reliability of our distribution and transmission systems with a significant portion of this investment incurred under regulatory mechanisms that reduce regulatory lag to six months or less fiscal 2015 spending under these and other mechanisms enabled the company to complete 20 regulatory filings during fiscal 2016 that should increase annual operating income from regulated operations by 1225 million  we funded our capital expenditure program primarily through operating cash flows of 7950 million  net shortterm borrowings and the issuance of common stock including the atthemarket equity sales atm program described below 

as we continue to invest in the safety and reliability of our distribution and transmission systems we expect our capital spending will increase in future periods we intend to fund this level of investment through available operating cash flows the issuance of longterm debt securities and to a lesser extent the issuance of equity in order to strengthen our ability to meet our financing needs we 

• entered into an atm equity distribution agreement in march 2016 under which we may issue and sell shares of our common stock up to an aggregate offering price of 200 million we issued 14 million shares of common stock and received 986 million in net proceeds under the atm program in fiscal 2016 

•  executed in september 2016 a new threeyear 200 million multidraw term loan agreement with a syndicate of three lenders the term loan will be used to refinance existing indebtedness and for working capital capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes 

• amended our existing fiveyear 125 billion unsecured credit facility in october 2016 which increased the committed loan to 15 billion and extended the facility through september 25 2021 the amended facility also retains the 250 million accordion feature which allows for an increase in the total committed loan amount to 175 billion 

on may 13 2016 standard  poor’s corporation upgraded our senior unsecured debt rating to a from a and upgraded our shortterm debt rating to a1 from a2 with a ratings outlook of stable citing strong financial performance largely due to our ability to timely recover capital investments 

on october 31 2016 we announced the proposed sale of aem to centerpoint energy services inc the transaction will include the transfer of approximately 800 delivered gas customers and aem’s related asset optimization business at an all cash price of 400 million plus working capital at the date of closing no material gain or loss is currently anticipated in connection with the closing of this transaction the proceeds from the sale will be redeployed to fund infrastructure investment in the regulated business upon completion of the sale we will have fully exited the nonregulated gas marketing business 

as a result of the continued contribution and stability of our regulated earnings cash flows and capital structure our board of directors increased the quarterly dividend by 71 percent for fiscal 2017 

consolidated results 

the following table presents our consolidated financial highlights for the fiscal years ended september 30 2016  2015  and 2014  

  

 regulated operations contributed 95 percent  95 percent  and 89 percent  to our consolidated net income for fiscal years 2016  2015  and 2014  our consolidated net income during the last three fiscal years was earned across our business segments as follows 





see the following discussion regarding the results of operations for each of our business operating segments 

regulated distribution segment 

the primary factors that impact the results of our regulated distribution operations are our ability to earn our authorized rates of return the cost of natural gas competitive factors in the energy industry and economic conditions in our service areas 

our ability to earn our authorized rates is based primarily on our ability to improve the rate design in our various ratemaking jurisdictions by reducing or eliminating regulatory lag and ultimately separating the recovery of our approved margins from customer usage patterns improving rate design is a longterm process and is further complicated by the fact that we operate in multiple rate jurisdictions the “ratemaking activity” section of this form 10k describes our current rate strategy progress towards implementing that strategy and recent ratemaking initiatives in more detail 

we are generally able to pass the cost of gas through to our customers without markup under purchased gas cost adjustment mechanisms therefore the cost of gas typically does not have an impact on our gross profit as increases in the cost of gas are offset by a corresponding increase in revenues accordingly we believe gross profit is a better indicator of our financial performance than revenues however gross profit in our texas and mississippi service areas include franchise fees and gross receipt taxes which are calculated as a percentage of revenue inclusive of gas costs therefore the amount of these taxes included in revenue is influenced by the cost of gas and the level of gas sales volumes we record the tax expense as a 

component of taxes other than income although changes in revenue related taxes arising from changes in gas costs affect gross profit over time the impact is offset within operating income 

although the cost of gas typically does not have a direct impact on our gross profit higher gas costs may adversely impact our accounts receivable collections resulting in higher bad debt expense and may require us to increase borrowings under our credit facilities resulting in higher interest expense in addition higher gas costs as well as competitive factors in the industry and general economic conditions may cause customers to conserve or in the case of industrial consumers to use alternative energy sources currently gas cost risk has been mitigated by rate design that allows us to collect from our customers the gas cost portion of our bad debt expense on approximately 76 percent of our residential and commercial margins 

during fiscal 2016  we completed 19 regulatory proceedings in our regulated distribution segment which should result in a 818 million increase in annual operating income 

review of financial and operating results 

financial and operational highlights for our regulated distribution segment for the fiscal years ended september 30 2016  2015  and 2014  are presented below 



fiscal year ended september 30 2016  compared with fiscal year ended september 30 2015   

net income for our regulated distribution segment increased 13 percent primarily due to a 352 million  increase in gross profit partially offset by a  158 million  increase in operating expenses the yeartodate increase in gross profit primarily reflects 

 the increase in operating expenses which include operation and maintenance expense bad debt expense depreciation and amortization expense and taxes other than income was primarily due to pipeline maintenance and related activities and increased depreciation expense associated with increased capital investments 

net income for the year ended september 30 2016 includes a 50 million income tax benefit for equity awards that vested during the current year as a result of adopting the new stockbased accounting guidance as described in note 2  to our consolidated financial statements 

fiscal year ended september 30 2015  compared with fiscal year ended september 30 2014   

net income for our regulated distribution segment increased 19 percent primarily due to a 611 million  increase in gross profit partially offset by a 255 million  increase in operating expenses the yearoveryear increase in gross profit primarily reflects 

 the increase in operating expenses which include operation and maintenance expense bad debt expense depreciation and amortization expense and taxes other than income was primarily due to increased depreciation expense associated with increased capital investments and increased ad valorem and franchise taxes 

interest charges decreased by  108 million  primarily due to replacing our 500 million unsecured 495 senior notes with 500 million of 4125 30year unsecured senior notes on october 15 2014 

the following table shows our operating income by regulated distribution division in order of total rate base for the fiscal years ended september 30 2016  2015  and 2014  the presentation of our regulated distribution operating income is included for financial reporting purposes and may not be appropriate for ratemaking purposes 



regulated pipeline segment 

our regulated pipeline segment consists of the pipeline and storage operations of apt apt is one of the largest intrastate pipeline operations in texas with a heavy concentration in the established natural gas producing areas of central northern and eastern texas extending into or near the major producing areas of the barnett shale the texas gulf coast and the delaware and val verde basins of west texas apt provides transportation and storage services to our midtex division other third party local distribution companies industrial and electric generation customers marketers and producers as part of its pipeline operations apt manages five underground storage reservoirs in texas 

our regulated pipeline segment is impacted by seasonal weather patterns competitive factors in the energy industry and economic conditions in apts service area natural gas prices do not directly impact the results of this segment as revenues are derived from the transportation of natural gas however natural gas prices and demand for natural gas could influence the level of drilling activity in the markets that we serve which may influence the level of throughput we may be able to transport on our pipeline further natural gas price differences between the various hubs that we serve determine the market value for transportation services between those geographic areas 

the results of apt are also significantly impacted by the natural gas requirements of the midtex division because apt is the midtex divisions primary transporter of natural gas 

finally as a regulated pipeline the operations of apt may be impacted by the timing of when costs and expenses are incurred and when these costs and expenses are recovered through its tariffs 

review of financial and operating results 

financial and operational highlights for our regulated pipeline segment for the fiscal years ended september 30 2016  2015  and 2014  are presented below 



fiscal year ended september 30 2016  compared with fiscal year ended september 30 2015 

net income for our regulated pipeline segment increased seven percent primarily due to a 387 million  increase in gross profit partially offset by a 206 million  increase in operating expenses the increase in gross profit primarily reflects a 396 million increase in rates from the approved 2015 and 2016 gas reliability infrastructure program grip filings additionally gross profit reflects a 36 million increase from the sale of excess retention gas which was offset by a 40 million decrease in throughsystem volumes and lower storage and blending fees due to warmer weather in the current year compared to the prior year 

operating expenses increased 206 million  primarily due to increased levels of pipeline maintenance activities to improve the safety and reliability of our system and increased property taxes and depreciation expense associated with increased capital investments 

fiscal year ended september 30 2015  compared with fiscal year ended september 30 2014 

net income for our regulated pipeline segment increased 10 percent primarily due to a 517 million  increase in gross profit partially offset by a 432 million  increase in operating expenses the increase in gross profit primarily reflects a 470 million increase in rates from the approved 2014 and 2015 grip filings additionally gross profit reflects increased pipeline demand fees and throughsystem transportation volumes and rates that were offset by lower park and lend storage and blending fees and the absence of a 18 million increase recorded in the fiscal 2014 associated with the renewal of an annual adjustment mechanism 

operating expenses increased 432 million  primarily due to increased levels of pipeline and rightofway maintenance activities to improve the safety and reliability of our system and increased depreciation expense associated with increased capital investments along with the absence of a 67 million refund received in fiscal 2014 as a result of the completion of a state use tax audit 

nonregulated segment 

our nonregulated operations are conducted through atmos energy holdings inc aeh a whollyowned subsidiary of atmos energy corporation and typically represent approximately five percent of our consolidated net income 

aehs primary business is to buy sell and deliver natural gas at competitive prices to approximately 1000 customers located primarily in the midwest and southeast areas of the united states aeh accomplishes this objective by aggregating and purchasing gas supply arranging transportation and storage logistics and effectively managing commodity price risk 

aeh also earns storage and transportation demand fees primarily from our regulated distribution operations in louisiana and kentucky these demand fees are subject to regulatory oversight and are renewed periodically 

our nonregulated activities are significantly influenced by competitive factors in the industry and general economic conditions therefore the margins earned from these activities are dependent upon our ability to attract and retain customers and to minimize the cost of buying selling and delivering natural gas to offer more competitive pricing to those customers 

further natural gas market conditions most notably the price of natural gas and the level of price volatility affect our nonregulated businesses natural gas prices and the level of volatility are influenced by a number of factors including but not limited to general economic conditions the demand for natural gas in different parts of the country domestic natural gas production and natural gas inventory levels 

natural gas prices can influence 

 natural gas price volatility can also influence our nonregulated business in the following ways 

 our nonregulated segment manages its exposure to natural gas commodity price risk through a combination of physical storage and financial instruments therefore results for this segment include unrealized gains or losses on its net physical gas position and the related financial instruments used to manage commodity price risk these margins fluctuate based upon changes in the spreads between the physical and forward natural gas prices the magnitude of the unrealized gains and losses is also contingent upon the levels of our net physical position at the end of the reporting period 

review of financial and operating results 

financial and operational highlights for our nonregulated segment for the fiscal years ended september 30 2016  2015  and 2014  are presented below 



  fiscal year ended september 30 2016  compared with fiscal year ended september 30 2015 

net income for our nonregulated segment increased 3 percent compared to the prior year due to both lower gross profit and lower operating expenses 

the 91 million  periodoverperiod decrease in gross profit was primarily due to a 127 million  decrease in realized margins combined with a 37 million  increase in unrealized margins the decrease in realized margins reflects 

 operating expenses decreased 81 million  primarily due to lower administrative expenses 

fiscal year ended september 30 2015  compared with fiscal year ended september 30 2014 

net income for our nonregulated segment decreased 51 percent from compared to fiscal 2014 due to lower gross profit and higher operating expenses 

the 151 million  yearoveryear decrease in gross profit was primarily due to a 120 million  decrease in unrealized margins combined with a 31 million  decrease in realized margins the decrease in realized margins reflects 



 operating expenses increased 89 million  primarily due to higher legal expenses as a result of the favorable settlement in fiscal 2014 of the kentucky litigation and the resolution of the tennessee business license tax matter 

liquidity and capital resources 

the liquidity required to fund our working capital capital expenditures and other cash needs is provided from a variety of sources including internally generated funds as well as borrowings under our commercial paper program and bank credit facilities additionally we have various uncommitted trade credit lines with our gas suppliers that we utilize to purchase natural gas on a monthly basis finally from time to time we raise funds from the public debt and equity capital markets to fund our liquidity needs 

we regularly evaluate our funding strategy and capital structure to ensure that we i have sufficient liquidity for our shortterm and longterm needs and ii maintain a balanced capital structure with a debttocapitalization ratio in a target range of 45 to 55 percent we also evaluate the levels of committed borrowing capacity that we require we currently have over 1 billion of committed capacity from our shortterm facilities 

as we continue to invest in the safety and reliability of our distribution and transportation system we expect our capital spending will increase we intend to fund this additional investment through available operating cash flows the issuance of longterm debt securities and to a lesser extent the issuance of equity we believe the liquidity provided by these sources combined with our committed credit facilities will be sufficient to fund our working capital needs and capital expenditure program for fiscal year 2017 and beyond 

to support our capital market activities we filed a registration statement with the sec on march 28 2016 to issue from time to time up to 25 billion in common stock andor debt securities which replaced our registration statement that expired on march 28 2016 on march 28 2016 we entered into an atm equity distribution agreement under which we may issue and sell shares of our common stock up to an aggregate offering price of 200 million the shares will be issued under our shelf registration statement proceeds from the atm program will be used primarily to repay shortterm debt outstanding under our 125 billion commercial paper program to fund capital spending primarily to enhance the safety and reliability of our system and for general corporate purposes during fiscal 2016 we issued 14 million shares of common stock and received 986 million in net proceeds under the atm program at september 30 2016 24 billion of securities remain available for issuance under the shelf registration statement 

on september 22 2016 we entered into a three year 200 million multidraw term loan agreement with a syndicate of three lenders the term loan will be used to refinance existing indebtedness and for working capital capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes at september 30 2016 there were no borrowings under the term loan on october 5 2016 we amended our existing fiveyear 125 billion credit facility which increased the committed loan to 15 billion and extended the facility through september 25 2021 the amended facility also retains the 250 million accordion feature which allows for an increase in the total committed loan amount to 175 billion 

 additionally we plan to issue new unsecured senior notes to replace 250 million and 450 million of unsecured senior notes that will mature in fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2019 during fiscal 2014 and 2015 we entered into forward starting interest rate swaps to fix the treasury yield component associated with the anticipated fiscal 2019 issuances at 3782 in fiscal 2012 we entered into forward starting interest rate swaps to fix the treasury yield component associated with the anticipated fiscal 2017 issuances at 3367 

  

the following table presents our capitalization as of september 30 2016  and 2015  





cash flows 

our internally generated funds may change in the future due to a number of factors some of which we cannot control these factors include regulatory changes the price for our services the demand for such products and services margin requirements resulting from significant changes in commodity prices operational risks and other factors 

cash flows from operating investing and financing activities for the years ended september 30 2016  2015  and 2014  are presented below 



cash flows from operating activities 

yearoveryear changes in our operating cash flows primarily are attributable to changes in net income working capital changes particularly within our regulated distribution segment resulting from changes in the price of natural gas and the timing of customer collections payments for natural gas purchases and deferred gas cost recoveries 

fiscal year ended september 30 2016  compared with fiscal year ended september 30 2015   

for the fiscal year ended september 30 2016  we generated operating cash flows of 7950 million  compared with 8119 million  in the prior year the yearoveryear decrease  primarily reflects the timing of deferred gas cost recoveries 

fiscal year ended september 30 2015  compared with fiscal year ended september 30 2014   

for the fiscal year ended september 30 2015  we generated operating cash flows of 8119 million  compared with 7328 million  in fiscal 2014  the yearoveryear increase primarily reflects successful rate case outcomes in fiscal 2014 the timing of gas cost recoveries under our purchased gas cost mechanisms and lower gas prices during the fiscal 2015 storage injection season 

cash flows from investing activities 

in recent years we have used substantial amounts of cash to fund our ongoing construction program which enables us to enhance the safety and reliability of the systems used to provide regulated distribution services to our existing customer base expand our natural gas distribution services into new markets enhance the integrity of our pipelines and more recently expand our intrastate pipeline network over the last three fiscal years approximately 80 percent of our capital spending has been committed to improving the safety and reliability of our system 

in executing our regulatory strategy we target our capital spending on regulatory mechanisms that permit us to earn an adequate return timely on our investment without compromising the safety or reliability of our system substantially all of our 

regulated jurisdictions have rate tariffs that provide the opportunity to include in their rate base approved capital costs on a periodic basis without being required to file a rate case 

 for the fiscal year ended september 30 2016  we incurred 10870 million  for capital expenditures compared with 9636 million  for the fiscal year ended september 30 2015  and 8244 million  for the fiscal year ended september 30 2014  

fiscal year ended september 30 2016  compared with fiscal year ended september 30 2015   

the 1234 million increase  in capital expenditures in fiscal 2016  compared to fiscal 2015  primarily reflects 

 fiscal year ended september 30 2015  compared with fiscal year ended september 30 2014 

the 1392 million increase in capital expenditures in fiscal 2015  compared to fiscal 2014  primarily reflects 

 cash flows from financing activities 

we generated a net 3036 million  1311 million  and 682 million  in cash from financing activities for fiscal years 2016  2015  and 2014  our significant financing activities for the fiscal years ended september 30 2016  2015  and 2014  are summarized as follows 

2016   

during the fiscal year ended september 30 2016  our financing activities generated 3036 million  of cash compared with 1311 million  of cash generated in the prior year the increase is primarily due to higher net shortterm borrowings due to increased capital expenditures and periodoverperiod changes in working capital funding needs compared to the prior year as well as proceeds received from the issuance of common stock under our atm program in the third fiscal quarter of 2016 

2015   

during the fiscal year ended september 30 2015  our financing activities generated 1311 million  of cash compared with 682 million  of cash generated in fiscal 2014 the increase is primarily due to timing between shortterm debt borrowings and repayments during fiscal 2015 proceeds from the issuance of 500 million unsecured 4125 senior notes in october 2014 and the settlement of the associated forward starting interest rate swaps partially offsetting these increases were the repayment of 500 million 495 senior unsecured notes at maturity on october 15 2014 compared with shortterm debt borrowings and repayments in fiscal 2014 and proceeds generated from the equity offering completed in february 2014 

2014   

during the fiscal year ended september 30 2014 our financing activities generated 682 million  of cash compared with 857 million of cash generated in fiscal 2013 the decrease is primarily due to timing between shortterm debt borrowings and repayments during fiscal 2014 partially offset by proceeds from the equity offering completed in february 2014 compared with proceeds generated from the issuance of longterm debt in fiscal 2013 

the following table shows the number of shares issued for the fiscal years ended september 30 2016  2015  and 2014  

  



the increase  in the number of shares issued in fiscal 2016  compared with the number of shares issued in fiscal 2015   primarily reflects shares issued under the atm program at september 30 2016  of the 112 million  shares authorized for issuance from the ltip 2359106 shares remained available 

the decrease in the number of shares issued in fiscal 2015 compared with the number of shares issued in fiscal 2014 primarily reflects the equity offering completed in february 2014 partially offset by the fact that we began issuing shares for use by the direct stock purchase plan and the retirement savings plan and trust rather than using shares purchased in the open market for the year ended september 30 2015 we canceled and retired 148464 shares attributable to federal income tax withholdings on equity awards which are not included in the table above 

credit facilities 

our shortterm borrowing requirements are affected by the seasonal nature of the natural gas business changes in the price of natural gas and the amount of natural gas we need to supply to meet our customers’ needs could significantly affect our borrowing requirements 

as of september 30 2016 we financed our shortterm borrowing requirements through a combination of a 125 billion  commercial paper program four committed revolving credit facilities and one uncommitted revolving credit facility with a total availability from thirdparty lenders of approximately 13 billion  of working capital funding on october 5 2016 we amended our existing 125 billion unsecured credit facility which increased the committed loan to 15 billion and extended the facility through september 25 2021 the amended facility also retains the 250 million accordion feature which provides the opportunity to increase the total committed loan amount to 175 billionwe also use intercompany credit facilities to supplement the funding provided by these thirdparty committed credit facilities 

shelf registration 

on march 28 2016 we filed a registration statement with the sec that originally permitted us to issue from time to time up to 25 billion in common stock andor debt securities which replaced our registration statement that expired on march 28 2016 at september 30 2016 24 billion of securities remain available for issuance under the shelf registration statement 

credit ratings 

our credit ratings directly affect our ability to obtain shortterm and longterm financing in addition to the cost of such financing in determining our credit ratings the rating agencies consider a number of quantitative factors including debt to total capitalization operating cash flow relative to outstanding debt operating cash flow coverage of interest and pension liabilities and funding status in addition the rating agencies consider qualitative factors such as consistency of our earnings over time the quality of our management and business strategy the risks associated with our regulated and nonregulated businesses and the regulatory environment in the states where we operate 

our debt is rated by three rating agencies standard  poor’s corporation sp moody’s investors service moody’s and fitch ratings fitch on may 13 2016 sp upgraded our senior unsecured debt rating to a from a and upgraded our shortterm debt rating to a1 from a2 with a ratings outlook of stable citing strong financial performance largely due to our ability to timely recover capital investments as of september 30 2016 all three rating agencies maintained a stable outlook 

our current debt ratings are all considered investment grade and are as follows 



 a significant degradation in our operating performance or a significant reduction in our liquidity caused by more limited access to the private and public credit markets as a result of deteriorating global or national financial and credit conditions could trigger a negative change in our ratings outlook or even a reduction in our credit ratings by the three credit rating agencies this would mean more limited access to the private and public credit markets and an increase in the costs of such borrowings 

a credit rating is not a recommendation to buy sell or hold securities the highest investment grade credit rating is aaa for sp aaa for moody’s and aaa for fitch the lowest investment grade credit rating is bbb for sp baa3 for moody’s and bbb for fitch our credit ratings may be revised or withdrawn at any time by the rating agencies and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating there can be no assurance that a rating will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if in its judgment circumstances so warrant 

debt covenants 

we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants as of september 30 2016  our debt covenants are described in note 5  to the consolidated financial statements 

contractual obligations and commercial commitments 

the following table provides information about contractual obligations and commercial commitments at september 30 2016  



  

 

our regulated distribution segment maintains supply contracts with several vendors that generally cover a period of up to one year commitments for estimated base gas volumes are established under these contracts on a monthly basis at contractually negotiated prices commitments for incremental daily purchases are made as necessary during the month in accordance with the terms of individual contracts our midtex division also maintains a limited number of longterm supply contracts to ensure a reliable source of gas for our customers in its service area which obligate it to purchase specified volumes at market and fixed prices at september 30 2016  we were committed to purchase 285  bcf within one year 42  bcf within two to three years and 06  bcf after three years under indexed contracts 

aeh has commitments to purchase physical quantities of natural gas under contracts indexed to the forward nymex strip or fixed price contracts at september 30 2016  aeh was committed to purchase 935  bcf within one year 91  bcf within two to three years and 02  bcf after three years under indexed contracts aeh is committed to purchase 119  bcf within one year and 13  bcf within two to three years under fixed price contracts with prices ranging from 025  to 316  per mcf 

risk management activities 

as discussed above in our critical accounting policies we use financial instruments to mitigate commodity price risk and periodically to manage interest rate risk we conduct risk management activities through our regulated distribution and nonregulated segments in our regulated distribution segment we use a combination of physical storage fixed physical contracts and fixed financial contracts to reduce our exposure to unusually large winterperiod gas price increases in our nonregulated segments we manage our exposure to the risk of natural gas price changes and lock in our gross profit margin through a combination of storage and financial instruments including futures overthecounter and exchangetraded options and swap contracts with counterparties to the extent our inventory cost and actual sales and actual purchases do not correlate 

with the changes in the market indices we use in our hedges we could experience ineffectiveness or the hedges may no longer meet the accounting requirements for hedge accounting resulting in the financial instruments being marked to market through earnings 

we record our financial instruments as a component of risk management assets and liabilities which are classified as current or noncurrent based upon the anticipated settlement date of the underlying financial instrument substantially all of our financial instruments are valued using external market quotes and indices 

the following table shows the components of the change in fair value of our regulated distribution segment’s financial instruments for the fiscal year ended september 30 2016  in thousands 



the fair value of our regulated distribution segment’s financial instruments at september 30 2016  is presented below by time period and fair value source 



the following table shows the components of the change in fair value of our nonregulated segment’s financial instruments for the fiscal year ended september 30 2016  in thousands 



the fair value of our nonregulated segment’s financial instruments at september 30 2016  is presented below by time period and fair value source 

  



employee benefits programs 

an important element of our total compensation program and a significant component of our operation and maintenance expense is the offering of various benefits programs to our employees these programs include medical and dental insurance coverage and pension and postretirement programs 

medical and dental insurance 

we offer medical and dental insurance programs to substantially all of our employeeswe believe these programs are compliant with all current and future provisions that will be going into effect under the patient protection and affordable care act and consistent with other programs in our industry in recent years we have endeavored to actively manage our health care costs through the introduction of a wellness strategy that is focused on helping employees to identify health risks and to manage these risks through improved lifestyle choices 

over the last five fiscal years we have experienced annual medical and prescription inflation of approximately six percent for fiscal 2017  we anticipate the medical and prescription drug inflation rate will continue at approximately six percent primarily due to the inflation of health care costs 

net periodic pension and postretirement benefit costs 

for the fiscal year ended september 30 2016  our total net periodic pension and other benefits costs was 460 million  compared with 589 million  and 698 million  for the fiscal years ended september 30 2015  and 2014  these costs relating to our regulated distribution operations are recoverable through our distribution rates a portion of these costs is capitalized into our distribution rate base and the remaining costs are recorded as a component of operation and maintenance expense 

our fiscal 2016  costs were determined using a september 30 2015  measurement date at that date interest and corporate bond rates utilized to determine our discount rates were higher than the interest and corporate bond rates as of september 30 2014  the measurement date for our fiscal 2015 net periodic cost therefore we increased the discount rate used to measure our fiscal 2016 net periodic cost from 443 percent to 455 percent we lowered expected return on plan assets from 725 percent to 700 percent in the determination of our fiscal 2016 net periodic pension cost based upon expected market returns for our targeted asset allocation as a result of the net impact of these and other assumptions our fiscal 2016 pension and postretirement medical costs were approximately 20 percent lower than in the prior year 

our fiscal 2015 costs were determined using a september 30 2014 measurement date at that date interest and corporate bond rates utilized to determine our discount rates were lower than the interest and corporate bond rates as of september 30 2013 the measurement date for our fiscal 2014 net periodic cost therefore we decreased the discount rate used to measure our fiscal 2015 net periodic cost from 495 percent to 443 percent we maintained our expected return on plan assets at 725 percent in the determination of our fiscal 2015 net periodic pension cost based upon expected market returns for our targeted asset allocation as a result of the net impact of these and other assumptions our fiscal 2015 pension and postretirement medical costs were lower than in the prior year 

pension and postretirement plan funding 

generally our funding policy is to contribute annually an amount that will at least equal the minimum amount required to comply with the employee retirement income security act of 1974 erisa however additional voluntary contributions are made from time to time as considered necessary contributions are intended to provide not only for benefits attributed to service to date but also for those expected to be earned in the future 

in accordance with the pension protection act of 2006 ppa we determined the funded status of our plans as of january 1 2016 based on this valuation we contributed cash of 150 million  380 million  and 271 million  to our pension plans during fiscal 2016  2015  and 2014  each contribution increased the level of our plan assets to achieve a desired ppa funding threshold 

we contributed 166 million  200 million  and 236 million  to our postretirement benefits plans for the fiscal years ended september 30 2016  2015  and 2014  the contributions represent the portion of the postretirement costs we are responsible for under the terms of our plan and minimum funding required by state regulatory commissions 

outlook for fiscal 2017  and beyond 

as of september 30 2016  interest and corporate bond rates were lower than the rates as of september 30 2015 therefore we decreased the discount rate used to measure our fiscal 2017 net periodic cost from 455 percent to 373 percent we maintained the expected return on plan assets of 700 percent in the determination of our fiscal 2017 net periodic pension cost based upon expected market returns for our targeted asset allocation on october 20 2016 the society of actuaries released its annuallyupdated mortality improvement scale for pension plans incorporating new assumptions surrounding life expectancies in the united states as of september 30 2016 we updated our assumed mortality rates to incorporate the 

updated mortality table as a result of the net impact of changes in these and other assumptions we expect our fiscal 2017 net periodic pension cost to be consistent with fiscal 2016 

based upon current market conditions the current funded position of the plans and the funding requirements under the ppa we do not anticipate a minimum required contribution for fiscal 2017  however we may consider whether a voluntary contribution is prudent to maintain certain funding levels with respect to our postretirement medical plans we anticipate contributing between 10 million  and 20 million  during fiscal 2017  

actual changes in the fair market value of plan assets and differences between the actual and expected return on plan assets could have a material effect on the amount of pension costs ultimately recognized a 025 percent change in our discount rate would impact our pension and postretirement costs by approximately 29 million a 025 percent change in our expected rate of return would impact our pension and postretirement costs by approximately 13 million 

the projected liability future funding requirements and the amount of expense or income recognized for each of our pension and other postretirement benefit plans are subject to change depending on the actuarial value of plan assets and the determination of future benefit obligations as of each subsequent calculation date these amounts are impacted by actual investment returns changes in interest rates changes in the demographic composition of the participants in the plans and other actuarial assumptions

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

we are exposed to risks associated with commodity prices and interest rates commodity price risk is the potential loss that we may incur as a result of changes in the fair value of a particular instrument or commodity interestrate risk results from our portfolio of debt and equity instruments that we issue to provide financing and liquidity for our business activities 

we conduct risk management activities through both our regulated distribution and nonregulated segments in our regulated distribution segment we use a combination of physical storage fixed physical contracts and fixed financial contracts to protect us and our customers against unusually large winter period gas price increases in our nonregulated segment we manage our exposure to the risk of natural gas price changes and lock in our gross profit margin through a combination of storage and financial instruments including futures overthecounter and exchangetraded options and swap contracts with counterparties our risk management activities and related accounting treatment are described in further detail in note 13  to the consolidated financial statements additionally our earnings are affected by changes in shortterm interest rates as a result of our issuance of shortterm commercial paper and our other shortterm borrowings 

commodity price risk 

regulated distribution segment 

we purchase natural gas for our regulated distribution operations substantially all of the costs of gas purchased for regulated distribution operations are recovered from our customers through purchased gas cost adjustment mechanisms therefore our regulated distribution operations have limited commodity price risk exposure 

nonregulated segment 

our nonregulated segment is also exposed to risks associated with changes in the market price of natural gas for our nonregulated segment we use a sensitivity analysis to estimate commodity price risk for purposes of this analysis we estimate commodity price risk by applying a 050 change in the forward nymex price to our net open position including existing storage and related financial contracts at the end of each period based on aeh’s net open position including existing storage and related financial contracts at september 30 2016  of 01  bcf a 050 change in the forward nymex price would have had an impact of less than 01 million  on our consolidated net income 

changes in the difference between the indices used to mark to market our physical inventory gas daily and the related fairvalue hedge nymex can result in volatility in our reported net income but over time gains and losses on the sale of storage gas inventory will be offset by gains and losses on the fairvalue hedges based upon our net physical position at september 30 2016  and assuming our hedges would still qualify as highly effective a 050 change in the difference between the gas daily and nymex indices would impact our reported net income by approximately 59 million  

additionally these changes could cause us to recognize a risk management liability which would require us to place cash into an escrow account to collateralize this liability position this in turn would reduce the amount of cash we would have on hand to fund our working capital needs 

interest rate risk 

our earnings are exposed to changes in shortterm interest rates associated with our shortterm commercial paper program and other shortterm borrowings we use a sensitivity analysis to estimate our shortterm interest rate risk for purposes of this analysis we estimate our shortterm interest rate risk as the difference between our actual interest expense for the period and estimated interest expense for the period assuming a hypothetical average one percent increase in the interest rates associated with our shortterm borrowings had interest rates associated with our shortterm borrowings increased by an average of one percent our interest expense would have increased by approximately 64 million during 2016

overview and strategy 

atmos energy corporation headquartered in dallas texas and incorporated in texas and virginia is engaged primarily in the regulated natural gas distribution and pipeline businesses as well as other nonregulated natural gas businesses we deliver natural gas through regulated sales and transportation arrangements to over three million residential commercial public authority and industrial customers in eight states located primarily in the south which makes us one of the country’s largest naturalgasonly distributors based on number of customers we also operate one of the largest intrastate pipelines in texas based on miles of pipe 

our nonregulated businesses provide natural gas management marketing transportation and storage services to municipalities local gas distribution companies including certain of our natural gas distribution divisions and industrial customers principally in the midwest and southeast 

atmos energys vision is to be the safest provider of natural gas services we intend to achieve this vision by 

 we believe the successful execution of this strategy has delivered excellent shareholder value over the last seven years we have achieved growth by implementing rate designs that reduce or eliminate regulatory lag and separate the recovery of our approved margins from customer usage patterns in addition we have developed various commercial opportunities within our regulated transmission and storage operations 

our core values include focusing on our employees and customers while conducting our business with honesty and integrity we continue to strengthen our culture through ongoing communications with our employees and enhanced employee training 

operating segments 

we operate the company through the following three segments 

 

these operating segments are described in greater detail below 

regulated distribution segment overview 

our regulated distribution segment is comprised of our six regulated natural gas distribution divisions this segment represents approximately 65 percent of our consolidated net income the following table summarizes key information about these divisions presented in order of total rate base we operate in our service areas under terms of nonexclusive franchise agreements granted by the various cities and towns that we serve at september 30 2015  we held 1005 franchises having terms generally ranging from five to 35 years a significant number of our franchises expire each year which require renewal prior to the end of their terms historically we have successfully renewed these franchises and believe that we will continue to be able to renew our franchises as they expire 



revenues in this operating segment are established by regulatory authorities in the states in which we operate these rates are intended to be sufficient to cover the costs of conducting business and to provide a reasonable return on invested capital in addition we transport natural gas for others through our distribution system 

rates established by regulatory authorities often include cost adjustment mechanisms for costs that i are subject to significant price fluctuations compared to our other costs ii represent a large component of our cost of service and iii are generally outside our control 

purchased gas cost adjustment mechanisms represent a common form of cost adjustment mechanism purchased gas cost adjustment mechanisms provide natural gas distribution companies a method of recovering purchased gas costs on an ongoing basis without filing a rate case because they provide a dollarfordollar offset to increases or decreases in natural gas distribution gas costs therefore although substantially all of our distribution operating revenues fluctuate with the cost of gas that we purchase distribution gross profit which is defined as operating revenues less purchased gas cost is generally not affected by fluctuations in the cost of gas 

additionally some jurisdictions have performancebased ratemaking adjustments to provide incentives to distribution companies to minimize purchased gas costs through improved storage management and use of financial instruments to lock in gas costs under the performancebased ratemaking adjustment purchased gas costs savings are shared between the utility and its customers 

our supply of natural gas is provided by a variety of suppliers including independent producers marketers and pipeline companies and withdrawals of gas from proprietary and contracted storage assets additionally the natural gas supply for our midtex division includes peaking and spot purchase agreements 

supply arrangements consist of both base load and swing supply peaking quantities and are contracted from our suppliers on a firm basis with various terms at market prices base load quantities are those that flow at a constant level throughout the month and swing supply quantities provide the flexibility to change daily quantities to match increases or decreases in requirements related to weather conditions 

except for local production purchases we select our natural gas suppliers through a competitive bidding process by periodically requesting proposals from suppliers that have demonstrated that they can provide reliable service we select these suppliers based on their ability to deliver gas supply to our designated firm pipeline receipt points at the lowest reasonable cost major suppliers during fiscal 2015  were anadarko energy services company conocophillips company devon gas services lp enbridge marketing us inc hydrocarbon exchange corporation munich re trading ltd targa gas marketing llc 

targa pipeline midcontinent westtex llc tenaska gas storage llc texla energy management inc and atmos energy marketing llc and trans louisiana gas pipeline inc wholly owned subsidiaries in our nonregulated segment 

the combination of base load peaking and spot purchase agreements coupled with the withdrawal of gas held in storage allows us the flexibility to adjust to changes in weather which minimizes our need to enter into longterm firm commitments we estimate our peakday availability of natural gas supply to be approximately 44 bcf the peakday demand for our distribution operations in fiscal 2015  was on january 7 2015 when sales to customers reached approximately 32 bcf 

currently our distribution divisions except for our midtex division utilize 35 pipeline transportation companies both interstate and intrastate to transport our natural gas the pipeline transportation agreements are firm and many of them have “pipeline nonotice” storage service which provides for daily balancing between system requirements and nominated flowing supplies these agreements have been negotiated with the shortest term necessary while still maintaining our right of first refusal the natural gas supply for our midtex division is delivered primarily by our atmos pipeline — texas division 

to maintain our deliveries to high priority customers we have the ability and have exercised our right to curtail deliveries to certain customers under the terms of interruptible contracts or applicable state regulations or statutes our customers’ demand on our system is not necessarily indicative of our ability to meet current or anticipated market demands or immediate delivery requirements because of factors such as the physical limitations of gathering storage and transmission systems the duration and severity of cold weather the availability of gas reserves from our suppliers the ability to purchase additional supplies on a shortterm basis and actions by federal and state regulatory authorities curtailment rights provide us the flexibility to meet the humanneeds requirements of our customers on a firm basis priority allocations imposed by federal and state regulatory agencies as well as other factors beyond our control may affect our ability to meet the demands of our customers we anticipate no problems with obtaining additional gas supply as needed for our customers 

regulated pipeline segment overview 

our regulated pipeline segment consists of the pipeline and storage operations of our atmos pipeline  texas division apt apt is one of the largest intrastate pipeline operations in texas with a heavy concentration in the established natural gasproducing areas of central northern and eastern texas extending into or near the major producing areas of the barnett shale the texas gulf coast and the permian basin of west texas apt’s primary business is providing firm transportation and storage services for our midtex division and other ldc customers apt also provides interruptible transportation storage and ancillary services for third parties including industrial and electric generation customers as well as producers marketers and other shippers the regulated pipeline segment represents approximately 30 percent of our consolidated operations 

gross profit earned from transportation and storage services for our atmos pipeline  texas division is subject to traditional ratemaking governed by the rrc rates are updated through annual filings made under texas’ gas reliability infrastructure program grip and rider rev grip allows us to include in our rates annually approved capital costs incurred in the prior calendar year provided that we file a complete rate case at least once every five years atmos pipelinetexas’ existing regulatory mechanisms allow certain transportation and storage services to be provided under marketbased rates rider rev is an annual adjustment mechanism that adjusts the regulated rates for a portion of the variation in nonregulated annual revenues from a set base level 

nonregulated segment overview 

our nonregulated operations are conducted through atmos energy holdings inc aeh a whollyowned subsidiary of atmos energy corporation and typically represent approximately five percent of our consolidated net income aehs primary business is to buy sell and deliver natural gas at competitive prices to approximately 1000 customers located primarily in the midwest and southeast areas of the united states aeh accomplishes this objective by aggregating and purchasing gas supply arranging transportation and storage logistics and effectively managing commodity price risk aeh also earns storage and transportation demand fees primarily from our regulated distribution operations in louisiana and kentucky these demand fees are subject to regulatory oversight and are renewed periodically 

ratemaking activity 

overview 

the method of determining regulated rates varies among the states in which our regulated businesses operate the regulatory authorities have the responsibility of ensuring that utilities in their jurisdictions operate in the best interests of customers while providing utility companies the opportunity to earn a reasonable return on their investment generally each regulatory authority reviews rate requests and establishes a rate structure intended to generate revenue sufficient to cover the costs of conducting business and to provide a reasonable return on invested capital 

our rate strategy focuses on reducing or eliminating regulatory lag obtaining adequate returns and providing stable predictable margins which benefit both our customers and the company as a result of our ratemaking efforts in recent years atmos energy has 

 the following table provides a jurisdictional rate summary for our regulated operations this information is for regulatory purposes only and may not be representative of our actual financial position 



  



  

 although substantial progress has been made in recent years by improving rate design and recovery of investment across atmos energy’s operating areas we will continue to seek improvements in rate design to address cost variations and pursue tariffs that reduce regulatory lag associated with investments further potential changes in federal energy policy federal safety regulations and adverse economic conditions will necessitate continued vigilance by the company and our regulators in meeting the challenges presented by these external factors 

recent ratemaking activity 

substantially all of our regulated revenues in the fiscal years ended september 30 2015  2014  and 2013  were derived from sales at rates set by or subject to approval by local or state authorities net operating income increases resulting from ratemaking activity totaling 1145 million  933 million  and 981 million  became effective in fiscal 2015  2014  and 2013  as summarized below 



additionally the following ratemaking efforts were initiated during fiscal 2015  but had not been completed as of september 30 2015  



  

 

our recent ratemaking activity is discussed in greater detail below 

annual formula rate mechanisms 

as an instrument to reduce regulatory lag formula rate mechanisms allow us to refresh our rates on an annual periodic basis without filing a formal rate case however these filings still involve discovery by the appropriate regulatory authorities prior to the final determination of rates under these mechanisms we currently have formula rate mechanisms in our louisiana mississippi and tennessee operations and in a portion of our texas divisions the formula rate filing mechanism is referred to as dallas annual rate review darr and rate review mechanisms rrm in our midtex division as the rrm in our west texas division as the stable rate filing srf in the mississippi division the rate stabilization clause rsc in the louisiana division and annual rate mechanism arm in tennessee 

additionally we have specific infrastructure programs in substantially all of our distribution divisions and our atmos pipeline  texas division colorado kansas kentucky mississippi texas and virginia distribution operations have tariffs in place to permit the investment associated with these programs to have their surcharge rate adjusted annually to recover approved capital costs incurred in a prior testyear period these infrastructure programs are referred to as system safety and integrity rider in colorado ssir gas system reliability surcharge gsrs in kansas pipeline replacement program prp in kentucky system integrity rider in mississippi sir gas infrastructure reliability program grip and steps to advance virginia energy save the following table summarizes our annual filing mechanisms with effective dates during the fiscal years ended september 30 2015 2014 and 2013 



 

 rate case filings 

a rate case is a formal request from atmos energy to a regulatory authority to increase rates that are charged to customers rate cases may also be initiated when the regulatory authorities request us to justify our rates this process is referred to as a “show cause” action adequate rates are intended to provide for recovery of the company’s costs as well as a fair rate of return to our shareholders and ensure that we continue to safely deliver reliable reasonably priced natural gas service to our customers the following table summarizes our recent rate cases 



  

other ratemaking activity 

the following table summarizes other ratemaking activity during the fiscal years ended september 30 2015  2014  and 2013  



  

 other regulation 

each of our regulated distribution divisions and our regulated pipeline division is regulated by various state or local public utility authorities we are also subject to regulation by the united states department of transportation with respect to safety requirements in the operation and maintenance of our transmission and distribution facilities in addition our regulated operations are also subject to various state and federal laws regulating environmental matters from time to time we receive inquiries regarding various environmental matters we believe that our properties and operations substantially comply with and are operated in substantial conformity with applicable safety and environmental statutes and regulations there are no administrative or judicial proceedings arising under environmental quality statutes pending or known to be contemplated by governmental agencies which would have a material adverse effect on us or our operations our environmental claims have arisen primarily from former manufactured gas plant sites 

the federal energy regulatory commission ferc allows pursuant to section 311 of the natural gas policy act gas transportation services through our atmos pipeline—texas assets “on behalf of” interstate pipelines or local distribution companies served by interstate pipelines without subjecting these assets to the jurisdiction of the ferc additionally the ferc has regulatory authority over the sale of natural gas in the wholesale gas market and the use and release of interstate pipeline and storage capacity the ferc also has authority to detect and prevent market manipulation and to enforce compliance with ferc’s other rules policies and orders by companies engaged in the sale purchase transportation or storage of natural gas in interstate commerce we have taken what we believe are the necessary and appropriate steps to comply with these regulations 

competition 

although our regulated distribution operations are not currently in significant direct competition with any other distributors of natural gas to residential and commercial customers within our service areas we do compete with other natural gas suppliers and suppliers of alternative fuels for sales to industrial customers we compete in all aspects of our business with alternative energy sources including in particular electricity electric utilities offer electricity as a rival energy source and compete for the space heating water heating and cooking markets promotional incentives improved equipment efficiencies and promotional rates all contribute to the acceptability of electrical equipment the principal means to compete against alternative fuels is lower prices and natural gas historically has maintained its price advantage in the residential commercial and industrial markets 

our regulated pipeline operations historically faced competition from other existing intrastate pipelines seeking to provide or arrange transportation storage and other services for customers in the last few years several new pipelines have been completed which has increased the level of competition in this segment of our business 

within our nonregulated operations aem competes with other natural gas marketers to provide natural gas management and other related services primarily to smaller customers requiring higher levels of balancing scheduling and other related management services aem has experienced increased competition in recent years primarily from investment banks and major integrated oil and natural gas companies who offer lower cost basic services the increased competition has reduced margins most notably on its highvolume accounts 

employees 

at september 30 2015  we had 4753 employees consisting of 4642 employees in our regulated operations and 111 employees in our nonregulated operations

risk factors 

tableend

our financial and operating results are subject to a number of risk factors many of which are not within our control although we have tried to discuss key risk factors below please be aware that other or new risks may prove to be important in the future investors should carefully consider the following discussion of risk factors as well as other information appearing in this report these factors include the following 

the company is dependent on continued access to the credit and capital markets to execute our business strategy 

our longterm debt is currently rated as “investment grade” by standard  poor’s corporation moody’s investors service inc and fitch ratings ltd similar to most companies we rely upon access to both shortterm and longterm credit and capital markets to satisfy our liquidity requirements if adverse credit conditions were to cause a significant limitation on our access to the private and public capital markets we could see a reduction in our liquidity a significant reduction in our liquidity could in turn trigger a negative change in our ratings outlook or even a reduction in our credit ratings by one or more of the three credit rating agencies such a downgrade could further limit our access to private credit andor public capital markets and increase our costs of borrowing 

further if our credit ratings were downgraded we could be required to provide additional liquidity to our nonregulated segment because the commodity financial instrument markets could become unavailable to us our nonregulated segment depends primarily upon an intercompany lending facility between aeh and atmos energy to finance its working capital needs supplemented by two small credit facilities with outside lenders our ability to provide this liquidity to aeh for our nonregulated operations is limited by the terms of the lending arrangement with aeh which is subject to annual approval by one state regulatory commission 

while we believe we can meet our capital requirements from our operations and the sources of financing available to us we can provide no assurance that we will continue to be able to do so in the future especially if the market price of natural gas increases significantly in the near term the future effects on our business liquidity and financial results of a deterioration of current conditions in the credit and capital markets could be material and adverse to us both in the ways described above or in other ways that we do not currently anticipate 

we are subject to state and local regulations that affect our operations and financial results 

our regulated distribution and regulated pipeline segments are subject to regulatory oversight from various state and local regulatory authorities in the eight states that we serve in our regulated distribution and pipeline segments therefore our returns are continuously monitored and are subject to challenge for their reasonableness by the appropriate regulatory authorities or other thirdparty intervenors in the normal course of business as a regulated entity we often need to place assets in service and establish historical test periods before rate cases that seek to adjust our allowed returns to recover that investment can be filed further the regulatory review process can be lengthy in the context of traditional ratemaking because of this process we suffer the negative financial effects of having placed assets in service without the benefit of rate relief which is commonly referred to as “regulatory lag” 

however in the last several years a number of regulatory authorities in the states we serve have approved rate mechanisms that provide for annual adjustments to rates that allow us to recover the cost of investments made to replace existing infrastructure or reflect changes in our cost of service these mechanisms work to effectively reduce the regulatory lag inherent in the ratemaking process however regulatory lag could significantly increase if the regulatory authorities modify or terminate these rate mechanisms the regulatory process also involves the risk that regulatory authorities may i review our purchases of natural gas and adjust the amount of our gas costs that we pass through to our customers or ii limit the costs we may have incurred from our cost of service that can be recovered from customers 

a deterioration in economic conditions could adversely affect our customers and negatively impact our financial results 

any adverse changes in economic conditions in the united states especially in the states in which we operate similar to the economic downturn we experienced for several years beginning in 2008 could adversely affect the financial resources of many domestic households and lead to an increase in mortgage defaults and significant decreases in the values of our customers’ homes and investment assets as a result our customers could seek to use even less gas and make it more difficult for them to pay their gas bills this would likely lead to slower collections and higher than normal levels of accounts receivable this in turn would probably increase our financing requirements and bad debt expense additionally should economic conditions deteriorate our industrial customers could seek alternative energy sources which could result in lower sales volumes 

inflation and increased gas costs could adversely impact our customer base and customer collections and increase our level of indebtedness 

over time inflation has caused increases in some of our operating expenses and has required assets to be replaced at higher costs we have a process in place to continually review the adequacy of our distribution gas rates in relation to the increasing cost of providing service and the inherent regulatory lag in adjusting those gas rates historically we have been able to budget and control operating expenses and investments within the amounts authorized to be collected in rates and intend to continue to do so however the ability to control expenses is an important factor that could impact future financial results 

in addition rapid increases in the costs of purchased gas would cause us to experience a significant increase in shortterm debt we must pay suppliers for gas when it is purchased which can be significantly in advance of when these costs may be recovered through the collection of monthly customer bills for gas delivered increases in purchased gas costs also slow our natural gas distribution collection efforts as customers are more likely to delay the payment of their gas bills leading to higher than normal accounts receivable this could result in higher shortterm debt levels greater collection efforts and increased bad debt expense 

we are exposed to market risks that are beyond our control which could adversely affect our financial results and capital requirements 

we are subject to market risks beyond our control including i commodity price volatility caused by market supply and demand dynamics counterparty performance or counterparty creditworthiness and ii interest rate risk 

our regulated operations are generally insulated from commodity price risk through its purchased gas cost mechanisms although our nonregulated operations represent only about five percent of our consolidated results commodity price volatility experienced in this business segment could lead to some minor volatility in our earnings our nonregulated segment manages margins and limits risk exposure on the sale of natural gas inventory or the offsetting fixedprice purchase or sale commitments for physical quantities of natural gas through the use of a variety of financial instruments however contractual limitations could adversely affect our ability to withdraw gas from storage which could cause us to purchase gas at spot prices in a rising market to obtain sufficient volumes to fulfill customer contracts we could also realize financial losses on our efforts to limit risk as a result of volatility in the market prices of the underlying commodities or if a counterparty fails to perform under a contract 

with respect to interest rate risk we have been operating in a relatively low interestrate environment in recent years compared to historical norms for both short and longterm interest rates however increases in interest rates could adversely affect our future financial results 

the concentration of our distribution pipeline and storage operations in the state of texas exposes our operations and financial results to economic conditions weather patterns and regulatory decisions in texas 

over 50 percent of our regulated distribution customers and most of our regulated pipeline assets and operations are located in the state of texas this concentration of our business in texas means that our operations and financial results may be significantly affected by changes in the texas economy in general weather patterns and regulatory decisions by state and local regulatory authorities in texas 

our operations are subject to increased competition  

in residential and commercial customer markets our regulated distribution operations compete with other energy products such as electricity and propane our primary product competition is with electricity for heating water heating and cooking increases in the price of natural gas could negatively impact our competitive position by decreasing the price benefits of natural gas to the consumer this could adversely impact our business if as a result our customer growth slows reducing our ability to make capital expenditures or if our customers further conserve their use of gas resulting in reduced gas purchases and customer billings 

in the case of industrial customers such as manufacturing plants adverse economic conditions including higher gas costs could cause these customers to use alternative sources of energy such as electricity or bypass our systems in favor of special competitive contracts with lower perunit costs our regulated pipeline operations historically have faced limited competition 

from other existing intrastate pipelines and gas marketers seeking to provide or arrange transportation storage and other services for customers however in the last few years several new pipelines have been completed which has increased the level of competition in this segment of our business 

finally within our nonregulated operations aem competes with other natural gas marketers to provide natural gas management and other related services primarily to smaller customers requiring higher levels of balancing scheduling and other related management services aem has experienced increased competition in recent years from competitors who offer lower cost basic services 

adverse weather conditions could affect our operations or financial results 

we have weathernormalized rates for over 95 percent of our residential and commercial meters in our regulated distribution business which substantially mitigates the adverse effects of warmerthannormal weather for meters in those service areas however there is no assurance that we will continue to receive such regulatory protection from adverse weather in our rates in the future the loss of such weathernormalized rates could have an adverse effect on our operations and financial results in addition our regulated distribution and regulated pipeline operating results may continue to vary somewhat with the actual temperatures during the winter heating season sustained cold weather could adversely affect our nonregulated operations as we may be required to purchase gas at spot rates in a rising market to obtain sufficient volumes to fulfill some customer contracts additionally sustained cold weather could challenge our ability to adequately meet customer demand in our natural gas distribution and pipeline and storage operations 

our growth in the future may be limited by the nature of our business which requires extensive capital spending 

the regulated natural gas distribution and pipeline business is capitalintensive we must make significant capital expenditures to renew or replace our facilities on a longterm basis to improve the safety and reliability of our facilities and to comply with the safety rules and regulations issued by the regulatory authorities responsible for the service areas we operate in addition we must continually build new capacity in our regulated distribution and regulated pipeline operations to serve the growing needs of the communities we serve the magnitude of these expenditures may be affected by a number of factors including new regulations the general state of the economy and weather 

  the liquidity required to fund our capital expenditures and other cash needs is provided from a variety of sources including our cash flows from operations borrowings under our shortterm lending facilities and from time to time funds raised from the public debt and equity capital markets the cost and availability of borrowing funds from third party lenders or issuing equity is dependent on the liquidity of the credit markets interest rates and other market conditions this in turn may limit the amount of funds we can invest in our infrastructure 

the costs of providing health care benefits pension and postretirement health care benefits and related funding requirements may increase substantially 

we provide health care benefits a cashbalance pension plan and postretirement health care benefits to eligible fulltime employees the costs of providing health care benefits to our employees could significantly increase over time due to rapidly increasing health care inflation the impact of the health care reform act of 2010 hcr and any future legislative changes related to the provision of health care benefits the impact of additional costs incurred by the health insurance industry arising from the implementation of hcr which are likely to be passed on to the company are difficult to measure at this time 

the costs of providing a cashbalance pension plan and postretirement health care benefits to eligible fulltime employees and related funding requirements could be influenced by changes in the market value of the assets funding our pension and postretirement health care plans any significant declines in the value of these investments due to sustained declines in equity markets or a reduction in bond yields could increase the costs of our pension and postretirement health care plans and related funding requirements in the future further our costs of providing such benefits and related funding requirements are also subject to a number of factors including i changing demographics including longer life expectancy of beneficiaries and an expected increase in the number of eligible former employees over the next five to ten years ii various actuarial calculations and assumptions which may differ materially from actual results due primarily to changing market and economic conditions including changes in interest rates and higher or lower withdrawal rates and iii future government regulation 

the costs to the company of providing these benefits and related funding requirements could also increase materially in the future should there be a material reduction in the amount of the recovery of these costs through our rates or should significant delays develop in the timing of the recovery of such costs which could adversely affect our financial results 

the inability to continue to hire train and retain operational technical and managerial personnel could adversely affect our results of operations 

the average age of the employee base of atmos energy has been increasing for a number of years with a number of employees becoming eligible to retire within the next five to 10 years if we were unable to hire appropriate personnel to fill future needs the company could encounter operating challenges and increased costs primarily due to a loss of knowledge 

errors due to inexperience or the lengthy time period typically required to adequately train replacement personnel in addition higher costs could result from the increased use of contractors to replace retiring employees loss of productivity or increased safety compliance issues the inability to hire train and retain new operational technical and managerial personnel adequately and to transfer institutional knowledge and expertise could adversely affect our ability to manage and operate our business if we were unable to hire train and retain appropriately qualified personnel our results of operations could be adversely affected 

we may experience increased federal state and local regulation of the safety of our operations 

we are committed to constantly monitoring and maintaining our pipeline and distribution system to ensure that natural gas is delivered safely reliably and efficiently through our network of more than 72000 miles of pipeline and distribution lines the pipeline replacement programs currently underway in several of our divisions typify the preventive maintenance and continual renewal that we perform on our natural gas distribution system in the eight states in which we currently operate the safety and protection of the public our customers and our employees is our top priority however due primarily to the unfortunate pipeline incident in california in 2010 natural gas distribution and pipeline companies have continued to face increasing federal state and local oversight of the safety of their operations although we believe these costs should be ultimately recoverable through our rates the costs of complying with such increased laws and regulations may have at least a shortterm adverse impact on our operating costs and financial results 

some of our operations are subject to increased federal regulatory oversight that could affect our operations and financial results 

ferc has regulatory authority over some of our operations including sales of natural gas in the wholesale gas market and the use and release of interstate pipeline and storage capacity ferc has adopted rules designed to prevent market power abuse and market manipulation and to promote compliance with ferc’s other rules policies and orders by companies engaged in the sale purchase transportation or storage of natural gas in interstate commerce these rules carry increased penalties for violations although we have taken steps to structure current and future transactions to comply with applicable current ferc regulations changes in ferc regulations or their interpretation by ferc or additional regulations issued by ferc in the future could also adversely affect our business financial condition or financial results 

we are subject to environmental regulations which could adversely affect our operations or financial results 

we are subject to laws regulations and other legal requirements enacted or adopted by federal state and local governmental authorities relating to protection of the environment and health and safety matters including those that govern discharges of substances into the air and water the management and disposal of hazardous substances and waste the cleanup of contaminated sites groundwater quality and availability plant and wildlife protection as well as work practices related to employee health and safety environmental legislation also requires that our facilities sites and other properties associated with our operations be operated maintained abandoned and reclaimed to the satisfaction of applicable regulatory authorities failure to comply with these laws regulations permits and licenses may expose us to fines penalties or interruptions in our operations that could be significant to our financial results in addition existing environmental regulations may be revised or our operations may become subject to new regulations 

the operations and financial results of the company could be adversely impacted as a result of climate changes or related additional legislation or regulation in the future 

to the extent climate changes occur our businesses could be adversely impacted although we believe it is likely that any such resulting impacts would occur very gradually over a long period of time and thus would be difficult to quantify with any degree of specificity to the extent climate changes would result in warmer temperatures in our service territories financial results from our regulated distribution segment could be adversely affected through lower gas volumes and revenues with our regulated pipeline segment also likely experiencing lower volumes and revenues as well such climate changes could also cause shifts in population including customers moving away from our service territories near the gulf coast in louisiana and mississippi another possible climate change would be more frequent and more severe weather events such as hurricanes and tornados which could increase our costs to repair damaged facilities and restore service to our customers if we were unable to deliver natural gas to our customers our financial results would be impacted by lost revenues and we generally would have to seek approval from regulators to recover restoration costs to the extent we would be unable to recover those costs or if higher rates resulting from our recovery of such costs would result in reduced demand for our services our future business financial condition or financial results could be adversely impacted in addition there have been a number of federal and state legislative and regulatory initiatives proposed in recent years in an attempt to control or limit the effects of global warming and overall climate change including greenhouse gas emissions such as carbon dioxide the adoption of this type of legislation by congress or similar legislation by states or the adoption of related regulations by federal or state governments mandating a substantial reduction in greenhouse gas emissions in the future could have farreaching and significant impacts on the energy industry such new legislation or regulations could result in increased compliance costs for us or additional operating restrictions on our business affect the demand for natural gas or impact the prices we charge to our customers at this time we 

cannot predict the potential impact of such laws or regulations that may be adopted on our future business financial condition or financial results 

distributing transporting and storing natural gas involve risks that may result in accidents and additional operating costs 

our regulated distribution and regulated pipeline businesses involve a number of hazards and operating risks that cannot be completely avoided such as leaks accidents and operational problems which could cause loss of human life as well as substantial financial losses resulting from property damage damage to the environment and to our operations we maintain liability and property insurance coverage in place for many of these hazards and risks however because some of our pipeline storage and distribution facilities are near or are in populated areas any loss of human life or adverse financial results resulting from such events could be large if these events were not fully covered by our general liability and property insurance which policies are subject to certain limits and deductibles our operations or financial results could be adversely affected 

cyberattacks or acts of cyberterrorism could disrupt our business operations and information technology systems or result in the loss or exposure of confidential or sensitive customer employee or company information 

our business operations and information technology systems may be vulnerable to an attack by individuals or organizations intending to disrupt our business operations and information technology systems even though the company has implemented policies procedures and controls to prevent and detect these activities we use our information technology systems to manage our distribution and intrastate pipeline operations and other business processes disruption of those systems could adversely impact our ability to safely deliver natural gas to our customers operate our pipeline systems or serve our customers timely accordingly if such an attack or act of terrorism were to occur our operations and financial results could be adversely affected 

in addition we use our information technology systems to protect confidential or sensitive customer employee and company information developed and maintained in the normal course of our business any attack on such systems that would result in the unauthorized release of customer employee or other confidential or sensitive data could have a material adverse effect on our business reputation increase our costs and expose us to additional material legal claims and liability even though we have insurance coverage in place for many of these cyberrelated risks if such an attack or act of terrorism were to occur our operations and financial results could be adversely affected to the extent not fully covered by such insurance coverage 

natural disasters terrorist activities or other significant events could adversely affect our operations or financial results 

natural disasters are always a threat to our assets and operations in addition the threat of terrorist activities could lead to increased economic instability and volatility in the price of natural gas that could affect our operations also companies in our industry may face a heightened risk of exposure to actual acts of terrorism which could subject our operations to increased risks as a result the availability of insurance covering such risks may become more limited which could increase the risk that an event could adversely affect our operations or financial results

results of operations 

overview 

atmos energy corporation strives to operate its businesses safely and reliably while delivering superior shareholder value in recent years we have implemented rate designs that reduce or eliminate regulatory lag and separate the recovery of our approved rate from customer usage patterns in addition recent pipeline safety rulemaking has impacted the level of operating and maintenance expense and capital spending in our regulated business which we expect to continue accordingly we have significantly increased investments in the safety and reliability of our natural gas distribution and transmission infrastructure this increased level of investment and timely recovery of these investments through our various regulatory mechanisms has resulted in increased earnings and operating cash flow in recent years 

this trend continued during fiscal 2015 net income increased 9 percent to 3151 million  or 309  per diluted share the yearoveryear increase largely reflects positive rate outcomes which more than offset weather that was 10 percent warmer than the prior year particularly in our nonregulated segment additionally operating cash flow increased 965 million  to 8365 million  for the fiscal year ended september 30 2015 

capital expenditures for fiscal 2015 totaled 9751 million  approximately 80 percent was invested to improve the safety and reliability of our distribution and transportation systems with a significant portion of this investment incurred under regulatory mechanisms that reduce lag to six months or less fiscal 2014 spending under these and other mechanisms enabled the company to complete 17 regulatory filings during fiscal 2015 that should increase annual operating income from regulated operations by 1145 million  we plan to continue to fund our growth through the use of operating cash flows and debt and equity securities to maintain a balanced capital structure 

on july 1 2015 fitch ratings fitch upgraded our senior unsecured debt rating to a from a with a ratings outlook of stable fitch cited its expectation of continued strong financial performance driven primarily by organic growth in our regulated distribution and regulated pipeline segments 

on october 29 2015 sp affirmed our senior unsecured debt rating as a and issued a revised outlook from stable to positive citing the potential for an upgraded rating in the future if we maintain our current level of financial performance as capital spending levels remain elevated 

as a result of the continued contribution and stability of our regulated earnings cash flows and capital structure our board of directors increased the quarterly dividend by 77 percent for fiscal 2016 

consolidated results 

the following table presents our consolidated financial highlights for the fiscal years ended september 30 2015  2014  and 2013  

  

regulated operations contributed 95 percent  89 percent  and 95 percent  to our consolidated net income from continuing operations for fiscal years 2015  2014  and 2013  our consolidated net income during the last three fiscal years was earned across our business segments as follows 



the following table segregates our consolidated net income and diluted earnings per share between our regulated and nonregulated operations 



we reported net income of 3151 million  or 309  per diluted share for the year ended september 30 2015  compared with net income of 2898 million or 296 per diluted share in the prior year unrealized losses in our nonregulated operations during the current year decreased net income by 15 million or 001 per diluted share compared with net gains recorded in the prior year of 58 million or 006 per diluted share 

we reported net income of 2898 million or 296 per diluted share for the year ended september 30 2014  compared with net income of 2432 million or 264 per diluted share in fiscal 2013 income from continuing operations in fiscal 2013 was 2307 million or 250 per diluted share income from discontinued operations was 125 million or 014 per diluted share for the year ended september 30 2013 which includes the gain on sale of substantially all our assets in georgia of 53 million unrealized gains in our nonregulated operations during fiscal 2014 increased net income by 58 million or 006 per diluted share compared with net gains recorded in fiscal 2013 of 53 million or 005 per diluted share 

see the following discussion regarding the results of operations for each of our business operating segments 

regulated distribution segment 

the primary factors that impact the results of our regulated distribution operations are our ability to earn our authorized rates of return the cost of natural gas competitive factors in the energy industry and economic conditions in our service areas 

our ability to earn our authorized rates is based primarily on our ability to improve the rate design in our various ratemaking jurisdictions by reducing or eliminating regulatory lag and ultimately separating the recovery of our approved margins from customer usage patterns improving rate design is a longterm process and is further complicated by the fact that we operate in multiple rate jurisdictions the “ratemaking activity” section of this form 10k describes our current rate strategy progress towards implementing that strategy and recent ratemaking initiatives in more detail 

we are generally able to pass the cost of gas through to our customers without markup under purchased gas cost adjustment mechanisms therefore the cost of gas typically does not have an impact on our gross profit as increases in the cost of gas are offset by a corresponding increase in revenues accordingly we believe gross profit is a better indicator of our financial performance than revenues however gross profit in our texas and mississippi service areas include franchise fees and gross receipt taxes which are calculated as a percentage of revenue inclusive of gas costs therefore the amount of these taxes included in revenue is influenced by the cost of gas and the level of gas sales volumes we record the tax expense as a component of taxes other than income although changes in revenue related taxes arising from changes in gas costs affect gross profit over time the impact is offset within operating income 

although the cost of gas typically does not have a direct impact on our gross profit higher gas costs may adversely impact our accounts receivable collections resulting in higher bad debt expense and may require us to increase borrowings under our credit facilities resulting in higher interest expense in addition higher gas costs as well as competitive factors in the industry and general economic conditions may cause customers to conserve or in the case of industrial consumers to use alternative energy sources currently gas cost risk has been mitigated by rate design that allows us to collect from our customers the gas cost portion of our bad debt expense on approximately 76 percent of our residential and commercial margins 

during fiscal 2015  we completed 16 regulatory proceedings in our regulated distribution segment which should result in a 773 million increase in annual operating income 

in april 2013 we completed the sale of our georgia regulated distribution operations representing approximately 64000 customers 

review of financial and operating results 

financial and operational highlights for our regulated distribution segment for the fiscal years ended september 30 2015  2014  and 2013  are presented below 



fiscal year ended september 30 2015  compared with fiscal year ended september 30 2014   

income from continuing operations for our regulated distribution segment increased 19 percent primarily due to a 611 million  increase in gross profit partially offset by a 255 million  increase in operating expenses the yeartodate increase in gross profit primarily reflects 

 the increase in operating expenses which include operation and maintenance expense bad debt expense depreciation and amortization expense and taxes other than income was primarily due to increased depreciation expense associated with increased capital investments and increased ad valorem and franchise taxes 

interest charges decreased by 108 million  primarily due to replacing our 500 million unsecured 495 senior notes with 500 million of 4125 30year unsecured senior notes on october 15 2014 and higher interest expense deferrals under our infrastructure mechanisms 

fiscal year ended september 30 2014  compared with fiscal year ended september 30 2013   

income from continuing operations for our regulated distribution segment increased 14 percent primarily due to a 953 million increase in gross profit partially offset by a 538 million increase in operating expenses the yeartodate increase in gross profit primarily reflects 

 the 538 million increase in operating expenses which include operation and maintenance expense bad debt expense depreciation and amortization expense and taxes other than income was primarily due to the following 

 the 212 million increase in income tax expense was primarily due to increased income from continuing operations before income taxes as well as an increase of approximately 70 million in our deferred tax asset valuation allowance due to the uncertainty in the companys ability to utilize certain charitable contribution carryforwards before they expire 

the following table shows our operating income from continuing operations by regulated distribution division in order of total rate base for the fiscal years ended september 30 2015  2014  and 2013  the presentation of our regulated distribution operating income is included for financial reporting purposes and may not be appropriate for ratemaking purposes

our regulated pipeline segment consists of the pipeline and storage operations of the atmos pipeline  texas division apt apt is one of the largest intrastate pipeline operations in texas with a heavy concentration in the established natural gasproducing areas of central northern and eastern texas extending into or near the major producing areas of the barnett shale the texas gulf coast and the permian basin of west texas apt’s primary business is providing firm transportation and storage services for our midtex division and other ldc customers apt also provides interruptible transportation storage and ancillary services for third parties including industrial and electric generation customers as well as producers marketers and other shippers 

our regulated pipeline segment is impacted by seasonal weather patterns competitive factors in the energy industry and economic conditions in apts service area natural gas prices do not directly impact the results of this segment as revenues are derived from the transportation of natural gas however natural gas prices and demand for natural gas could influence the level of drilling activity in the markets that we serve which may influence the level of throughput we may be able to transport on our pipeline further natural gas price differences between the various hubs that we serve impact the market value for transportation services between those geographic areas 

the results of the atmos pipeline  texas division are also significantly impacted by the natural gas requirements of the midtex division because it is the primary transporter of natural gas for our midtex division 

finally as a regulated pipeline the operations of the atmos pipeline  texas division may be impacted by the timing of when costs and expenses are incurred and when these costs and expenses are recovered through its tariffs 

review of financial and operating results 

financial and operational highlights for our regulated pipeline segment for the fiscal years ended september 30 2015  2014  and 2013  are presented below 



fiscal year ended september 30 2015  compared with fiscal year ended september 30 2014 

net income for our regulated pipeline segment increased 10 percent primarily due to a 517 million  increase in gross profit partially offset by a 432 million  increase in operating expenses the increase in gross profit primarily reflects a 470 million increase in rates from the approved 2014 and 2015 gas reliability infrastructure program grip filings additionally gross profit reflects increased pipeline demand fees and throughsystem transportation volumes and rates that were offset by lower storage and other fees and the absence of a 18 million increase recorded in the prioryear associated with an annual adjustment mechanism 

operating expenses increased 432 million  primarily due to increased levels of pipeline and rightofway maintenance activities to improve the safety and reliability of our system and increased depreciation expense associated with increased capital investments along with the absence of a 67 million refund received in the prior year as a result of the completion of a state use tax audit 

fiscal year ended september 30 2014  compared with fiscal year ended september 30 2013 

net income for our regulated pipeline segment increased 26 percent in fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013 primarily due to a 496 million increase in gross profit the increase in gross profit primarily reflects a 385 million increase in rates from the grip filings approved by the railroad commission of texas rrc in fiscal 2014 and 2013 coupled with a 47 million increase associated with higher transportation volumes and basis spreads driven by colder weather 

the atmos pipeline — texas rate case approved by the rrc on april 18 2011 contained an annual adjustment mechanism approved for a threeyear pilot program that adjusted regulated rates up or down by 75 percent of the difference between the nonregulated annual revenue of atmos pipeline — texas and a predefined base credit the annual adjustment 

mechanism expired on june 30 2013 on january 1 2014 the rrc approved the extension of the annual adjustment mechanism retroactive to july 1 2013 which will stay in place until the completion of the next atmos pipeline — texas rate case as a result of this decision during fiscal 2014 we recognized a 18 million increase in gross profit for the application of the annual adjustment mechanism for the period july 1 2013 to september 30 2013 

operating expenses increased 166 million primarily due to the following 

• a 101 million increase in pipeline and rightofway maintenance activities 

• a 57 million increase in depreciation expense associated with increased capital investments 

• a 24 million increase due to higher employeerelated expenses partially offset by 

• a 67 million refund received as a result of the completion of a state use tax audit 

nonregulated segment 

our nonregulated operations are conducted through atmos energy holdings inc aeh a whollyowned subsidiary of atmos energy corporation and typically represents approximately five percent of our consolidated net income 

aehs primary business is to buy sell and deliver natural gas at competitive prices to approximately 1000 customers located primarily in the midwest and southeast areas of the united states aeh accomplishes this objective by aggregating and purchasing gas supply arranging transportation and storage logistics and effectively managing commodity price risk 

aeh also earns storage and transportation demand fees primarily from our regulated distribution operations in louisiana and kentucky these demand fees are subject to regulatory oversight and are renewed periodically 

our nonregulated activities are significantly influenced by competitive factors in the industry and general economic conditions therefore the margins earned from these activities are dependent upon our ability to attract and retain customers and to minimize the cost of buying selling and delivering natural gas to offer more competitive pricing to those customers 

further natural gas market conditions most notably the price of natural gas and the level of price volatility affect our nonregulated businesses natural gas prices and the level of volatility are influenced by a number of factors including but not limited to general economic conditions the demand for natural gas in different parts of the country the level of domestic natural gas production and the level of natural gas inventory levels 

natural gas prices can influence 

 natural gas price volatility can also influence our nonregulated business in the following ways 

 our nonregulated segment manages its exposure to natural gas commodity price risk through a combination of physical storage and financial instruments therefore results for this segment include unrealized gains or losses on its net physical gas position and the related financial instruments used to manage commodity price risk these margins fluctuate based upon changes in the spreads between the physical and forward natural gas prices the magnitude of the unrealized gains and losses is also contingent upon the levels of our net physical position at the end of the reporting period 

review of financial and operating results 

financial and operational highlights for our nonregulated segment for the fiscal years ended september 30 2015  2014  and 2013  are presented below 



  fiscal year ended september 30 2015  compared with fiscal year ended september 30 2014 

net income for our nonregulated segment decreased 51 percent from the prior year due to lower gross profit and higher operating expenses 

the 151 million  periodoverperiod decrease in gross profit was primarily due to a 120 million  decrease in unrealized margins combined with a 31 million  decrease in realized margins the decrease in realized margins reflects 

 operating expenses increased 89 million  primarily due to higher legal expenses as a result of the favorable settlement in the prior year of the kentucky litigation and the resolution of the tennessee business license tax matter 

fiscal year ended september 30 2014  compared with fiscal year ended september 30 2013 

net income for our nonregulated segment increased 185 percent in fiscal year 2014 compared to the year ended september 30 2013 due to higher gross profit and decreased operating expenses 

the periodoverperiod increase in gross profit was primarily due to a 240 million increase in realized margins the increase in realized margins reflects 

 operating expenses decreased 104 million primarily due to lower legal expenses related to the dismissal of the kentucky litigation and the favorable resolution of the tennessee business license tax matter in fiscal 2014 

liquidity and capital resources 

the liquidity required to fund our working capital capital expenditures and other cash needs is provided from a variety of sources including internally generated funds and borrowings under our commercial paper program and bank credit facilities additionally we have various uncommitted trade credit lines with our gas suppliers that we utilize to purchase natural gas on a monthly basis finally from time to time we raise funds from the public debt and equity capital markets to fund our liquidity needs 

we regularly evaluate our funding strategy and capital structure to ensure that we i have sufficient liquidity for our shortterm and longterm needs in a costeffective manner and ii maintain a balanced capital structure with a debttocapitalization ratio in a target range of 45 to 55 percent we also evaluate the levels of committed borrowing capacity that we require we currently have over 1 billion of capacity from our shortterm facilities 

the following table presents our capitalization as of september 30 2015  and 2014  



total debt as a percentage of total capitalization including shortterm debt was 477 percent  and 462 percent  at september 30 2015  and 2014  

as we continue to invest in the safety and reliability of our distribution and transportation system we expect our capital spending will increase in future periods we intend to fund this level of investment through available operating cash flows the issuance of longterm debt securities and equity we believe the liquidity provided by these sources combined with our committed credit facilities will be sufficient to fund our working capital needs and capital expenditure program for fiscal year 2016 and beyond 

on september 25 2015 we terminated our existing 125 billion credit facility and entered into a new five year 125 billion credit facility with substantially the same terms the new facility also retains the 250 million accordion feature which allows for an increase in the total committed loan amount to 15 billion 

 additionally we plan to issue new unsecured senior notes to replace 250 million and 450 million of unsecured senior notes that will mature in fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2019 during fiscal 2014 and 2015 we entered into forward starting interest rate swaps to fix the treasury yield component associated with the anticipated fiscal 2019 issuances at 3782 in fiscal 2012 we entered into forward starting interest rate swaps to fix the treasury yield component associated with the anticipated fiscal 2017 issuances at 3367 

cash flows 

our internally generated funds may change in the future due to a number of factors some of which we cannot control these factors include regulatory changes the price for our services the demand for such products and services margin requirements resulting from significant changes in commodity prices operational risks and other factors 

cash flows from operating investing and financing activities for the years ended september 30 2015  2014  and 2013  are presented below 



cash flows from operating activities 

yearoveryear changes in our operating cash flows primarily are attributable to changes in net income working capital changes particularly within our regulated distribution segment resulting from changes in the price of natural gas and the timing of customer collections payments for natural gas purchases and deferred gas cost recoveries 

fiscal year ended september 30 2015  compared with fiscal year ended september 30 2014   

for the fiscal year ended september 30 2015  we generated operating cash flow of 8365 million  from operating activities compared with 7400 million  in the prior year the yearoveryear increase  primarily reflects successful rate case outcomes in the prior year the timing of gas cost recoveries under our purchased gas cost mechanisms and lower gas prices during the currentyear storage injection season 

fiscal year ended september 30 2014  compared with fiscal year ended september 30 2013   

for the fiscal year ended september 30 2014  we generated operating cash flow of 7400 million  from operating activities compared with 6131 million  in fiscal 2013  the yearoveryear increase reflects higher operating results from colder weather and rate increases combined with the timing of customer collections and vendor payments 

cash flows from investing activities 

in recent years a substantial portion of our cash resources has been used to fund our ongoing construction program which enables us to enhance the safety and reliability of the systems used to provide regulated distribution services to our existing customer base expand our natural gas distribution services into new markets enhance the integrity of our pipelines and more recently expand our intrastate pipeline network over the last three fiscal years approximately 80 percent of our capital spending has been committed to improving the safety and reliability of our system 

in executing our regulatory strategy we target our capital spending on regulatory mechanisms that permit us to earn an adequate return timely on our investment without compromising the safety or reliability of our system substantially all of our regulated jurisdictions have rate tariffs that provide the opportunity to include in their rate base approved capital costs on a periodic basis without being required to file a rate case 

 for the fiscal year ended september 30 2015  we incurred 9751 million  for capital expenditures compared with 8353 million  for the fiscal year ended september 30 2014  and 8450 million  for the fiscal year ended september 30 2013  

fiscal year ended september 30 2015  compared with fiscal year ended september 30 2014   

the 1398 million increase  in capital expenditures in fiscal 2015  compared to fiscal 2014  primarily reflects 

 

fiscal year ended september 30 2014  compared with fiscal year ended september 30 2013 

the 97 million decrease in capital expenditures in fiscal 2014  compared to fiscal 2013  primarily reflects 

 cash flows from financing activities 

we generated a net 1246 million  736 million  and 857 million  in cash from financing activities for fiscal years 2015 2014 and 2013 our significant financing activities for the fiscal years ended september 30 2015  2014  and 2013  are summarized as follows 

2015   

during the fiscal year ended september 30 2015  our financing activities generated 1246 million  of cash compared with 736 million  of cash generated in the prior year the increase is primarily due to timing between shortterm debt borrowings and repayments during the current year proceeds from the issuance of 500 million unsecured 4125 senior notes in october 2014 and the settlement of the associated forward starting interest rate swaps partially offsetting these increases were the repayment of 500 million 495 senior unsecured notes at maturity on october 15 2014 compared with shortterm debt borrowings and repayments in the prior year and proceeds generated from the equity offering completed in february 2014 

2014   

during the fiscal year ended september 30 2014  our financing activities generated 736 million  of cash compared with 857 million  of cash generated in the prior year the decrease is primarily due to timing between shortterm debt borrowings and repayments during fiscal 2014 partially offset by proceeds from the equity offering completed in february 2014 compared with proceeds generated from the issuance of longterm debt in fiscal 2013 

2013   

during the fiscal year ended september 30 2013 our financing activities generated 857 million  of cash compared with 448 million of cash used in fiscal 2012 fiscal year 2013 cash flows from financing activities were significantly influenced by the issuance of 500 million 415 30year unsecured senior notes on january 11 2013 we used a portion of the net cash proceeds of 4938 million to repay a 260 million shortterm financing facility executed in fiscal 2012 to settle for 666 million three treasury locks associated with the issuance and to reduce shortterm debt borrowings by 1672 million 

the following table shows the number of shares issued for the fiscal years ended september 30 2015  2014  and 2013  

  



the decrease  in the number of shares issued in fiscal 2015  compared with the number of shares issued in fiscal 2014   primarily reflects the equity offering completed in february 2014 partially offset by the fact that we have begun issuing shares for use by the direct stock purchase plan and the retirement savings plan and trust rather than using shares purchased in the open market at september 30 2015  of the 87 million shares authorized for issuance from the ltip 308582  shares remained available for the year ended september 30 2015  we canceled and retired 148464 shares attributable to federal income tax withholdings on equity awards which are not included in the table above 

the increased number of shares issued in fiscal 2014 compared with the number of shares issued in fiscal 2013 primarily reflects the equity offering completed in february 2014 as well as a higher number of performancebased awards issued in the 

current year as actual performance exceeded the target at september 30 2014 of the 87 million shares authorized for issuance from the ltip 845139 shares remained available for the year ended september 30 2014 we canceled and retired 190134 shares attributable to federal income tax withholdings on equity awards which are not included in the table above 

credit facilities 

our shortterm borrowing requirements are affected by the seasonal nature of the natural gas business changes in the price of natural gas and the amount of natural gas we need to supply to meet our customers’ needs could significantly affect our borrowing requirements 

we finance our shortterm borrowing requirements through a combination of a 125 billion commercial paper program which is collateralized by our 125 billion unsecured credit facility as well as three additional committed revolving credit facilities and one uncommitted revolving credit facility with thirdparty lenders that provide approximately 13 billion of working capital funding the 125 billion unsecured credit facility has a 250 million accordion feature which allows for an increase in the total committed loan amount to 15 billion we also use intercompany credit facilities to supplement the funding provided by these thirdparty committed credit facilities 

shelf registration 

we have an effective shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission that permits us to issue a total of 175 billion in common stock andor debt securities the shelf registration statement is effective until march 28 2016 as of september 30 2015 845 million was available for issuance 

credit ratings 

our credit ratings directly affect our ability to obtain shortterm and longterm financing in addition to the cost of such financing in determining our credit ratings the rating agencies consider a number of quantitative factors including debt to total capitalization operating cash flow relative to outstanding debt operating cash flow coverage of interest and pension liabilities and funding status in addition the rating agencies consider qualitative factors such as consistency of our earnings over time the quality of our management and business strategy the risks associated with our regulated and nonregulated businesses and the regulatory environment in the states where we operate 

our debt is rated by three rating agencies standard  poor’s corporation sp moody’s investors service moody’s and fitch ratings ltd fitch our current debt ratings are all considered investment grade and are as follows 



on july 1 2015 fitch upgraded our senior unsecured debt rating to a from a with a ratings outlook of stable citing fitchs expectation of continued strong financial performance which has been driven primarily by organic growth in our regulated distribution and regulated pipeline segments 

on october 29 2015 sp affirmed our senior unsecured debt rating as a and issued a revised outlook from stable to positive citing the potential for an upgraded rating in the future if we maintain our current level of financial performance as capital spending levels remain elevated 

 a significant degradation in our operating performance or a significant reduction in our liquidity caused by more limited access to the private and public credit markets as a result of deteriorating global or national financial and credit conditions could trigger a negative change in our ratings outlook or even a reduction in our credit ratings by the three credit rating agencies this would mean more limited access to the private and public credit markets and an increase in the costs of such borrowings 

a credit rating is not a recommendation to buy sell or hold securities the highest investment grade credit rating is aaa for sp aaa for moody’s and aaa for fitch the lowest investment grade credit rating is bbb for sp baa3 for moody’s and bbb for fitch our credit ratings may be revised or withdrawn at any time by the rating agencies and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating there can be no assurance that a rating will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if in its judgment circumstances so warrant 

debt covenants 

we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants as of september 30 2015  our debt covenants are described in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements 

contractual obligations and commercial commitments 

the following table provides information about contractual obligations and commercial commitments at september 30 2015  



  

 

our regulated distribution segment maintains supply contracts with several vendors that generally cover a period of up to one year commitments for estimated base gas volumes are established under these contracts on a monthly basis at contractually negotiated prices commitments for incremental daily purchases are made as necessary during the month in accordance with the terms of individual contracts our midtex division also maintains a limited number of longterm supply contracts to ensure a reliable source of gas for our customers in its service area which obligate it to purchase specified volumes at market and fixed prices at september 30 2015  we were committed to purchase 366  bcf within one year and 268  bcf within one to three years under indexed contracts 

aeh has commitments to purchase physical quantities of natural gas under contracts indexed to the forward nymex strip or fixed price contracts at september 30 2015  aeh was committed to purchase 1019  bcf within one year 160  bcf within one to three years and 05  bcf after three years under indexed contracts aeh is committed to purchase 30  bcf within one year under fixed price contracts with prices ranging from 232  to 323  per mcf 

risk management activities 

as discussed above in our critical accounting policies we use financial instruments to mitigate commodity price risk and periodically to manage interest rate risk we conduct risk management activities through our regulated distribution and nonregulated segments in our regulated distribution segment we use a combination of physical storage fixed physical contracts and fixed financial contracts to reduce our exposure to unusually large winterperiod gas price increases in our nonregulated segments we manage our exposure to the risk of natural gas price changes and lock in our gross profit margin through a combination of storage and financial instruments including futures overthecounter and exchangetraded options and swap contracts with counterparties to the extent our inventory cost and actual sales and actual purchases do not correlate with the changes in the market indices we use in our hedges we could experience ineffectiveness or the hedges may no longer meet the accounting requirements for hedge accounting resulting in the financial instruments being treated as mark to market instruments through earnings 

we record our financial instruments as a component of risk management assets and liabilities which are classified as current or noncurrent based upon the anticipated settlement date of the underlying financial instrument substantially all of our financial instruments are valued using external market quotes and indices 

the following table shows the components of the change in fair value of our regulated distribution segment’s financial instruments for the fiscal year ended september 30 2015  in thousands 



the fair value of our regulated distribution segment’s financial instruments at september 30 2015  is presented below by time period and fair value source 



the following table shows the components of the change in fair value of our nonregulated segment’s financial instruments for the fiscal year ended september 30 2015  in thousands 



the fair value of our nonregulated segment’s financial instruments at september 30 2015  is presented below by time period and fair value source 

  



employee benefits programs 

an important element of our total compensation program and a significant component of our operation and maintenance expense is the offering of various benefits programs to our employees these programs include medical and dental insurance coverage and pension and postretirement programs 

medical and dental insurance 

we offer medical and dental insurance programs to substantially all of our employeeswe believe these programs are compliant with all current and future provisions that will be going into effect under the patient protection and affordable care act and consistent with other programs in our industry in recent years we have strived to actively manage our health care costs through the introduction of a wellness strategy that is focused on helping employees to identify health risks and to manage these risks through improved lifestyle choices 

over the last five fiscal years we have experienced annual medical and prescription inflation of approximately five percent for fiscal 2016  we anticipate the medical and prescription drug inflation rate will continue at approximately five percent primarily due to the inflation of health care costs 

net periodic pension and postretirement benefit costs 

for the fiscal year ended september 30 2015  our total net periodic pension and other benefits costs was 589 million  compared with 698 million and 785 million for the fiscal years ended september 30 2014  and 2013  these costs relating to our regulated distribution operations are recoverable through our distribution rates a portion of these costs is capitalized into our distribution rate base and the remaining costs are recorded as a component of operation and maintenance expense 

our fiscal 2015  costs were determined using a september 30 2014  measurement date at that date interest and corporate bond rates utilized to determine our discount rates were lower than the interest and corporate bond rates as of september 30 2013  the measurement date for our fiscal 2014 net periodic cost therefore we decreased the discount rate used to measure our fiscal 2015 net periodic cost from 495 percent to 443 percent we maintained our expected return on plan assets at 725 percent in the determination of our fiscal 2015 net periodic pension cost based upon expected market returns for our targeted asset allocation as a result of the net impact of these and other assumptions our fiscal 2015 pension and postretirement medical costs were lower than in the prior year 

our fiscal 2014 costs were determined using a september 30 2013 measurement date at that date interest and corporate bond rates utilized to determine our discount rates were higher than the interest and corporate bond rates as of september 30 2012 the measurement date for our fiscal 2013 net periodic cost therefore we increased the discount rate used to measure our fiscal 2014 net periodic cost from 404 percent to 495 percent however we decreased the expected return on plan assets from 775 percent to 725 percent in the determination of our fiscal 2014 net periodic pension cost based upon expected market returns for our targeted asset allocation as a result of the net impact of these and other assumptions our fiscal 2014 pension and postretirement medical costs were lower than in the prior year 

pension and postretirement plan funding 

generally our funding policy is to contribute annually an amount that will at least equal the minimum amount required to comply with the employee retirement income security act of 1974 erisa however additional voluntary contributions are made from time to time as considered necessary contributions are intended to provide not only for benefits attributed to service to date but also for those expected to be earned in the future 

in accordance with the pension protection act of 2006 ppa we determined the funded status of our plans as of january 1 2015 based on this valuation we contributed cash of 380 million  271 million  and 327 million to our pension 

plans during fiscal 2015  2014  and 2013  each contribution increased the level of our plan assets to achieve a desirable ppa funding threshold 

we contributed 200 million  236 million  and 266 million to our postretirement benefits plans for the fiscal years ended september 30 2015  2014  and 2013  the contributions represent the portion of the postretirement costs we are responsible for under the terms of our plan and minimum funding required by state regulatory commissions 

outlook for fiscal 2016  and beyond 

as of september 30 2015  interest and corporate bond rates were higher than the rates as of september 30 2014 therefore we increased the discount rate used to measure our fiscal 2016 net periodic cost from 443 percent to 455 percent we lowered expected return on plan assets from 725 percent to 700 percent in the determination of our fiscal 2016 net periodic pension cost based upon expected market returns for our targeted asset allocation in october 2014 the society of actuaries released its final report on mortality tables and the mortality improvement scale to reflect increasing life expectancies in the united states on october 8 2015 the society of actuaries issued an additional report related to mortality tables and the mortality improvement scale as of september 30 2015 we updated our assumed mortality rates to incorporate both new sets of mortality tables as a result of the net impact of changes in these and other assumptions we expect our fiscal 2016 net periodic pension cost to decrease by approximately 20 percent 

based upon current market conditions the current funded position of the plans and the funding requirements under the ppa we do not anticipate a minimum required contribution for fiscal 2016  however we may consider whether a voluntary contribution is prudent to maintain certain funding levels with respect to our postretirement medical plans we anticipate contributing between 30 million and 40 million during fiscal 2016  

actual changes in the fair market value of plan assets and differences between the actual and expected return on plan assets could have a material effect on the amount of pension costs ultimately recognized a 025 percent change in our discount rate would impact our pension and postretirement costs by approximately 27 million a 025 percent change in our expected rate of return would impact our pension and postretirement costs by approximately 12 million 

the projected liability future funding requirements and the amount of expense or income recognized for each of our pension and other postretirement benefit plans are subject to change depending on the actuarial value of plan assets and the determination of future benefit obligations as of each subsequent calculation date these amounts are impacted by actual investment returns changes in interest rates changes in the demographic composition of the participants in the plans and other actuarial assumptions

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend

we are exposed to risks associated with commodity prices and interest rates commodity price risk is the potential loss that we may incur as a result of changes in the fair value of a particular instrument or commodity interestrate risk results from our portfolio of debt and equity instruments that we issue to provide financing and liquidity for our business activities 

we conduct risk management activities through both our regulated distribution and nonregulated segments in our regulated distribution segment we use a combination of physical storage fixed physical contracts and fixed financial contracts to protect us and our customers against unusually large winter period gas price increases in our nonregulated segment we manage our exposure to the risk of natural gas price changes and lock in our gross profit margin through a combination of storage and financial instruments including futures overthecounter and exchangetraded options and swap contracts with counterparties our risk management activities and related accounting treatment are described in further detail in note 12 to the consolidated financial statements additionally our earnings are affected by changes in shortterm interest rates as a result of our issuance of shortterm commercial paper and our other shortterm borrowings 

commodity price risk 

regulated distribution segment 

we purchase natural gas for our regulated distribution operations substantially all of the costs of gas purchased for regulated distribution operations are recovered from our customers through purchased gas cost adjustment mechanisms therefore our regulated distribution operations have limited commodity price risk exposure 

nonregulated segment 

our nonregulated segment is also exposed to risks associated with changes in the market price of natural gas for our nonregulated segment we use a sensitivity analysis to estimate commodity price risk for purposes of this analysis we estimate commodity price risk by applying a 050 change in the forward nymex price to our net open position including existing storage and related financial contracts at the end of each period based on aeh’s net open position including existing storage and related financial contracts at september 30 2015  of 10  bcf a 050 change in the forward nymex price would have had a 03 million impact on our consolidated net income 

changes in the difference between the indices used to mark to market our physical inventory gas daily and the related fairvalue hedge nymex can result in volatility in our reported net income but over time gains and losses on the sale of storage gas inventory will be offset by gains and losses on the fairvalue hedges based upon our net physical position at september 30 2015  and assuming our hedges would still qualify as highly effective a 050 change in the difference between the gas daily and nymex indices would impact our reported net income by approximately 44 million 

additionally these changes could cause us to recognize a risk management liability which would require us to place cash into an escrow account to collateralize this liability position this in turn would reduce the amount of cash we would have on hand to fund our working capital needs 

interest rate risk 

our earnings are exposed to changes in shortterm interest rates associated with our shortterm commercial paper program and other shortterm borrowings we use a sensitivity analysis to estimate our shortterm interest rate risk for purposes of this analysis we estimate our shortterm interest rate risk as the difference between our actual interest expense for the period and estimated interest expense for the period assuming a hypothetical average one percent increase in the interest rates associated with our shortterm borrowings had interest rates associated with our shortterm borrowings increased by an average of one percent our interest expense would have increased by approximately 27 million during 2015

business

overview and strategy 

atmos energy corporation headquartered in dallas texas and incorporated in texas and virginia is engaged primarily in the regulated natural gas distribution and pipeline businesses as well as other nonregulated natural gas businesses we deliver natural gas through regulated sales and transportation arrangements to over three million residential commercial public authority and industrial customers in eight states located primarily in the south which makes us one of the country’s largest naturalgasonly distributors based on number of customers we also operate one of the largest intrastate pipelines in texas based on miles of pipe 

during fiscal 2012 and 2013 we sold our natural gas distribution operations in four states to streamline our regulated operations in august 2012 we completed the sale of our natural gas distribution operations in missouri illinois and iowa representing approximately 84000 customers and in april 2013 we completed the sale of our natural gas distribution operations in georgia representing approximately 64000 customers 

our nonregulated businesses provide natural gas management marketing transportation and storage services to municipalities local gas distribution companies including certain of our natural gas distribution divisions and industrial customers principally in the midwest and southeast 

our overall strategy is to 

 we have delivered excellent shareholder value by growing our earnings and increasing our dividends for over 25 consecutive years over the last six years we have achieved growth by implementing rate designs that reduce or eliminate regulatory lag and separate the recovery of our approved margins from customer usage patterns in addition we have developed various commercial opportunities within our regulated transmission and storage operations 

our core values include focusing on our employees and customers while conducting our business with honesty and integrity we continue to strengthen our culture through ongoing communications with our employees and enhanced employee training 

operating segments 

we operate the company through the following three segments 

 

these operating segments are described in greater detail below 

regulated distribution segment overview 

our regulated distribution segment is comprised of our six regulated natural gas distribution divisions this segment represents approximately 65 percent of our consolidated net income the following table summarizes key information about these divisions presented in order of total rate base we operate in our service areas under terms of nonexclusive franchise agreements granted by the various cities and towns that we serve at september 30 2014  we held 1003 franchises having terms generally ranging from five to 35 years a significant number of our franchises expire each year which require renewal prior to the end of their terms we believe that we will be able to renew our franchises as they expire 



revenues in this operating segment are established by regulatory authorities in the states in which we operate these rates are intended to be sufficient to cover the costs of conducting business and to provide a reasonable return on invested capital in addition we transport natural gas for others through our distribution system 

rates established by regulatory authorities often include cost adjustment mechanisms for costs that i are subject to significant price fluctuations compared to our other costs ii represent a large component of our cost of service and iii are generally outside our control 

purchased gas cost adjustment mechanisms represent a common form of cost adjustment mechanism purchased gas cost adjustment mechanisms provide natural gas distribution companies a method of recovering purchased gas costs on an ongoing basis without filing a rate case because they provide a dollarfordollar offset to increases or decreases in natural gas distribution gas costs therefore although substantially all of our distribution operating revenues fluctuate with the cost of gas that we purchase distribution gross profit which is defined as operating revenues less purchased gas cost is generally not affected by fluctuations in the cost of gas 

additionally some jurisdictions have introduced performancebased ratemaking adjustments to provide incentives to distribution companies to minimize purchased gas costs through improved storage management and use of financial instruments to lock in gas costs under the performancebased ratemaking adjustment purchased gas costs savings are shared between the utility and its customers 

our supply of natural gas is provided by a variety of suppliers including independent producers marketers and pipeline companies and withdrawals of gas from proprietary and contracted storage assets additionally the natural gas supply for our midtex division includes peaking and spot purchase agreements 

supply arrangements consist of both base load and swing supply peaking quantities and are contracted from our suppliers on a firm basis with various terms at market prices base load quantities are those that flow at a constant level throughout the month and swing supply quantities provide the flexibility to change daily quantities to match increases or decreases in requirements related to weather conditions 

except for local production purchases we select our natural gas suppliers through a competitive bidding process by periodically requesting proposals from suppliers that have demonstrated that they can provide reliable service we select these suppliers based on their ability to deliver gas supply to our designated firm pipeline receipt points at the lowest reasonable cost major suppliers during fiscal 2014  were conocophillips company devon gas services lp enbridge marketing us inc enterprise products operating llc iberdrola energy services llc njr energy services company targa gas marketing llc tenaska gas storage llc tenaska marketing ventures texla energy management inc and atmos energy marketing llc our natural gas marketing subsidiary 

the combination of base load peaking and spot purchase agreements coupled with the withdrawal of gas held in storage allows us the flexibility to adjust to changes in weather which minimizes our need to enter into longterm firm commitments we estimate our peakday availability of natural gas supply to be approximately 44 bcf the peakday demand for our distribution operations in fiscal 2014  was on january 6 2014 when sales to customers reached approximately 35 bcf 

currently our distribution divisions except for our midtex division utilize 35 pipeline transportation companies both interstate and intrastate to transport our natural gas the pipeline transportation agreements are firm and many of them have “pipeline nonotice” storage service which provides for daily balancing between system requirements and nominated flowing supplies these agreements have been negotiated with the shortest term necessary while still maintaining our right of first refusal the natural gas supply for our midtex division is delivered primarily by our atmos pipeline — texas division 

to maintain our deliveries to high priority customers we have the ability and have exercised our right to curtail deliveries to certain customers under the terms of interruptible contracts or applicable state regulations or statutes our customers’ demand on our system is not necessarily indicative of our ability to meet current or anticipated market demands or immediate delivery requirements because of factors such as the physical limitations of gathering storage and transmission systems the duration and severity of cold weather the availability of gas reserves from our suppliers the ability to purchase additional supplies on a shortterm basis and actions by federal and state regulatory authorities curtailment rights provide us the flexibility to meet the humanneeds requirements of our customers on a firm basis priority allocations imposed by federal and state regulatory agencies as well as other factors beyond our control may affect our ability to meet the demands of our customers we anticipate no problems with obtaining additional gas supply as needed for our customers 

regulated pipeline segment overview 

our regulated pipeline segment consists of the regulated pipeline and storage operations of our atmos pipeline  texas division apt apt is one of the largest intrastate pipeline operations in texas with a heavy concentration in the established natural gasproducing areas of central northern and eastern texas extending into or near the major producing areas of the barnett shale the texas gulf coast and the delaware and val verde basins of west texas through it we transport natural gas to our midtex division and to third parties and manage five underground storage reservoirs in texas we also provide ancillary services customary in the pipeline industry including parking and lending arrangements this segment represents approximately 30 percent of our consolidated operations 

gross profit earned from transportation for our midtex division other local distribution companies and certain other transportation and storage services is subject to traditional ratemaking governed by the rrc rates are updated through periodic formal rate proceedings and filings made under texas’ gas reliability infrastructure program grip grip allows us to include in our rate base annually approved capital costs incurred in the prior calendar year provided that we file a complete rate case at least once every five years atmos pipelinetexas’ existing regulatory mechanisms allow certain transportation and storage services to be provided under marketbased rates 

nonregulated segment overview 

our nonregulated operations are conducted through atmos energy holdings inc aeh a whollyowned subsidiary of atmos energy corporation and typically represent approximately five percent of our consolidated net income 

aehs primary business is to buy sell and deliver natural gas at competitive prices to approximately 1000 customers located primarily in the midwest and southeast areas of the united states aeh accomplishes this objective by aggregating and purchasing gas supply arranging transportation and storage logistics and effectively managing commodity price risk 

aeh also earns storage and transportation demand fees primarily from our regulated distribution operations in louisiana and kentucky these demand fees are subject to regulatory oversight and are renewed periodically 

ratemaking activity 

overview 

the method of determining regulated rates varies among the states in which our regulated businesses operate the regulatory authorities have the responsibility of ensuring that utilities in their jurisdictions operate in the best interests of customers while providing utility companies the opportunity to earn a reasonable return on their investment generally each regulatory authority reviews rate requests and establishes a rate structure intended to generate revenue sufficient to cover the costs of conducting business and to provide a reasonable return on invested capital 

our rate strategy focuses on reducing or eliminating regulatory lag obtaining adequate returns and providing stable predictable margins which benefit both our customers and the company as a result of our ratemaking efforts in recent years atmos energy has 

 

 the following table provides a jurisdictional rate summary for our regulated operations this information is for regulatory purposes only and may not be representative of our actual financial position 



  



  

 although substantial progress has been made in recent years by improving rate design and recovery of investment across atmos energy’s operating areas we will continue to seek improvements in rate design to address cost variations that are related to passthrough energy costs beyond our control and pursue tariffs that reduce regulatory lag associated with investments further potential changes in federal energy policy and adverse economic conditions will necessitate continued vigilance by the company and our regulators in meeting the challenges presented by these external factors 

recent ratemaking activity 

substantially all of our regulated revenues in the fiscal years ended september 30 2014  2013  and 2012  were derived from sales at rates set by or subject to approval by local or state authorities net operating income increases resulting from ratemaking activity totaling 933 million  981 million  and 307 million  became effective in fiscal 2014  2013  and 2012  as summarized below 



additionally the following ratemaking efforts were initiated during fiscal 2014  but had not been completed as of september 30 2014  



  

 tex cities decision to deny the 2013 rrm increase to the texas railroad commission on may 30 2014 a proposal for decision is expected before the end of the calendar year 

 

  

our recent ratemaking activity is discussed in greater detail below 

infrastructure programs 

as discussed above in “regulated distribution segment overview” and “regulated pipeline segment overview” infrastructure programs such as grip allow our regulated divisions the opportunity to include in their rate base annually approved capital costs incurred in the prior calendar year we currently have infrastructure programs in texas kansas kentucky louisiana and virginia the following table summarizes our infrastructure program filings with effective dates during the fiscal years ended september 30 2014  2013  and 2012  



  

 

annual rate filing mechanisms 

as an instrument to reduce regulatory lag annual rate filing mechanisms allow us to refresh our rates on an annual periodic basis without filing a formal rate case however these filings still involve discovery by the appropriate regulatory authorities prior to the final determination of rates under these mechanisms we currently have formula rate filing mechanisms in our louisiana and mississippi divisions and in a portion of our texas divisions the annual rate filing mechanism is referred to as dallas annual rate review darr and rate review mechanisms rrm in our midtex division as the rrm in our west texas division as stable rate filings in the mississippi division and the rate stabilization clause in the louisiana division the following table summarizes filings made under our various formula rate filing mechanisms 



 during fiscal 2011 the rrc’s division of public safety issued a new rule requiring natural gas distribution companies with operations in texas to develop and implement a riskbased program for the renewal or replacement of distribution facilities including steel service lines the rule allows for the deferral of all expenses associated with capital expenditures incurred pursuant to this rule until the expenses are included in rates including the recording of interest on the deferred expenses 

rate case filings 

a rate case is a formal request from atmos energy to a regulatory authority to increase rates that are charged to customers rate cases may also be initiated when the regulatory authorities request us to justify our rates this process is referred to as a “show cause” action adequate rates are intended to provide for recovery of the company’s costs as well as a fair rate of return to our shareholders and ensure that we continue to safely deliver reliable reasonably priced natural gas service to our customers the following table summarizes our recent rate cases 



  

other ratemaking activity 

the following table summarizes other ratemaking activity during the fiscal years ended september 30 2014  2013  and 2012  



  

 other regulation 

each of our regulated distribution divisions and our regulated pipeline division is regulated by various state or local public utility authorities we are also subject to regulation by the united states department of transportation with respect to safety requirements in the operation and maintenance of our transmission and distribution facilities in addition our regulated operations are also subject to various state and federal laws regulating environmental matters from time to time we receive inquiries regarding various environmental matters we believe that our properties and operations substantially comply with and are operated in substantial conformity with applicable safety and environmental statutes and regulations there are no administrative or judicial proceedings arising under environmental quality statutes pending or known to be contemplated by governmental agencies which would have a material adverse effect on us or our operations our environmental claims have arisen primarily from former manufactured gas plant sites 

the federal energy regulatory commission ferc allows pursuant to section 311 of the natural gas policy act gas transportation services through our atmos pipeline—texas assets “on behalf of” interstate pipelines or local distribution companies served by interstate pipelines without subjecting these assets to the jurisdiction of the ferc additionally the ferc has regulatory authority over the sale of natural gas in the wholesale gas market and the use and release of interstate pipeline and storage capacity the ferc also has authority to detect and prevent market manipulation and to enforce compliance with ferc’s other rules policies and orders by companies engaged in the sale purchase transportation or storage of natural gas in interstate commerce we have taken what we believe are the necessary and appropriate steps to comply with these regulations 

competition 

although our regulated distribution operations are not currently in significant direct competition with any other distributors of natural gas to residential and commercial customers within our service areas we do compete with other natural gas suppliers and suppliers of alternative fuels for sales to industrial customers we compete in all aspects of our business with alternative energy sources including in particular electricity electric utilities offer electricity as a rival energy source and compete for the space heating water heating and cooking markets promotional incentives improved equipment efficiencies and promotional rates all contribute to the acceptability of electrical equipment the principal means to compete against alternative fuels is lower prices and natural gas historically has maintained its price advantage in the residential commercial and industrial markets 

our regulated pipeline operations historically faced competition from other existing intrastate pipelines seeking to provide or arrange transportation storage and other services for customers in the last few years several new pipelines have been completed which has increased the level of competition in this segment of our business 

within our nonregulated operations aem competes with other natural gas marketers to provide natural gas management and other related services primarily to smaller customers requiring higher levels of balancing scheduling and other related management services aem has experienced increased competition in recent years primarily from investment banks and major integrated oil and natural gas companies who offer lower cost basic services the increased competition has reduced margins most notably on its highvolume accounts 

employees 

at september 30 2014  we had 4761 employees consisting of 4650 employees in our regulated operations and 111 employees in our nonregulated operations

 item 1a 

risk factors 

tableend

our financial and operating results are subject to a number of risk factors many of which are not within our control although we have tried to discuss key risk factors below please be aware that other or new risks may prove to be important in the future investors should carefully consider the following discussion of risk factors as well as other information appearing in this report these factors include the following 

the company is dependent on continued access to the credit and capital markets to execute our business strategy 

our longterm debt is currently rated as “investment grade” by standard  poor’s corporation moody’s investors services inc and fitch ratings ltd similar to most companies we rely upon access to both shortterm and longterm credit and capital markets to satisfy our liquidity requirements if adverse credit conditions were to cause a significant limitation on our access to the private and public capital markets we could see a reduction in our liquidity a significant reduction in our liquidity could in turn trigger a negative change in our ratings outlook or even a reduction in our credit ratings by one or more of the three credit rating agencies such a downgrade could further limit our access to private credit andor public capital markets and increase our costs of borrowing 

further if our credit ratings were downgraded we could be required to provide additional liquidity to our nonregulated segment because the commodity financial instrument markets could become unavailable to us our nonregulated segment depends primarily upon an intercompany lending facility between aeh and atmos energy to finance its working capital needs supplemented by two small credit facilities with outside lenders our ability to provide this liquidity to aeh for our nonregulated operations is limited by the terms of the lending arrangement with aeh which is subject to annual approval by one state regulatory commission 

while we believe we can meet our capital requirements from our operations and the sources of financing available to us we can provide no assurance that we will continue to be able to do so in the future especially if the market price of natural gas increases significantly in the near term the future effects on our business liquidity and financial results of a deterioration of current conditions in the credit and capital markets could be material and adverse to us both in the ways described above or in other ways that we do not currently anticipate 

we are subject to state and local regulations that affect our operations and financial results 

our regulated distribution and regulated pipeline segments are subject to regulatory oversight from various state and local regulatory authorities in the eight states that we serve in our regulated distribution and pipeline segments therefore our returns are continuously monitored and are subject to challenge for their reasonableness by the appropriate regulatory authorities or other thirdparty interveners in the normal course of business as a regulated entity we often need to place assets in service and establish historical test periods before rate cases that seek to adjust our allowed returns to recover that investment can be filed further the regulatory review process can be lengthy because of this process we suffer the negative financial effects of having placed assets in service without the benefit of rate relief which is commonly referred to as “regulatory lag” the regulatory process also involves the risk that regulatory authorities may i review our purchases of natural gas and adjust the amount of our gas costs that we pass through to our customers or ii limit the costs we may have incurred from our cost of service that can be recovered from customers 

a deterioration in economic conditions could adversely affect our customers and negatively impact our financial results 

any adverse changes in economic conditions in the united states especially in the states in which we operate similar to the economic downturn we experienced for several years beginning in 2008 could adversely affect the financial resources of many domestic households and lead to an increase in mortgage defaults and significant decreases in the values of our customers’ homes and investment assets as a result our customers could seek to use even less gas and make it more difficult for them to pay their gas bills this would likely lead to slower collections and higher than normal levels of accounts receivable this in turn would probably increase our financing requirements and bad debt expense additionally should economic conditions deteriorate our industrial customers could seek alternative energy sources which could result in lower sales volumes 

inflation and increased gas costs could adversely impact our customer base and customer collections and increase our level of indebtedness 

inflation has continued to cause increases in some of our operating expenses and has required assets to be replaced at higher costs we have a process in place to continually review the adequacy of our distribution gas rates in relation to the increasing cost of providing service and the inherent regulatory lag in adjusting those gas rates historically we have been able to budget and control operating expenses and investments within the amounts authorized to be collected in rates and intend to continue to do so however the ability to control expenses is an important factor that could impact future financial results 

in addition rapid increases in the costs of purchased gas would cause us to experience a significant increase in shortterm debt we must pay suppliers for gas when it is purchased which can be significantly in advance of when these costs may be recovered through the collection of monthly customer bills for gas delivered increases in purchased gas costs also slow our natural gas distribution collection efforts as customers are more likely to delay the payment of their gas bills leading to higher than normal accounts receivable this could result in higher shortterm debt levels greater collection efforts and increased bad debt expense 

we are exposed to market risks that are beyond our control which could adversely affect our financial results and capital requirements 

we are subject to market risks beyond our control including i commodity price volatility caused by market supply and demand dynamics counterparty performance or counterparty creditworthiness and ii interest rate risk 

our regulated operations are generally insulated from commodity price risk through its purchased gas cost mechanisms although our nonregulated operations represent only about five percent of our consolidated results commodity price volatility experienced in this business segment could lead to some volatility in our earnings our nonregulated segment manages margins and limits risk exposure on the sale of natural gas inventory or the offsetting fixedprice purchase or sale commitments for physical quantities of natural gas through the use of a variety of financial instruments however contractual limitations could adversely affect our ability to withdraw gas from storage which could cause us to purchase gas at spot prices in a rising market to obtain sufficient volumes to fulfill customer contracts we could also realize financial losses on our efforts to limit risk as a result of volatility in the market prices of the underlying commodities or if a counterparty fails to perform under a contract any significant tightening of the credit markets could cause more of our counterparties to fail to perform than expected in addition adverse changes in the creditworthiness of our counterparties could limit the level of trading activities with these parties and increase the risk that these parties may not perform under a contract these circumstances could also increase our capital requirements 

although we manage our business to maintain no open positions related to our physical storage there are times when limited net open positions may occur on a shortterm basis net open positions may increase volatility in our financial condition or results of operations if market prices move in a significantly favorable or unfavorable manner before the open positions can be closed the determination of our net open position as of the end of any particular trading day requires us to make assumptions as to future circumstances including the use of gas by our customers in relation to our anticipated storage and market positions because the price risk associated with any net open position at the end of such day may increase if the assumptions are not realized we review these assumptions as part of our daily monitoring activities further if the local physical markets do not move consistently with the nymex futures market upon which most of our commodity derivative financial instruments are valued we could experience increased volatility in the financial results of our nonregulated segment 

with respect to interest rate risk we have been operating in a relatively low interestrate environment in recent years compared to historical norms for both short and longterm interest rates however increases in interest rates could adversely affect our future financial results 

the concentration of our distribution pipeline and storage operations in the state of texas exposes our operations and financial results to economic conditions weather patterns and regulatory decisions in texas 

over 50 percent of our regulated distribution customers and most of our regulated pipeline assets and operations are located in the state of texas this concentration of our business in texas means that our operations and financial results may be significantly affected by changes in the texas economy in general weather patterns and regulatory decisions by state and local regulatory authorities in texas 

our operations are subject to increased competition  

in residential and commercial customer markets our regulated distribution operations compete with other energy products such as electricity and propane our primary product competition is with electricity for heating water heating and cooking increases in the price of natural gas could negatively impact our competitive position by decreasing the price benefits of natural gas to the consumer this could adversely impact our business if as a result our customer growth slows reducing our ability to make capital expenditures or if our customers further conserve their use of gas resulting in reduced gas purchases and customer billings 

in the case of industrial customers such as manufacturing plants adverse economic conditions including higher gas costs could cause these customers to use alternative sources of energy such as electricity or bypass our systems in favor of special competitive contracts with lower perunit costs our regulated pipeline operations historically have faced limited competition from other existing intrastate pipelines and gas marketers seeking to provide or arrange transportation storage and other 

services for customers however in the last few years several new pipelines have been completed which has increased the level of competition in this segment of our business 

finally within our nonregulated operations aem competes with other natural gas marketers to provide natural gas management and other related services primarily to smaller customers requiring higher levels of balancing scheduling and other related management services aem has experienced increased competition in recent years from competitors who offer lower cost basic services 

adverse weather conditions could affect our operations or financial results 

we have weathernormalized rates for over 95 percent of our residential and commercial meters in our regulated distribution business which substantially mitigates the adverse effects of warmerthannormal weather for meters in those service areas however there is no assurance that we will continue to receive such regulatory protection from adverse weather in our rates in the future the loss of such weathernormalized rates could have an adverse effect on our operations and financial results in addition our regulated distribution and regulated pipeline operating results may continue to vary somewhat with the actual temperatures during the winter heating season sustained cold weather could adversely affect our nonregulated operations as we may be required to purchase gas at spot rates in a rising market to obtain sufficient volumes to fulfill some customer contracts additionally sustained cold weather could challenge our ability to adequately meet customer demand in our natural gas distribution and pipeline and storage operations 

our growth in the future may be limited by the nature of our business which requires extensive capital spending 

we must continually build additional capacity in our regulated distribution system to enable us to serve any growth in the number of our customers the cost of adding this capacity may be affected by a number of factors including the general state of the economy and weather in addition although we should ultimately recover the cost of the expenditures through rates we must make significant capital expenditures to comply with rules issued by the rrc’s division of public safety that require natural gas distribution companies to develop and implement riskbased programs for the renewal or replacement of distribution facilities including steel service lines our cash flows from operations generally are sufficient to supply funding for all our capital expenditures including the financing of the costs of new construction along with capital expenditures necessary to maintain our existing natural gas system due to the timing of these cash flows and capital expenditures we often must fund at least a portion of these costs through borrowing funds from thirdparty lenders the cost and availability of which is dependent on the liquidity of the credit markets interest rates and other market conditions this in turn may limit our ability to connect new customers to our system due to constraints on the amount of funds we can invest in our infrastructure 

the costs of providing health care benefits pension and postretirement health care benefits and related funding requirements may increase substantially 

we provide health care benefits a cashbalance pension plan and postretirement health care benefits to eligible fulltime employees the costs of providing health care benefits to our employees could significantly increase over time due to rapidly increasing health care inflation the impact of the health care reform act of 2010 hcr and any future legislative changes related to the provision of health care benefits the impact of additional costs incurred by the health insurance industry arising from the implementation of hcr which are likely to be passed on to the company are difficult to measure at this time 

the costs of providing a cashbalance pension plan and postretirement health care benefits to eligible fulltime employees and related funding requirements could be influenced by changes in the market value of the assets funding our pension and postretirement health care plans any significant declines in the value of these investments due to sustained declines in equity markets or a reduction in bond yields could increase the costs of our pension and postretirement health care plans and related funding requirements in the future further our costs of providing such benefits and related funding requirements are also subject to a number of factors including i changing demographics including longer life expectancy of beneficiaries and an expected increase in the number of eligible former employees over the next five to ten years ii various actuarial calculations and assumptions which may differ materially from actual results due primarily to changing market and economic conditions including changes in interest rates and higher or lower withdrawal rates and iii future government regulation 

the costs to the company of providing these benefits and related funding requirements could also increase materially in the future depending on the timing of the recovery if any of such costs through our rates 

the inability to continue to hire train and retain operational technical and managerial personnel could adversely affect our results of operations 

the average age of the employee base of atmos energy has been increasing for a number of years with a number of employees becoming eligible to retire within the next five to 10 years if we were unable to hire appropriate personnel to fill future needs the company could encounter operating challenges and increased costs primarily due to a loss of knowledge errors due to inexperience or the lengthy time period typically required to adequately train replacement personnel in addition higher costs could result from the increased use of contractors to replace retiring employees loss of productivity or increased 

safety compliance issues the inability to hire train and retain new operational technical and managerial personnel adequately and to transfer institutional knowledge and expertise could adversely affect our ability to manage and operate our business if we were unable to hire train and retain appropriately qualified personnel our results of operations could be adversely affected 

we may experience increased federal state and local regulation of the safety of our operations 

we are committed to constantly monitoring and maintaining our pipeline and distribution system to ensure that natural gas is delivered safely reliably and efficiently through our network of more than 72000 miles of pipeline and distribution lines the pipeline replacement programs currently underway in several of our divisions typify the preventive maintenance and continual renewal that we perform on our natural gas distribution system in the eight states in which we currently operate the safety and protection of the public our customers and our employees is our top priority however due primarily to the unfortunate pipeline incident in california in 2010 natural gas distribution and pipeline companies have continued to face increasing federal state and local oversight of the safety of their operations although we believe these costs should be ultimately recoverable through our rates the costs of complying with such increased laws and regulations may have at least a shortterm adverse impact on our operating costs and financial results 

some of our operations are subject to increased federal regulatory oversight that could affect our operations and financial results 

ferc has regulatory authority over some of our operations including sales of natural gas in the wholesale gas market and the use and release of interstate pipeline and storage capacity ferc has adopted rules designed to prevent market power abuse and market manipulation and to promote compliance with ferc’s other rules policies and orders by companies engaged in the sale purchase transportation or storage of natural gas in interstate commerce these rules carry increased penalties for violations although we have taken steps to structure current and future transactions to comply with applicable current ferc regulations changes in ferc regulations or their interpretation by ferc or additional regulations issued by ferc in the future could also adversely affect our business financial condition or financial results 

we are subject to environmental regulations which could adversely affect our operations or financial results 

we are subject to laws regulations and other legal requirements enacted or adopted by federal state and local governmental authorities relating to protection of the environment and health and safety matters including those that govern discharges of substances into the air and water the management and disposal of hazardous substances and waste the cleanup of contaminated sites groundwater quality and availability plant and wildlife protection as well as work practices related to employee health and safety environmental legislation also requires that our facilities sites and other properties associated with our operations be operated maintained abandoned and reclaimed to the satisfaction of applicable regulatory authorities failure to comply with these laws regulations permits and licenses may expose us to fines penalties or interruptions in our operations that could be significant to our financial results in addition existing environmental regulations may be revised or our operations may become subject to new regulations 

the operations and financial results of the company could be adversely impacted as a result of climate changes or related additional legislation or regulation in the future 

to the extent climate changes occur our businesses could be adversely impacted although we believe it is likely that any such resulting impacts would occur very gradually over a long period of time and thus would be difficult to quantify with any degree of specificity to the extent climate changes would result in warmer temperatures in our service territories financial results from our regulated distribution segment could be adversely affected through lower gas volumes and revenues with our regulated pipeline segment also likely experiencing lower volumes and revenues as well such climate changes could also cause shifts in population including customers moving away from our service territories near the gulf coast in louisiana and mississippi another possible climate change would be more frequent and more severe weather events such as hurricanes and tornados which could increase our costs to repair damaged facilities and restore service to our customers if we were unable to deliver natural gas to our customers our financial results would be impacted by lost revenues and we generally would have to seek approval from regulators to recover restoration costs to the extent we would be unable to recover those costs or if higher rates resulting from our recovery of such costs would result in reduced demand for our services our future business financial condition or financial results could be adversely impacted in addition there have been a number of federal and state legislative and regulatory initiatives proposed in recent years in an attempt to control or limit the effects of global warming and overall climate change including greenhouse gas emissions such as carbon dioxide the adoption of this type of legislation by congress or similar legislation by states or the adoption of related regulations by federal or state governments mandating a substantial reduction in greenhouse gas emissions in the future could have farreaching and significant impacts on the energy industry such new legislation or regulations could result in increased compliance costs for us or additional operating restrictions on our business affect the demand for natural gas or impact the prices we charge to our customers at this time we cannot predict the potential impact of such laws or regulations that may be adopted on our future business financial condition or financial results 

distributing transporting and storing natural gas involve risks that may result in accidents and additional operating costs 

our regulated distribution and regulated pipeline businesses involve a number of hazards and operating risks that cannot be completely avoided such as leaks accidents and operational problems which could cause loss of human life as well as substantial financial losses resulting from property damage damage to the environment and to our operations we maintain liability and property insurance coverage in place for many of these hazards and risks however because some of our pipeline storage and distribution facilities are near or are in populated areas any loss of human life or adverse financial results resulting from such events could be large if these events were not fully covered by our general liability and property insurance which policies are subject to certain limits and deductibles our operations or financial results could be adversely affected 

cyberattacks or acts of cyberterrorism could disrupt our business operations and information technology systems or result in the loss or exposure of confidential or sensitive customer employee or company information 

our business operations and information technology systems may be vulnerable to an attack by individuals or organizations intending to disrupt our business operations and information technology systems we use such systems to manage our distribution and intrastate pipeline operations and other business processes disruption of those systems could adversely impact our ability to safely deliver natural gas to our customers operate our pipeline systems or serve our customers timely accordingly if such an attack or act of terrorism were to occur our operations and financial results could be adversely affected in addition we use our information technology systems to protect confidential or sensitive customer employee and company information developed and maintained in the normal course of our business any attack on such systems that would result in the unauthorized release of customer employee or other confidential or sensitive data could have a material adverse effect on our business reputation increase our costs and expose us to additional material legal claims and liability even though we have insurance coverage in place for many of these cyberrelated risks if such an attack or act of terrorism were to occur our operations and financial results could be adversely affected 

natural disasters terrorist activities or other significant events could adversely affect our operations or financial results 

natural disasters are always a threat to our assets and operations in addition the threat of terrorist activities could lead to increased economic instability and volatility in the price of natural gas that could affect our operations also companies in our industry may face a heightened risk of exposure to actual acts of terrorism which could subject our operations to increased risks as a result the availability of insurance covering such risks may become more limited which could increase the risk that an event could adversely affect our operations or financial results

results of operations 

overview 

atmos energy corporation strives to operate its businesses safely and reliably while delivering superior shareholder value to achieve this objective we are investing in our infrastructure and are seeking to achieve positive rate outcomes that benefit both our customers and the company during fiscal 2014  we earned 2898 million  or 296  per diluted share which represents a 19 percent increase in net income and a 12 percent increase in diluted net income per share over fiscal 2013  primarily due to positive rate outcomes combined with increased gross profit associated with weather that was 20 percent colder than the prioryear period the colder than normal weather increased market demand for natural gas which drove higher price volatility particularly during our second fiscal quarter 

capital expenditures for fiscal 2014 totaled 8353 million  approximately 80 percent was invested to improve the safety and reliability of our distribution and transportation systems and a significant portion of this investment was incurred under regulatory mechanisms that reduce lag to six months or less fiscal 2013 spending under these and other mechanisms enabled the company to complete 18 regulatory filings that should increase annual operating income from regulated operations by 933 million  we plan to continue to fund our growth through the use of operating cash flows and debt and equity securities while maintaining a balanced capital structure 

during fiscal 2014 and early fiscal 2015 we undertook several initiatives to strengthen our balance sheet and improve our liquidity on february 18 2014 we completed the sale of 9200000 shares of common stock under our shelf registration statement generating net proceeds of 3902 million which were used to repay shortterm debt outstanding under our commercial paper program to fund infrastructure spending primarily to enhance the safety and reliability of our system and for general corporate purposes 

on august 22 2014 we amended our 950 million credit facility to increase the committed loan amount from 950 million to 125 billion and extend the expiration date to august 22 2019 the facility retains the 250 million accordion feature which allows for an increase in the total committed loan amount to 15 billion our debttocapitalization ratio as of september 30 2014 was 462 percent  and our liquidity remained strong with over 1 billion of capacity from our shortterm facilities 

on october 15 2014 we issued 500 million of 4125 30year unsecured senior notes which replaced on a longterm basis our 500 million 495 10year unsecured senior notes at maturity on october 15 2014 

as a result of the continued contribution and stability of our regulated earnings cash flows and capital structure our board of directors increased the quarterly dividend by 54 percent for fiscal 2015 

consolidated results 

the following table presents our consolidated financial highlights for the fiscal years ended september 30 2014  2013  and 2012  

  

regulated operations contributed 89 percent  95 percent  and 97 percent  to our consolidated net income from continuing operations for fiscal years 2014  2013  and 2012  our consolidated net income during the last three fiscal years was earned across our business segments as follows 



the following table segregates our consolidated net income and diluted earnings per share between our regulated and nonregulated operations 



we reported net income of 2898 million  or 296  per diluted share for the year ended september 30 2014  compared with net income of 2432 million or 264 per diluted share in the prior year income from continuing operations was 2898 million  or 296  per diluted share compared with 2307 million  or 250  per diluted share in the prioryear period in the prior year income from discontinued operations was 125 million  or 014  per diluted share which included the gain on sale of substantially all our assets in georgia of 53 million unrealized gains in our nonregulated operations during the current year increased net income by 58 million or 006 per diluted share compared with net gains recorded in the prior year of 53 million or 005 per diluted share in fiscal 2013 net income includes an 82 million 53 million net of tax or 006 per diluted share favorable impact related to the gain recorded in association with the april 1 2013 completion of the sale of our georgia assets 

we reported net income of 2432 million or 264 per diluted share for the year ended september 30 2013  compared with net income of 2167 million or 237 per diluted share in fiscal 2012 income from continuing operations in fiscal 2013 was 2307 million or 250 per diluted share compared with 1922 million or 210 per diluted share in fiscal 2012 income from discontinued operations was 125 million  or 014 per diluted share for the year ended september 30 2013 which includes the gain on sale of substantially all our assets in georgia of 53 million compared with 245 million or 027 per diluted share in fiscal 2012 unrealized gains in our nonregulated operations during fiscal 2013 increased net income by 53 million or 005 per diluted share compared with net losses recorded in fiscal 2012 of 50 million or 005 per diluted share additionally net income in both periods was impacted by nonrecurring items in fiscal 2013 net income includes an 82 million 53 million net of tax or 006 per diluted share favorable impact related to the gain recorded in association with the april 1 2013 completion of the sale of our georgia assets in fiscal 2012 net income included the net positive impact of several onetime items totaling 103 million or 011 per diluted share related to the following amounts 

 see the following discussion regarding the results of operations for each of our business operating segments 

regulated distribution segment 

the primary factors that impact the results of our regulated distribution operations are our ability to earn our authorized rates of return the cost of natural gas competitive factors in the energy industry and economic conditions in our service areas 

our ability to earn our authorized rates is based primarily on our ability to improve the rate design in our various ratemaking jurisdictions by reducing or eliminating regulatory lag and ultimately separating the recovery of our approved margins from customer usage patterns improving rate design is a longterm process and is further complicated by the fact that we operate in multiple rate jurisdictions the “ratemaking activity” section of this form 10k describes our current rate strategy progress towards implementing that strategy and recent ratemaking initiatives in more detail 

we are generally able to pass the cost of gas through to our customers without markup under purchased gas cost adjustment mechanisms therefore the cost of gas typically does not have an impact on our gross profit as increases in the cost of gas are offset by a corresponding increase in revenues accordingly we believe gross profit is a better indicator of our financial performance than revenues however gross profit in our texas and mississippi service areas include franchise fees and gross receipt taxes which are calculated as a percentage of revenue inclusive of gas costs therefore the amount of these taxes included in revenue is influenced by the cost of gas and the level of gas sales volumes we record the tax expense as a component of taxes other than income although changes in revenue related taxes arising from changes in gas costs affect gross profit over time the impact is offset within operating income 

although the cost of gas typically does not have a direct impact on our gross profit higher gas costs may adversely impact our accounts receivable collections resulting in higher bad debt expense and may require us to increase borrowings under our credit facilities resulting in higher interest expense in addition higher gas costs as well as competitive factors in the industry and general economic conditions may cause customers to conserve or in the case of industrial consumers to use alternative energy sources currently gas cost risk has been mitigated by rate design that allows us to collect from our customers the gas cost portion of our bad debt expense on approximately 76 percent of our residential and commercial margins 

during fiscal 2014 we completed 17 regulatory proceedings in our regulated distribution segment which should result in a 478 million increase in annual operating income 

in august 2012 we completed the sale of our regulated distribution operations in missouri illinois and iowa representing approximately 84000 customers and in april 2013 we completed the sale of our georgia regulated distribution operations representing approximately 64000 customers 

review of financial and operating results 

financial and operational highlights for our regulated distribution segment for the fiscal years ended september 30 2014  2013  and 2012  are presented below 



fiscal year ended september 30 2014  compared with fiscal year ended september 30 2013   

income from continuing operations for our regulated distribution segment increased 14 percent primarily due to a 953 million  increase in gross profit partially offset by a 538 million  increase in operating expenses the year to date increase in gross profit primarily reflects 

 the 538 million  increase in operating expenses which include operation and maintenance expense provision for doubtful accounts depreciation and amortization expense and taxes other than income was primarily due to the following 

 

 the  212 million  increase in income tax expense was primarily due to increased income from continuing operations before income taxes as well as an increase of approximately 70 million in our deferred tax asset valuation allowance due to the uncertainty in the companys ability to utilize certain charitable contribution carryforwards before they expire 

fiscal year ended september 30 2013  compared with fiscal year ended september 30 2012   

the 585 million periodoverperiod increase in regulated distribution gross profit primarily reflects the following 

  operating expenses which include operation and maintenance expense provision for doubtful accounts depreciation and amortization expense and taxes other than income increased by 199 million primarily due to the following 

 these increases were partially offset by 

 miscellaneous income increased 152 million primarily due to the absence of a 100 million onetime donation to a donor advised fund in fiscal 2012 the completion of a periodic review of our performancebased ratemaking pbr mechanism in our tennessee service area and the implementation of a new pbr program in our mississippi division during fiscal 2013 

interest charges decreased 123 million primarily from interest deferrals associated with our infrastructure spending activities in texas 

the following table shows our operating income from continuing operations by regulated distribution division in order of total rate base for the fiscal years ended september 30 2014  2013  and 2012  the presentation of our regulated distribution operating income is included for financial reporting purposes and may not be appropriate for ratemaking purposes 



regulated pipeline segment 

our regulated pipeline segment consists of the pipeline and storage operations of our atmos pipeline  texas division apt apt is one of the largest intrastate pipeline operations in texas with a heavy concentration in the established natural gasproducing areas of central northern and eastern texas extending into or near the major producing areas of the barnett shale the texas gulf coast and the delaware and val verde basins of west texas it transports natural gas to our midtex division transports natural gas for third parties and manages five underground storage reservoirs in texas we also provide ancillary services customary in the pipeline industry including parking and lending arrangements and sales 

our regulated pipeline segment is impacted by seasonal weather patterns competitive factors in the energy industry and economic conditions in apts service area natural gas prices do not directly impact the results of this segment as revenues are derived from the transportation of natural gas however natural gas prices and demand for natural gas could influence the level of drilling activity in the markets that we serve which may influence the level of throughput we may be able to transport on our pipeline further natural gas price differences between the various hubs that we serve determine the market value for transportation services between those geographic areas 

the results of atmos pipeline  texas division are also significantly impacted by the natural gas requirements of the midtex division because it is the primary transporter of natural gas for our midtex division 

finally as a regulated pipeline the operations of the atmos pipeline  texas division may be impacted by the timing of when costs and expenses are incurred and when these costs and expenses are recovered through its tariffs 

review of financial and operating results 

financial and operational highlights for our regulated pipeline segment for the fiscal years ended september 30 2014  2013  and 2012  are presented below 



fiscal year ended september 30 2014  compared with fiscal year ended september 30 2013 

net income for our regulated pipeline segment increased 26 percent primarily due to a 496 million  increase in gross profit the increase in gross profit primarily reflects a 385 million increase in rates from the gas reliability infrastructure program grip filings approved by the railroad commission of texas rrc in fiscal 2014 and 2013 coupled with a 47 million increase associated with higher transportation volumes and basis spreads driven by colder weather 

the atmos pipeline — texas rate case approved by the rrc on april 18 2011 contained an annual adjustment mechanism approved for a threeyear pilot program that adjusted regulated rates up or down by 75 percent of the difference between the nonregulated annual revenue of atmos pipeline — texas and a predefined base credit the annual adjustment mechanism expired on june 30 2013 on january 1 2014 the rrc approved the extension of the annual adjustment mechanism retroactive to july 1 2013 which will stay in place until the completion of the next atmos pipeline — texas rate case as a result of this decision during fiscal 2014 we recognized a 18 million increase in gross profit for the application of the annual adjustment mechanism for the period july 1 2013 to september 30 2013 

operating expenses increased 166 million  primarily due to the following 

• a 101 million increase in pipeline and rightofway maintenance activities 

• a 57 million increase in depreciation expense associated with increased capital investments 

• a 24 million increase due to higher employeerelated expenses partially offset by 

• a 67 million refund received as a result of the completion of a state use tax audit 

fiscal year ended september 30 2013  compared with fiscal year ended september 30 2012 

the 215 million increase in regulated pipeline gross profit compared to the prioryear period was primarily a result of the grip filings approved by the rrc during fiscal 2012 and 2013 during fiscal 2012 the rrc approved the atmos pipeline  texas grip filing with an annual operating income increase of 147 million effective april 2012 on may 7 2013 the rrc approved the atmos pipeline  texas grip filing with an annual operating income increase of 267 million that went into effect with bills rendered on and after may 7 2013 grip filings increased periodoverperiod gross profit by 197 million 

this increase was partially offset by a 105 million increase in operating expenses largely attributable to increased depreciation expense as a result of increased capital investments and increased levels of pipeline and rightofway maintenance activities to improve the safety and reliability of our system 

nonregulated segment 

our nonregulated operations are conducted through atmos energy holdings inc aeh a whollyowned subsidiary of atmos energy corporation and typically represents approximately five percent of our consolidated net income 

aehs primary business is to buy sell and deliver natural gas at competitive prices to approximately 1000 customers located primarily in the midwest and southeast areas of the united states aeh accomplishes this objective by aggregating and purchasing gas supply arranging transportation and storage logistics and effectively managing commodity price risk 

aeh also earns storage and transportation demand fees primarily from our regulated distribution operations in louisiana and kentucky these demand fees are subject to regulatory oversight and are renewed periodically 

our nonregulated activities are significantly influenced by competitive factors in the industry and general economic conditions therefore the margins earned from these activities are dependent upon our ability to attract and retain customers and to minimize the cost of buying selling and delivering natural gas to offer more competitive pricing to those customers 

further natural gas market conditions most notably the price of natural gas and the level of price volatility affect our nonregulated businesses natural gas prices and the level of volatility are influenced by a number of factors including but not limited to general economic conditions the demand for natural gas in different parts of the country the level of domestic natural gas production and the level of natural gas inventory levels 

natural gas prices can influence 

 natural gas price volatility can also influence our nonregulated business in the following ways 

 our nonregulated segment manages its exposure to natural gas commodity price risk through a combination of physical storage and financial instruments therefore results for this segment include unrealized gains or losses on its net physical gas position and the related financial instruments used to manage commodity price risk these margins fluctuate based upon changes in the spreads between the physical and forward natural gas prices the magnitude of the unrealized gains and losses is also contingent upon the levels of our net physical position at the end of the reporting period 

review of financial and operating results 

financial and operational highlights for our nonregulated segment for the fiscal years ended september 30 2014  2013  and 2012  are presented below 



  fiscal year ended september 30 2014  compared with fiscal year ended september 30 2013 

net income for our nonregulated segment increased 185 percent from the prior year due to higher gross profit and decreased operating expenses 

the 246 million  periodoverperiod increase in gross profit was primarily due to a 240 million  increase in realized margins the increase in realized margins reflects 

 operating expenses decreased 104 million  primarily due to lower legal expenses related to the dismissal of the kentucky litigation and the resolution of the tennessee business license tax matter which are discussed in note 10 to the financial statements 

fiscal year ended september 30 2013  compared with fiscal year ended september 30 2012 

gross profit increased 82 million for the year ended september 30 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 realized margins decreased 88 million primarily attributable to lower gas delivery margins consolidated sales volumes decreased two percent due to increased competition which reduced industrial and power generation sales the impact of lower sales volumes was compounded by a decrease in perunit margins from 116 cents per mcf to 100 cents per mcf this decrease was offset by an increase of 170 million in unrealized margins primarily due to the yearoveryear timing of realized margins on the settlement of hedged natural gas inventory positions 

operating expenses increased 75 million primarily due to increased litigation and software support costs partially offset by reduced employee costs 

miscellaneous income increased 13 million primarily due to a gain realized from the sale of a peaking power facility and related assets during the first quarter of fiscal 2013 

during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 we recorded a 53 million noncash charge to impair our natural gas gathering assets located in kentucky the charge reflected a reduction in the value of the project due to the current low natural gas price environment and management’s decision to focus aeh’s activities on its gas delivery storage and transportation services 

liquidity and capital resources 

the liquidity required to fund our working capital capital expenditures and other cash needs is provided from a variety of sources including internally generated funds and borrowings under our commercial paper program and bank credit facilities additionally we have various uncommitted trade credit lines with our gas suppliers that we utilize to purchase natural gas on a monthly basis finally from time to time we raise funds from the public debt and equity capital markets to fund our liquidity needs 

we regularly evaluate our funding strategy and capital structure to ensure that we i have sufficient liquidity for our shortterm and longterm needs in a costeffective manner and ii maintain a balanced capital structure with a debttocapitalization ratio in a target range of 50 to 55 percent we also evaluate the levels of committed borrowing capacity that we require we currently have over 1 billion of capacity from our shortterm facilities 

the following table presents our capitalization as of september 30 2014  and 2013  



total debt as a percentage of total capitalization including shortterm debt was 462 percent  and 522 percent  at september 30 2014  and 2013  

going forward we anticipate our capital spending will be more consistent with levels experienced during fiscal 2014 as we continue to invest in the safety and reliability of our distribution and transportation system we plan to continue to fund our growth and maintain a balanced capital structure primarily through the use of longterm debt securities and to a lesser extent equity 

to support our capital market activities we have filed a shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission sec that originally permitted us to issue a total of 175 billion in common stock andor debt securities on february18 2014 we completed the public offering of 9200000 shares of our common stock including the underwriters’ exercise of their overallotment option of 1200000 shares the offering was priced at 4400 and generated net proceeds of 3902 million which were used to repay shortterm debt outstanding under our commercial paper program to fund infrastructure spending primarily to enhance the safety and reliability of our system and for general corporate purposes on october 15 2014 we issued 500 million of 4125 30year unsecured senior notes which replaced on a longterm basis our 500 million 495 senior unsecured notes in october 2012 we entered into forward starting interest rate swaps to fix the treasury yield component associated with this issuance at 3129 which reduced the effective rate for this issuance to 4086 the net proceeds of approximately 494 million were used to repay our 500 million 495 senior unsecured notes at maturity on october 15 2014 after giving effect to these issuances 845 million of securities remained available for issuance under the shelf registration statement until march 28 2016 

on august 22 2014 we amended our 950 million credit facility to increase the committed loan amount from 950 million to 125 billion and extend the expiration date to august 22 2019 the amended facility retains the 250 million accordion feature which allows for an increase in the total committed loan amount to 15 billion 

 additionally we plan to issue new unsecured senior notes to replace 250 million and 450 million of unsecured senior notes that will mature in fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2019 during fiscal 2014 we entered into forward starting interest rate swaps to fix the treasury yield component associated with the fiscal 2019 issuances at 3857 in fiscal 2012 we entered into forward starting interest rate swaps to fix the treasury yield component associated with the fiscal 2017 issuances at 3367 

on january 11 2013 we issued 500 million of 415 30year unsecured senior notes which in effect replaced our 250 million 5125 10year unsecured senior notes we redeemed in august 2012 on a longterm basis the net proceeds of approximately 494 million were used to repay 260 million outstanding under our shortterm financing facility used to redeem our 5125 senior notes and to partially repay commercial paper borrowings and for general corporate purposes 

we believe the liquidity provided by our fiscal 2014 equity issuance senior notes and committed credit facilities combined with our operating cash flows will be sufficient to fund our working capital needs and capital expenditure program for fiscal year 2015  

cash flows 

our internally generated funds may change in the future due to a number of factors some of which we cannot control these factors include regulatory changes the price for our services the demand for such products and services margin requirements resulting from significant changes in commodity prices operational risks and other factors 

cash flows from operating investing and financing activities for the years ended september 30 2014  2013  and 2012  are presented below 



cash flows from operating activities 

yearoveryear changes in our operating cash flows primarily are attributable to changes in net income working capital changes particularly within our regulated distribution segment resulting from changes in the price of natural gas and the timing of customer collections payments for natural gas purchases and deferred gas cost recoveries 

fiscal year ended september 30 2014  compared with fiscal year ended september 30 2013   

for the fiscal year ended september 30 2014  we generated operating cash flow of 7400 million  from operating activities compared with 6131 million  in the prior year the yearoveryear increase  reflects higher operating results from colder weather and rate increases combined with the timing of customer collections and vendor payments 

fiscal year ended september 30 2013  compared with fiscal year ended september 30 2012   

for the fiscal year ended september 30 2013  we generated operating cash flow of 6131 million  from operating activities compared with 5869 million  in fiscal 2012  the yearoveryear increase reflects changes in working capital offset by a 105 million decrease in contributions made to our pension and postretirement plans in fiscal 2013 

cash flows from investing activities 

in recent years a substantial portion of our cash resources has been used to fund growth projects in our regulated operations our ongoing construction program and improvements to information technology systems our ongoing construction program enables us to enhance the safety and reliability of the systems used to provide regulated distribution services to our existing customer base expand our natural gas distribution services into new markets enhance the integrity of our pipelines 

and more recently expand our intrastate pipeline network over the last two fiscal years approximately 80 percent of our capital spending has been committed to improving the safety and reliability of our system 

in executing our regulatory strategy we focus our capital spending in jurisdictions that permit us to earn an adequate return timely on our investment without compromising the safety or reliability of our system currently our midtex louisiana mississippi and west texas regulated distribution divisions and our atmos pipeline–texas division have rate tariffs that provide the opportunity to include in their rate base approved capital costs on a periodic basis without being required to file a rate case 

 over the next five years we anticipate our capital spending will be more consistent with levels experienced during fiscal 2014 as we continue to invest in the safety and reliability of our distribution and transportation system where possible we will also continue to focus our capital spending in jurisdictions that permit us to earn an adequate return timely on our investment without compromising the safety or reliability of our system 

for the fiscal year ended september 30 2014  we incurred 8353 million  for capital expenditures compared with 8450 million  for the fiscal year ended september 30 2013  and 7329 million  for the fiscal year ended september 30 2012  

fiscal year ended september 30 2014  compared with fiscal year ended september 30 2013   

the 97 million decrease  in capital expenditures in fiscal 2014  compared to fiscal 2013  primarily reflects 

 fiscal year ended september 30 2013  compared with fiscal year ended september 30 2012 

the 1121 million increase in capital expenditures in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 primarily reflects spending incurred for the line w and line wx expansion projects and increased cathodic protection spending in our regulated pipeline segment 

cash flows from financing activities 

we generated a net 736 million  and 857 million  in cash from financing activities for fiscal years 2014 and 2013 in fiscal 2012 we used a net 448 million  of cash from financing activities our significant financing activities for the fiscal years ended september 30 2014  2013  and 2012  are summarized as follows 

2014   

during the fiscal year ended september 30 2014  our financing activities generated 736 million  of cash compared with 857 million  of cash generated in the prior year the decrease is primarily due to timing between shortterm debt borrowings and repayments during the current year partially offset by proceeds from the equity offering completed in february 2014 compared with proceeds generated from the issuance of longterm debt in fiscal 2013 

2013   

during the fiscal year ended september 30 2013 our financing activities generated 857 million of cash compared with 448 million of cash used in fiscal 2012 current year cash flows from financing activities were significantly influenced by the issuance of 500 million 415 30year unsecured senior notes on january 11 2013 we used a portion of the net cash proceeds of 4938 million to repay a 260 million shortterm financing facility executed in fiscal 2012 to settle for 666 million three treasury locks associated with the issuance and to reduce shortterm debt borrowings by 1672 million 

2012   

during the fiscal year ended september 30 2012 our financing activities used 448 million of cash primarily due to the payment of 2570 million associated with the early redemption of our 250 million 5125 senior notes that were scheduled to mature in january 2013 the repayment of our 250 million 5125 senior notes was financed using a 260 million shortterm loan additionally we repurchased 125 million of common stock under our 2011 share repurchase program 

the following table shows the number of shares issued for the fiscal years ended september 30 2014  2013  and 2012  

  



the increase  in the number of shares issued in fiscal 2014  compared with the number of shares issued in fiscal 2013  primarily reflects the equity offering completed in february 2014 as well as a higher number of performancebased awards issued in the current year as actual performance exceeded the target at september 30 2014 of the 87 million shares authorized for issuance from the ltip 845139  million shares remained available for the year ended september 30 2014 we canceled and retired 190134 shares attributable to federal income tax withholdings on equity awards which are not included in the table above 

the increased number of shares issued in fiscal 2013 compared with the number of shares issued in fiscal 2012 primarily reflects an increase in the amount of awards granted to a higher number of employees for the year ended september 30 2013 we canceled and retired 133449 shares attributable to federal income tax withholdings on equity awards which are not included in the table above 

credit facilities 

our shortterm borrowing requirements are affected by the seasonal nature of the natural gas business changes in the price of natural gas and the amount of natural gas we need to supply to meet our customers’ needs could significantly affect our borrowing requirements 

we finance our shortterm borrowing requirements through a combination of a 125 billion commercial paper program which is collateralized by our 125 billion unsecured credit facility as well as three additional committed revolving credit facilities and one uncommitted revolving credit facility with thirdparty lenders on august 22 2014 we amended the 950 million credit facility to increase the committed loan amount from 950 million to 125 billion and extended the expiration date to august 22 2019 the amended facility retains the 250 million accordion feature which allows for an increase in the total committed loan amount to 15 billion as a result we have approximately 13 billion of working capital funding we also use intercompany credit facilities to supplement the funding provided by these thirdparty committed credit facilities 

shelf registration 

on march 28 2013 we filed a registration statement with the securities and exchange commission to 

issue from time to time up to 175 billion in common stock andor debt securities available for issuance which replaced our 

registration statement that expired on march 31 2013 on february18 2014 we completed the public offering of 9200000 shares of our common stock including the underwriters’ exercise of their overallotment option of 1200000 shares the offering was priced at 4400 and generated net proceeds of 3902 million which were used to repay shortterm debt outstanding under our commercial paper program to fund infrastructure spending primarily to enhance the safety and reliability of our system and for general corporate purposes on october 15 2014 we issued 500 million of 4125 30year unsecured senior notes which replaced on a longterm basis our 500 million 495 senior unsecured notes the net proceeds of approximately 494 million were used to repay our 500 million 495 senior unsecured notes at maturity on october 15 2014 after giving effect to these issuances 845 million of securities remained available for issuance under the shelf registration statement until march 28 2016 

credit ratings 

our credit ratings directly affect our ability to obtain shortterm and longterm financing in addition to the cost of such financing in determining our credit ratings the rating agencies consider a number of quantitative factors including debt to total capitalization operating cash flow relative to outstanding debt operating cash flow coverage of interest and pension liabilities and funding status in addition the rating agencies consider qualitative factors such as consistency of our earnings over time the quality of our management and business strategy the risks associated with our regulated and nonregulated businesses and the regulatory environment in the states where we operate 

our debt is rated by three rating agencies standard  poor’s corporation sp moody’s investors service moody’s and fitch ratings ltd fitch our current debt ratings are all considered investment grade and are as follows 



on january 30 2014 moodys upgraded our senior unsecured debt rating to a2 from baa1 and our commercial paper rating to p1 from p2 with a rating outlook of stable on october 8 2013 sp upgraded our senior unsecured debt rating to a from bbb with a ratings outlook of stable citing an improved business risk profile from an increasing contribution of earnings from our regulated operations and focusing our nonregulated operations on our delivered gas business 

 a significant degradation in our operating performance or a significant reduction in our liquidity caused by more limited access to the private and public credit markets as a result of deteriorating global or national financial and credit conditions could trigger a negative change in our ratings outlook or even a reduction in our credit ratings by the three credit rating agencies this would mean more limited access to the private and public credit markets and an increase in the costs of such borrowings 

a credit rating is not a recommendation to buy sell or hold securities the highest investment grade credit rating is aaa for sp aaa for moody’s and aaa for fitch the lowest investment grade credit rating is bbb for sp baa3 for moody’s and bbb for fitch our credit ratings may be revised or withdrawn at any time by the rating agencies and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating there can be no assurance that a rating will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if in its judgment circumstances so warrant 

debt covenants 

we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants as of september 30 2014  our debt covenants are described in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements 

contractual obligations and commercial commitments 

the following table provides information about contractual obligations and commercial commitments at september 30 2014  



  

 

 

our regulated distribution segment maintains supply contracts with several vendors that generally cover a period of up to one year commitments for estimated base gas volumes are established under these contracts on a monthly basis at contractually negotiated prices commitments for incremental daily purchases are made as necessary during the month in accordance with the terms of individual contracts our midtex division also maintains a limited number of longterm supply contracts to ensure a reliable source of gas for our customers in its service area which obligate it to purchase specified volumes at market and fixed prices at september 30 2014  we were committed to purchase 497  bcf within one year and 698  bcf within one to three years under indexed contracts 

aeh has commitments to purchase physical quantities of natural gas under contracts indexed to the forward nymex strip or fixed price contracts at september 30 2014  aeh was committed to purchase 1115  bcf within one year 198  bcf within one to three years and 05  bcf after three years under indexed contracts aeh is committed to purchase 78  bcf within one year under fixed price contracts with prices ranging from 196  to 449  per mcf 

risk management activities 

as discussed above in our critical accounting policies we use financial instruments to mitigate commodity price risk and periodically to manage interest rate risk we conduct risk management activities through our regulated distribution and nonregulated segments in our regulated distribution segment we use a combination of physical storage fixed physical contracts and fixed financial contracts to reduce our exposure to unusually large winterperiod gas price increases in our nonregulated segments we manage our exposure to the risk of natural gas price changes and lock in our gross profit margin through a combination of storage and financial instruments including futures overthecounter and exchangetraded options and swap contracts with counterparties to the extent our inventory cost and actual sales and actual purchases do not correlate with the changes in the market indices we use in our hedges we could experience ineffectiveness or the hedges may no longer meet the accounting requirements for hedge accounting resulting in the financial instruments being treated as mark to market instruments through earnings 

we record our financial instruments as a component of risk management assets and liabilities which are classified as current or noncurrent based upon the anticipated settlement date of the underlying financial instrument substantially all of our financial instruments are valued using external market quotes and indices 

the following table shows the components of the change in fair value of our regulated distribution segment’s financial instruments for the fiscal year ended september 30 2014  in thousands 



the fair value of our regulated distribution segment’s financial instruments at september 30 2014  is presented below by time period and fair value source 



the following table shows the components of the change in fair value of our nonregulated segment’s financial instruments for the fiscal year ended september 30 2014  in thousands 



the fair value of our nonregulated segment’s financial instruments at september 30 2014  is presented below by time period and fair value source 

  



employee benefits programs 

an important element of our total compensation program and a significant component of our operation and maintenance expense is the offering of various benefits programs to our employees these programs include medical and dental insurance coverage and pension and postretirement programs 

medical and dental insurance 

we offer medical and dental insurance programs to substantially all of our employeeswe believe these programs are compliant with all current and future provisions that will be going into effect under the patient protection and affordable care act and consistent with other programs in our industry in recent years we have strived to actively manage our health care costs through the introduction of a wellness strategy that is focused on helping employees to identify health risks and to manage these risks through improved lifestyle choices 

over the last five fiscal years we have experienced annual medical and prescription inflation of approximately six percent for fiscal 2015  we anticipate the medical and prescription drug inflation rate will continue at approximately six percent primarily due to a stable population and no significant changes anticipated for high cost claimant activity 

net periodic pension and postretirement benefit costs 

for the fiscal year ended september 30 2014  our total net periodic pension and other benefits costs was 698 million  compared with 785 million and 692 million for the fiscal years ended september 30 2013  and 2012  these costs relating to 

our regulated distribution operations are recoverable through our distribution rates a portion of these costs is capitalized into our distribution rate base and the remaining costs are recorded as a component of operation and maintenance expense 

our fiscal 2014  costs were determined using a september 30 2013  measurement date at that date interest and corporate bond rates utilized to determine our discount rates were higher than the interest and corporate bond rates as of september 30 2012  the measurement date for our fiscal 2013 net periodic cost therefore we increased the discount rate used to measure our fiscal 2014 net periodic cost from 404 percent to 495 percent however we decreased the expected return on plan assets from 775 percent to 725 percent in the determination of our fiscal 2014 net periodic pension cost based upon expected market returns for our targeted asset allocation as a result our fiscal 2014 pension and postretirement medical costs were lower than in the prior year 

our fiscal 2013 costs were determined using a september 30 2012 measurement date at that date interest and corporate bond rates utilized to determine our discount rates were lower than the interest and corporate bond rates as of september 30 2011 the measurement date for our fiscal 2012 net periodic cost as a result of the lower interest and corporate bond rates we decreased the discount rate used to determine our fiscal 2013 pension and benefit costs to 404 percent our expected return on our pension plan assets was maintained at 775 percent due to historical experience and the current market projection of the target asset allocation as a result our fiscal 2013 pension and postretirement medical costs were higher than in fiscal 2012 

pension and postretirement plan funding 

generally our funding policy is to contribute annually an amount that will at least equal the minimum amount required to comply with the employee retirement income security act of 1974 erisa however additional voluntary contributions are made from time to time as considered necessary contributions are intended to provide not only for benefits attributed to service to date but also for those expected to be earned in the future 

in accordance with the pension protection act of 2006 ppa we determined the funded status of our plans as of january 1 2014 based on this valuation we were required to contribute cash of 271 million  327 million  and 465 million to our pension plans during fiscal 2014  2013  and 2012  the higher level of contributions experienced during fiscal 2013 and 2012 reflect lower discount rates each contribution increased the level of our plan assets to achieve a desirable ppa funding threshold 

we contributed 236 million  266 million  and 221 million to our postretirement benefits plans for the fiscal years ended september 30 2014  2013  and 2012 the contributions represent the portion of the postretirement costs we are responsible for under the terms of our plan and minimum funding required by state regulatory commissions 

outlook for fiscal 2015 and beyond 

as of september 30 2014  interest and corporate bond rates were lower than the rates as of september 30 2013 therefore we decreased the discount rate used to measure our fiscal 2015 net periodic cost from 495 percent to 443 percent we maintained our expected return on plan assets at 725 percent in the determination of our fiscal 2015 net periodic pension cost based upon expected market returns for our targeted asset allocation as a result of the net impact of changes in these and other assumptions we expect our fiscal 2015 net periodic pension cost to decrease by approximately 10 percent 

based upon current market conditions the current funded position of the plans and the funding requirements under the ppa we do not anticipate a minimum required contribution for fiscal 2015  however we may consider whether a voluntary contribution is prudent to maintain certain funding levels with respect to our postretirement medical plans we anticipate contributing between 20 million and 25 million during fiscal 2015  

actual changes in the fair market value of plan assets and differences between the actual and expected return on plan assets could have a material effect on the amount of pension costs ultimately recognized a 025 percent change in our discount rate would impact our pension and postretirement costs by approximately 24 million a 025 percent change in our expected rate of return would impact our pension and postretirement costs by approximately 12 million 

the projected liability future funding requirements and the amount of expense or income recognized for each of our pension and other postretirement benefit plans are subject to change depending on the actuarial value of plan assets and the determination of future benefit obligations as of each subsequent calculation date these amounts are impacted by actual investment returns changes in interest rates changes in the demographic composition of the participants in the plans and other actuarial assumptions 

in october 2014 the society of actuaries released its final report on mortality tables and the mortality improvement scale to reflect increasing life expectancies in the united states we anticipate utilizing the new mortality data in our next actuarial calculation date on september 30 2015 we are currently evaluating the impact the updated data will have on the valuation of our defined benefit and other postretirement benefits plans it is expected the use of this new data will increase total amount of liabilities reported on our balance sheet in future periods

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend

we are exposed to risks associated with commodity prices and interest rates commodity price risk is the potential loss that we may incur as a result of changes in the fair value of a particular instrument or commodity interestrate risk results from our portfolio of debt and equity instruments that we issue to provide financing and liquidity for our business activities 

we conduct risk management activities through both our regulated distribution and nonregulated segments in our regulated distribution segment we use a combination of physical storage fixed physical contracts and fixed financial contracts to protect us and our customers against unusually large winter period gas price increases in our nonregulated segment we manage our exposure to the risk of natural gas price changes and lock in our gross profit margin through a combination of storage and financial instruments including futures overthecounter and exchangetraded options and swap contracts with counterparties our risk management activities and related accounting treatment are described in further detail in note 12 to the consolidated financial statements additionally our earnings are affected by changes in shortterm interest rates as a result of our issuance of shortterm commercial paper and our other shortterm borrowings 

commodity price risk 

regulated distribution segment 

we purchase natural gas for our regulated distribution operations substantially all of the costs of gas purchased for regulated distribution operations are recovered from our customers through purchased gas cost adjustment mechanisms therefore our regulated distribution operations have limited commodity price risk exposure 

nonregulated segment 

our nonregulated segment is also exposed to risks associated with changes in the market price of natural gas for our nonregulated segment we use a sensitivity analysis to estimate commodity price risk for purposes of this analysis we estimate commodity price risk by applying a 050 change in the forward nymex price to our net open position including existing storage and related financial contracts at the end of each period based on aeh’s net open position including existing storage and related financial contracts at september 30 2014  of 01  bcf a 050 change in the forward nymex price would have had a 01 million impact on our consolidated net income 

changes in the difference between the indices used to mark to market our physical inventory gas daily and the related fairvalue hedge nymex can result in volatility in our reported net income but over time gains and losses on the sale of storage gas inventory will be offset by gains and losses on the fairvalue hedges based upon our net physical position at september 30 2014  and assuming our hedges would still qualify as highly effective a 050 change in the difference between the gas daily and nymex indices would impact our reported net income by approximately 28 million 

additionally these changes could cause us to recognize a risk management liability which would require us to place cash into an escrow account to collateralize this liability position this in turn would reduce the amount of cash we would have on hand to fund our working capital needs 

interest rate risk 

our earnings are exposed to changes in shortterm interest rates associated with our shortterm commercial paper program and other shortterm borrowings we use a sensitivity analysis to estimate our shortterm interest rate risk for purposes of this analysis we estimate our shortterm interest rate risk as the difference between our actual interest expense for the period and estimated interest expense for the period assuming a hypothetical average one percent increase in the interest rates associated with our shortterm borrowings had interest rates associated with our shortterm borrowings increased by an average of one percent our interest expense would have increased by approximately 25 million during 2014

overview and strategy 

atmos energy corporation headquartered in dallas texas and incorporated in texas and virginia is engaged primarily in the regulated natural gas distribution and transmission and storage businesses as well as other nonregulated natural gas businesses we deliver natural gas through regulated sales and transportation arrangements to over three million residential commercial public authority and industrial customers in eight states located primarily in the south which makes us one of the country’s largest naturalgasonly distributors based on number of customers we also operate one of the largest intrastate pipelines in texas based on miles of pipe 

over the last two fiscal years we have sold our natural gas distribution operations in four states to streamline our regulated operations on april 1 2013 we completed the divestiture of our natural gas distribution operations in georgia representing approximately 64000 customers and in august 2012 we completed the sale of our natural gas distribution operations in missouri illinois and iowa representing approximately 84000 customers 

through our nonregulated businesses we provide natural gas management marketing transportation and storage services to municipalities local gas distribution companies including certain of our natural gas distribution divisions and industrial customers principally in the midwest and southeast 

our overall strategy is to 

 we have delivered excellent shareholder value by growing our earnings and increasing our dividends for over 25 consecutive years over the last five years we have achieved growth by implementing rate designs that reduce or eliminate regulatory lag and separate the recovery of our approved margins from customer usage patterns in addition we have developed various commercial opportunities within our regulated transmission and storage operations 

our core values include focusing on our employees and customers while conducting our business with honesty and integrity we continue to strengthen our culture through ongoing communications with our employees and enhanced employee training 

operating segments 

we operate the company through the following three segments 

 

these operating segments are described in greater detail below 

natural gas distribution segment overview 

our natural gas distribution segment is comprised of our six regulated natural gas distribution divisions this segment represents approximately 65 percent of our consolidated net income the following table summarizes key information about these divisions presented in order of total rate base see note 16 in the consolidated financial statements for a description of the completed sales of our missouri illinois iowa and georgia service areas we operate in our service areas under terms of nonexclusive franchise agreements granted by the various cities and towns that we serve at september 30 2013 we held 998 franchises having terms generally ranging from five to 35 years a significant number of our franchises expire each year which require renewal prior to the end of their terms we believe that we will be able to renew our franchises as they expire 



our natural gas distribution business is a seasonal business gas sales to residential and commercial customers are greater during the winter months than during the remainder of the year the volumes of gas sales during the winter months will vary with the temperatures during these months historically this generally has resulted in higher operating revenues and net income during the period from october through march of each fiscal year and lower operating revenues and either lower net income or net losses during the period from april through september of each fiscal year however rate design changes implemented during the first quarter of fiscal 2013 in our midtex and west texas divisions should change this trend the rate design approved in these regulatory proceedings includes an increase to the customer base charge and a decrease in the consumption charge applied to customer usage the effect of this change in rate design allows our rates to be more closely aligned with the natural gas distribution industry standard rate design in addition we anticipate these divisions which represent approximately 50 percent of the operating income for our natural gas distribution segment will earn their operating income more ratably over the fiscal year as they are now less dependent on customer consumption 

revenues in this operating segment are established by regulatory authorities in the states in which we operate these rates are intended to be sufficient to cover the costs of conducting business and to provide a reasonable return on invested capital in addition we transport natural gas for others through our distribution system 

rates established by regulatory authorities often include cost adjustment mechanisms for costs that i are subject to significant price fluctuations compared to our other costs ii represent a large component of our cost of service and iii are generally outside our control 

purchased gas cost adjustment mechanisms represent a common form of cost adjustment mechanism purchased gas cost adjustment mechanisms provide natural gas distribution companies a method of recovering purchased gas costs on an ongoing basis without filing a rate case because they provide a dollarfordollar offset to increases or decreases in natural gas distribution gas costs therefore although substantially all of our natural gas distribution operating revenues fluctuate with the cost of gas that we purchase natural gas distribution gross profit which is defined as operating revenues less purchased gas cost is generally not affected by fluctuations in the cost of gas 

additionally some jurisdictions have introduced performancebased ratemaking adjustments to provide incentives to natural gas distribution companies to minimize purchased gas costs through improved storage management and use of financial instruments to lock in gas costs under the performancebased ratemaking adjustment purchased gas costs savings are shared between the utility and its customers 

regulatory authorities have approved weather normalization adjustments wna for approximately 97 percent of residential and commercial margins in our service areas as a part of our rates wna minimizes the effect of weather that is above or below normal by allowing us to increase customers’ bills to offset the effect of lower gas usage when weather is warmer than normal and decrease customers’ bills to offset the effect of higher gas usage when weather is colder than normal 

the following table provides a jurisdictional rate summary for our regulated operations this information is for regulatory purposes only and may not be representative of our actual financial position 



  



  

 

 our supply of natural gas is provided by a variety of suppliers including independent producers marketers and pipeline companies and withdrawals of gas from proprietary and contracted storage assets additionally the natural gas supply for our midtex division includes peaking and spot purchase agreements 

supply arrangements consist of both base load and swing supply peaking quantities and are contracted from our suppliers on a firm basis with various terms at market prices base load quantities are those that flow at a constant level throughout the month and swing supply quantities provide the flexibility to change daily quantities to match increases or decreases in requirements related to weather conditions 

except for local production purchases we select our natural gas suppliers through a competitive bidding process by periodically requesting proposals from suppliers that have demonstrated that they can provide reliable service we select these suppliers based on their ability to deliver gas supply to our designated firm pipeline receipt points at the lowest reasonable cost major suppliers during fiscal 2013  were anadarko energy services company bp energy company conocophillips company devon gas services lp enterprise products operating llc iberdrola energy services llc sequent energy management lp targa gas marketing llc tenaska marketing ventures texla energy management inc and atmos energy marketing llc our natural gas marketing subsidiary 

the combination of base load peaking and spot purchase agreements coupled with the withdrawal of gas held in storage allows us the flexibility to adjust to changes in weather which minimizes our need to enter into longterm firm commitments we estimate our peakday availability of natural gas supply to be approximately 44 bcf the peakday demand for our natural gas distribution operations in fiscal 2013  was on january 15 2013 when sales to customers reached approximately 31 bcf 

currently our natural gas distribution divisions except for our midtex division utilize 35 pipeline transportation companies both interstate and intrastate to transport our natural gas the pipeline transportation agreements are firm and many of them have “pipeline nonotice” storage service which provides for daily balancing between system requirements and nominated flowing supplies these agreements have been negotiated with the shortest term necessary while still maintaining our right of first refusal the natural gas supply for our midtex division is delivered primarily by our atmos pipeline — texas division 

to maintain our deliveries to high priority customers we have the ability and have exercised our right to curtail deliveries to certain customers under the terms of interruptible contracts or applicable state regulations or statutes our customers’ demand on our system is not necessarily indicative of our ability to meet current or anticipated market demands or immediate delivery requirements because of factors such as the physical limitations of gathering storage and transmission systems the duration and severity of cold weather the availability of gas reserves from our suppliers the ability to purchase additional supplies on a shortterm basis and actions by federal and state regulatory authorities curtailment rights provide us the flexibility to meet the humanneeds requirements of our customers on a firm basis priority allocations imposed by federal and state regulatory agencies as well as other factors beyond our control may affect our ability to meet the demands of our customers we anticipate no problems with obtaining additional gas supply as needed for our customers 

regulated transmission and storage segment overview 

our regulated transmission and storage segment consists of the regulated pipeline and storage operations of our atmos pipeline — texas division apt apt is one of the largest intrastate pipeline operations in texas with a heavy concentration in the established natural gasproducing areas of central northern and eastern texas extending into or near the major producing areas of the texas gulf coast and the delaware and val verde basins of west texas it transports natural gas to our midtex division transports natural gas for third parties and manages five underground storage reservoirs in texas we also provide ancillary services customary in the pipeline industry including parking and lending arrangements and sales of excess gas this segment represents approximately 30 percent of our consolidated operations 

gross profit earned from our midtex division and through certain other transportation and storage services is subject to traditional ratemaking governed by the rrc rates are updated through periodic formal rate proceedings and filings made under texas’ gas reliability infrastructure program grip grip allows us to include in our rate base annually approved capital costs incurred in the prior calendar year provided that we file a complete rate case at least once every five years atmos pipeline–texas’ existing regulatory mechanisms allow certain transportation and storage services to be provided under marketbased rates with minimal regulation 

nonregulated segment overview 

our nonregulated operations are conducted through atmos energy holdings inc aeh a whollyowned subsidiary of atmos energy corporation and represent approximately five percent of our consolidated net income 

aehs primary business is to buy sell and deliver natural gas at competitive prices to approximately 1000 customers located primarily in the midwest and southeast areas of the united states aeh accomplishes this objective by aggregating and purchasing gas supply arranging transportation and storage logistics and effectively managing commodity price risk 

aeh also earns storage and transportation demand fees primarily from our regulated natural gas distribution operations in louisiana and kentucky these demand fees are subject to regulatory oversight and are renewed periodically 

ratemaking activity 

overview 

the method of determining regulated rates varies among the states in which our regulated businesses operate the regulatory authorities have the responsibility of ensuring that utilities in their jurisdictions operate in the best interests of customers while providing utility companies the opportunity to earn a reasonable return on their investment generally each regulatory authority reviews rate requests and establishes a rate structure intended to generate revenue sufficient to cover the costs of conducting business and to provide a reasonable return on invested capital 

our rate strategy focuses on reducing or eliminating regulatory lag obtaining adequate returns and providing stable predictable margins which benefit both our customers and the company as a result of our ratemaking efforts in recent years atmos energy has 

 although substantial progress has been made in recent years by improving rate design across atmos energy’s operating areas we will continue to seek improvements in rate design to address cost variations that are related to passthrough energy costs beyond our control further potential changes in federal energy policy and adverse economic conditions will necessitate continued vigilance by the company and our regulators in meeting the challenges presented by these external factors 

recent ratemaking activity 

substantially all of our regulated revenues in the fiscal years ended september 30 2013  2012  and 2011  were derived from sales at rates set by or subject to approval by local or state authorities net operating income increases resulting from ratemaking activity totaling 981 million  307 million  and 724 million  became effective in fiscal 2013  2012  and 2011  as summarized below 



additionally the following ratemaking efforts were initiated during fiscal 2013  but had not been completed as of september 30 2013  



  

 

  

our recent ratemaking activity is discussed in greater detail below 

infrastructure programs 

as discussed above in “natural gas distribution segment overview” and “regulated transmission and storage segment overview” infrastructure programs such as grip allow our regulated divisions the opportunity to include in their rate base annually approved capital costs incurred in the prior calendar year we currently have infrastructure programs in texas kansas kentucky and virginia the following table summarizes our infrastructure program filings with effective dates during the fiscal years ended september 30 2013  2012  and 2011  



  

 

annual rate filing mechanisms 

as an instrument to reduce regulatory lag annual rate filing mechanisms allow us to refresh our rates on a periodic basis without filing a formal rate case however these filings still involve discovery by the appropriate regulatory authorities prior to the final determination of rates under these mechanisms we currently have annual rate filing mechanisms in our louisiana and mississippi divisions and in a portion of our texas divisions these mechanisms are referred to as dallas annual rate review darr and rate review mechanisms rrm in our midtex division stable rate filings in the mississippi division and the rate stabilization clause in the louisiana division the following table summarizes filings made under our various annual rate filing mechanisms 



 

from 2008 through fiscal 2011 the midtex division had an annual rate review mechanism rrm for approximately 80 percent of its customers which allowed it to update rates annually without the necessity of filing a general rate case in fiscal 2013 a new rrm was approved for these customers 

since june 2011 the midtex division has operated under a dallas annual rate review mechanism darr that provides the ability for it to annually update rates for its city of dallas customers without the necessity of filing a general rate case the first rates were implemented under the darr in june 2012 

during fiscal 2011 the rrc’s division of public safety issued a new rule requiring natural gas distribution companies with operations in texas to develop and implement a riskbased program for the renewal or replacement of distribution facilities including steel service lines the rule allows for the deferral of all expenses associated with capital expenditures incurred pursuant to this rule until the expenses are included in rates including the recording of interest on the deferred expenses 

rate case filings 

a rate case is a formal request from atmos energy to a regulatory authority to increase rates that are charged to customers rate cases may also be initiated when the regulatory authorities request us to justify our rates this process is referred to as a “show cause” action adequate rates are intended to provide for recovery of the company’s costs as well as a fair rate of return to our shareholders and ensure that we continue to safely deliver reliable reasonably priced natural gas service to our customers the following table summarizes our recent rate cases 



  

other ratemaking activity 

the following table summarizes other ratemaking activity during the fiscal years ended september 30 2013  2012  and 2011  



  

 other regulation 

each of our natural gas distribution divisions and our regulated transmission and storage division is regulated by various state or local public utility authorities we are also subject to regulation by the united states department of transportation with respect to safety requirements in the operation and maintenance of our transmission and distribution facilities in addition our distribution operations are also subject to various state and federal laws regulating environmental matters from time to time 

we receive inquiries regarding various environmental matters we believe that our properties and operations substantially comply with and are operated in substantial conformity with applicable safety and environmental statutes and regulations there are no administrative or judicial proceedings arising under environmental quality statutes pending or known to be contemplated by governmental agencies which would have a material adverse effect on us or our operations our environmental claims have arisen primarily from former manufactured gas plant sites 

the federal energy regulatory commission ferc allows pursuant to section 311 of the natural gas policy act gas transportation services through our atmos pipeline—texas assets “on behalf of” interstate pipelines or local distribution companies served by interstate pipelines without subjecting these assets to the jurisdiction of the ferc additionally the ferc has regulatory authority over the sale of natural gas in the wholesale gas market and the use and release of interstate pipeline and storage capacity the ferc also has authority to detect and prevent market manipulation and to enforce compliance with ferc’s other rules policies and orders by companies engaged in the sale purchase transportation or storage of natural gas in interstate commerce we have taken what we believe are the necessary and appropriate steps to comply with these regulations 

competition 

although our natural gas distribution operations are not currently in significant direct competition with any other distributors of natural gas to residential and commercial customers within our service areas we do compete with other natural gas suppliers and suppliers of alternative fuels for sales to industrial customers we compete in all aspects of our business with alternative energy sources including in particular electricity electric utilities offer electricity as a rival energy source and compete for the space heating water heating and cooking markets promotional incentives improved equipment efficiencies and promotional rates all contribute to the acceptability of electrical equipment the principal means to compete against alternative fuels is lower prices and natural gas historically has maintained its price advantage in the residential commercial and industrial markets 

our regulated transmission and storage operations historically have faced limited competition from other existing intrastate pipelines and gas marketers seeking to provide or arrange transportation storage and other services for customers however in the last few years several new pipelines have been completed which has increased the level of competition in this segment of our business 

within our nonregulated operations aem competes with other natural gas marketers to provide natural gas management and other related services primarily to smaller customers requiring higher levels of balancing scheduling and other related management services aem has experienced increased competition in recent years primarily from investment banks and major integrated oil and natural gas companies who offer lower cost basic services the increased competition has reduced margins most notably on its highvolume accounts 

employees 

at september 30 2013  we had 4720 employees consisting of 4611 employees in our regulated operations and 109 employees in our nonregulated operations

risk factors 

tableend

our financial and operating results are subject to a number of risk factors many of which are not within our control although we have tried to discuss key risk factors below please be aware that other or new risks may prove to be important in the future investors should carefully consider the following discussion of risk factors as well as other information appearing in this report these factors include the following 

the company is dependent on continued access to the credit and capital markets to execute our business strategy 

our longterm debt is currently rated as “investment grade” by standard  poor’s corporation moody’s investors services inc and fitch ratings ltd similar to most companies we rely upon access to both shortterm and longterm credit and capital markets to satisfy our liquidity requirements if adverse credit conditions were to cause a significant limitation on our access to the private and public capital markets we could see a reduction in our liquidity a significant reduction in our liquidity could in turn trigger a negative change in our ratings outlook or even a reduction in our credit ratings by one or more of the three credit rating agencies such a downgrade could further limit our access to private credit andor public capital markets and increase our costs of borrowing 

further if our credit ratings were downgraded we could be required to provide additional liquidity to our nonregulated segment because the commodity financial instrument markets could become unavailable to us our nonregulated segment depends primarily upon an intercompany lending facility between aeh and atmos energy to finance its working capital needs supplemented by two small credit facilities with outside lenders our ability to provide this liquidity to aeh for our nonregulated operations is limited by the terms of the lending arrangement with aeh which is subject to annual approval by one state regulatory commission 

while we believe we can meet our capital requirements from our operations and the sources of financing available to us we can provide no assurance that we will continue to be able to do so in the future especially if the market price of natural gas increases significantly in the near term the future effects on our business liquidity and financial results of a deterioration of current conditions in the credit and capital markets could be material and adverse to us both in the ways described above or in other ways that we do not currently anticipate 

we are subject to state and local regulations that affect our operations and financial results 

our natural gas distribution and regulated transmission and storage segments are subject to regulatory oversight from various state and local regulatory authorities in the eight states that we serve therefore our returns are continuously monitored and are subject to challenge for their reasonableness by the appropriate regulatory authorities or other thirdparty intervenors in the normal course of business a regulated entity often needs to place assets in service and establish historical test periods before rate cases that seek to adjust our allowed returns to recover that investment can be filed further the regulatory review process can be lengthy because of this process we suffer the negative financial effects of having placed assets in service without the benefit of rate relief which is commonly referred to as “regulatory lag” the regulatory process also involves the risk that regulatory authorities may i review our purchases of natural gas and adjust the amount of our gas costs that we pass through to our customers or ii limit the costs we may have incurred from our cost of service that can be recovered from customers 

the continuation of recent economic conditions could adversely affect our customers and negatively impact our financial results 

the slowdown in the us economy in the last several years together with increased mortgage defaults and significant decreases in the values of homes and investment assets has adversely affected the financial resources of many domestic households it is unclear whether the administrative and legislative responses to these conditions will be successful in continuing to improve economic conditions including the continued lowering of current high unemployment rates across the us as a result our customers may seek to use even less gas and it may become more difficult for them to pay their gas bills this may slow collections and lead to higher than normal levels of accounts receivable this in turn could increase our financing requirements and bad debt expense additionally our industrial customers may seek alternative energy sources which could result in lower sales volumes 

inflation and increased gas costs could adversely impact our customer base and customer collections and increase our level of indebtedness 

inflation has caused increases in some of our operating expenses and has required assets to be replaced at higher costs we have a process in place to continually review the adequacy of our natural gas distribution gas rates in relation to the increasing cost of providing service and the inherent regulatory lag in adjusting those gas rates historically we have been able to budget and control operating expenses and investments within the amounts authorized to be collected in rates and intend to continue to do so however the ability to control expenses is an important factor that could impact future financial results 

rapid increases in the costs of purchased gas would cause us to experience a significant increase in shortterm debt we must pay suppliers for gas when it is purchased which can be significantly in advance of when these costs may be recovered through the collection of monthly customer bills for gas delivered increases in purchased gas costs also slow our natural gas distribution collection efforts as customers are more likely to delay the payment of their gas bills leading to higher than normal accounts receivable this could result in higher shortterm debt levels greater collection efforts and increased bad debt expense 

we are exposed to market risks that are beyond our control which could adversely affect our financial results and capital requirements 

we are subject to market risks beyond our control including market liquidity commodity price volatility caused by market supply and demand dynamics and counterparty creditworthiness and interest rate risk our regulated operations are generally insulated from commodity price risk through its purchased gas cost mechanisms with respect to interest rate risk we have been operating in a relatively low interestrate environment in recent years compared to historical norms for both short and longterm interest rates however increases in interest rates could adversely affect our future financial results 

although our nonregulated operations represent approximately five percent of our consolidated results commodity price volatility experienced in this business segment could lead to some volatility in our earnings our nonregulated segment manages margins and limits risk exposure on the sale of natural gas inventory or the offsetting fixedprice purchase or sale commitments for physical quantities of natural gas through the use of a variety of financial instruments however contractual limitations could adversely affect our ability to withdraw gas from storage which could cause us to purchase gas at spot prices in a rising market to obtain sufficient volumes to fulfill customer contracts we could also realize financial losses on our efforts to limit risk as a result of volatility in the market prices of the underlying commodities or if a counterparty fails to perform under a contract any significant tightening of the credit markets could cause more of our counterparties to fail to perform than expected in addition adverse changes in the creditworthiness of our counterparties could limit the level of trading activities with these parties and increase the risk that these parties may not perform under a contract these circumstances could also increase our capital requirements 

although we manage our business to maintain no open positions related to our physical storage there are times when limited net open positions may occur on a shortterm basis net open positions may increase volatility in our financial condition or results of operations if market prices move in a significantly favorable or unfavorable manner before the open positions can be closed the determination of our net open position as of the end of any particular trading day requires us to make assumptions as to future circumstances including the use of gas by our customers in relation to our anticipated storage and market positions because the price risk associated with any net open position at the end of such day may increase if the assumptions are not realized we review these assumptions as part of our daily monitoring activities further if the local physical markets do not move consistently with the nymex futures market upon which most of our commodity derivative financial instruments are valued we could experience increased volatility in the financial results of our nonregulated segment 

the concentration of our distribution pipeline and storage operations in the state of texas exposes our operations and financial results to economic conditions and regulatory decisions in texas 

over 50 percent of our natural gas distribution customers and most of our pipeline and storage assets and operations are located in the state of texas this concentration of our business in texas means that our operations and financial results may be significantly affected by changes in the texas economy in general and regulatory decisions by state and local regulatory authorities in texas 

our operations are subject to increased competition  

in residential and commercial customer markets our natural gas distribution operations compete with other energy products such as electricity and propane our primary product competition is with electricity for heating water heating and cooking increases in the price of natural gas could negatively impact our competitive position by decreasing the price benefits of natural gas to the consumer this could adversely impact our business if as a result our customer growth slows reducing our ability to make capital expenditures or if our customers further conserve their use of gas resulting in reduced gas purchases and customer billings 

in the case of industrial customers such as manufacturing plants adverse economic conditions including higher gas costs could cause these customers to use alternative sources of energy such as electricity or bypass our systems in favor of special competitive contracts with lower perunit costs our regulated transmission and storage operations historically have faced limited competition from other existing intrastate pipelines and gas marketers seeking to provide or arrange transportation storage and other services for customers however in the last few years several new pipelines have been completed which has increased the level of competition in this segment of our business 

finally within our nonregulated operations aem competes with other natural gas marketers to provide natural gas management and other related services primarily to smaller customers requiring higher levels of balancing scheduling and other related management services aem has experienced increased competition in recent years from competitors who offer lower cost basic services 

adverse weather conditions could affect our operations or financial results 

we have weathernormalized rates for over 95 percent of our residential and commercial meters in our natural gas distribution business which substantially mitigates the adverse effects of warmerthannormal weather for meters in those service areas however there is no assurance that we will continue to receive such regulatory protection from adverse weather in our rates in the future the loss of such weathernormalized rates could have an adverse effect on our operations and financial results in addition our natural gas distribution and regulated transmission and storage operating results may continue to vary somewhat with the actual temperatures during the winter heating season sustained cold weather could adversely affect our nonregulated operations as we may be required to purchase gas at spot rates in a rising market to obtain sufficient volumes to fulfill some customer contracts additionally sustained cold weather could challenge our ability to adequately meet customer demand in our natural gas distribution and regulated transmission and storage operations 

our growth in the future may be limited by the nature of our business which requires extensive capital spending 

we must continually build additional capacity in our natural gas distribution system to enable us to serve any growth in the number of our customers the cost of adding this capacity may be affected by a number of factors including the general state of the economy and weather in addition although we should ultimately recover the cost of the expenditures through rates we must make significant capital expenditures to comply with rules issued by the rrc’s division of public safety that require natural gas distribution companies to develop and implement riskbased programs for the renewal or replacement of distribution facilities including steel service lines our cash flows from operations generally are sufficient to supply funding for all our capital expenditures including the financing of the costs of new construction along with capital expenditures necessary to maintain our existing natural gas system due to the timing of these cash flows and capital expenditures we often must fund at least a portion of these costs through borrowing funds from thirdparty lenders the cost and availability of which is dependent on the liquidity of the credit markets interest rates and other market conditions this in turn may limit our ability to connect new customers to our system due to constraints on the amount of funds we can invest in our infrastructure 

the costs of providing health care benefits pension and postretirement health care benefits and related funding requirements may increase substantially 

we provide health care benefits and a cashbalance pension plan and postretirement health care benefits to eligible fulltime employees the costs of providing health care benefits to our employees could significantly increase over time due to rapidly increasing health care inflation the impact of the health care reform act of 2010 hcr and any future legislative changes related to the provision of health care benefits although the hcr is not expected to have a direct material impact when a number of its more significant provisions become effective in 2014 the impact of costs incurred by the insurance industry arising from the implementation of hcr on the company are difficult to measure at this time 

the costs of providing a cashbalance pension plan and postretirement health care benefits to eligible fulltime employees and related funding requirements could be influenced by changes in the market value of the assets funding our pension and postretirement health care plans any significant declines in the value of these investments could increase the costs of our 

pension and postretirement health care plans and related funding requirements in the future further our costs of providing such benefits and related funding requirements are also subject to a number of factors including i changing demographics including longer life expectancy of beneficiaries and an expected increase in the number of eligible former employees over the next five to ten years and ii various actuarial calculations and assumptions which may differ materially from actual results due primarily to changing market and economic conditions and higher or lower withdrawal rates 

the costs to the company of providing these benefits and related funding requirements could also increase materially in the future depending on the timing of the recovery if any of such costs through our rates 

we may experience increased federal state and local regulation of the safety of our operations 

we are committed to constantly monitoring and maintaining our pipeline and distribution system to ensure that natural gas is delivered safely reliably and efficiently through our network of more than 72000 miles of pipeline and distribution lines the pipeline replacement programs currently underway in several of our divisions typify the preventive maintenance and continual renewal that we perform on our natural gas distribution system in the eight states in which we currently operate the safety and protection of the public our customers and our employees is our top priority however due primarily to the unfortunate pipeline incident in california in 2010 natural gas distribution and pipeline companies are facing increasing federal state and local oversight of the safety of their operations although we believe these costs should be ultimately recoverable through our rates the costs of complying with such increased regulations may have at least a shortterm adverse impact on our operating costs and financial results 

some of our operations are subject to increased federal regulatory oversight that could affect our operations and financial results 

ferc has regulatory authority over some of our operations including sales of natural gas in the wholesale gas market and the use and release of interstate pipeline and storage capacity ferc has adopted rules designed to prevent market power abuse and market manipulation and to promote compliance with ferc’s other rules policies and orders by companies engaged in the sale purchase transportation or storage of natural gas in interstate commerce these rules carry increased penalties for violations although we have taken steps to structure current and future transactions to comply with applicable current ferc regulations changes in ferc regulations or their interpretation by ferc or additional regulations issued by ferc in the future could also adversely affect our business financial condition or financial results 

we are subject to environmental regulations which could adversely affect our operations or financial results 

we are subject to laws regulations and other legal requirements enacted or adopted by federal state and local governmental authorities relating to protection of the environment and health and safety matters including those that govern discharges of substances into the air and water the management and disposal of hazardous substances and waste the cleanup of contaminated sites groundwater quality and availability plant and wildlife protection as well as work practices related to employee health and safety environmental legislation also requires that our facilities sites and other properties associated with our operations be operated maintained abandoned and reclaimed to the satisfaction of applicable regulatory authorities failure to comply with these laws regulations permits and licenses may expose us to fines penalties or interruptions in our operations that could be significant to our financial results in addition existing environmental regulations may be revised or our operations may become subject to new regulations 

our business may be subject in the future to additional regulatory and financial risks associated with global warming and climate change 

there have been a number of federal and state legislative and regulatory initiatives proposed in recent years in an attempt to control or limit the effects of global warming and overall climate change including greenhouse gas emissions such as carbon dioxide the adoption of this type of legislation by congress or similar legislation by states or the adoption of related regulations by federal or state governments mandating a substantial reduction in greenhouse gas emissions in the future could have farreaching and significant impacts on the energy industry such new legislation or regulations could result in increased compliance costs for us or additional operating restrictions on our business affect the demand for natural gas or impact the prices we charge to our customers at this time we cannot predict the potential impact of such laws or regulations that may be adopted on our future business financial condition or financial results 

distributing transporting and storing natural gas involve risks that may result in accidents and additional operating costs 

our natural gas distribution and pipeline and storage businesses involve a number of hazards and operating risks that cannot be completely avoided such as leaks accidents and operational problems which could cause loss of human life as well 

as substantial financial losses resulting from property damage damage to the environment and to our operations we maintain liability and property insurance coverage in place for many of these hazards and risks however because some of our pipeline storage and distribution facilities are near or are in populated areas any loss of human life or adverse financial results resulting from such events could be large if these events were not fully covered by insurance our operations or financial results could be adversely affected 

cyberattacks or acts of cyberterrorism could disrupt our business operations and information technology systems or result in the loss or exposure of confidential or sensitive customer employee or company information 

our business operations and information technology systems may be vulnerable to an attack by individuals or organizations intending to disrupt our business operations and information technology systems we use such systems to manage our natural gas distribution and intrastate pipeline operations and other business processes disruption of those systems could adversely impact our ability to safely deliver natural gas to our customers operate our pipeline systems or serve our customers timely accordingly if such an attack or act of terrorism were to occur our operations and financial results could be adversely affected in addition we use our information technology systems to protect confidential or sensitive customer employee and company information developed and maintained in the normal course of our business any attack on such systems that would result in the unauthorized release of customer employee or other confidential or sensitive data could have a material adverse effect on our business reputation increase our costs and expose us to additional material legal claims and liability even though we have insurance coverage in place for many of these cyberrelated risks if such an attack or act of terrorism were to occur our operations and financial results could be adversely affected 

natural disasters terrorist activities or other significant events could adversely affect our operations or financial results 

natural disasters are always a threat to our assets and operations in addition the threat of terrorist activities could lead to increased economic instability and volatility in the price of natural gas that could affect our operations also companies in our industry may face a heightened risk of exposure to actual acts of terrorism which could subject our operations to increased risks as a result the availability of insurance covering such risks may be more limited which could increase the risk that an event could adversely affect our operations or financial results

critical accounting policies 

our consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and the related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ from estimates 

our significant accounting policies are discussed in note 2 to our consolidated financial statements the accounting policies discussed below are both important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and require 

management to make difficult subjective or complex accounting estimates accordingly these critical accounting policies are reviewed periodically by the audit committee of the board of directors 









results of operations 

overview 

atmos energy corporation is involved in the distribution marketing and transportation of natural gas accordingly our results of operations are impacted by the demand for natural gas particularly during the winter heating season and the volatility of the natural gas markets historically this has generally resulted in higher operating revenues and net income during the period from october through march of each fiscal year and lower operating revenues and either lower net income or net losses during the period from april through september of each fiscal year as a result of the seasonality of the natural gas industry our second fiscal quarter has historically been our most critical earnings quarter with an average of approximately 54 percent of our consolidated net income having been earned in the second quarter during the three most recently completed fiscal years however we believe rate design changes implemented during the first quarter of fiscal 2013 in our midtex and west texas divisions should continue to cause this pattern to change the rate design approved in these regulatory proceedings includes an increase to the customer base charge and a decrease in the consumption charge applied to customer usage the effect of this change in rate design should result in a more equal distribution of operating income earned over the fiscal year for approximately 50 percent of our natural gas distribution segment 

additionally the seasonality of our business impacts our working capital differently at various times during the year typically our accounts receivable accounts payable and shortterm debt balances peak by the end of january and then start to decline as customers begin to pay their winter heating bills gas stored underground particularly in our natural gas distribution segment typically peaks in november and declines as we utilize storage gas to serve our customers 

during fiscal 2013  we earned 2432 million or 264 per diluted share which represents a twelve percent increase in net income and diluted net income per share over fiscal 2012  primarily due to recent improvements in rate designs in our natural gas distribution and regulated transmission and storage segments combined with a two percent yearoveryear increase in consolidated natural gas distribution throughput due to colder weather 

we completed the sale of our georgia natural gas distribution operations on april 1 2013 to liberty energy georgia corp an affiliate of algonquin power  utilities corp for a cash price of approximately 153 million pursuant to a purchase agreement executed on august 8 2012 in connection with the sale we recognized a net of tax gain of 53 million accordingly the results of operations for this service area are shown in discontinued operations for all periods presented prioryear results also reflect our illinois iowa and missouri service areas in discontinued operations the sale of these three service areas was completed in august 2012 

we also took several steps during the year ended september 30 2013 to further strengthen our balance sheet and borrowing capability in december 2012 we amended our 750 million revolving credit agreement primarily to i increase our borrowing capacity to 950 million while retaining the accordion feature that would allow an increase in borrowing capacity up to 12 billion and ii to permit sameday funding on base rate loans in august 2013 we amended our revolving credit agreement primarily to increase the term through august 2018 we also terminated atmos energy marketing’s 200 million committed and secured credit facility and replaced this facility with two 25 million 364day bilateral facilities which should result in a decrease in external credit expense incurred in our nonregulated operations after giving effect to these changes we have over 1 billion of working capital funding from four committed revolving credit facilities and one noncommitted revolving credit facility 

on january 11 2013 we issued 500 million of 415 30year unsecured senior notes which replaced on a longterm basis our 250 million 5125 10year unsecured senior notes we redeemed in august 2012 the net proceeds of approximately 494 million were used to repay 260 million outstanding under the shortterm financing facility used to redeem our 5125 senior notes and to partially repay commercial paper borrowings and for general corporate purposes 

consolidated results 

the following table presents our consolidated financial highlights for the fiscal years ended september 30 2013  2012  and 2011  

  

regulated operations contributed 95 percent  97 percent  and 104 percent  to our consolidated net income from continuing operations for fiscal years 2013  2012  and 2011  our consolidated net income during the last three fiscal years was earned across our business segments as follows 



the following table segregates our consolidated net income and diluted earnings per share between our regulated and nonregulated operations 



we reported net income of 2432 million  or 264 per diluted share for the year ended september 30 2013  compared with net income of 2167 million  or 237 per diluted share in the prior year income from continuing operations was 2307 million  or 250 per diluted share compared with 1922 million  or 210 per diluted share in the prioryear period income from discontinued operations was 125 million  or 014 per diluted share for the year which includes the gain on sale of substantially all our assets in georgia of 53 million compared with 245 million  or 027 per diluted share in the prior year unrealized gains in our nonregulated operations during the current year increased net income by 53 million or 005 per diluted share compared with net losses recorded in the prior year of 50 million or 005 per diluted share additionally net income in both periods was impacted by nonrecurring items in fiscal 2012 net income included the net positive impact of several onetime items totaling 103 million or 011 per diluted share related to the pretax items which are discussed in further detail below in fiscal 2013 net income includes an 82 million 53 million net of tax or 006 per diluted share favorable impact related to the gain recorded in association with the april 1 2013 completion of the sale of our georgia assets 

we reported net income of 2167 million  or 237 per diluted share for the year ended september 30 2012  compared with net income of 2076 million  or 227 per diluted share in fiscal 2011 income from continuing operations was 1922 million  or 210 per diluted share compared with 1896 million  or 207 per diluted share in fiscal 2011 income from discontinued operations was 245 million  or 027 per diluted share for the year which includes the gain on sale of substantially all our assets in missouri illinois and iowa of 63 million compared with 180 million  or 020 per diluted share in fiscal 2011 unrealized losses in our nonregulated operations during fiscal 2012 reduced net income by 50 million or 005 per diluted share compared with net losses recorded in fiscal 2011 of 66 million or 007 per diluted share additionally net income in both periods was impacted by nonrecurring items in fiscal 2011 net income included the net positive impact of several onetime items totaling 32 million or 003 per diluted share related to pretax items in fiscal 2012 net income included the net positive impact of several onetime items totaling 103 million or 011 per diluted share related to the following amounts 

 see the following discussion regarding the results of operations for each of our business operating segments 

natural gas distribution segment 

the primary factors that impact the results of our natural gas distribution operations are our ability to earn our authorized rates of return the cost of natural gas competitive factors in the energy industry and economic conditions in our service areas 

our ability to earn our authorized rates is based primarily on our ability to improve the rate design in our various ratemaking jurisdictions by reducing or eliminating regulatory lag and ultimately separating the recovery of our approved margins from customer usage patterns improving rate design is a longterm process and is further complicated by the fact that 

we operate in multiple rate jurisdictions the “ratemaking activity” section of this form 10k describes our current rate strategy progress towards implementing that strategy and recent ratemaking initiatives in more detail 

we are generally able to pass the cost of gas through to our customers without markup under purchased gas cost adjustment mechanisms therefore the cost of gas typically does not have an impact on our gross profit as increases in the cost of gas are offset by a corresponding increase in revenues accordingly we believe gross profit is a better indicator of our financial performance than revenues however gross profit in our texas and mississippi service areas include franchise fees and gross receipt taxes which are calculated as a percentage of revenue inclusive of gas costs therefore the amount of these taxes included in revenue is influenced by the cost of gas and the level of gas sales volumes we record the tax expense as a component of taxes other than income although changes in revenue related taxes arising from changes in gas costs affect gross profit over time the impact is offset within operating income 

although the cost of gas typically does not have a direct impact on our gross profit higher gas costs may adversely impact our accounts receivable collections resulting in higher bad debt expense and may require us to increase borrowings under our credit facilities resulting in higher interest expense in addition higher gas costs as well as competitive factors in the industry and general economic conditions may cause customers to conserve or in the case of industrial consumers to use alternative energy sources however gas cost risk has been mitigated in recent years through improvements in rate design that allow us to collect from our customers the gas cost portion of our bad debt expense on approximately 75 percent of our residential and commercial margins 

we completed the sale of our georgia natural gas distribution operations on april 1 2013 to liberty energy georgia corp an affiliate of algonquin power  utilities corp for a cash price of approximately 153 million in connection with the sale we recognized a net of tax gain of 53 million on august 1 2012 we completed the sale of substantially all of our natural gas distribution operations in missouri illinois and iowa 

during fiscal 2013 we completed 13 regulatory proceedings which should result in a 714 million increase in annual operating income the majority of this rate increase related to our midtex division where rates became effective january 1 2013 the rate design approved in our midtex division and west texas division regulatory proceedings includes an increase to the base customer charge and a decrease in the commodity charge applied to customer consumption the effect of this change in rate design allows the company’s rates to be more closely aligned with the utility industry standard rate design in addition we anticipate these divisions will earn their operating income more ratably over the fiscal year as they are now less dependent on customer consumption 

review of financial and operating results 

financial and operational highlights for our natural gas distribution segment for the fiscal years ended september 30 2013  2012  and 2011  are presented below 



fiscal year ended september 30 2013  compared with fiscal year ended september 30 2012   

the 585 million  periodoverperiod increase in natural gas distribution gross profit primarily reflects the following 

  operating expenses which include operation and maintenance expense provision for doubtful accounts depreciation and amortization expense and taxes other than income increased by 199 million  primarily due to the following 

 

 these increases were partially offset by 

 miscellaneous income increased 152 million  primarily due to the absence of a 100 million onetime donation to a donor advised fund in the prior year the completion of a periodic review of our performancebased ratemaking pbr mechanism in our tennessee service area and the implementation of a new pbr program in our mississippi division during fiscal 2013 

interest charges decreased 123 million  primarily from interest deferrals associated with our infrastructure spending activities in texas 

fiscal year ended september 30 2012  compared with fiscal year ended september 30 2011   

the 48 million   increase  in natural gas distribution gross profit was primarily due to a 177 million net increase in rate adjustments primarily in the midtex louisiana mississippi west texas and kentucky service areas 

these increases  were partially offset by the following 

 operating expenses which include operation and maintenance expense provision for doubtful accounts depreciation and amortization expense and taxes other than income increased   224 million  primarily due to the following 

 these increases  were partially offset by the following 

 miscellaneous income decreased 289 million primarily due to the absence of a 218 million pretax gain recognized in fiscal 2011 as a result of unwinding two treasury locks 136 million net of tax and a 100 million onetime donation to a donor advised fund in fiscal 2012 

interest charges decreased 51 million compared to the prior year due primarily to the prepayment of our 5125 250 million senior notes in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 refinancing longterm debt at reduced interest rates and reducing commitment fees from decreasing the number of credit facilities and extending the length of their terms in fiscal 2011 

additionally results for fiscal 2012 were favorably impacted by a state tax benefit of 113 million due to the completion of the sale of our missouri iowa and illinois service areas in the fiscal fourth quarter the company updated its analysis of the tax rate at which deferred taxes would reverse in the future to reflect the sale of these service areas the updated 

analysis supported a reduction in the deferred tax rate which when applied to the balance of taxable income deferred to future periods resulted in a reduction of the company’s overall deferred tax liability 

the following table shows our operating income from continuing operations by natural gas distribution division in order of total rate base for the fiscal years ended september 30 2013  2012  and 2011  the presentation of our natural gas distribution operating income is included for financial reporting purposes and may not be appropriate for ratemaking purposes 



regulated transmission and storage segment 

our regulated transmission and storage segment consists of the regulated pipeline and storage operations of the atmos pipeline — texas division the atmos pipeline — texas division transports natural gas to our midtex division and third parties and manages five underground storage reservoirs in texas we also provide ancillary services customary in the pipeline industry including parking arrangements lending and sales of excess gas 

our regulated transmission and storage segment is impacted by seasonal weather patterns competitive factors in the energy industry and economic conditions in our midtex service area natural gas prices do not directly impact the results of this segment as revenues are derived from the transportation of natural gas however natural gas prices and demand for natural gas could influence the level of drilling activity in the markets that we serve which may influence the level of throughput we may be able to transport on our pipeline further natural gas price differences between the various hubs that we serve could influence customers to transport gas through our pipeline to capture arbitrage gains 

the results of atmos pipeline — texas division are also significantly impacted by the natural gas requirements of the midtex division because it is the primary supplier of natural gas for our midtex division 

finally as a regulated pipeline the operations of the atmos pipeline — texas division may be impacted by the timing of when costs and expenses are incurred and when these costs and expenses are recovered through its tariffs 

review of financial and operating results 

financial and operational highlights for our regulated transmission and storage segment for the fiscal years ended september 30 2013  2012  and 2011  are presented below 



fiscal year ended september 30 2013  compared with fiscal year ended september 30 2012 

the 215 million  increase in regulated transmission and storage gross profit compared to the prioryear period was primarily a result of the gas reliability infrastructure program grip filings approved by the railroad commission of texas rrc during fiscal 2012 and 2013 during fiscal 2012 the rrc approved the atmos pipeline  texas grip filing with an annual operating income increase of 147 million effective april 2012 on may 7 2013 the rrc approved the atmos pipeline  texas grip filing with an annual operating income increase of 267 million that went into effect with bills rendered on and after may 7 2013 grip filings increased periodoverperiod gross profit by 197 million 

this increase was partially offset by a 105 million  increase in operating expenses largely attributable to increased depreciation expense as a result of increased capital investments and increased levels of pipeline and rightofway maintenance activities to improve the safety and reliability of our system 

the apt rate case approved by the rrc on april 18 2011 contained an annual adjustment mechanism approved for a threeyear pilot program that adjusted regulated rates up or down by 75 percent of the difference between apt’s nonregulated annual revenue and a predefined base credit the annual adjustment mechanism expired on june 30 2013 apt requested to extend the annual adjustment mechanism until november 1 2017 a hearing to review the request was held on october 29 2013 with a final decision expected in december 2013 

fiscal year ended september 30 2012  compared with fiscal year ended september 30 2011 

the 280 million increase in regulated transmission and storage gross profit compared to the prior year was primarily a result of the rate case that was finalized and became effective in may 2011 as well as the grip filings approved by the rrc during fiscal 2011 and 2012 in may 2011 the rrc issued an order in the rate case of atmos pipeline  texas that approved an annual operating income increase of 204 million during fiscal 2011 the rrc approved the atmos pipeline  texas grip filing with an annual operating income increase of 126 million that went into effect in the fiscal fourth quarter on april 10 2012 the rrc approved the atmos pipeline  texas grip filing with an annual operating income increase of 147 million that went into effect with bills rendered on an after april 10 2012 

operating expenses increased 74 million primarily due to a 54 million increase in depreciation expense resulting from higher investment in net plant 

additionally results for fiscal 2012 were favorably impacted by a state tax benefit of 23 million associated with an update of the estimated tax rate at which deferred taxes would reverse in future periods after the completion of the sale of our missouri illinois and iowa assets net income for this segment for fiscal 2011 was favorably impacted by a 60 million pretax gain recognized in march 2011 as a result of unwinding two treasury locks 39 million net of tax 

nonregulated segment 

our nonregulated operations are conducted through atmos energy holdings inc aeh a whollyowned subsidiary of atmos energy corporation and represent approximately five percent of our consolidated net income 

aehs primary business is to buy sell and deliver natural gas at competitive prices to approximately 1000 customers located primarily in the midwest and southeast areas of the united states aeh accomplishes this objective by aggregating and purchasing gas supply arranging transportation and storage logistics and effectively managing commodity price risk 

aeh also earns storage and transportation demand fees primarily from our regulated natural gas distribution operations in louisiana and kentucky these demand fees are subject to regulatory oversight and are renewed periodically 

our nonregulated activities are significantly influenced by competitive factors in the industry and general economic conditions therefore the margins earned from these activities are dependent upon our ability to attract and retain customers and to minimize the cost of buying selling and delivering natural gas to offer more competitive pricing to those customers 

further natural gas market conditions most notably the price of natural gas and the level of price volatility affect our nonregulated businesses natural gas prices and the level of volatility are influenced by a number of factors including but not limited to general economic conditions the demand for natural gas in different parts of the country the level of domestic natural gas production and the level of natural gas inventory levels 

natural gas prices can influence 

 natural gas price volatility can also influence our nonregulated business in the following ways 

 our nonregulated segment manages its exposure to natural gas commodity price risk through a combination of physical storage and financial instruments therefore results for this segment include unrealized gains or losses on its net physical gas position and the related financial instruments used to manage commodity price risk these margins fluctuate based upon changes in the spreads between the physical and forward natural gas prices the magnitude of the unrealized gains and losses is also contingent upon the levels of our net physical position at the end of the reporting period 

review of financial and operating results 

financial and operational highlights for our nonregulated segment for the fiscal years ended september 30 2013  2012  and 2011  are presented below 



  

fiscal year ended september 30 2013  compared with fiscal year ended september 30 2012 

gross profit increased 82 million  for the year ended september 30 2013 compared to the prior year realized margins decreased 88 million  primarily attributable to lower gas delivery margins consolidated sales volumes decreased two percent due to increased competition which reduced industrial and power generation sales the impact of lower sales volumes was compounded by a decrease in perunit margins from 116 cents per mcf to 100 cents per mcf this decrease was offset by an increase of 170 million  in unrealized margins primarily due to the yearoveryear timing of realized margins on the settlement of hedged natural gas inventory positions 

operating expenses increased 75 million  primarily due to increased litigation and software support costs partially offset by reduced employee costs 

miscellaneous income increased 13 million  primarily due to a gain realized from the sale of a peaking power facility and related assets during the first quarter of fiscal 2013 

fiscal year ended september 30 2012  compared with fiscal year ended september 30 2011 

realized margins for gas delivery storage and transportation services and other services were 631 million  during the year ended september 30 2012 compared with 754 million  for fiscal 2011 the decrease reflects the following 

 

unrealized margins increased 24 million in fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011 primarily due to the yearoveryear timing of realized margins on the settlement of hedged natural gas inventory positions 

operating expenses excluding asset impairments decreased 22 million primarily due to lower employeerelated expenses 

during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 we recorded a 53 million noncash charge to impair our natural gas gathering assets located in kentucky the charge reflected a reduction in the value of the project due to the current low natural gas price environment and management’s decision to focus aeh’s activities on its gas delivery storage and transportation services in fiscal 2011 asset impairments included an asset impairment charge of 193 million related to our investment in our fort necessity storage project as well as an 110 million pretax impairment charge related to the writeoff of certain natural gas gathering assets 

liquidity and capital resources 

the liquidity required to fund our working capital capital expenditures and other cash needs is provided from a variety of sources including internally generated funds and borrowings under our commercial paper program and bank credit facilities additionally we have various uncommitted trade credit lines with our gas suppliers that we utilize to purchase natural gas on a monthly basis finally from time to time we raise funds from the public debt and equity capital markets to fund our liquidity needs 

we regularly evaluate our funding strategy and profile to ensure that we i have sufficient liquidity for our shortterm and longterm needs in a costeffective manner and ii maintain our debt to capitalization ratio in a target range of 50 to 55 percent 

the following table presents our capitalization as of september 30 2013  and 2012  



total debt as a percentage of total capitalization including shortterm debt was 522 percent  and 517 percent  at september 30 2013  and 2012  

on january 11 2013 we issued 500 million of 415 30year unsecured senior notes which in effect replaced our 250 million 5125 10year unsecured senior notes we redeemed in august 2012 on a longterm basis the net proceeds of approximately 494 million were used to repay 260 million outstanding under our shortterm financing facility used to redeem our 5125 senior notes and to partially repay commercial paper borrowings and for general corporate purposes 

going forward we anticipate our capital spending will be more consistent with levels experienced during fiscal 2013 as we continue to invest in the safety and reliability of our distribution and transportation system we plan to continue to fund our growth and maintain a balanced capital structure through the use of longterm debt securities and to a lesser extent equity 

further 500 million of longterm debt will mature in october 2014 we plan to issue new senior notes to replace this maturing debt during the current year we entered into forward starting interest rate swaps to fix the treasury yield component associated with this anticipated issuance at 3129 we believe the liquidity provided by our senior notes and committed credit facilities combined with our operating cash flows will be sufficient to fund our working capital needs and capital expenditure program for fiscal year 2014  

cash flows 

our internally generated funds may change in the future due to a number of factors some of which we cannot control these factors include regulatory changes the price for our services the demand for such products and services margin requirements resulting from significant changes in commodity prices operational risks and other factors 

cash flows from operating investing and financing activities for the years ended september 30 2013  2012  and 2011  are presented below 



cash flows from operating activities 

yearoveryear changes in our operating cash flows primarily are attributable to changes in net income working capital changes particularly within our natural gas distribution segment resulting from the price of natural gas and the timing of customer collections payments for natural gas purchases and purchased gas cost recoveries the significant factors impacting our operating cash flow for the last three fiscal years are summarized below 

fiscal year ended september 30 2013  compared with fiscal year ended september 30 2012   

for the fiscal year ended september 30 2013  we generated operating cash flow of 6131 million  from operating activities compared with 5869 million  in the prior year the yearoveryear increase  reflects changes in working capital offset by a 105 million decrease in contributions made to our pension and postretirement plans in the current year 

fiscal year ended september 30 2012  compared with fiscal year ended september 30 2011   

for the fiscal year ended september 30 2012  we generated operating cash flow of 5869 million  from operating activities compared with 5828 million  in fiscal 2011  the yearoveryear increase reflects changes in working capital offset by a 567 million increase in contributions made to our pension and postretirement plans during fiscal 2012 

cash flows from investing activities 

our ongoing capital expenditure program enables us to provide safe and reliable natural gas distribution services to our existing customer base expand our natural gas distribution services into new markets and enhance the integrity of our pipelines in recent years we have increased our level of capital spending to improve the safety and reliability of our distribution system and to expand our intrastate pipeline network over the last three fiscal years approximately 68 percent of our capital spending has been committed to improving the safety and reliability of our system 

over the next five years we anticipate our capital spending will be more consistent with levels experienced during fiscal 2013 as we continue to invest in the safety and reliability of our distribution and transportation system where possible we will also continue to focus our capital spending in jurisdictions that permit us to earn an adequate return timely on our investment without compromising the safety or reliability of our system 

for the fiscal year ended september 30 2013  we incurred 8450 million  for capital expenditures compared with 7329 million  for the fiscal year ended september 30 2012  and 6230 million  for the fiscal year ended september 30 2011  

fiscal year ended september 30 2013  compared with fiscal year ended september 30 2012   

the 1121 million   increase  in capital expenditures in fiscal 2013  compared to fiscal 2012  primarily reflects spending incurred for the line w and line wx expansion projects and increased cathodic protection spending in our regulated transmission and storage segment 

fiscal year ended september 30 2012  compared with fiscal year ended september 30 2011 

the 1099 million   increase  in capital expenditures in fiscal 2012  compared to fiscal 2011  primarily reflects spending for the steel service line replacement program in the midtex division the development of new customer billing and information systems for our natural gas distribution and our nonregulated segments and increased capital spending to increase the capacity on our atmos pipeline — texas system 

cash flows from financing activities 

we received a net 857 million  and 440 million  in cash from financing activities for fiscal years 2013 and 2011 in fiscal 2012 we used a net 448 million  in financing activities our significant financing activities for the fiscal years ended september 30 2013  2012  and 2011  are summarized as follows 

2013   

during the fiscal year ended september 30 2013  our financing activities generated 857 million  of cash compared with 448 million  of cash used in the prior year current year cash flows from financing activities were significantly influenced by the issuance of 500 million 415 30year unsecured senior notes on january 11 2013 we used a portion of the net cash proceeds of 4938 million to repay a 260 million shortterm financing facility executed in fiscal 2012 to settle for 666 million three treasury locks associated with the issuance and to reduce shortterm debt borrowings by 1672 million 

2012   

during the fiscal year ended september 30 2012  our financing activities used 448 million  of cash primarily due to the payment of 2570 million associated with the early redemption of our 250 million 5125 senior notes that were scheduled to mature in january 2013 the repayment of our 250 million 5125 senior notes was financed using a 260 million shortterm loan additionally we repurchased 125 million of common stock under our 2011 share repurchase program 

2011   

during the fiscal year ended september 30 2011  our financing activities generated 440 million  of cash primarily related to the issuance of 400 million 550 senior notes in june 2011 and the related settlement of three treasury locks for 201 million we used a portion of the net cash proceeds of 3945 million to pay scheduled longterm debt repayments including our 350 million 7375 senior notes that were paid on their maturity date in may 2011 additionally we received 278 million cash in march 2011 related to the unwinding of two treasury locks 

the following table shows the number of shares issued for the fiscal years ended september 30 2013  2012  and 2011  

  



the increase  in the number of shares issued in fiscal 2013  compared with the number of shares issued in fiscal 2012  primarily reflects the type of awards that were issued from the 1998 longterm incentive plan ltip in the current year employees were issued restricted stock units for which we issued new shares in the prior year employees were issued restricted stock awards which were held in trust and did not require the issuance of new shares during fiscal 2013  we canceled and retired 133449 shares attributable to federal withholdings on equity awards which are not included in the table above at september 30 2013 of the 87 million shares authorized for issuance from the ltip 14 million shares remained available 

the decreased number of shares issued in fiscal 2012 compared with the number of shares issued in fiscal 2011 primarily reflects the exercise of a significant number of stock options during fiscal 2011 during fiscal 2012 we canceled and retired 153255 shares attributable to federal withholdings on equity awards and repurchased and retired 387991 shares attributable to our share repurchase program which are not included in the table above 

credit facilities 

our shortterm borrowing requirements are affected by the seasonal nature of the natural gas business changes in the price of natural gas and the amount of natural gas we need to supply to meet our customers’ needs could significantly affect our borrowing requirements 

we finance our shortterm borrowing requirements through a combination of a 950 million commercial paper program which is collateralized by our 950 million unsecured credit facility as well as three additional committed revolving credit facilities and one uncommitted revolving credit facility with thirdparty lenders as a result we have approximately 1 billion of working capital funding additionally our 950 million unsecured credit facility has an accordion feature which if utilized would increase borrowing capacity to 12 billion we also use intercompany credit facilities to supplement the funding provided by these thirdparty committed credit facilities 

shelf registration 

on march 28 2013 we filed a registration statement with the securities and exchange commission to 

issue from time to time up to 175 billion in common stock andor debt securities available for issuance which replaced our 

registration statement that expired on march 31 2013 as of september 30 2013 175 billion was available under the shelf 

registration statement 

credit ratings 

our credit ratings directly affect our ability to obtain shortterm and longterm financing in addition to the cost of such financing in determining our credit ratings the rating agencies consider a number of quantitative factors including debt to total capitalization operating cash flow relative to outstanding debt operating cash flow coverage of interest and pension liabilities and funding status in addition the rating agencies consider qualitative factors such as consistency of our earnings over time the quality of our management and business strategy the risks associated with our regulated and nonregulated businesses and the regulatory environment in the states where we operate 

our debt is rated by three rating agencies standard  poor’s corporation sp moody’s investors service moody’s and fitch ratings ltd fitch our current debt ratings are all considered investment grade and are as follows 



on october 8 2013 sp upgraded our senior unsecured debt rating to a from bbb with a ratings outlook of stable citing an improved business risk profile from an increasing contribution of earnings from our regulated operations and focusing our nonregulated operations on our delivered gas business 

 a significant degradation in our operating performance or a significant reduction in our liquidity caused by more limited access to the private and public credit markets as a result of deteriorating global or national financial and credit conditions could trigger a negative change in our ratings outlook or even a reduction in our credit ratings by the three credit rating agencies this would mean more limited access to the private and public credit markets and an increase in the costs of such borrowings 

a credit rating is not a recommendation to buy sell or hold securities the highest investment grade credit rating is aaa for sp aaa for moody’s and aaa for fitch the lowest investment grade credit rating is bbb for sp baa3 for moody’s and bbb for fitch our credit ratings may be revised or withdrawn at any time by the rating agencies and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating there can be no assurance that a rating will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if in its judgment circumstances so warrant 

debt covenants 

we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants as of september 30 2013  our debt covenants are described in note 5  to the consolidated financial statements 

contractual obligations and commercial commitments 

the following table provides information about contractual obligations and commercial commitments at september 30 2013  



  

 

with the exception of our midtex division our natural gas distribution segment maintains supply contracts with several vendors that generally cover a period of up to one year commitments for estimated base gas volumes are established under these contracts on a monthly basis at contractually negotiated prices commitments for incremental daily purchases are made as necessary during the month in accordance with the terms of individual contracts our midtex division maintains longterm supply contracts to ensure a reliable source of natural gas for our customers in its service area which obligate it to purchase specified volumes at market prices the estimated commitments under the terms of these contracts as of september 30 2013  are reflected in the table above 

aeh has commitments to purchase physical quantities of natural gas under contracts indexed to the forward nymex strip or fixed price contracts at september 30 2013  aeh was committed to purchase 780  bcf within one year 219  bcf within one to three years and 10  bcf after three years under indexed contracts aeh is committed to purchase 61  bcf within one year and 02  bcf within one to three years under fixed price contracts with prices ranging from 332  to 636  per mcf 

risk management activities 

as discussed above in our critical accounting policies we use financial instruments to mitigate commodity price risk and periodically to manage interest rate risk we conduct risk management activities through our natural gas distribution and nonregulated segments in our natural gas distribution segment we use a combination of physical storage fixed physical contracts and fixed financial contracts to reduce our exposure to unusually large winterperiod gas price increases in our nonregulated segments we manage our exposure to the risk of natural gas price changes and lock in our gross profit margin through a combination of storage and financial instruments including futures overthecounter and exchangetraded options and swap contracts with counterparties to the extent our inventory cost and actual sales and actual purchases do not correlate with the changes in the market indices we use in our hedges we could experience ineffectiveness or the hedges may no longer meet the accounting requirements for hedge accounting resulting in the financial instruments being treated as mark to market instruments through earnings 

we record our financial instruments as a component of risk management assets and liabilities which are classified as current or noncurrent based upon the anticipated settlement date of the underlying financial instrument substantially all of our financial instruments are valued using external market quotes and indices 

the following table shows the components of the change in fair value of our natural gas distribution segment’s financial instruments for the fiscal year ended september 30 2013  in thousands 



the fair value of our natural gas distribution segment’s financial instruments at september 30 2013  is presented below by time period and fair value source 



the following table shows the components of the change in fair value of our nonregulated segment’s financial instruments for the fiscal year ended september 30 2013  in thousands 



the fair value of our nonregulated segment’s financial instruments at september 30 2013  is presented below by time period and fair value source 

  



employee benefits programs 

an important element of our total compensation program and a significant component of our operation and maintenance expense is the offering of various benefits programs to our employees these programs include medical and dental insurance coverage and pension and postretirement programs 

medical and dental insurance 

we offer medical and dental insurance programs to substantially all of our employees and we believe these programs are consistent with other programs in our industry since 2006 we have experienced medical and prescription inflation of approximately four percent in recent years we have strived to actively manage our health care costs through the introduction of a wellness strategy that is focused on helping employees to identify health risks and to manage these risks through improved lifestyle choices 

in march 2010 president obama signed the patient protection and affordable care act  into law the “health care reform act” the health care reform act will be phased in over an eightyear period we have changed the design of our health care plans to comply with provisions of the health care reform act that have already gone into effect or will be going into effect in future years we will continue to monitor all developments on health care reform and continue to comply with all existing relevant laws and regulations 

for fiscal 2014  we anticipate an approximate six percent medical and prescription drug inflation rate primarily due to anticipated higher claims costs and the implementation of the health care reform act 

net periodic pension and postretirement benefit costs 

for the fiscal year ended september 30 2013  our total net periodic pension and other benefits costs was 785 million  compared with 692 million and 566 million for the fiscal years ended september 30 2012  and 2011  these costs relating to our natural gas distribution operations are recoverable through our gas distribution rates a portion of these costs is capitalized into our gas distribution rate base and the remaining costs are recorded as a component of operation and maintenance expense 

our fiscal 2013  costs were determined using a september 30 2012  measurement date at that date interest and corporate bond rates utilized to determine our discount rates were lower than the interest and corporate bond rates as of september 30 2011  the measurement date for our fiscal 2012 net periodic cost as a result of the lower interest and corporate bond rates we decreased the discount rate used to determine our fiscal 2013 pension and benefit costs to 404 percent our expected return on our pension plan assets was maintained at 775 percent due to historical experience and the current market projection of the target asset allocation as a result our fiscal 2013 pension and postretirement medical costs were higher than in the prior year 

the increase in total net periodic pension and other benefits costs during fiscal 2012  compared with fiscal 2011  primarily reflects the decrease in our discount rate at september 30 2011  the measurement date for our fiscal 2012  pension and postretirement costs the discount rate used to compute the present value of a plan’s liabilities generally is based on rates of highgrade corporate bonds with maturities similar to the average period over which the benefits will be paid at our september 30 2011 measurement date the interest and corporate bond rates used to determine our fiscal 2012 net periodic pension cost were significantly lower than the rates at september 30 2010 the measurement date used to determine our fiscal 2011 net periodic cost our expected return on our pension plan assets was reduced to 775 percent due to historical experience and the thencurrent market projection of the target asset allocation 

pension and postretirement plan funding 

generally our funding policy is to contribute annually an amount that will at least equal the minimum amount required to comply with the employee retirement income security act of 1974 erisa however additional voluntary contributions are 

made from time to time as considered necessary contributions are intended to provide not only for benefits attributed to service to date but also for those expected to be earned in the future 

in accordance with the pension protection act of 2006 ppa we determined the funded status of our plans as of january 1 2013 based on this valuation we were required to contribute cash of 327 million  465 million  and 09 million to our pension plans during fiscal 2013  2012  and 2011  the higher level of contributions experienced during fiscal 2013 and 2012 reflect lower discount rates than in previous years each contribution increased the level of our plan assets to achieve a desirable ppa funding threshold 

we contributed 266 million  and 221 million  to our postretirement benefits plans for the fiscal years ended september 30 2013  and 2012  the contributions represent the portion of the postretirement costs we are responsible for under the terms of our plan and minimum funding required by state regulatory commissions 

outlook for fiscal 2014 and beyond 

as of september 30 2013  interest and corporate bond rates were higher than the rates as of september 30 2012 therefore we increased the discount rate used to measure our fiscal 2014 net periodic cost from 404 percent to 495 percent however we decreased the expected return on plan assets from 775 percent to 725 percent in the determination of our fiscal 2014 net periodic pension cost based upon expected market returns for our targeted asset allocation as a result of the net impact of changes in these and other assumptions we expect our fiscal 2014 net period pension cost to decrease by less than five percent 

based upon market conditions subsequent to september 30 2013  the current funded position of the plans and the funding requirements under the ppa we anticipate contributing between 15 million and 25 million to the plans in fiscal 2014  further we will consider whether an additional voluntary contribution is prudent to maintain certain ppa funding thresholds with respect to our postretirement medical plans we anticipate contributing between 25 million and 30 million during fiscal 2014  

actual changes in the fair market value of plan assets and differences between the actual and expected return on plan 

assets could have a material effect on the amount of pension costs ultimately recognized a 025 percent change in our discount 

rate would impact our pension and postretirement costs by approximately 28 million a 025 percent change in our expected 

rate of return would impact our pension and postretirement costs by approximately 10 million 

the projected pension liability future funding requirements and the amount of pension expense or income recognized for the plan are subject to change depending upon the actuarial value of plan assets and the determination of future benefit obligations as of each subsequent actuarial calculation date these amounts are impacted by actual investment returns changes in interest rates and changes in the demographic composition of the participants in the plan

we are exposed to risks associated with commodity prices and interest rates commodity price risk is the potential loss that we may incur as a result of changes in the fair value of a particular instrument or commodity interestrate risk results from our portfolio of debt and equity instruments that we issue to provide financing and liquidity for our business activities 

we conduct risk management activities through both our natural gas distribution and nonregulated segments in our natural gas distribution segment we use a combination of physical storage fixed physical contracts and fixed financial contracts to protect us and our customers against unusually large winter period gas price increases in our nonregulated segment we manage our exposure to the risk of natural gas price changes and lock in our gross profit margin through a combination of storage and financial instruments including futures overthecounter and exchangetraded options and swap contracts with counterparties our risk management activities and related accounting treatment are described in further detail in note 12 to the consolidated financial statements additionally our earnings are affected by changes in shortterm interest rates as a result of our issuance of shortterm commercial paper and our other shortterm borrowings 

commodity price risk 

natural gas distribution segment 

we purchase natural gas for our natural gas distribution operations substantially all of the costs of gas purchased for natural gas distribution operations are recovered from our customers through purchased gas cost adjustment mechanisms therefore our natural gas distribution operations have limited commodity price risk exposure 

nonregulated segment 

our nonregulated segment is also exposed to risks associated with changes in the market price of natural gas for our nonregulated segment we use a sensitivity analysis to estimate commodity price risk for purposes of this analysis we estimate commodity price risk by applying a 050 change in the forward nymex price to our net open position including existing storage and related financial contracts at the end of each period based on aeh’s net open position including existing storage and related financial contracts at september 30 2013  of 01 bcf a 050 change in the forward nymex price would have had a 01 million impact on our consolidated net income 

changes in the difference between the indices used to mark to market our physical inventory gas daily and the related fairvalue hedge nymex can result in volatility in our reported net income but over time gains and losses on the sale of storage gas inventory will be offset by gains and losses on the fairvalue hedges based upon our net physical position at september 30 2013  and assuming our hedges would still qualify as highly effective a 050 change in the difference between the gas daily and nymex indices would impact our reported net income by approximately 37 million 

additionally these changes could cause us to recognize a risk management liability which would require us to place cash into an escrow account to collateralize this liability position this in turn would reduce the amount of cash we would have on hand to fund our working capital needs 

interest rate risk 

our earnings are exposed to changes in shortterm interest rates associated with our shortterm commercial paper program and other shortterm borrowings we use a sensitivity analysis to estimate our shortterm interest rate risk for purposes of this analysis we estimate our shortterm interest rate risk as the difference between our actual interest expense for the period and estimated interest expense for the period assuming a hypothetical average one percent increase in the interest rates associated with our shortterm borrowings had interest rates associated with our shortterm borrowings increased by an average of one percent our interest expense would have increased by approximately 32 million during 2013

 item 1 business tableend overview and strategy 

atmos energy corporation headquartered in dallas texas and incorporated in texas and virginia is engaged primarily in the regulated natural gas distribution and transmission and storage businesses as well as other nonregulated natural gas businesses we deliver natural gas through regulated sales and transportation arrangements to over three million residential commercial public authority and industrial customers in nine states located primarily in the south which makes us one of the country’s largest naturalgasonly distributors based on number of customers we also operate one of the largest intrastate pipelines in texas based on miles of pipe 

in august 2012 we completed the sale of our natural gas distribution operations in missouri illinois and iowa representing approximately 84000 customers and announced that we had entered into a definitive agreement to sell our natural gas distribution operations in georgia representing approximately 64000 customers after the closing of the georgia transaction we will operate in eight states 

through our nonregulated businesses we primarily provide natural gas management and marketing services to municipalities other local gas distribution companies and industrial customers principally in the midwest and southeast and natural gas transportation along with storage services to certain of our natural gas distribution divisions and third parties 

our overall strategy is to 

 

  

  

 we have delivered excellent shareholder value by growing our earnings and increasing our dividends for over 25 consecutive years through fiscal 2005 we achieved this record of growth through acquisitions while efficiently managing our operating and maintenance expenses and leveraging our technology to achieve more efficient operations since that time we have achieved growth by implementing rate designs that reduce or eliminate regulatory lag and separate the recovery of our approved margins from customer usage patterns in addition we have developed various commercial opportunities within our regulated transmission and storage operations 

our core values include focusing on our employees and customers while conducting our business with honesty and integrity we continue to strengthen our culture through ongoing communications with our employees and enhanced employee training 

operating segments 

we operate the company through the following three segments 

 

  

  

   

these operating segments are described in greater detail below 

natural gas distribution segment overview 

our natural gas distribution segment represents approximately 65 percent of our consolidated net income this segment is comprised of the following six regulated divisions presented in order of total rate base covering service areas in nine states 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 our natural gas distribution business is a seasonal business gas sales to residential and commercial customers are greater during the winter months than during the remainder of the year the volumes of gas sales during the winter months will vary with the temperatures during these months 

revenues in this operating segment are established by regulatory authorities in the states in which we operate these rates are intended to be sufficient to cover the costs of conducting business and to provide a reasonable return on invested capital our primary service areas are located in colorado kansas kentucky louisiana mississippi tennessee and texas we have more limited service areas in georgia and virginia see note 6 in the consolidated financial statements for a description of the completed sale of our missouri illinois and iowa service areas and the anticipated sale of our georgia distribution operations in addition we transport natural gas for others through our distribution system 

rates established by regulatory authorities often include cost adjustment mechanisms for costs that i are subject to significant price fluctuations compared to our other costs ii represent a large component of our cost of service and iii are generally outside our control 

purchased gas cost adjustment mechanisms represent a common form of cost adjustment mechanism purchased gas cost adjustment mechanisms provide natural gas utility companies a method of recovering purchased gas costs on an ongoing basis without filing a rate case because they provide a dollarfordollar offset to increases or decreases in natural gas distribution gas costs therefore although substantially all of our natural gas distribution operating revenues fluctuate with the cost of gas that we purchase natural gas distribution gross profit which is defined as operating revenues less purchased gas cost is generally not affected by fluctuations in the cost of gas 

additionally some jurisdictions have introduced performancebased ratemaking adjustments to provide incentives to natural gas utilities to minimize purchased gas costs through improved storage management and use of financial instruments to lock in gas costs under the performancebased ratemaking adjustment purchased gas costs savings are shared between the utility and its customers 

finally regulatory authorities have approved weather normalization adjustments wna for approximately 97 percent of residential and commercial margins in our service areas as a part of our rates wna minimizes the effect of weather that is above or below normal by allowing us to increase customers’ bills to offset the effect of lower gas usage when weather is warmer than normal and decrease customers’ bills to offset the effect of higher gas usage when weather is colder than normal 

  

as of september 30 2012 we had wna for our residential and commercial meters in the following service areas for the following periods 

 

 our supply of natural gas is provided by a variety of suppliers including independent producers marketers and pipeline companies and withdrawals of gas from proprietary and contracted storage assets additionally the natural gas supply for our midtex division includes peaking and spot purchase agreements 

supply arrangements consist of both base load and swing supply peaking quantities and are contracted from our suppliers on a firm basis with various terms at market prices base load quantities are those that flow at a constant level throughout the month and swing supply quantities provide the flexibility to change daily quantities to match increases or decreases in requirements related to weather conditions 

except for local production purchases we select our natural gas suppliers through a competitive bidding process by periodically requesting proposals from suppliers that have demonstrated that they can provide reliable service we select these suppliers based on their ability to deliver gas supply to our designated firm pipeline receipt points at the lowest reasonable cost major suppliers during fiscal 2012 were anadarko energy services bp energy company conocophillips devon gas services lp enbridge marketing us lp iberdrola renewables inc national fuel marketing company llc sequent energy management lp texla energy management inc and atmos energy marketing llc our natural gas marketing subsidiary 

the combination of base load peaking and spot purchase agreements coupled with the withdrawal of gas held in storage allows us the flexibility to adjust to changes in weather which minimizes our need to enter into longterm firm commitments we estimate our peakday availability of natural gas supply to be approximately 44 bcf the peakday demand for our natural gas distribution operations in fiscal 2012 was on february 11 2012 when sales to customers reached approximately 30 bcf 

currently our natural gas distribution divisions except for our midtex division utilize 43 pipeline transportation companies both interstate and intrastate to transport our natural gas the pipeline transportation agreements are firm and many of them have “pipeline nonotice” storage service which provides for daily balancing between system requirements and nominated flowing supplies these agreements have been negotiated with the shortest term necessary while still maintaining our right of first refusal the natural gas supply for our midtex division is delivered primarily by our atmos pipeline — texas division 

to maintain our deliveries to high priority customers we have the ability and have exercised our right to curtail deliveries to certain customers under the terms of interruptible contracts or applicable state regulations or statutes our customers’ demand on our system is not necessarily indicative of our ability to meet current or anticipated market demands or immediate delivery requirements because of factors such as the physical limitations of gathering storage and transmission systems the duration and severity of cold weather the availability of gas reserves from our suppliers the ability to purchase additional supplies on a shortterm basis and actions by federal and state regulatory authorities curtailment rights provide us the flexibility to meet the humanneeds requirements of our customers on a firm basis priority allocations imposed by federal and state regulatory agencies as well as other factors beyond our control may affect our ability to meet the demands of our customers we anticipate no problems with obtaining additional gas supply as needed for our customers 

below we briefly describe our six natural gas distribution divisions we operate in our service areas under terms of nonexclusive franchise agreements granted by the various cities and towns that we serve at september 30 2012 we held 1006 franchises having terms generally ranging from five to 35 years a significant number of our franchises expire each year which require renewal prior to the end of their terms we believe that we will be able to renew our franchises as they expire additional information concerning our natural gas distribution divisions is presented under the caption “operating statistics” 

  

atmos energy midtex division   our midtex division serves approximately 550 incorporated and unincorporated communities in the northcentral eastern and western parts of texas including the dallasfort worth metroplex the governing body of each municipality we serve has original jurisdiction over all gas distribution rates operations and services within its city limits except with respect to sales of natural gas for vehicle fuel and agricultural use the railroad commission of texas rrc has exclusive appellate jurisdiction over all rate and regulatory orders and ordinances of the municipalities and exclusive original jurisdiction over rates and services to customers not located within the limits of a municipality 

prior to fiscal 2008 this division operated under one systemwide rate structure in fiscal 2008 we reached a settlement with cities representing approximately 80 percent of this division’s customers that allowed us to update rates for customers in these cities using an annual rate review mechanism rrm from fiscal 2008 through fiscal 2011 when the rrm was active we filed a formal rate case for the midtex division in fiscal 2012 after the conclusion of this rate case we expect to negotiate a new rate review mechanism process in june 2011 we reached an agreement with the city of dallas to enter into the dallas annual rate review darr this rate review provides for an annual rate review without the necessity of filing a general rate case the first rates were implemented under the darr in june 2012 

atmos energy kentuckymidstates division   our kentuckymidstates division currently operates in more than 230 communities across georgia kentucky tennessee and virginia the service areas in these states are primarily rural however this division serves franklin tennessee and other suburban areas of nashville we update our rates in this division through periodic formal rate filings made with each state’s public service commission 

on august 1 2012 we completed the divestiture of our natural gas distribution operations in missouri illinois and iowa representing approximately 84000 customers in 189 communities with some of the missouri communities located in our atmos energy coloradokansas division on august 8 2012 we announced that we had entered into a definitive agreement to sell our natural gas distribution operations in georgia representing approximately 64000 customers in 19 communities see note 6 in the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding these divestitures 

atmos energy louisiana division   in louisiana we serve nearly 300 communities including the suburban areas of new orleans the metropolitan area of monroe and western louisiana direct sales of natural gas to industrial customers in louisiana who use gas for fuel or in manufacturing processes and sales of natural gas for vehicle fuel are exempt from regulation and are recognized in our nonregulated segment our rates in this division are updated annually through a rate stabilization clause filing without filing a formal rate case 

atmos energy west texas division   our west texas division serves approximately 80 communities in west texas including the amarillo lubbock and midland areas like our midtex division each municipality we serve has original jurisdiction over all gas distribution rates operations and services within its city limits with the rrc having exclusive appellate jurisdiction over the municipalities and exclusive original jurisdiction over rates and services provided to customers not located within the limits of a municipality prior to fiscal 2008 rates were updated in this division through formal rate proceedings in fiscal 2008 and 2009 we reached an agreement with the west texas service areas and the amarillo and lubbock service areas that allowed us to update rates for customers in these cities using an annual rate review mechanism rrm through fiscal 2011 when the rrm was active we filed a formal rate case for the west texas division in fiscal 2012 which was approved on october 2 2012 we expect to negotiate a new rate review mechanism process in fiscal 2013 

atmos energy mississippi division in mississippi we serve about 110 communities throughout the northern half of the state including the jackson metropolitan area our rates in the mississippi division are updated annually through a stable rate filing without filing a formal rate case 

atmos energy coloradokansas division   our coloradokansas division serves approximately 170 communities throughout colorado and kansas including the cities of olathe kansas a suburb of kansas city and greeley colorado located near denver we update our rates in this division through periodic formal rate filings and in kansas through periodic infrastructure replacement filings made with each state’s public service commission

 regulated transmission and storage segment overview 

our regulated transmission and storage segment represents approximately 30 percent of our consolidated net income and consists of the regulated pipeline and storage operations of our atmos pipeline — texas division this division transports natural gas to our midtex division transports natural gas for third parties and manages five underground storage reservoirs in texas we also provide ancillary services customary in the pipeline industry including parking and lending arrangements and sales of inventory on hand parking arrangements provide shortterm interruptible storage of gas on our pipeline lending services provide shortterm interruptible loans of natural gas from our pipeline to meet market demands gross profit earned from our midtex division and through certain other transportation and storage services is subject to traditional ratemaking governed by the rrc rates are updated through periodic formal rate proceedings and filings made under texas’ gas reliability infrastructure program grip grip allows us to include in our rate base annually approved capital costs incurred in the prior calendar year provided that we file a complete rate case at least once every five years atmos pipeline–texas’ existing regulatory mechanisms allow certain transportation and storage services to be provided under marketbased rates with minimal regulation 

these operations include one of the largest intrastate pipeline operations in texas with a heavy concentration in the established natural gasproducing areas of central northern and eastern texas extending into or near the major producing areas of the texas gulf coast and the delaware and val verde basins of west texas nine basins located in texas are believed to contain a substantial portion of the nation’s remaining onshore natural gas reserves with our pipeline system providing access to all of these basins 

nonregulated segment overview 

our nonregulated activities are conducted through atmos energy holdings inc aeh which is a whollyowned subsidiary of atmos energy corporation and operates primarily in the midwest and southeast areas of the united states currently this segment represents less than five percent of our consolidated net income 

aeh’s primary business is to deliver gas and provide related services by aggregating and purchasing gas supply arranging transportation and storage logistics and ultimately delivering gas to customers at competitive prices aeh also earns storage and transportation margins from i utilizing its proprietary 21mile pipeline located in new orleans louisiana to aggregate gas supply for our regulated natural gas distribution division in louisiana its gas delivery activities and on a more limited basis for third parties and ii managing proprietary storage in kentucky and louisiana to supplement the natural gas needs of our natural gas distribution divisions during peak periods the majority of these margins are generated through demand fees established under contracts with certain of our natural gas distribution divisions that are renewed periodically and subject to regulatory oversight 

aeh utilizes customerowned or contracted storage capacity to serve its customers in an effort to offset the demand fees paid to contract for storage capacity and to maximize the value of this capacity aeh sells financial 

  

instruments in an effort to earn a gross profit margin through the arbitrage of pricing differences in various locations and by recognizing pricing differences that occur over time certain of these arrangements are with regulated affiliates which have been approved by applicable state regulatory commissions 

ratemaking activity 

overview 

the method of determining regulated rates varies among the states in which our regulated businesses operate the regulatory authorities have the responsibility of ensuring that utilities in their jurisdictions operate in the best interests of customers while providing utility companies the opportunity to earn a reasonable return on their investment generally each regulatory authority reviews rate requests and establishes a rate structure intended to generate revenue sufficient to cover the costs of conducting business and to provide a reasonable return on invested capital 

our rate strategy focuses on reducing or eliminating regulatory lag obtaining adequate returns and providing stable predictable margins which benefit both our customers and the company as a result of our ratemaking efforts in recent years atmos energy has 

 

  

  

  

 although substantial progress has been made in recent years by improving rate design across atmos energy’s operating areas we will continue to seek improvements in rate design to address cost variations that are related to passthrough energy costs beyond our control further potential changes in federal energy policy and adverse economic conditions will necessitate continued vigilance by the company and our regulators in meeting the challenges presented by these external factors 

recent ratemaking activity 

substantially all of our regulated revenues in the fiscal years ended september 30 2012 2011 and 2010 were derived from sales at rates set by or subject to approval by local or state authorities net operating income increases resulting from ratemaking activity totaling 307 million 724 million and 568 million became effective in fiscal 2012 2011 and 2010 as summarized below 

 

   

additionally the following ratemaking efforts were initiated during fiscal 2012 but had not been completed as of september 30 2012 

 

  

 

  

  

  

  

   

our recent ratemaking activity is discussed in greater detail below 

rate case filings 

a rate case is a formal request from atmos energy to a regulatory authority to increase rates that are charged to customers rate cases may also be initiated when the regulatory authorities request us to justify our rates this process is referred to as a “show cause” action adequate rates are intended to provide for recovery of the company’s costs as well as a fair rate of return to our shareholders and ensure that we continue to safely deliver reliable reasonably priced natural gas service to our customers the following table summarizes our recent rate cases 

 

  

   

infrastructure programs 

as discussed above in “natural gas distribution segment overview” and “regulated transmission and storage segment overview” infrastructure programs such as grip allow our regulated companies the opportunity to include in their rate base annually approved capital costs incurred in the prior calendar year we currently have infrastructure programs in texas georgia and kentucky the following table summarizes our infrastructure program filings with effective dates during the fiscal years ended september 30 2012 2011 and 2010 

 

  

 

  

  

  

  

   

annual rate filing mechanisms 

as an instrument to reduce regulatory lag annual rate filing mechanisms allow us to refresh our rates on a periodic basis without filing a formal rate case however these filings still involve discovery by the appropriate regulatory authorities prior to the final determination of rates under these mechanisms as discussed above in “natural gas distribution segment overview” we currently have annual rate filing mechanisms in our louisiana mississippi and georgia divisions and in a portion of our texas divisions these mechanisms are referred to as dallas annual rate review darr in our midtex division stable rate filings in the mississippi division the rate stabilization clause in the louisiana division the georgia rate adjustment mechanism gram in the georgia division and previously as rate review mechanisms rrm in our texas divisions the following table summarizes filings made under our various annual rate filing mechanisms 

 

 beginning in fiscal year 2008 we entered into rrm mechanisms within our midtex and west texas divisions throughout the period of fiscal 2008 through fiscal 2011 when the rrm mechanisms were active we were able to successfully implement new base rates within the various cities of both divisions in fiscal 2012 we filed a rate case in both the midtex division for all cities except dallas and the west texas division following the conclusion of the midtex division case we expect to negotiate a new rate review mechanism process with each of the cities within both the midtex and west texas divisions 

  

we continue to operate under an annual rate mechanism darr with the city of dallas which was approved in june 2011 the first rates were implemented under the darr in june 2012 

during fiscal 2011 the rrc’s division of public safety issued a new rule requiring natural gas distribution companies to develop and implement a riskbased program for the renewal or replacement of distribution facilities including steel service lines the rule allows for the deferral of all expense associated with capital expenditures incurred pursuant to this rule including the recording of interest on the deferred expenses 

other ratemaking activity 

the following table summarizes other ratemaking activity during the fiscal years ended september 30 2012 2011 and 2010 

 

  

 

  

 other regulation 

each of our natural gas distribution divisions as well as our regulated transmission and storage division is regulated by various state or local public utility authorities we are also subject to regulation by the united states department of transportation with respect to safety requirements in the operation and maintenance of our transmission and distribution facilities in addition our distribution operations are also subject to various state and federal laws regulating environmental matters from time to time we receive inquiries regarding various environmental matters we believe that our properties and operations substantially comply with and are operated in substantial conformity with applicable safety and environmental statutes and regulations there are no administrative or judicial proceedings arising under environmental quality statutes pending or known to be contemplated by governmental agencies which would have a material adverse effect on us or our operations our environmental claims have arisen primarily from former manufactured gas plant sites 

the federal energy regulatory commission ferc allows pursuant to section 311 of the natural gas policy act gas transportation services through our atmos pipeline—texas assets “on behalf of” interstate pipelines or local distribution companies served by interstate pipelines without subjecting these assets to the jurisdiction of the ferc additionally the ferc has regulatory authority over the sale of natural gas in the wholesale gas market and the use and release of interstate pipeline and storage capacity as well as authority to detect and prevent market manipulation and to enforce compliance with ferc’s other rules policies and orders 

  

by companies engaged in the sale purchase transportation or storage of natural gas in interstate commerce we have taken what we believe are the necessary and appropriate steps to comply with these regulations 

competition 

although our natural gas distribution operations are not currently in significant direct competition with any other distributors of natural gas to residential and commercial customers within our service areas we do compete with other natural gas suppliers and suppliers of alternative fuels for sales to industrial customers we compete in all aspects of our business with alternative energy sources including in particular electricity electric utilities offer electricity as a rival energy source and compete for the space heating water heating and cooking markets promotional incentives improved equipment efficiencies and promotional rates all contribute to the acceptability of electrical equipment the principal means to compete against alternative fuels is lower prices and natural gas historically has maintained its price advantage in the residential commercial and industrial markets 

our regulated transmission and storage operations historically have faced limited competition from other existing intrastate pipelines and gas marketers seeking to provide or arrange transportation storage and other services for customers however in the last few years several new pipelines have been completed which has increased the level of competition in this segment of our business 

within our nonregulated operations aem competes with other natural gas marketers to provide natural gas management and other related services primarily to smaller customers requiring higher levels of balancing scheduling and other related management services aem has experienced increased competition in recent years primarily from investment banks and major integrated oil and natural gas companies who offer lower cost basic services the increased competition has reduced margins most notably on its highvolume accounts 

employees 

at september 30 2012 we had 4759 employees consisting of 4646 employees in our regulated operations and 113 employees in our nonregulated operations

 item 1a risk factors tableend our financial and operating results are subject to a number of risk factors many of which are not within our control although we have tried to discuss key risk factors below please be aware that other or new risks may prove to be important in the future investors should carefully consider the following discussion of risk factors as well as other information appearing in this report these factors include the following 

disruptions in the credit markets could limit our ability to access capital and increase our costs of capital 

we rely upon access to both shortterm and longterm credit markets to satisfy our liquidity requirements the global credit markets have experienced significant disruptions and volatility during the last few years to a greater degree than has been seen in decades in some cases the ability or willingness of traditional sources of capital to provide financing has been reduced 

our longterm debt is currently rated as “investment grade” by standard  poor’s corporation moody’s investors services inc and fitch ratings ltd if adverse credit conditions were to cause a significant limitation on our access to the private and public credit markets we could see a reduction in our liquidity a significant reduction in our liquidity could in turn trigger a negative change in our ratings outlook or even a reduction in our credit ratings by one or more of the three credit rating agencies such a downgrade could further limit our access to public andor private credit markets and increase the costs of borrowing under each source of credit 

further if our credit ratings were downgraded we could be required to provide additional liquidity to our nonregulated segment because the commodity financial instrument markets could become unavailable to us our nonregulated segment depends primarily upon a committed credit facility to finance its working capital needs which it uses primarily to issue standby letters of credit to its natural gas suppliers a significant reduction in the availability of this facility could require us to provide extra liquidity to support its operations or reduce some of the activities of our nonregulated segment our ability to provide extra liquidity is limited by the terms of our existing lending arrangements with aeh which are subject to annual approval by one state regulatory commission 

while we believe we can meet our capital requirements from our operations and the sources of financing available to us we can provide no assurance that we will continue to be able to do so in the future especially if the market price of natural gas increases significantly in the nearterm the future effects on our business liquidity and financial results of a further deterioration of current conditions in the credit markets could be material and adverse to us both in the ways described above or in other ways that we do not currently anticipate 

the continuation of recent economic conditions could adversely affect our customers and negatively impact our financial results 

the slowdown in the us economy in the last few years together with increased mortgage defaults and significant decreases in the values of homes and investment assets has adversely affected the financial resources of many domestic households it is unclear whether the administrative and legislative responses to these conditions will be successful in improving current economic conditions including the lowering of current high unemployment rates across the us as a result our customers may seek to use even less gas and it may become more difficult for them to pay their gas bills this may slow collections and lead to higher than normal levels of accounts receivable this in turn could increase our financing requirements and bad debt expense additionally our industrial customers may seek alternative energy sources which could result in lower sales volumes 

the costs of providing pension and postretirement health care benefits and related funding requirements are subject to changes in pension fund values changing demographics and fluctuating actuarial assumptions and may have a material adverse effect on our financial results in addition the passage of the health care reform act in 2010 could significantly increase the cost of health care benefits for our employees further the costs to the company of providing such benefits and related funding requirements are subject to the continued and timely recovery of such costs through our rates 

we provide a cashbalance pension plan and postretirement healthcare benefits to eligible fulltime employees the costs of providing such benefits and related funding requirements could be influenced by changes in the 

  

market value of the assets funding our pension and postretirement healthcare plans any significant declines in the value of these investments could increase the costs of our pension and postretirement healthcare plans and related funding requirements in the future further our costs of providing such benefits and related funding requirements are also subject to a number of factors including i changing demographics including longer life expectancy of beneficiaries and an expected increase in the number of eligible former employees over the next five to ten years and ii various actuarial calculations and assumptions which may differ materially from actual results due primarily to changing market and economic conditions and higher or lower withdrawal rates 

in addition the costs of providing health care benefits to our employees could significantly increase over the next five to ten years due primarily to the health care reform act of 2010 although the full effects of the act should not impact the company until 2014 the future costs of compliance with its provisions are difficult to measure at this time also the costs to the company of providing such benefits and related funding requirements could also increase materially in the future depending on the timing of the recovery if any of such costs through our rates 

our risk management operations are exposed to market risks that are beyond our control which could adversely affect our financial results and capital requirements 

our risk management operations are subject to market risks beyond our control including market liquidity commodity price volatility caused by market supply and demand dynamics and counterparty creditworthiness although we maintain a risk management policy we may not be able to completely offset the price risk associated with volatile gas prices particularly in our nonregulated business segment which could lead to volatility in our earnings 

physical trading in our nonregulated business segment also introduces price risk on any net open positions at the end of each trading day as well as volatility resulting from intraday fluctuations of gas prices and the potential for daily price movements between the time natural gas is purchased or sold for future delivery and the time the related purchase or sale is hedged the determination of our net open position as of the end of any particular trading day requires us to make assumptions as to future circumstances including the use of gas by our customers in relation to our anticipated storage and market positions because the price risk associated with any net open position at the end of such day may increase if the assumptions are not realized we review these assumptions as part of our daily monitoring activities although we manage our business to maintain no open positions there are times when limited net open positions related to our physical storage may occur on a shortterm basis net open positions may increase volatility in our financial condition or results of operations if market prices move in a significantly favorable or unfavorable manner before the open positions can be closed 

further the timing of the recognition for financial accounting purposes of gains or losses resulting from changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments designated as hedges usually does not match the timing of the economic profits or losses on the item being hedged this volatility may occur with a resulting increase or decrease in earnings or losses even though the expected profit margin is essentially unchanged from the date the transactions were consummated also if the local physical markets in which we trade do not move consistently with the nymex futures market upon which most of our commodity derivative financial instruments are valued we could experience increased volatility in the financial results of our nonregulated segment 

our nonregulated segment manages margins and limits risk exposure on the sale of natural gas inventory or the offsetting fixedprice purchase or sale commitments for physical quantities of natural gas through the use of a variety of financial instruments however contractual limitations could adversely affect our ability to withdraw gas from storage which could cause us to purchase gas at spot prices in a rising market to obtain sufficient volumes to fulfill customer contracts we could also realize financial losses on our efforts to limit risk as a result of volatility in the market prices of the underlying commodities or if a counterparty fails to perform under a contract any significant tightening of the credit markets could cause more of our counterparties to fail to perform than expected in addition adverse changes in the creditworthiness of our counterparties could limit the level of trading activities with these parties and increase the risk that these parties may not perform under a contract these circumstances could also increase our capital requirements 

  

we are also subject to interest rate risk on our borrowings in recent years we have been operating in a relatively low interestrate environment compared to historical norms for both short and longterm interest rates however increases in interest rates could adversely affect our future financial results 

we are subject to state and local regulations that affect our operations and financial results 

our natural gas distribution and regulated transmission and storage segments are subject to various regulated returns on our rate base in each jurisdiction in which we operate we monitor the allowed rates of return and our effectiveness in earning such rates and initiate rate proceedings or operating changes as we believe they are needed in addition in the normal course of business in the regulatory environment assets may be placed in service and historical test periods established before rate cases can be filed that could result in an adjustment of our allowed returns once rate cases are filed regulatory bodies have the authority to suspend implementation of the new rates while studying the cases because of this process we must suffer the negative financial effects of having placed assets in service without the benefit of rate relief which is commonly referred to as “regulatory lag” rate cases also involve a risk of rate reduction because once rates have been approved they are still subject to challenge for their reasonableness by appropriate regulatory authorities in addition regulators may review our purchases of natural gas and can adjust the amount of our gas costs that we pass through to our customers finally our debt and equity financings are also subject to approval by regulatory commissions in several states which could limit our ability to access or take advantage of rapid changes in the capital markets 

we may experience increased federal state and local regulation of the safety of our operations 

we are committed to constantly monitoring and maintaining our pipeline and distribution system to ensure that natural gas is delivered safely reliably and efficiently through our network of more than 73000 miles of pipeline and distribution lines the pipeline replacement programs currently underway in several of our divisions typify the preventive maintenance and continual renewal that we perform on our natural gas distribution system in the nine states in which we currently operate the safety and protection of the public our customers and our employees is our top priority however due primarily to the unfortunate pipeline incident in california in 2010 we anticipate companies in the natural gas distribution business may be subjected to even greater federal state and local oversight of the safety of their operations in the future although we believe these costs should be ultimately recoverable through our rates costs of complying with such increased regulations may have at least a shortterm adverse impact on our operating costs and financial results 

some of our operations are subject to increased federal regulatory oversight that could affect our operations and financial results 

ferc has regulatory authority over some of our operations including sales of natural gas in the wholesale gas market and the use and release of interstate pipeline and storage capacity under legislation passed by congress in 2005 ferc has adopted rules designed to prevent market power abuse and market manipulation and to promote compliance with ferc’s other rules policies and orders by companies engaged in the sale purchase transportation or storage of natural gas in interstate commerce these rules carry increased penalties for violations although we have taken steps to structure current and future transactions to comply with applicable current ferc regulations changes in ferc regulations or their interpretation by ferc or additional regulations issued by ferc in the future could also adversely affect our business financial condition or financial results 

we are subject to environmental regulations which could adversely affect our operations or financial results 

we are subject to laws regulations and other legal requirements enacted or adopted by federal state and local governmental authorities relating to protection of the environment and health and safety matters including those legal requirements that govern discharges of substances into the air and water the management and disposal of hazardous substances and waste the cleanup of contaminated sites groundwater quality and availability plant and wildlife protection as well as work practices related to employee health and safety environmental legislation also requires that our facilities sites and other properties associated with our operations be operated maintained abandoned and reclaimed to the satisfaction of applicable regulatory authorities 

  

failure to comply with these laws regulations permits and licenses may expose us to fines penalties or interruptions in our operations that could be significant to our financial results in addition existing environmental regulations may be revised or our operations may become subject to new regulations 

our business may be subject in the future to additional regulatory and financial risks associated with global warming and climate change 

there have been a number of federal and state legislative and regulatory initiatives proposed in recent years in an attempt to control or limit the effects of global warming and overall climate change including greenhouse gas emissions such as carbon dioxide the adoption of this type of legislation by congress or similar legislation by states or the adoption of related regulations by federal or state governments mandating a substantial reduction in greenhouse gas emissions in the future could have farreaching and significant impacts on the energy industry such new legislation or regulations could result in increased compliance costs for us or additional operating restrictions on our business affect the demand for natural gas or impact the prices we charge to our customers at this time we cannot predict the potential impact of such laws or regulations that may be adopted on our future business financial condition or financial results 

the concentration of our distribution pipeline and storage operations in the state of texas exposes our operations and financial results to economic conditions and regulatory decisions in texas 

over 50 percent of our natural gas distribution customers and most of our pipeline and storage assets and operations are located in the state of texas this concentration of our business in texas means that our operations and financial results may be significantly affected by changes in the texas economy in general and regulatory decisions by state and local regulatory authorities in texas 

adverse weather conditions could affect our operations or financial results 

we have weathernormalized rates for over 95 percent of our residential and commercial meters which substantially mitigates the adverse effects of warmerthannormal weather for meters in those service areas however there is no assurance that we will continue to receive such regulatory protection from adverse weather in our rates in the future the loss of such weather–normalized rates could have an adverse effect on our operations and financial results in addition our natural gas distribution and regulated transmission and storage operating results may continue to vary somewhat with the actual temperatures during the winter heating season sustained cold weather could adversely affect our nonregulated operations as we may be required to purchase gas at spot rates in a rising market to obtain sufficient volumes to fulfill some customer contracts additionally sustained cold weather could challenge our ability to adequately meet customer demand in our natural gas distribution and regulated transmission and storage operations 

inflation and increased gas costs could adversely impact our customer base and customer collections and increase our level of indebtedness 

inflation has caused increases in some of our operating expenses and has required assets to be replaced at higher costs we have a process in place to continually review the adequacy of our natural gas distribution gas rates in relation to the increasing cost of providing service and the inherent regulatory lag in adjusting those gas rates historically we have been able to budget and control operating expenses and investments within the amounts authorized to be collected in rates and intend to continue to do so however the ability to control expenses is an important factor that could impact future financial results 

rapid increases in the costs of purchased gas would cause us to experience a significant increase in shortterm debt we must pay suppliers for gas when it is purchased which can be significantly in advance of when these costs may be recovered through the collection of monthly customer bills for gas delivered increases in purchased gas costs also slow our natural gas distribution collection efforts as customers are more likely to delay the payment of their gas bills leading to higher than normal accounts receivable this could result in higher shortterm debt levels greater collection efforts and increased bad debt expense 

  

our growth in the future may be limited by the nature of our business which requires extensive capital spending 

we must continually build additional capacity in our natural gas distribution system to enable us to serve any growth in the number of our customers the cost of adding this capacity may be affected by a number of factors including the general state of the economy and weather in addition although we should ultimately recover the cost of the expenditures through rates we must make significant capital expenditures to comply with the recent rule issued by the rrc’s division of public safety that requires natural gas distribution companies to develop and implement a riskbased program for the renewal or replacement of distribution facilities including steel service lines our cash flows from operations generally are sufficient to supply funding for all our capital expenditures including the financing of the costs of new construction along with capital expenditures necessary to maintain our existing natural gas system due to the timing of these cash flows and capital expenditures we often must fund at least a portion of these costs through borrowing funds from third party lenders the cost and availability of which is dependent on the liquidity of the credit markets interest rates and other market conditions this in turn may limit our ability to connect new customers to our system due to constraints on the amount of funds we can invest in our infrastructure 

our operations are subject to increased competition 

in residential and commercial customer markets our natural gas distribution operations compete with other energy products such as electricity and propane our primary product competition is with electricity for heating water heating and cooking increases in the price of natural gas could negatively impact our competitive position by decreasing the price benefits of natural gas to the consumer this could adversely impact our business if as a result our customer growth slows reducing our ability to make capital expenditures or if our customers further conserve their use of gas resulting in reduced gas purchases and customer billings 

in the case of industrial customers such as manufacturing plants adverse economic conditions including higher gas costs could cause these customers to use alternative sources of energy such as electricity or bypass our systems in favor of special competitive contracts with lower perunit costs our regulated transmission and storage operations historically have faced limited competition from other existing intrastate pipelines and gas marketers seeking to provide or arrange transportation storage and other services for customers however in the last few years several new pipelines have been completed which has increased the level of competition in this segment of our business within our nonregulated operations aem competes with other natural gas marketers to provide natural gas management and other related services primarily to smaller customers requiring higher levels of balancing scheduling and other related management services aem has experienced increased competition in recent years primarily from investment banks and major integrated oil and natural gas companies who offer lower cost basic services 

cyberattacks or acts of cyberterrorism could disrupt our business operations and information technology systems or result in the loss or exposure of confidential or sensitive customer employee or company information 

our business operations and information technology systems may be vulnerable to an attack by individuals or organizations intending to disrupt our business operations and information technology systems we use such systems to manage our natural gas distribution and intrastate pipeline operations and other business processes disruption of those systems could adversely impact our ability to safely deliver natural gas to our customers operate our pipeline systems or serve our customers timely accordingly if such an attack or act of terrorism were to occur our operations and financial results could be adversely affected in addition we use our information technology systems to protect confidential or sensitive customer employee and company information developed and maintained in the normal course of our business any attack on such systems that would result in the unauthorized release of customer employee or other confidential or sensitive data could have a material adverse effect on our business reputation increase our costs and expose us to additional material legal claims and liability as a result if such an attack or act of terrorism were to occur our operations and financial results could be adversely affected 

  

distributing transporting and storing natural gas involve risks that may result in accidents and additional operating costs 

our natural gas distribution and pipeline and storage businesses involve a number of hazards and operating risks that cannot be completely avoided such as leaks accidents and operational problems which could cause loss of human life as well as substantial financial losses resulting from property damage damage to the environment and to our operations we maintain liability and property insurance coverage in place for many of these hazards and risks however because some of our pipeline storage and distribution facilities are near or are in populated areas any loss of human life or adverse financial results resulting from such events could be large if these events were not fully covered by insurance our operations or financial results could be adversely affected 

natural disasters terrorist activities or other significant events could adversely affect our operations or financial results 

natural disasters are always a threat to our assets and operations in addition the threat of terrorist activities could lead to increased economic instability and volatility in the price of natural gas that could affect our operations also companies in our industry may face a heightened risk of exposure to actual acts of terrorism which could subject our operations to increased risks as a result the availability of insurance covering such risks may be more limited which could increase the risk that an event could adversely affect our operations or financial results

this section provides management’s discussion of the financial condition changes in financial condition and results of operations of atmos energy corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries with specific information on results of operations and liquidity and capital resources it includes management’s interpretation of our financial results the factors affecting these results the major factors expected to affect future operating results and future investment and financing plans this discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 

several factors exist that could influence our future financial performance some of which are described in item 1a above “risk factors” they should be considered in connection with evaluating forwardlooking statements contained in this report or otherwise made by or on behalf of us since these factors could cause actual results and conditions to differ materially from those set out in such forwardlooking statements 

cautionary statement for the purposes of the safe harbor under the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 

the statements contained in this annual report on form 10k may contain “forwardlooking statements” within the meaning of section 27a of the securities act of 1933 and section 21e of the securities exchange act of 1934 all statements other than statements of historical fact included in this report are forwardlooking statements made in good faith by us and are intended to qualify for the safe harbor from liability established by the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 when used in this report or any other of our documents or oral presentations the words “anticipate” “believe” “estimate” “expect” “forecast” “goal” “intend” “objective” “plan” “projection” “seek” “strategy” or similar words are intended to identify forwardlooking statements such forwardlooking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the statements relating to our strategy operations markets services rates recovery of costs availability of gas supply and other factors these risks and uncertainties include the following our ability to continue to access the credit markets to satisfy our liquidity requirements the impact of adverse economic conditions on our customers increased costs of providing pension and postretirement health care benefits and increased funding requirements along with increased costs of health care benefits market risks beyond our control affecting our risk management activities including market liquidity commodity price volatility increasing interest rates and counterparty creditworthiness regulatory trends and decisions including the impact of rate proceedings before various state regulatory commissions possible increased federal state and local regulation of the safety of our operations increased federal regulatory oversight and potential penalties the impact of environmental regulations on our business the impact of possible future additional regulatory and financial risks associated with global warming and climate change on our business the concentration of our distribution pipeline and storage operations in texas adverse weather conditions the effects of inflation and changes in the availability and price of natural gas the capitalintensive nature of our gas distribution business increased competition from energy suppliers and alternative forms of energy the threat of cyberattacks or acts of cyberterrorism that could disrupt our business operations and information technology systems the inherent hazards and risks involved in operating our gas distribution business natural disasters terrorist activities or other events and other risks and uncertainties discussed herein all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond our control accordingly while we believe these forwardlooking statements to be reasonable there can be no assurance that they will approximate actual experience or that the expectations derived from them will be realized further we undertake no obligation to update or revise any of our forwardlooking statements whether as a result of new information future events or otherwise 

critical accounting policies 

our consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and the related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ from estimates 

  

our significant accounting policies are discussed in note 2 to our consolidated financial statements the accounting policies discussed below are both important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and require management to make difficult subjective or complex accounting estimates accordingly these critical accounting policies are reviewed periodically by the audit committee of the board of directors 

regulation — our natural gas distribution and regulated transmission and storage operations are subject to regulation with respect to rates service maintenance of accounting records and various other matters by the respective regulatory authorities in the states in which we operate we meet the criteria established within accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of a costbased rateregulated entity which requires us to reflect the financial effects of the ratemaking and accounting practices and policies of the various regulatory commissions in our financial statements in accordance with applicable authoritative accounting standards we apply the provisions of this standard to our regulated operations and record regulatory assets for costs that have been deferred for which future recovery through customer rates is considered probable and regulatory liabilities when it is probable that revenues will be reduced for amounts that will be credited to customers through the ratemaking process as a result certain costs that would normally be expensed under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states are permitted to be capitalized or deferred on the balance sheet because it is probable they can be recovered through rates discontinuing the application of this method of accounting for regulatory assets and liabilities could significantly increase our operating expenses as fewer costs would likely be capitalized or deferred on the balance sheet which could reduce our net income further regulation may impact the period in which revenues or expenses are recognized the amounts to be recovered or recognized are based upon historical experience and our understanding of the regulations the impact of regulation on our regulated operations may be affected by decisions of the regulatory authorities or the issuance of new regulations 

unbilled revenue — sales of natural gas to our natural gas distribution customers are billed on a monthly basis however the billing cycle periods for certain classes of customers do not necessarily coincide with accounting periods used for financial reporting purposes we follow the revenue accrual method of accounting for natural gas distribution segment revenues whereby revenues applicable to gas delivered to customers but not yet billed under the cycle billing method are estimated and accrued and the related costs are charged to expense 

on occasion we are permitted to implement new rates that have not been formally approved by our regulatory authorities which are subject to refund we recognize this revenue and establish a reserve for amounts that could be refunded based on our experience for the jurisdiction in which the rates were implemented 

financial instruments and hedging activities — we use financial instruments to mitigate commodity price risk and interest rate risk the objectives for using financial instruments have been tailored to meet the needs of our regulated and nonregulated businesses these objectives are more fully described in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements 

we record all of our financial instruments on the balance sheet at fair value as required by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  with changes in fair value ultimately recorded in the income statement market value changes result in a change in the fair value of these financial instruments the recognition of the changes in fair value of these financial instruments are recorded in the income statement is contingent upon whether the financial instrument has been designated and qualifies as a part of a hedging relationship or if regulatory rulings require a different accounting treatment 

we have elected to treat forward gas supply contracts used in our regulated operations to deliver gas as normal purchases and normal sales financial instruments used to manage commodity price risk in our natural gas distribution segment do not impact this segment’s results of operations as the realized gains and losses are ultimately recovered from ratepayers through our rates 

our nonregulated segment also utilizes financial instruments to manage commodity price risk we have designated the natural gas inventory held by this operating segment as the hedged item in a fairvalue hedge the financial instruments associated with this natural gas inventory have been designated as fairvalue hedges changes in the fair value of the inventory and designated hedges are recognized in purchased gas cost in the period of change 

  

additionally we have elected to treat fixedprice forward contracts used in our nonregulated segment to deliver gas as normal purchases and normal sales financial instruments used to mitigate the commodity price risk associated with these contracts have been designated as cash flow hedges of anticipated purchases and sales at indexed prices accordingly unrealized gains and losses on open financial instruments are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss and are recognized as a component of revenue when the hedged volumes are sold 

our nonregulated segment also uses storage swaps and futures that have not been designated as hedges accordingly changes in the fair value of the inventory and designated hedges are recognized in revenue in the period of change 

finally financial instruments used to mitigate interest rate risk are designated as cash flow hedges accordingly unrealized gains and losses are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss and are recognized as a component of interest expense over the life of the related financing arrangement 

the criteria used to determine if a financial instrument meets the definition of a derivative and qualifies for hedge accounting treatment are complex and require management to exercise professional judgment further as more fully discussed below significant changes in the fair value of these financial instruments could materially impact our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

fair value measurements — we report certain assets and liabilities at fair value which is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date exit price 

prices actively quoted on national exchanges are used to determine the fair value of most of our assets and liabilities recorded on our balance sheet at fair value within our nonregulated operations we utilize a midmarket pricing convention the midpoint between the bid and ask prices for determining fair value measurement as permitted under current accounting standards values derived from these sources reflect the market in which transactions involving these financial instruments are executed 

we utilize models and other valuation methods to determine fair value when external sources are not available values are adjusted to reflect the potential impact of an orderly liquidation of our positions over a reasonable period of time under thencurrent market conditions 

fairvalue estimates also consider our own creditworthiness and the creditworthiness of the counterparties involved our counterparties consist primarily of financial institutions and major energy companies this concentration of counterparties may materially impact our exposure to credit risk resulting from market economic or regulatory conditions we seek to minimize counterparty credit risk through an evaluation of their financial condition and credit ratings and the use of collateral requirements under certain circumstances 

the fair value of our financial instruments is subject to potentially significant volatility based numerous considerations including but not limited to changes in commodity prices interest rates maturity and settlement of these financial instruments and our creditworthiness as well as the creditworthiness of our counterparties we believe the market prices and models used to value these financial instruments represent the best information available with respect to closing exchange and overthecounter quotations time value and volatility factors underlying the contracts 

impairment assessments — we review the carrying value of our longlived assets including goodwill and identifiable intangibles whenever events or changes in circumstance indicate that such carrying values may not be recoverable and at least annually for goodwill as required by us accounting standards 

the evaluation of our goodwill balances and other longlived assets or identifiable assets for which uncertainty exists regarding the recoverability of the carrying value of such assets involves the assessment of future cash flows and external market conditions and other subjective factors that could impact the estimation of future cash flows including but not limited to the commodity prices the amount and timing of future cash flows future growth rates and the discount rate unforeseen events and changes in circumstances or market conditions could adversely affects these estimates which could result in an impairment charge 

  

pension and other postretirement plans — pension and other postretirement plan costs and liabilities are determined on an actuarial basis using a september 30 measurement date and are affected by numerous assumptions and estimates including the market value of plan assets estimates of the expected return on plan assets assumed discount rates and current demographic and actuarial mortality data the assumed discount rate and the expected return are the assumptions that generally have the most significant impact on our pension costs and liabilities the assumed discount rate the assumed health care cost trend rate and assumed rates of retirement generally have the most significant impact on our postretirement plan costs and liabilities 

the discount rate is utilized principally in calculating the actuarial present value of our pension and postretirement obligations and net periodic pension and postretirement benefit plan costs when establishing our discount rate we consider high quality corporate bond rates based on bonds available in the marketplace that are suitable for settling the obligations changes in those rates from the prior year and the implied discount rate that is derived from matching our projected benefit disbursements with currently available high quality corporate bonds 

the expected longterm rate of return on assets is utilized in calculating the expected return on plan assets component of our annual pension and postretirement plan costs we estimate the expected return on plan assets by evaluating expected bond returns equity risk premiums asset allocations the effects of active plan management the impact of periodic plan asset rebalancing and historical performance we also consider the guidance from our investment advisors in making a final determination of our expected rate of return on assets to the extent the actual rate of return on assets realized over the course of a year is greater than or less than the assumed rate that year’s annual pension or postretirement plan costs are not affected rather this gain or loss reduces or increases future pension or postretirement plan costs over a period of approximately ten to twelve years 

the marketrelated value of our plan assets represents the fair market value of the plan assets adjusted to smooth out shortterm market fluctuations over a fiveyear period the use of this calculation will delay the impact of current market fluctuations on the pension expense for the period 

we estimate the assumed health care cost trend rate used in determining our postretirement net expense based upon our actual health care cost experience the effects of recently enacted legislation and general economic conditions our assumed rate of retirement is estimated based upon our annual review of our participant census information as of the measurement date 

actual changes in the fair market value of plan assets and differences between the actual and expected return on plan assets could have a material effect on the amount of pension costs ultimately recognized a 025 percent change in our discount rate would impact our pension and postretirement costs by approximately 23 million a 025 percent change in our expected rate of return would impact our pension and postretirement costs by approximately 08 million 

contingencies — in the normal course of business we are confronted with issues or events that may result in a contingent liability these generally relate to lawsuits claims made by third parties or the action of various regulatory agencies for such matters we record liabilities when they are considered probable and reasonably estimable based on currently available facts and our estimates of the ultimate outcome or resolution of the liability in the future actual results may differ from estimates depending on actual outcomes or changes in the facts or expectations surrounding each potential exposure changes in the estimates related to contingencies could have a negative impact on our consolidated results of operations cash flows or financial position our contingencies are further discussed in note 13 to our consolidated financial statements 

results of operations 

overview 

atmos energy corporation is involved in the distribution marketing and transportation of natural gas accordingly our results of operations are impacted by the demand for natural gas particularly during the winter heating season and the volatility of the natural gas markets this generally results in higher operating revenues and net income during the period from october through march of each fiscal year and lower operating revenues and either lower net income or net losses during the period from april through september of each fiscal year as 

  

a result of the seasonality of the natural gas industry our second fiscal quarter has historically been our most critical earnings quarter with an average of approximately 56 percent of our consolidated net income having been earned in the second quarter during the three most recently completed fiscal years 

additionally the seasonality of our business impacts our working capital differently at various times during the year typically our accounts receivable accounts payable and shortterm debt balances peak by the end of january and then start to decline as customers begin to pay their winter heating bills gas stored underground particularly in our natural gas distribution segment typically peaks in november and declines as we utilize storage gas to serve our customers 

during fiscal 2012 we earned 2167 million or 237 per diluted share which represents a four percent increase in net income and diluted net income per share over fiscal 2011 during fiscal 2012 recent improvements in rate designs in our natural gas distribution and regulated transmission and storage segments offset an eight percent yearoveryear decline in consolidated natural gas distribution throughput due to warmer weather and a 21 percent decrease in nonregulated delivered gas sales due to a nine percent decrease in consolidated sales volumes as a result of warmer weather and a decrease in perunit margins additionally results for fiscal 2012 were influenced by several nonrecurring items which increased diluted earnings per share by 011 

on august 1 2012 we completed the sale of substantially all of our natural gas distribution assets located in missouri illinois and iowa to liberty energy midstates corp an affiliate of algonquin power  utilities corp for a cash price of approximately 128 million pursuant to an asset purchase agreement executed on may 12 2011 in connection with the sale we recognized a net of tax gain of approximately 63 million 

on august 8 2012 we entered into an asset purchase agreement to sell all of our natural gas distribution assets located in georgia to liberty energy georgia corp an affiliate of algonquin power  utilities corp for a cash price of approximately 141 million the agreement contains terms and conditions customary for transactions of this type including typical adjustments to the purchase price at closing if applicable the closing of the transaction is subject to the satisfaction of customary conditions including the receipt of applicable regulatory approvals due to the pending sales transaction the results of operations for our georgia service area are shown in discontinued operations 

our unsecured 5125 senior notes were scheduled to mature in january 2013 on july 27 2012 we issued a notice of early redemption of these notes on august 28 2012 we initially funded the redemption through the issuance of commercial paper on september 27 2012 we entered into a 260 million shortterm financing facility to repay the commercial paper borrowings utilized to redeem the notes the facility bears interest at a onemonth libor based rate plus currently a margin of 0875 which is based on the company’s credit rating the shortterm facility is expected to be repaid with the proceeds received from the issuance of new 350 million senior unsecured notes anticipated to occur in january 2013 in connection with the redemption we paid a makewhole premium in accordance with the terms of the indenture and the senior notes and accrued interest at the time of redemption in accordance with regulatory requirements the premium will be deferred and will be recognized over the life of the new unsecured notes expected to be issued in january 2013

 see the following discussion regarding the results of operations for each of our business operating segments 

natural gas distribution segment 

the primary factors that impact the results of our natural gas distribution operations are our ability to earn our authorized rates of return the cost of natural gas competitive factors in the energy industry and economic conditions in our service areas 

our ability to earn our authorized rates is based primarily on our ability to improve the rate design in our various ratemaking jurisdictions by reducing or eliminating regulatory lag and ultimately separating the recovery of our approved margins from customer usage patterns improving rate design is a longterm process and is further complicated by the fact that we operate in multiple rate jurisdictions the “ratemaking activity” section of this form 10k describes our current rate strategy progress towards implementing that strategy and recent ratemaking initiatives in more detail 

we are generally able to pass the cost of gas through to our customers without markup under purchased gas cost adjustment mechanisms therefore the cost of gas typically does not have an impact on our gross profit as increases in the cost of gas are offset by a corresponding increase in revenues accordingly we believe gross profit is a better indicator of our financial performance than revenues however gross profit in our texas and mississippi service areas include franchise fees and gross receipts taxes which are calculated as a percentage of revenue inclusive of gas costs therefore the amount of these taxes included in revenues is influenced by the 

  

cost of gas and the level of gas sales volumes we record the tax expense as a component of taxes other than income although changes in revenuerelated taxes arising from changes in gas costs affect gross profit over time the impact is offset within operating income 

as discussed above the cost of gas typically does not have a direct impact on our gross profit however higher gas costs may adversely impact our accounts receivable collections resulting in higher bad debt expense and may require us to increase borrowings under our credit facilities resulting in higher interest expense in addition higher gas costs as well as competitive factors in the industry and general economic conditions may cause customers to conserve or in the case of industrial consumers to use alternative energy sources however gas cost risk has been mitigated in recent years through improvements in rate design that allow us to collect from our customers the gas cost portion of our bad debt expense on approximately 75 percent of our residential and commercial margins 

as discussed above on august 1 2012 we completed the sale of substantially all of our natural gas distribution operations in missouri illinois and iowa on august 8 2012 we entered into a definitive agreement to sell our natural gas distribution operations in georgia the results of these operations have been separately reported in the following tables and exclude general corporate overhead and interest expense that would normally be allocated to these operations 

review of financial and operating results 

financial and operational highlights for our natural gas distribution segment for the fiscal years ended september 30 2012 2011 and 2010 are presented below 

 

   

fiscal year ended september 30 2012 compared with fiscal year ended september 30 2011 

the 48 million increase in natural gas distribution gross profit was primarily due to a 177 million net increase in rate adjustments primarily in the midtex louisiana mississippi west texas and kentucky service areas 

these increases were partially offset by the following 

 

  

 operating expenses which include operation and maintenance expense provision for doubtful accounts depreciation and amortization expense and taxes other than income increased 224 million primarily due to the following 

 

  

  

  

 these increases were partially offset by the following 

 

  

 miscellaneous income decreased 289 million primarily due to the absence of a 218 million pretax gain recognized in the prior year as a result of unwinding two treasury locks 136 million net of tax and a 100 million onetime donation to a donor advised fund in the current year 

interest charges decreased 51 million compared to the prior year due primarily to the prepayment of our 5125 250 million senior notes in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 refinancing longterm debt at reduced interest rates and reducing commitment fees from decreasing the number of credit facilities and extending the length of their terms in fiscal 2011 

additionally results for fiscal 2012 were favorably impacted by a state tax benefit of 113 million due to the completion of the sale of our missouri iowa and illinois service areas in the fiscal fourth quarter the company updated its analysis of the tax rate at which deferred taxes would reverse in the future to reflect the sale of these service areas the updated analysis supported a reduction in the deferred tax rate which when applied to the balance of taxable income deferred to future periods resulted in a reduction of the company’s overall deferred tax liability 

fiscal year ended september 30 2011 compared with fiscal year ended september 30 2010 

the 193 million increase in natural gas distribution gross profit primarily reflects a 386 million net increase in rate adjustments primarily in the midtex louisiana kentucky and kansas service areas 

these increases were partially offset by 

 

  

   

operating expenses which include operation and maintenance expense provision for doubtful accounts depreciation and amortization expense and taxes other than income decreased 59 million primarily due to the following 

 

  

 these decreases were partially offset by 

 

  

  

 net income for this segment for fiscal 2011 was also favorably impacted by a 218 million pretax gain recognized in march 2011 as a result of unwinding two treasury locks and a 50 million income tax benefit related to the administrative settlement of various income tax positions 

the following table shows our operating income from continuing operations by natural gas distribution division in order of total rate base for the fiscal years ended september 30 2012 2011 and 2010 the presentation of our natural gas distribution operating income is included for financial reporting purposes and may not be appropriate for ratemaking purposes 

 

 regulated transmission and storage segment 

our regulated transmission and storage segment consists of the regulated pipeline and storage operations of the atmos pipeline — texas division the atmos pipeline — texas division transports natural gas to our midtex division and third parties and manages five underground storage reservoirs in texas we also provide ancillary services customary in the pipeline industry including parking arrangements lending and sales of excess gas 

our regulated transmission and storage segment is impacted by seasonal weather patterns competitive factors in the energy industry and economic conditions in our midtex service area natural gas prices do not directly impact the results of this segment as revenues are derived from the transportation of natural gas however natural gas prices and demand for natural gas could influence the level of drilling activity in the markets that we serve which may influence the level of throughput we may be able to transport on our pipeline further natural gas price differences between the various hubs that we serve could influence customers to transport gas through our pipeline to capture arbitrage gains 

the results of atmos pipeline — texas division are also significantly impacted by the natural gas requirements of the midtex division because it is the primary supplier of natural gas for our midtex division 

finally as a regulated pipeline the operations of the atmos pipeline — texas division may be impacted by the timing of when costs and expenses are incurred and when these costs and expenses are recovered through its tariffs 

  

review of financial and operating results 

financial and operational highlights for our regulated transmission and storage segment for the fiscal years ended september 30 2012 2011 and 2010 are presented below 

 

 fiscal year ended september 30 2012 compared with fiscal year ended september 30 2011 

the 280 million increase in regulated transmission and storage gross profit compared to the prior year was primarily a result of the rate case that was finalized and became effective in may 2011 as well as the grip filings approved by the railroad commission of texas rrc during fiscal 2011 and 2012 in may 2011 the rrc issued an order in the rate case of atmos pipeline — texas that approved an annual operating income increase of 204 million during fiscal 2011 the rrc approved the atmos pipeline — texas grip filing with an annual operating income increase of 126 million that went into effect in the fiscal fourth quarter on april 10 2012 the rrc approved the atmos pipeline — texas grip filing with an annual operating income increase of 147 million that went into effect with bills rendered on an after april 10 2012 

operating expenses increased 74 million primarily due to a 54 million increase in depreciation expense resulting from higher investment in net plant 

additionally results for fiscal 2012 were favorably impacted by a state tax benefit of 23 million associated with an update of the estimated tax rate at which deferred taxes would reverse in future periods after the completion of the sale of our missouri illinois and iowa assets net income for this segment for the prior year was favorably impacted by a 60 million pretax gain recognized in march 2011 as a result of unwinding two treasury locks 39 million net of tax 

fiscal year ended september 30 2011 compared with fiscal year ended september 30 2010 

on april 18 2011 the rrc issued an order in the rate case of atmos pipeline — texas apt that was originally filed in september 2010 the rrc approved an annual operating income increase of 204 million as well as the following major provisions that went into effect with bills rendered on and after may 1 2011 

 

  

   

  

  

 the 164 million increase in regulated transmission and storage gross profit was attributable primarily to the following 

 

  

 these increases were partially offset by the following 

 

  

 operating expenses increased 51 million primarily due to the following 

 

  

 these increases were partially offset by the following 

 

  

 miscellaneous income includes a 60 million gain recognized in march 2011 as a result of unwinding two treasury locks 

nonregulated segment 

our nonregulated activities are conducted through atmos energy holdings inc aeh which is a whollyowned subsidiary of atmos energy corporation and operates primarily in the midwest and southeast areas of the united states 

aeh’s primary business is to deliver gas and provide related services by aggregating and purchasing gas supply arranging transportation and storage logistics and ultimately delivering gas to customers at competitive prices these activities are reflected as gas delivery and related services in the table below 

aeh also earns storage and transportation margins from i utilizing its proprietary 21mile pipeline located in new orleans louisiana to aggregate gas supply for our regulated natural gas distribution division in louisiana its gas delivery activities and on a more limited basis for third parties and ii managing proprietary storage in kentucky and louisiana to supplement the natural gas needs of our natural gas distribution divisions during peak periods most of these margins are generated through demand fees established under contracts with certain of our natural gas distribution divisions that are renewed periodically and subject to regulatory oversight these activities are reflected as storage and transportation services in the table below 

aeh utilizes customerowned or contracted storage capacity to serve its customers in an effort to offset the demand fees paid to contract for storage capacity and to maximize the value of this capacity aeh sells financial instruments in an effort to earn a gross profit margin through the arbitrage of pricing differences in various locations and by recognizing pricing differences that occur over time margins earned from these activities and the related storage demand fees are reported as asset optimization margins certain of these arrangements are with regulated affiliates which have been approved by applicable state regulatory commissions 

  

  

our nonregulated activities are significantly influenced by competitive factors in the industry and general economic conditions therefore the margins earned from these activities are dependent upon our ability to attract and retain customers and to minimize the cost of gas and demand fees paid to contract for storage capacity to offer more competitive pricing to those customers 

further natural gas market conditions most notably the price of natural gas and the level of price volatility affect our nonregulated businesses natural gas prices and the level of volatility are influenced by a number of factors including but not limited to general economic conditions the demand for natural gas in different parts of the country the level of domestic natural gas production and the level of natural gas inventory levels 

natural gas prices can influence 

 

  

  

 natural gas price volatility can also influence our nonregulated business in the following ways 

 

  

  

 our nonregulated segment manages its exposure to natural gas commodity price risk through a combination of physical storage and financial instruments therefore results for this segment include unrealized gains or losses on its net physical gas position and the related financial instruments used to manage commodity price risk these margins fluctuate based upon changes in the spreads between the physical and forward natural gas prices generally if the physicalfinancial spread narrows we will record unrealized gains or lower unrealized losses if the physicalfinancial spread widens we will generally record unrealized losses or lower unrealized gains the magnitude of the unrealized gains and losses is also contingent upon the levels of our net physical position at the end of the reporting period 

  

review of financial and operating results 

financial and operational highlights for our nonregulated segment for the fiscal years ended september 30 2012 2011 and 2010 are presented below 

 

  

 

 fiscal year ended september 30 2012 compared with fiscal year ended september 30 2011 

results for our nonregulated operations during fiscal 2012 were adversely influenced by continued unfavorable natural gas market conditions historically high natural gas storage levels from strong domestic natural gas production caused natural gas prices to remain relatively low during fiscal 2012 additionally we continued to experience compressed spot to forward spread values and basis differentials 

we anticipate these natural gas market conditions will continue for the foreseeable future as a result we anticipate that basis differentials will remain compressed and spottoforward price volatility will remain relatively low accordingly although we anticipate continuing to profit on a fiscalyear basis from our nonregulated activities we anticipate perunit margins from our delivered gas activities and margins earned from our asset optimization activities for the foreseeable future to be more consistent with the performance we have experienced during the last two fiscal years 

  

realized margins for gas delivery storage and transportation services and other services were 637 million during the year ended september 30 2012 compared with 788 million for the prior year the decrease reflects the following 

 

  

 asset optimization margins increased 29 million from the prior year the increase primarily reflects higher realized margins earned from the settlement of financial instruments used to hedge our natural gas inventory purchases partially offset by increased storage fees associated with increased park and loan activity and a 17 million charge in the first fiscal quarter of the current year to write down to market certain natural gas inventory that no longer qualified for fair value hedge accounting 

unrealized margins increased 24 million in the current year compared to the prior year primarily due to the timing of yearoveryear realized margins 

operating expenses excluding asset impairments decreased 22 million primarily due to lower employeerelated expenses 

during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 we recorded a 53 million noncash charge to impair our natural gas gathering assets located in kentucky the charge reflected a reduction in the value of the project due to the current low natural gas price environment and management’s decision to focus aeh’s activities on its gas delivery storage and transportation services in the prior year asset impairments included an asset impairment charge of 193 million related to our investment in our fort necessity storage project as well as an 110 million pretax impairment charge related to the writeoff of certain natural gas gathering assets 

fiscal year ended september 30 2011 compared with fiscal year ended september 30 2010 

realized margins for gas delivery storage and transportation services and other services were 788 million during the year ended september 30 2011 compared with 781 million for the prioryear period the increase primarily reflects the following 

 

  

 the 472 million decrease in realized asset optimization margins from the prior year primarily reflects the unfavorable impact of weak natural gas market fundamentals which provided fewer favorable trading opportunities 

unrealized margins decreased 26 million in the current period compared to the prioryear period primarily due to the timing of yearoveryear realized margins 

operating expenses decreased 50 million primarily due to lower employeerelated expenses and ad valorem taxes 

during fiscal 2011 our nonregulated segment recognized 303 million of noncash asset impairment charges associated with the two aforementioned projects 

interest charges decreased 66 million primarily due to a decrease in intercompany borrowings 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

the liquidity required to fund our working capital capital expenditures and other cash needs is provided from a variety of sources including internally generated funds and borrowings under our commercial paper program and bank credit facilities additionally we have various uncommitted trade credit lines with our gas suppliers that we utilize to purchase natural gas on a monthly basis finally from time to time we raise funds from the public debt and equity capital markets to fund our liquidity needs 

we regularly evaluate our funding strategy and profile to ensure that we have sufficient liquidity for our shortterm and longterm needs in a costeffective manner we also evaluate the levels of committed borrowing capacity that we require 

our unsecured 5125 senior notes were scheduled to mature in january 2013 on august 28 2012 we redeemed these notes with proceeds received through the issuance of commercial paper on september 27 2012 we entered into a 260 million shortterm financing facility that expires february 1 2013 to repay the commercial paper borrowings utilized to redeem the notes the shortterm facility is expected to be repaid with the proceeds from the 350 million 30year unsecured senior notes which are expected to be issued in january 2013 we fixed the treasury yield component of the interest cost associated with these anticipated senior notes at 407 by executing three treasury lock agreements in august 2011 we designated all of these treasury locks as cash flow hedges 

we believe the liquidity provided by our senior notes and committed credit facilities combined with our operating cash flows will be sufficient to fund our working capital needs and capital expenditure program for fiscal year 2013 

cash flows 

our internally generated funds may change in the future due to a number of factors some of which we cannot control these include regulatory changes the price for our services the demand for such products and services margin requirements resulting from significant changes in commodity prices operational risks and other factors 

cash flows from operating investing and financing activities for the years ended september 30 2012 2011 and 2010 are presented below 

 

 cash flows from operating activities 

yearoveryear changes in our operating cash flows primarily are attributable to changes in net income working capital changes particularly within our natural gas distribution segment resulting from the price of natural gas and the timing of customer collections payments for natural gas purchases and purchased gas cost recoveries the significant factors impacting our operating cash flow for the last three fiscal years are summarized below 

  

fiscal year ended september 30 2012 compared with fiscal year ended september 30 2011 

for the fiscal year ended september 30 2012 we generated operating cash flow of 5869 million from operating activities compared with 5828 million in the prior year the yearoveryear increase reflects changes in working capital offset by the 567 million increase in contributions made to our pension and postretirement plans during fiscal 2012 

fiscal year ended september 30 2011 compared with fiscal year ended september 30 2010 

for the fiscal year ended september 30 2011 we generated operating cash flow of 5828 million from operating activities compared with 7265 million in fiscal september 30 2010 the yearoveryear decrease reflects the absence of an 85 million income tax refund received in the prior year coupled with the timing of gas cost recoveries under our purchased gas cost mechanisms and other net working capital changes 

cash flows from investing activities 

in recent fiscal years a substantial portion of our cash resources has been used to fund our ongoing construction program and improvements to information technology systems our ongoing construction program enables us to provide safe and reliable natural gas distribution services to our existing customer base expand our natural gas distribution services into new markets enhance the integrity of our pipelines and more recently expand our intrastate pipeline network in executing our current rate strategy we are focusing our capital spending in jurisdictions that permit us to earn an adequate return timely on our investment without compromising the safety or reliability of our system currently our midtex louisiana mississippi and west texas natural gas distribution divisions and our atmos pipeline — texas division have rate designs that provide the opportunity to include in their rate base approved capital costs on a periodic basis without being required to file a rate case 

in early fiscal 2010 two coalitions of cities representing the majority of the cities our midtex division serves agreed to a program of installing beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2011 100000 steel service line replacements during fiscal 2011 and 2012 with approved recovery of the associated return depreciation and taxes for lines replaced between october 1 2010 and september 30 2012 as of september 30 2012 we had replaced 98675 lines since october 1 2010 we have spent 1163 million on steel service line replacements 

for the fiscal year ended september 30 2012 we incurred 7329 million for capital expenditures compared with 6230 million for the fiscal year ended september 30 2011 and 5426 million for the fiscal year ended september 30 2010 

the 1099 million increase in capital expenditures in fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011 primarily reflects spending for the steel service line replacement program in the midtex division the development of new customer billing and information systems for our natural gas distribution and our nonregulated segments and increased capital spending to increase the capacity on our atmos pipeline — texas system as a result of these projects we anticipate capital expenditures will remain elevated during the next fiscal year 

the 804 million increase in capital expenditures in fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 primarily reflects spending for the steel service line replacement program in the midtex division the development of new customer billing and information systems for our natural gas distribution and our nonregulated segments and the construction of a new customer contact center in amarillo texas partially offset by costs incurred in the prior fiscal year to relocate the company’s information technology data center 

cash flows from financing activities 

for the fiscal year ended september 30 2012 our financing activities used 448 million in cash while financing activities for the fiscal year ended september 30 2011 generated 440 million in cash compared with cash of 1630 million used for the fiscal year ended september 30 2010 our significant financing activities for the fiscal years ended september 30 2012 2011 and 2010 are summarized as follows

the following table shows the number of shares issued for the fiscal years ended september 30 2012 2011 and 2010 

 

 the decreased number of shares issued in fiscal 2012 compared with the number of shares issued in fiscal 2011 primarily reflects a decrease in the number of shares issued under our 1998 longterm incentive plan ltip due to the exercise of a significant number of stock options during fiscal 2011 during fiscal 2012 we cancelled and retired 153255 shares attributable to federal withholdings on equity awards and repurchased and retired 387991 shares attributable to our share repurchase program which are not included in the table above 

the increase in the number of shares issued in fiscal 2011 compared with the number of shares issued in fiscal 2010 primarily reflects an increased number of shares issued under our ltip due to the exercise of a significant number of stock options during fiscal 2011 this increase was partially offset by the fact that we purchased shares in the open market rather than issuing new shares for the direct stock purchase plan and the retirement savings plan during fiscal 2011 we cancelled and retired 169793 shares attributable to federal withholdings on equity awards and repurchased and retired 375468 shares attributable to our 2010 accelerated share repurchase agreement which are not included in the table above 

as of september 30 2011 we were authorized to grant awards for up to a maximum of 65 million shares of common stock under our ltip in february 2011 shareholders voted to increase the number of authorized ltip shares by 22 million shares on october 19 2011 we received all required state regulatory approvals to increase the maximum number of authorized ltip shares to 87 million shares subject to certain adjustment provisions on october 28 2011 we filed with the sec a registration statement on form s8 to register an additional 22 million shares we also listed such shares with the new york stock exchange 

credit facilities 

our shortterm borrowing requirements are affected by the seasonal nature of the natural gas business changes in the price of natural gas and the amount of natural gas we need to supply to meet our customers’ needs could significantly affect our borrowing requirements 

we finance our shortterm borrowing requirements through a combination of a 750 million commercial paper program collateralized by our 750 million unsecured credit facility and four committed revolving credit facilities with thirdparty lenders as a result we have approximately 989 million of working capital funding additionally our 750 million unsecured credit facility has an accordion feature which if utilized would increase borrowing capacity to 10 billion we also use intercompany credit facilities to supplement the funding provided by these thirdparty committed credit facilities 

shelf registration 

we have an effective shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission sec that permits us to issue a total of 13 billion in common stock andor debt securities the shelf registration statement has been approved by all requisite state regulatory commissions with the closing of the sale of our missouri illinois and iowa operations on august 1 2012 there are no longer any restrictions on our ability to issue either debt or equity under the shelf until it expires on march 31 2013 with 900 million available for issuance at september 30 2012 we intend to file a new shelf registration statement with the sec for at least 13 billion prior to the expiration of the current shelf 

  

credit ratings 

our credit ratings directly affect our ability to obtain shortterm and longterm financing in addition to the cost of such financing in determining our credit ratings the rating agencies consider a number of quantitative factors including debt to total capitalization operating cash flow relative to outstanding debt operating cash flow coverage of interest and pension liabilities and funding status in addition the rating agencies consider qualitative factors such as consistency of our earnings over time the quality of our management and business strategy the risks associated with our regulated and nonregulated businesses and the regulatory environment in the states where we operate 

our debt is rated by three rating agencies standard  poor’s corporation sp moody’s investors service moody’s and fitch ratings ltd fitch our current debt ratings are all considered investment grade and are as follows 

 

 a significant degradation in our operating performance or a significant reduction in our liquidity caused by more limited access to the private and public credit markets as a result of deteriorating global or national financial and credit conditions could trigger a negative change in our ratings outlook or even a reduction in our credit ratings by the three credit rating agencies this would mean more limited access to the private and public credit markets and an increase in the costs of such borrowings 

a credit rating is not a recommendation to buy sell or hold securities the highest investment grade credit rating is aaa for sp aaa for moody’s and aaa for fitch the lowest investment grade credit rating is bbb for sp baa3 for moody’s and bbb for fitch our credit ratings may be revised or withdrawn at any time by the rating agencies and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating there can be no assurance that a rating will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if in its judgment circumstances so warrant 

debt covenants 

we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants as of september 30 2012 our debt covenants are described in note 7 to the consolidated financial statements 

capitalization 

the following table presents our capitalization as of september 30 2012 and 2011 

 

 total debt as a percentage of total capitalization including shortterm debt was 517 percent at september 30 2012 and 2011 our ratio of total debt to capitalization is typically greater during the winter heating season as we make additional shortterm borrowings to fund natural gas purchases and meet our working capital requirements we intend to continue to maintain our debt to capitalization ratio in a target range of 50 to 55 percent 

  

contractual obligations and commercial commitments 

the following table provides information about contractual obligations and commercial commitments at september 30 2012 

 

  

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 aeh has commitments to purchase physical quantities of natural gas under contracts indexed to the forward nymex strip or fixed price contracts at september 30 2012 aeh was committed to purchase 722 bcf within one year 290 bcf within one to three years and 290 bcf after three years under indexed contracts aeh is committed to purchase 38 bcf within one year and 03 bcf within one to three years under fixed price contracts with prices ranging from 246 to 636 per mcf 

  

with the exception of our midtex division our natural gas distribution segment maintains supply contracts with several vendors that generally cover a period of up to one year commitments for estimated base gas volumes are established under these contracts on a monthly basis at contractually negotiated prices commitments for incremental daily purchases are made as necessary during the month in accordance with the terms of individual contracts our midtex division maintains longterm supply contracts to ensure a reliable source of natural gas for our customers in its service area which obligate it to purchase specified volumes at market prices the estimated commitments under the terms of these contracts as of september 30 2012 are reflected in the table above 

risk management activities 

as discussed above in our critical accounting policies we use financial instruments to mitigate commodity price risk and periodically to manage interest rate risk we conduct risk management activities through our natural gas distribution and nonregulated segments in our natural gas distribution segment we use a combination of physical storage fixed physical contracts and fixed financial contracts to reduce our exposure to unusually large winterperiod gas price increases in our nonregulated segments we manage our exposure to the risk of natural gas price changes and lock in our gross profit margin through a combination of storage and financial instruments including futures overthecounter and exchangetraded options and swap contracts with counterparties to the extent our inventory cost and actual sales and actual purchases do not correlate with the changes in the market indices we use in our hedges we could experience ineffectiveness or the hedges may no longer meet the accounting requirements for hedge accounting resulting in the financial instruments being treated as mark to market instruments through earnings 

we use financial instruments designated as cash flow hedges of anticipated purchases and sales at index prices to mitigate the commodity price risk in our nonregulated segment associated with deliveries under fixedpriced forward contracts to deliver gas to customers and we use financial instruments designated as fair value hedges to hedge our natural gas inventory used in our asset optimization activities in our nonregulated segment 

also in our nonregulated segment we use storage swaps and futures to capture additional storage arbitrage opportunities that arise subsequent to the execution of the original fair value hedge associated with our physical natural gas inventory basis swaps to insulate and protect the economic value of our fixed price and storage books and various overthecounter and exchangetraded options these financial instruments have not been designated as hedges 

we record our financial instruments as a component of risk management assets and liabilities which are classified as current or noncurrent based upon the anticipated settlement date of the underlying financial instrument substantially all of our financial instruments are valued using external market quotes and indices 

the following table shows the components of the change in fair value of our natural gas distribution segment’s financial instruments for the fiscal year ended september 30 2012 in thousands 

 

 the fair value of our natural gas distribution segment’s financial instruments at september 30 2012 is presented below by time period and fair value source 

 

   

the tables above include 01 million of current assets from risk management activities that are classified as assets held for sale and 03 million of current liabilities from risk management activities that are classified as liabilities held for sale in conjunction with the sale of our georgia operations

 the fair value of our nonregulated segment’s financial instruments at september 30 2012 is presented below by time period and fair value source 

 

 employee benefits programs 

an important element of our total compensation program and a significant component of our operation and maintenance expense is the offering of various benefits programs to our employees these programs include medical and dental insurance coverage and pension and postretirement programs 

medical and dental insurance 

we offer medical and dental insurance programs to substantially all of our employees and we believe these programs are consistent with other programs in our industry since 2006 we have experienced medical and prescription inflation of approximately six percent in recent years we have strived to actively manage our health care costs through the introduction of a wellness strategy that is focused on helping employees to identify health risks and to manage these risks through improved lifestyle choices 

in march 2010 president obama signed the patient protection and affordable care act into law the “health care reform act” the health care reform act will be phased in over an eightyear period we have changed the design of our health care plans to comply with provisions of the health care reform act that have already gone into effect or will be going into effect in future years for example lifetime maximums on benefits have been eliminated coverage for dependent children has been extended to age 26 and all costs of preventive coverage must be paid for by the insurer in 2014 health insurance exchanges will open in each state in order to provide a competitive marketplace for purchasing health insurance by individuals companies who offer health insurance to their employees could face a substantial increase in premiums at that time if they choose to continue to provide such coverage however companies who elect to cease providing health insurance to their employees will be faced with paying significant penalties to the federal government for each employee who receives coverage through an exchange we will continue to monitor all developments on health care reform and continue to comply with all existing relevant laws and regulations 

for fiscal 2013 we anticipate an approximate seven percent medical and prescription drug inflation rate primarily due to anticipated higher claims costs and the implementation of the health care reform act 

  

net periodic pension and postretirement benefit costs 

for the fiscal year ended september 30 2012 our total net periodic pension and other benefits costs was 692 million compared with 566 million and 508 million for the fiscal years ended september 30 2011 and 2010 these costs relating to our natural gas distribution operations are recoverable through our gas distribution rates a portion of these costs is capitalized into our gas distribution rate base and the remaining costs are recorded as a component of operation and maintenance expense 

our fiscal 2012 costs were determined using a september 30 2011 measurement date at that date interest and corporate bond rates utilized to determine our discount rates were significantly lower than the interest and corporate bond rates as of september 30 2010 the measurement date for our fiscal 2011 net periodic cost accordingly we decreased our discount rate used to determine our fiscal 2012 pension and benefit costs to 505 percent our expected return on our pension plan assets was reduced to 775 percent due to historical experience and the current market projection of the target asset allocation as a result our fiscal 2012 pension and postretirement medical costs were higher than in the prior year 

the increase in total net periodic pension and other benefits costs during fiscal 2011 compared with fiscal 2010 primarily reflects the decrease in our discount rate at september 30 2010 the measurement date for our fiscal 2011 pension and postretirement costs the discount rate used to compute the present value of a plan’s liabilities generally is based on rates of highgrade corporate bonds with maturities similar to the average period over which the benefits will be paid at our september 30 2010 measurement date the interest rates were significantly higher than the interest rates at september 30 2009 the measurement date used to determine our fiscal 2009 net periodic cost our expected return on our pension plan assets remained constant at 825 percent 

pension and postretirement plan funding 

generally our funding policy is to contribute annually an amount that will at least equal the minimum amount required to comply with the employee retirement income security act of 1974 erisa however additional voluntary contributions are made from time to time as considered necessary contributions are intended to provide not only for benefits attributed to service to date but also for those expected to be earned in the future 

in accordance with the pension protection act of 2006 ppa we determined the funded status of our plans as of january 1 2012 based on this valuation we were required to contribute cash of 465 million to our pension plans during fiscal 2012 the need for this funding primarily reflects a decrease in the discount rate used to determine our obligations under our plans this contribution increased the level of our plan assets to achieve a desirable ppa funding threshold 

during fiscal 2011 we were required to contribute cash of 09 million to our pension plans the need for this funding reflected the decline in the fair value of the plans’ assets resulting from the unfavorable market conditions experienced during 2008 and 2009 this contribution increased the level of our plan assets to achieve a desirable ppa funding threshold during fiscal 2010 we did not contribute cash to our pension plans as the fair value of the plans’ assets recovered somewhat during the year from the unfavorable market conditions experienced in the latter half of calendar year 2008 and our plan assets were sufficient to achieve a desirable funding threshold as established by the ppa 

we contributed 221 million 113 million and 118 million to our postretirement benefits plans for the fiscal years ended september 30 2012 2011 and 2010 the contributions represent the portion of the postretirement costs we are responsible for under the terms of our plan and minimum funding required by state regulatory commissions 

outlook for fiscal 2013 and beyond 

as of september 30 2012 interest and corporate bond rates utilized to determine our discount rates which impacted our fiscal 2013 net periodic pension and postretirement costs were lower than the interest and corporate bond rates as of september 30 2011 the measurement date for our fiscal 2012 net periodic cost as a result of the lower interest and corporate bond rates we decreased the discount rate used to determine our fiscal 2013 

  

pension and benefit costs to 404 percent we maintained the expected return on our pension plan assets at 775 percent based on historical experience and the current market projection of the target asset allocation due to the decrease in our discount rate we expect our fiscal 2013 pension and postretirement medical costs to increase compared to fiscal 2012 

based upon market conditions subsequent to september 30 2012 the current funded position of the plans and the new funding requirements under the ppa we anticipate contributing between 30 million and 40 million to the plans in fiscal 2013 further we will consider whether an additional voluntary contribution is prudent to maintain certain ppa funding thresholds with respect to our postretirement medical plans we anticipate contributing between 25 million and 30 million during fiscal 2013 

the projected pension liability future funding requirements and the amount of pension expense or income recognized for the plan are subject to change depending upon the actuarial value of plan assets and the determination of future benefit obligations as of each subsequent actuarial calculation date these amounts are impacted by actual investment returns changes in interest rates and changes in the demographic composition of the participants in the plan 

in august 2010 the board of directors of atmos energy approved a proposal to close the pension account plan pap to new participants effective october 1 2010 employees participating in the pap as of october 1 2010 were allowed to make a onetime election to migrate from the pap into our defined contribution plan with enhanced features effective january 1 2011 participants who chose to remain in the pap have continued to earn benefits and interest allocations with no changes to their existing benefits

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend we are exposed to risks associated with commodity prices and interest rates commodity price risk is the potential loss that we may incur as a result of changes in the fair value of a particular instrument or commodity interestrate risk results from our portfolio of debt and equity instruments that we issue to provide financing and liquidity for our business activities 

we conduct risk management activities through both our natural gas distribution and nonregulated segments in our natural gas distribution segment we use a combination of physical storage fixed physical contracts and fixed financial contracts to protect us and our customers against unusually large winter period gas price increases in our nonregulated segment we manage our exposure to the risk of natural gas price changes and lock in our gross profit margin through a combination of storage and financial instruments including futures overthecounter and exchangetraded options and swap contracts with counterparties our risk management activities and related accounting treatment are described in further detail in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements additionally our earnings are affected by changes in shortterm interest rates as a result of our issuance of shortterm commercial paper and our other shortterm borrowings 

commodity price risk 

natural gas distribution segment 

we purchase natural gas for our natural gas distribution operations substantially all of the costs of gas purchased for natural gas distribution operations are recovered from our customers through purchased gas cost adjustment mechanisms therefore our natural gas distribution operations have limited commodity price risk exposure 

nonregulated segment 

our nonregulated segment is also exposed to risks associated with changes in the market price of natural gas for our nonregulated segment we use a sensitivity analysis to estimate commodity price risk for purposes of this analysis we estimate commodity price risk by applying a 050 change in the forward nymex price to 

  

our net open position including existing storage and related financial contracts at the end of each period based on aeh’s net open position including existing storage and related financial contracts at september 30 2012 of 04 bcf a 050 change in the forward nymex price would have had a 02 million impact on our consolidated net income 

changes in the difference between the indices used to mark to market our physical inventory gas daily and the related fairvalue hedge nymex can result in volatility in our reported net income but over time gains and losses on the sale of storage gas inventory will be offset by gains and losses on the fairvalue hedges based upon our net physical position at september 30 2012 and assuming our hedges would still qualify as highly effective a 050 change in the difference between the gas daily and nymex indices would impact our reported net income by approximately 58 million 

additionally these changes could cause us to recognize a risk management liability which would require us to place cash into an escrow account to collateralize this liability position this in turn would reduce the amount of cash we would have on hand to fund our working capital needs 

interest rate risk 

our earnings are exposed to changes in shortterm interest rates associated with our shortterm commercial paper program and other shortterm borrowings we use a sensitivity analysis to estimate our shortterm interest rate risk for purposes of this analysis we estimate our shortterm interest rate risk as the difference between our actual interest expense for the period and estimated interest expense for the period assuming a hypothetical average one percent increase in the interest rates associated with our shortterm borrowings had interest rates associated with our shortterm borrowings increased by an average of one percent our interest expense would have increased by approximately 25 million during 2012

 item 1   business tableend  

overview and strategy 

 

atmos energy corporation headquartered in dallas texas is engaged primarily in the regulated natural gas distribution and transmission and storage businesses as well as other nonregulated natural gas businesses since our incorporation in texas in 1983 we have grown primarily through a series of acquisitions the most recent of which was the acquisition in october 2004 of the natural gas distribution and pipeline operations of txu gas company we are also incorporated in the state of virginia 

 

today we distribute natural gas through regulated sales and transportation arrangements to over three million residential commercial public authority and industrial customers in 12 states located primarily in the south which makes us one of the country’s largest naturalgasonly distributors based on number of customers in may 2011 we announced that we had entered into a definitive agreement to sell our natural gas distribution operations in missouri illinois and iowa representing approximately 84000 customers after the closing of this transaction we will operate in nine states we also operate one of the largest intrastate pipelines in texas based on miles of pipe 

 

through our nonregulated businesses we primarily provide natural gas management and marketing services to municipalities other local gas distribution companies and industrial customers principally in the midwest and southeast and natural gas transportation along with storage services to certain of our natural gas distribution divisions and third parties 

 

our overall strategy is to 

 

  

we have continued to grow our earnings after giving effect to our acquisitions and have experienced more than 25 consecutive years of increasing dividends historically we achieved this record of growth through acquisitions while efficiently managing our operating and maintenance expenses and leveraging our technology to achieve more efficient operations in recent years we have also achieved growth by implementing rate designs that reduce or eliminate regulatory lag and separate the recovery of our approved margins from customer usage patterns in addition we have developed various commercial opportunities within our regulated transmission and storage operations 

 

our core values include focusing on our employees and customers while conducting our business with honesty and integrity we continue to strengthen our culture through ongoing communications with our employees and enhanced employee training 

 

operating segments 

 

we operate the company through the following three segments 

 

 4 

 

  

these operating segments are described in greater detail below 

 

natural gas distribution segment overview 

 

our natural gas distribution segment consists of the following six regulated divisions presented in order of total rate base covering service areas in 12 states 

 

  

our natural gas distribution business is a seasonal business gas sales to residential and commercial customers are greater during the winter months than during the remainder of the year the volumes of gas sales during the winter months will vary with the temperatures during these months 

 

revenues in this operating segment are established by regulatory authorities in the states in which we operate these rates are intended to be sufficient to cover the costs of conducting business and to provide a reasonable return on invested capital our primary service areas are located in colorado kansas kentucky louisiana mississippi tennessee and texas we have more limited service areas in georgia illinois iowa missouri and virginia see note 6 in the consolidated financial statements for a complete description of the anticipated sale of our illinois iowa and missouri service areas in addition we transport natural gas for others through our distribution system 

 

rates established by regulatory authorities often include cost adjustment mechanisms for costs that i are subject to significant price fluctuations compared to our other costs ii represent a large component of our cost of service and iii are generally outside our control 

 

purchased gas cost adjustment mechanisms represent a common form of cost adjustment mechanism purchased gas cost adjustment mechanisms provide natural gas utility companies a method of recovering purchased gas costs on an ongoing basis without filing a rate case because they provide a dollarfordollar offset to increases or decreases in natural gas distribution gas costs therefore although substantially all of our natural gas distribution operating revenues fluctuate with the cost of gas that we purchase natural gas distribution gross profit which is defined as operating revenues less purchased gas cost is generally not affected by fluctuations in the cost of gas 

 

additionally some jurisdictions have introduced performancebased ratemaking adjustments to provide incentives to natural gas utilities to minimize purchased gas costs through improved storage management and use of financial instruments to lock in gas costs under the performancebased ratemaking adjustment purchased gas costs savings are shared between the utility and its customers 

 

finally regulatory authorities have approved weather normalization adjustments wna for approximately 94 percent of residential and commercial margins in our service areas as a part of our rates wna minimizes the effect of weather that is above or below normal by allowing us to increase customers’ bills to offset lower gas usage when weather is warmer than normal and decrease customers’ bills to offset higher gas usage when weather is colder than normal 

as of september 30 2011 we had wna for our residential and commercial meters in the following service areas for the following periods 

 

 

 

our supply of natural gas is provided by a variety of suppliers including independent producers marketers and pipeline companies and withdrawals of gas from proprietary and contracted storage assets additionally the natural gas supply for our midtex division includes peaking and spot purchase agreements 

 

supply arrangements consist of both base load and swing supply peaking quantities and are contracted from our suppliers on a firm basis with various terms at market prices base load quantities are those that flow at a constant level throughout the month and swing supply quantities provide the flexibility to change daily quantities to match increases or decreases in requirements related to weather conditions 

 

except for local production purchases we select our natural gas suppliers through a competitive bidding process by periodically requesting proposals from suppliers that have demonstrated that they can provide reliable service we select these suppliers based on their ability to deliver gas supply to our designated firm pipeline receipt points at the lowest cost major suppliers during fiscal 2011 were anadarko energy services bp energy company conocophillips devon gas services lp enbridge marketing us lp iberdrola renewables inc national fuel marketing company llc oneok energy services company lp tenaska marketing and atmos energy marketing llc our natural gas marketing subsidiary 

 

the combination of base load peaking and spot purchase agreements coupled with the withdrawal of gas held in storage allows us the flexibility to adjust to changes in weather which minimizes our need to enter into longterm firm commitments we estimate our peakday availability of natural gas supply to be approximately 44 bcf the peakday demand for our natural gas distribution operations in fiscal 2011 was on february 2 2011 when sales to customers reached approximately 44 bcf 

 

currently our natural gas distribution divisions except for our midtex division utilize 45 pipeline transportation companies both interstate and intrastate to transport our natural gas the pipeline transportation agreements are firm and many of them have “pipeline nonotice” storage service which provides for daily balancing between system requirements and nominated flowing supplies these agreements have been negotiated with the shortest term necessary while still maintaining our right of first refusal the natural gas supply for our midtex division is delivered primarily by our atmos pipeline — texas division 

 

to maintain our deliveries to high priority customers we have the ability and have exercised our right to curtail deliveries to certain customers under the terms of interruptible contracts or applicable state regulations or statutes our customers’ demand on our system is not necessarily indicative of our ability to meet current or anticipated market demands or immediate delivery requirements because of factors such as the physical limitations of gathering storage and transmission systems the duration and severity of cold weather the availability of gas reserves from our suppliers the ability to purchase additional supplies on a shortterm basis and actions by federal and state regulatory authorities curtailment rights provide us the flexibility to meet the humanneeds requirements of our customers on a firm basis priority allocations imposed by federal and state regulatory agencies as well as other factors beyond our control may affect our ability to meet the demands of our customers we anticipate no problems with obtaining additional gas supply as needed for our customers 

 

below we briefly describe our six natural gas distribution divisions we operate in our service areas under terms of nonexclusive franchise agreements granted by the various cities and towns that we serve at september 30 2011 we held 1116 franchises having terms generally ranging from five to 35 years a significant number of our franchises expire each year which require renewal prior to the end of their terms we believe that we will be able to renew our franchises as they expire additional information concerning our natural gas distribution divisions is presented under the caption “operating statistics” 

atmos energy midtex division our midtex division serves approximately 550 incorporated and unincorporated communities in the northcentral eastern and western parts of texas including the dallasfort worth metroplex the governing body of each municipality we serve has original jurisdiction over all gas distribution rates operations and services within its city limits except with respect to sales of natural gas for vehicle fuel and agricultural use the railroad commission of texas rrc has exclusive appellate jurisdiction over all rate and regulatory orders and ordinances of the municipalities and exclusive original jurisdiction over rates and services to customers not located within the limits of a municipality 

 

prior to fiscal 2008 this division operated under one systemwide rate structure however in fiscal 2008 we reached a settlement with cities representing approximately 80 percent of this division’s customers settled cities that has allowed us beginning in fiscal 2008 to update rates for customers in these cities through an annual rate review mechanism rrm rates for the remaining 20 percent of this division’s customers primarily the city of dallas continue to be updated through periodic formal rate proceedings and filings made under texas’ gas reliability infrastructure program grip grip allows us to include in our rate base annually approved capital costs incurred in the prior calendar year provided that we file a complete rate case at least once every five years in june 2011 we reached an agreement with the city of dallas to enter into the dallas annual rate review darr this rate review provides for an annual rate review without the necessity of filing a general rate case the first filing made under this mechanism will be in january 2012 

 

atmos energy kentuckymidstates division our kentuckymidstates division operates in more than 420 communities across georgia illinois iowa kentucky missouri tennessee and virginia the service areas in these states are primarily rural however this division serves franklin tennessee and other suburban areas of nashville we update our rates in this division through periodic formal rate filings made with each state’s public service commission 

 

in may 2011 we announced that we had entered into a definitive agreement to sell our natural gas distribution operations in missouri illinois and iowa representing approximately 189 communities some of which of the missouri communities are located in our atmos energy coloradokansas division 

 

atmos energy louisiana division in louisiana we serve nearly 300 communities including the suburban areas of new orleans the metropolitan area of monroe and western louisiana direct sales of natural gas to industrial customers in louisiana who use gas for fuel or in manufacturing processes and sales of natural gas for vehicle fuel are exempt from regulation and are recognized in our nonregulated segment our rates in this division are updated annually through a rate stabilization clause filing without filing a formal rate case 

 

atmos energy west texas division our west texas division serves approximately 80 communities in west texas including the amarillo lubbock and midland areas like our midtex division each municipality we serve has original jurisdiction over all gas distribution rates operations and services within its city limits with the rrc having exclusive appellate jurisdiction over the municipalities and exclusive original jurisdiction over rates and services provided to customers not located within the limits of a municipality prior to fiscal 2008 rates were updated in this division through formal rate proceedings however the west texas division entered into agreements with its west texas service areas during fiscal 2008 and its amarillo and lubbock service areas during fiscal 2009 to update rates for customers in these service areas through an rrm 

 

atmos energy mississippi division in mississippi we serve about 110 communities throughout the northern half of the state including the jackson metropolitan area our rates in the mississippi division are updated annually through a stable rate filing without filing a formal rate case 

atmos energy coloradokansas division our coloradokansas division serves approximately 170 communities throughout colorado and kansas and parts of missouri including the cities of olathe kansas a suburb of kansas city and greeley colorado located near denver we update our rates in this division through periodic formal rate filings made with each state’s public service commission

regulated transmission and storage segment overview 

 

our regulated transmission and storage segment consists of the regulated pipeline and storage operations of our atmos pipeline — texas division this division transports natural gas to our midtex division transports natural gas for third parties and manages five underground storage reservoirs in texas we also provide ancillary services customary in the pipeline industry including parking and lending arrangements and sales of inventory on hand parking arrangements provide shortterm interruptible storage of gas on our pipeline lending services provide shortterm interruptible loans of natural gas from our pipeline to meet market demands gross profit earned from our midtex division and through certain other transportation and storage services is subject to traditional ratemaking governed by the rrc rates are updated through periodic formal rate proceedings and filings made under texas’ gas reliability infrastructure program grip grip allows us to include in our rate base annually approved capital costs incurred in the prior calendar year provided that we file a complete rate case at least once every five years atmos pipeline — texas’ existing regulatory mechanisms allow certain transportation and storage services to be provided under marketbased rates with minimal regulation 

 

these operations include one of the largest intrastate pipeline operations in texas with a heavy concentration in the established natural gasproducing areas of central northern and eastern texas extending into or near the major producing areas of the texas gulf coast and the delaware and val verde basins of west texas nine basins located in texas are believed to contain a substantial portion of the nation’s remaining onshore natural gas reserves this pipeline system provides access to all of these basins

our nonregulated activities are conducted through atmos energy holdings inc aeh which is a whollyowned subsidiary of atmos energy corporation and operates primarily in the midwest and southeast areas of the united states 

aeh’s primary business is to deliver gas and provide related services by aggregating and purchasing gas supply arranging transportation and storage logistics and ultimately delivering gas to customers at competitive prices in addition aeh utilizes proprietary and customerowned transportation and storage assets to provide various delivered gas services our customers request including furnishing natural gas supplies at fixed and marketbased prices contract negotiation and administration load forecasting gas storage acquisition and management services transportation services peaking sales and balancing services capacity utilization strategies and gas price hedging through the use of financial instruments as a result aeh’s gas delivery and related services margins arise from the types of commercial transactions we have structured with our customers and our ability to identify the lowest cost alternative among the natural gas supplies transportation and markets to which it has access to serve those customers 

 

aeh’s storage and transportation margins arise from i utilizing its proprietary 21mile pipeline located in new orleans louisiana to aggregate gas supply for our regulated natural gas distribution division in louisiana its gas delivery activities and on a more limited basis for third parties and ii managing proprietary storage in kentucky and louisiana to supplement the natural gas needs of our natural gas distribution divisions during peak periods 

 

aeh also seeks to enhance its gross profit margin by maximizing through asset optimization activities the economic value associated with the storage and transportation capacity it owns or controls in our natural gas distribution and by its subsidiaries we attempt to meet these objectives by engaging in natural gas storage transactions in which we seek to find and profit through the arbitrage of pricing differences in various locations and by recognizing pricing differences that occur over time this process involves purchasing physical natural gas storing it in the storage and transportation assets to which aeh has access and selling financial instruments at advantageous prices to lock in a gross profit margin certain of these arrangements are with regulatory affiliates which have been approved by applicable state regulatory commissions 

 

due to the nature of these operations natural gas prices and differences in natural gas prices between the various markets that we serve commonly referred to as basis differentials have a significant impact on our nonregulated businesses within our delivered gas activities basis differentials impact our ability to create value from identifying the lowest cost alternative among the natural gas supplies transportation and markets to which we have access further higher natural gas prices may adversely impact our accounts receivable collections resulting in higher bad debt expense and may require us to increase borrowings under our credit facilities resulting in higher interest expense higher gas prices as well as competitive factors in the industry and general economic conditions may also cause customers to conserve or use alternative energy sources within our asset optimization activities higher natural gas prices could also lead to increased borrowings under our credit facilities resulting in higher interest expense 

 

volatility in natural gas prices also has a significant impact on our nonregulated segment increased price volatility often has a significant impact on the spreads between the market spot prices and forward natural gas prices which creates opportunities to earn higher arbitrage spreads within our asset optimization activities volatility could also impact the basis differentials we capture in our delivered gas activities however increased volatility impacts the amounts of unrealized margins recorded in our gross profit and could impact the amount of cash required to collateralize our risk management liabilities

ratemaking activity 

 

overview 

 

the method of determining regulated rates varies among the states in which our natural gas distribution divisions operate the regulatory authorities have the responsibility of ensuring that utilities in their jurisdictions operate in the best interests of customers while providing utility companies the opportunity to earn a reasonable return on their investment generally each regulatory authority reviews rate requests and establishes a rate structure intended to generate revenue sufficient to cover the costs of conducting business and to provide a reasonable return on invested capital 

 

our rate strategy focuses on reducing or eliminating regulatory lag obtaining adequate returns and providing stable predictable margins atmos energy has annual ratemaking mechanisms in place in three states that provide for an annual rate review and adjustment to rates for approximately 73 percent of our gross margin we also have accelerated recovery of capital for approximately 11 percent of our gross margin combined we have rate structures with accelerated recovery of all or a portion of our expenditures for approximately 84 percent of our gross margin additionally we have wna mechanisms in eight states that serve to minimize the effects of weather on approximately 94 percent of our gross margin finally we have the ability to recover the gas cost portion of bad debts for approximately 73 percent of our gross margin these mechanisms work in tandem to provide substantial insulation from volatile margins both for the company and our customers 

 

we will also continue to address various rate design changes including the recovery of bad debt gas costs and inclusion of other taxes in gas costs in future rate filings these design changes would address cost variations that are related to passthrough energy costs beyond our control 

 

although substantial progress has been made in recent years by improving rate design across atmos energy’s operating areas potential changes in federal energy policy and adverse economic conditions will necessitate continued vigilance by the company and our regulators in meeting the challenges presented by these external factors 

recent ratemaking activity 

 

substantially all of our natural gas distribution revenues in the fiscal years ended september 30 2011 2010 and 2009 were derived from sales at rates set by or subject to approval by local or state authorities net operating income increases resulting from ratemaking activity totaling 724 million 568 million and 544 million became effective in fiscal 2011 2010 and 2009 as summarized below 

 

 

 

additionally the following ratemaking efforts were initiated during fiscal 2011 but had not been completed as of september 30 2011 

 

 

 

 

  

our recent ratemaking activity is discussed in greater detail below 

 

rate case filings 

 

a rate case is a formal request from atmos energy to a regulatory authority to increase rates that are charged to customers rate cases may also be initiated when the regulatory authorities request us to justify our rates this process is referred to as a “show cause” action adequate rates are intended to provide for recovery of the company’s costs as well as a fair rate of return to our shareholders and ensure that we continue to 

safely deliver reliable reasonably priced natural gas service to our customers the following table summarizes our recent rate cases

infrastructure programs 

 

as discussed above in “natural gas distribution segment overview” infrastructure programs such as grip allow natural gas distribution companies the opportunity to include in their rate base annually approved capital costs incurred in the prior calendar year we currently have infrastructure programs in texas georgia missouri and kentucky the following table summarizes our infrastructure program filings with effective dates during the fiscal years ended september 30 2011 2010 and 2009

annual rate filing mechanisms 

 

as an instrument to reduce regulatory lag annual rate filing mechanisms allow us to refresh our rates on a periodic basis without filing a formal rate case however these filings still involve discovery by the appropriate regulatory authorities prior to the final determination of rates under these mechanisms as discussed above in “natural gas distribution segment overview” we currently have annual rate filing mechanisms in our louisiana and mississippi divisions and in significant portions of our midtex and west texas divisions these mechanisms are referred to as rate review mechanisms in our midtex and west texas divisions stable rate filings in the mississippi division and the rate stabilization clause in the louisiana division the following table summarizes filings made under our various annual rate filing mechanisms 

 

 

 

in june 2011 we reached an agreement with the city of dallas to enter into the darr this rate review provides for an annual rate review without the necessity of filing a general rate case the first filing made under this mechanism will be in january 2012 

in august 2010 we reached an agreement to extend the rrm in our midtex division for an additional twoyear period beginning october 1 2010 however the midtex division will be required to file a general systemwide rate case on or before june 1 2013 this extension provides for an annual rate adjustment to reflect changes in the midtex division’s costs of service and additions to capital investment from year to year without the necessity of filing a general rate case 

 

the settlement also allows us to expand our existing program to replace steel service lines in the midtex division’s natural gas delivery system on october 13 2010 the city of dallas approved the recovery of the return depreciation and taxes associated with the replacement of 100000 steel service lines across the midtex division by september 30 2012 the rrm in the midtex division was entered into as a result of a settlement in the september 20 2007 statement of intent case filed with all midtex division cities of the 440 incorporated cities served by the midtex division 439 of these cities are part of the rrm process 

 

the west texas rrm was entered into in august 2008 as a result of a settlement with the west texas coalition of cities the lubbock and amarillo rrms were entered into in the spring of 2009 the west texas coalition of cities agreed to extend its rrm for one additional cycle as part of the settlement of this fiscal year’s filing 

 

during fiscal 2011 the rrc’s division of public safety issued a new rule requiring natural gas distribution companies to develop and implement a riskbased program for the renewal or replacement of distribution facilities including steel service lines the rule allows for the deferral of all expense associated with capital expenditures incurred pursuant to this rule including the recording of interest on the deferred expenses 

 

other ratemaking activity 

 

the following table summarizes other ratemaking activity during the fiscal years ended september 30 2011 2010 and 2009

other regulation 

 

each of our natural gas distribution divisions is regulated by various state or local public utility authorities we are also subject to regulation by the united states department of transportation with respect to safety requirements in the operation and maintenance of our gas distribution facilities in addition our distribution operations are also subject to various state and federal laws regulating environmental matters from time to time we receive inquiries regarding various environmental matters we believe that our properties and operations substantially comply with and are operated in substantial conformity with applicable safety and environmental statutes and regulations there are no administrative or judicial proceedings arising under environmental quality statutes pending or known to be contemplated by governmental agencies which would have a material adverse effect on us or our operations our environmental claims have arisen primarily from former manufactured gas plant sites in tennessee iowa and missouri 

 

the federal energy regulatory commission ferc allows pursuant to section 311 of the natural gas policy act gas transportation services through our atmos pipeline — texas assets “on behalf of” interstate pipelines or local distribution companies served by interstate pipelines without subjecting these assets to the jurisdiction of the ferc additionally the ferc has regulatory authority over the sale of natural gas in the wholesale gas market and the use and release of interstate pipeline and storage capacity as well as authority to detect and prevent market manipulation and to enforce compliance with ferc’s other rules policies and orders by companies engaged in the sale purchase transportation or storage of natural gas in interstate commerce we have taken what we believe are the necessary and appropriate steps to comply with these regulations 

 

competition 

 

although our natural gas distribution operations are not currently in significant direct competition with any other distributors of natural gas to residential and commercial customers within our service areas we do compete with other natural gas suppliers and suppliers of alternative fuels for sales to industrial customers we compete in all aspects of our business with alternative energy sources including in particular electricity electric utilities offer electricity as a rival energy source and compete for the space heating water heating and cooking markets promotional incentives improved equipment efficiencies and promotional rates all contribute to the acceptability of electrical equipment the principal means to compete against alternative fuels is lower prices and natural gas historically has maintained its price advantage in the residential commercial and industrial markets 

 

our regulated transmission and storage operations historically have faced limited competition from other existing intrastate pipelines and gas marketers seeking to provide or arrange transportation storage and other services for customers however in the last few years several new pipelines have been completed which has increased the level of competition in this segment of our business 

 

within our nonregulated operations aem competes with other natural gas marketers to provide natural gas management and other related services primarily to smaller customers requiring higher levels of balancing scheduling and other related management services aem has experienced increased competition in recent years primarily from investment banks and major integrated oil and natural gas companies who offer lower cost basic services the increased competition has reduced margins most notably on its highvolume accounts 

 

employees 

 

at september 30 2011 we had 4949 employees consisting of 4817 employees in our regulated operations and 132 employees in our nonregulated operations

 item 1a   risk factors tableend  

our financial and operating results are subject to a number of risk factors many of which are not within our control although we have tried to discuss key risk factors below please be aware that other or new risks may prove to be important in the future investors should carefully consider the following discussion of risk factors as well as other information appearing in this report these factors include the following 

 

further disruptions in the credit markets could limit our ability to access capital and increase our costs of capital 

 

we rely upon access to both shortterm and longterm credit markets to satisfy our liquidity requirements the global credit markets have experienced significant disruptions and volatility during the last few years to a greater degree than has been seen in decades in some cases the ability or willingness of traditional sources of capital to provide financing has been reduced 

 

our longterm debt is currently rated as “investment grade” by standard  poor’s corporation moody’s investors services inc and fitch ratings ltd if adverse credit conditions were to cause a significant limitation on our access to the private and public credit markets we could see a reduction in our liquidity a significant reduction in our liquidity could in turn trigger a negative change in our ratings outlook or even a reduction in our credit ratings by one or more of the three credit rating agencies such a downgrade could further limit our access to public andor private credit markets and increase the costs of borrowing under each source of credit 

 

further if our credit ratings were downgraded we could be required to provide additional liquidity to our nonregulated segment because the commodity financial instruments markets could become unavailable to us our nonregulated segment depends primarily upon a committed credit facility to finance its working capital needs which it uses primarily to issue standby letters of credit to its natural gas suppliers a significant reduction in the availability of this facility could require us to provide extra liquidity to support its operations or reduce some of the activities of our nonregulated segment our ability to provide extra liquidity is limited by the terms of our existing lending arrangements with aeh which are subject to annual approval by one state regulatory commission 

while we believe we can meet our capital requirements from our operations and the sources of financing available to us we can provide no assurance that we will continue to be able to do so in the future especially if the market price of natural gas increases significantly in the nearterm the future effects on our business liquidity and financial results of a further deterioration of current conditions in the credit markets could be material and adverse to us both in the ways described above or in other ways that we do not currently anticipate 

 

the continuation of recent economic conditions could adversely affect our customers and negatively impact our financial results 

 

the slowdown in the us economy in the last few years together with increased mortgage defaults and significant decreases in the values of homes and investment assets has adversely affected the financial resources of many domestic households it is unclear whether the administrative and legislative responses to these conditions will be successful in improving current economic conditions including the lowering of current high unemployment rates across the us as a result our customers may seek to use even less gas and it may become more difficult for them to pay their gas bills this may slow collections and lead to higher than normal levels of accounts receivable this in turn could increase our financing requirements and bad debt expense additionally our industrial customers may seek alternative energy sources which could result in lower sales volumes 

 

the costs of providing pension and postretirement health care benefits and related funding requirements are subject to changes in pension fund values changing demographics and fluctuating actuarial assumptions and may have a material adverse effect on our financial results in addition the passage of the health care reform act in 2010 could significantly increase the cost of the health care benefits for our employees 

 

we provide a cashbalance pension plan and postretirement healthcare benefits to eligible fulltime employees our costs of providing such benefits and related funding requirements are subject to changes in the market value of the assets funding our pension and postretirement healthcare plans the fluctuations over the last few years in the values of investments that fund our pension and postretirement healthcare plans may significantly differ from or alter the values and actuarial assumptions we use to calculate our future pension plan expense and postretirement healthcare costs and funding requirements under the pension protection act any significant declines in the value of these investments could increase the expenses of our pension and postretirement healthcare plans and related funding requirements in the future our costs of providing such benefits and related funding requirements are also subject to changing demographics including longer life expectancy of beneficiaries and an expected increase in the number of eligible former employees over the next five to ten years as well as various actuarial calculations and assumptions which may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions higher or lower withdrawal rates and interest rates and other factors also our costs of providing such benefits are subject to the continuing recovery of these costs through rates 

 

in addition the costs of providing health care benefits to our employees could significantly increase over the next five to ten years although the full effects of the health care reform act should not impact the company until 2014 the future cost of compliance with the provisions of this legislation is difficult to measure at this time 

 

our operations are exposed to market risks that are beyond our control which could adversely affect our financial results and capital requirements 

 

our risk management operations are subject to market risks beyond our control including market liquidity commodity price volatility caused by market supply and demand dynamics and counterparty creditworthiness although we maintain a risk management policy we may not be able to completely offset the price risk associated with volatile gas prices particularly in our nonregulated business segments which could lead to volatility in our earnings 

physical trading in our nonregulated business segments also introduces price risk on any net open positions at the end of each trading day as well as volatility resulting from intraday fluctuations of gas prices and the potential for daily price movements between the time natural gas is purchased or sold for future delivery and the time the related purchase or sale is hedged the determination of our net open position as of the end of any particular trading day requires us to make assumptions as to future circumstances including the use of gas by our customers in relation to our anticipated storage and market positions because the price risk associated with any net open position at the end of such day may increase if the assumptions are not realized we review these assumptions as part of our daily monitoring activities although we manage our business to maintain no open positions there are times when limited net open positions related to our physical storage may occur on a shortterm basis net open positions may increase volatility in our financial condition or results of operations if market prices move in a significantly favorable or unfavorable manner before the open positions can be closed 

 

further the timing of the recognition for financial accounting purposes of gains or losses resulting from changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments designated as hedges usually does not match the timing of the economic profits or losses on the item being hedged this volatility may occur with a resulting increase or decrease in earnings or losses even though the expected profit margin is essentially unchanged from the date the transactions were consummated also if the local physical markets in which we trade do not move consistently with the nymex futures market upon which most of our commodity derivative financial instruments are valued we could experience increased volatility in the financial results of our nonregulated segment 

 

our nonregulated segment manages margins and limits risk exposure on the sale of natural gas inventory or the offsetting fixedprice purchase or sale commitments for physical quantities of natural gas through the use of a variety of financial instruments however contractual limitations could adversely affect our ability to withdraw gas from storage which could cause us to purchase gas at spot prices in a rising market to obtain sufficient volumes to fulfill customer contracts we could also realize financial losses on our efforts to limit risk as a result of volatility in the market prices of the underlying commodities or if a counterparty fails to perform under a contract any significant tightening of the credit markets could cause more of our counterparties to fail to perform than expected in addition adverse changes in the creditworthiness of our counterparties could limit the level of trading activities with these parties and increase the risk that these parties may not perform under a contract these circumstances could also increase our capital requirements 

 

we are also subject to interest rate risk on our borrowings in recent years we have been operating in a relatively low interestrate environment compared to historical norms for both short and longterm interest rates however increases in interest rates could adversely affect our future financial results 

 

we are subject to state and local regulations that affect our operations and financial results 

 

our natural gas distribution and regulated transmission and storage segments are subject to various regulated returns on our rate base in each jurisdiction in which we operate we monitor the allowed rates of return and our effectiveness in earning such rates and initiate rate proceedings or operating changes as we believe they are needed in addition in the normal course of business in the regulatory environment assets may be placed in service and historical test periods established before rate cases can be filed that could result in an adjustment of our allowed returns once rate cases are filed regulatory bodies have the authority to suspend implementation of the new rates while studying the cases because of this process we must suffer the negative financial effects of having placed assets in service without the benefit of rate relief which is commonly referred to as “regulatory lag” rate cases also involve a risk of rate reduction because once rates have been approved they are still subject to challenge for their reasonableness by appropriate regulatory authorities in addition regulators may review our purchases of natural gas and can adjust the amount of our gas costs that we pass through to our customers finally our debt and equity financings are also subject to approval by regulatory commissions in several states which could limit our ability to access or take advantage of rapid changes in the capital markets 

we may experience increased federal state and local regulation of the safety of our operations 

 

we are committed to constantly monitoring and maintaining our pipeline and distribution system to ensure that natural gas is delivered safely reliably and efficiently through our network of more than 76000 miles of pipeline and distribution lines the pipeline replacement programs currently underway in several of our divisions typify the preventive maintenance and continual renewal that we perform on our natural gas distribution system in the 12 states in which we currently operate the safety and protection of the public our customers and our employees is our top priority however due primarily to the recent unfortunate pipeline incident in california we anticipate companies in the natural gas distribution business may be subjected to even greater federal state and local oversight of the safety of their operations in the future although we believe these costs are ultimately recoverable through our rates costs of complying with such increased regulations may have at least a shortterm adverse impact on our operating costs and financial results 

 

some of our operations are subject to increased federal regulatory oversight that could affect our operations and financial results 

 

ferc has regulatory authority that affects some of our operations including sales of natural gas in the wholesale gas market and the use and release of interstate pipeline and storage capacity under legislation passed by congress in 2005 ferc has adopted rules designed to prevent market power abuse and market manipulation and to promote compliance with ferc’s other rules policies and orders by companies engaged in the sale purchase transportation or storage of natural gas in interstate commerce these rules carry increased penalties for violations we are currently under investigation by ferc for possible violations of its posting and competitive bidding regulations for prearranged released firm capacity on interstate natural gas pipelines should ferc conclude that we have committed such violations of its regulations and levies substantial fines andor penalties against us our business financial condition or financial results could be adversely affected although we have taken steps to structure current and future transactions to comply with applicable current ferc regulations changes in ferc regulations or their interpretation by ferc or additional regulations issued by ferc in the future could also adversely affect our business financial condition or financial results 

 

we are subject to environmental regulations which could adversely affect our operations or financial results 

 

we are subject to laws regulations and other legal requirements enacted or adopted by federal state and local governmental authorities relating to protection of the environment and health and safety matters including those legal requirements that govern discharges of substances into the air and water the management and disposal of hazardous substances and waste the cleanup of contaminated sites groundwater quality and availability plant and wildlife protection as well as work practices related to employee health and safety environmental legislation also requires that our facilities sites and other properties associated with our operations be operated maintained abandoned and reclaimed to the satisfaction of applicable regulatory authorities failure to comply with these laws regulations permits and licenses may expose us to fines penalties or interruptions in our operations that could be significant to our financial results in addition existing environmental regulations may be revised or our operations may become subject to new regulations 

 

our business may be subject in the future to additional regulatory and financial risks associated with global warming and climate change 

 

there have been a number of new federal and state legislative and regulatory initiatives proposed in an attempt to control or limit the effects of global warming and overall climate change including greenhouse gas emissions such as carbon dioxide for example in june 2009 the us house of representatives approved the american clean energy and security act of 2009  also known as the waxmanmarkey bill or “cap and trade” bill however neither this bill nor a related bill in the us senate the clean energy and emissions power act was passed by congress the adoption of this type of legislation by congress or similar legislation by states or the adoption of related regulations by federal or state governments mandating a substantial 

reduction in greenhouse gas emissions in the future could have farreaching and significant impacts on the energy industry such new legislation or regulations could result in increased compliance costs for us or additional operating restrictions on our business affect the demand for natural gas or impact the prices we charge to our customers at this time we cannot predict the potential impact of such laws or regulations that may be adopted on our future business financial condition or financial results 

 

the concentration of our distribution pipeline and storage operations in the state of texas exposes our operations and financial results to economic conditions and regulatory decisions in texas 

 

over 50 percent of our natural gas distribution customers and most of our pipeline and storage assets and operations are located in the state of texas this concentration of our business in texas means that our operations and financial results may be significantly affected by changes in the texas economy in general and regulatory decisions by state and local regulatory authorities in texas 

 

adverse weather conditions could affect our operations or financial results 

 

since the 20062007 winter heating season we have had weathernormalized rates for over 90 percent of our residential and commercial meters which has substantially mitigated the adverse effects of warmerthannormal weather for meters in those service areas however there is no assurance that we will continue to receive such regulatory protection from adverse weather in our rates in the future the loss of such weather — normalized rates could have an adverse effect on our operations and financial results in addition our natural gas distribution and regulated transmission and storage operating results may continue to vary somewhat with the actual temperatures during the winter heating season sustained cold weather could adversely affect our nonregulated operations as we may be required to purchase gas at spot rates in a rising market to obtain sufficient volumes to fulfill some customer contracts additionally sustained cold weather could challenge our ability to adequately meet customer demand in our natural gas distribution and regulated transmission and storage operations 

 

inflation and increased gas costs could adversely impact our customer base and customer collections and increase our level of indebtedness 

 

inflation has caused increases in some of our operating expenses and has required assets to be replaced at higher costs we have a process in place to continually review the adequacy of our natural gas distribution gas rates in relation to the increasing cost of providing service and the inherent regulatory lag in adjusting those gas rates historically we have been able to budget and control operating expenses and investments within the amounts authorized to be collected in rates and intend to continue to do so however the ability to control expenses is an important factor that could impact future financial results 

 

rapid increases in the costs of purchased gas would cause us to experience a significant increase in shortterm debt we must pay suppliers for gas when it is purchased which can be significantly in advance of when these costs may be recovered through the collection of monthly customer bills for gas delivered increases in purchased gas costs also slow our natural gas distribution collection efforts as customers are more likely to delay the payment of their gas bills leading to higher than normal accounts receivable this could result in higher shortterm debt levels greater collection efforts and increased bad debt expense 

 

our growth in the future may be limited by the nature of our business which requires extensive capital spending 

 

we must continually build additional capacity in our natural gas distribution system to enable us to serve any growth in the number of our customers the cost of adding this capacity may be affected by a number of factors including the general state of the economy and weather in addition although we should ultimately recover the cost of the expenditures through rates we must make significant capital expenditures during the next fiscal year in executing our steel service line replacement program in the midtex division our cash flows from operations generally are sufficient to supply funding for all our capital expenditures including the financing of the costs of new construction along with capital expenditures necessary to maintain our existing 

natural gas system due to the timing of these cash flows and capital expenditures we often must fund at least a portion of these costs through borrowing funds from third party lenders the cost and availability of which is dependent on the liquidity of the credit markets interest rates and other market conditions this in turn may limit our ability to connect new customers to our system due to constraints on the amount of funds we can invest in our infrastructure 

 

our operations are subject to increased competition 

 

in residential and commercial customer markets our natural gas distribution operations compete with other energy products such as electricity and propane our primary product competition is with electricity for heating water heating and cooking increases in the price of natural gas could negatively impact our competitive position by decreasing the price benefits of natural gas to the consumer this could adversely impact our business if as a result our customer growth slows reducing our ability to make capital expenditures or if our customers further conserve their use of gas resulting in reduced gas purchases and customer billings 

 

in the case of industrial customers such as manufacturing plants adverse economic conditions including higher gas costs could cause these customers to use alternative sources of energy such as electricity or bypass our systems in favor of special competitive contracts with lower perunit costs our regulated transmission and storage operations historically have faced limited competition from other existing intrastate pipelines and gas marketers seeking to provide or arrange transportation storage and other services for customers however in the last few years several new pipelines have been completed which has increased the level of competition in this segment of our business within our nonregulated operations aem competes with other natural gas marketers to provide natural gas management and other related services primarily to smaller customers requiring higher levels of balancing scheduling and other related management services aem has experienced increased competition in recent years primarily from investment banks and major integrated oil and natural gas companies who offer lower cost basic services 

 

distributing and storing natural gas involve risks that may result in accidents and additional operating costs 

 

our natural gas distribution business involves a number of hazards and operating risks that cannot be completely avoided such as leaks accidents and operational problems which could cause loss of human life as well as substantial financial losses resulting from property damage damage to the environment and to our operations we do have liability and property insurance coverage in place for many of these hazards and risks however because our pipeline storage and distribution facilities are near or are in populated areas any loss of human life or adverse financial results resulting from such events could be large if these events were not fully covered by insurance our operations or financial results could be adversely affected 

 

natural disasters terrorist activities or other significant events could adversely affect our operations or financial results 

 

natural disasters are always a threat to our assets and operations in addition the threat of terrorist activities could lead to increased economic instability and volatility in the price of natural gas that could affect our operations also companies in our industry may face a heightened risk of exposure to actual acts of terrorism which could subject our operations to increased risks as a result the availability of insurance covering such risks may be more limited which could increase the risk that an event could adversely affect our operations or financial results

critical accounting policies and estimates 

 

our consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and the related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities we based our estimates on historical experience and various 

other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including those related to risk management and trading activities fair value measurements allowance for doubtful accounts legal and environmental accruals insurance accruals pension and postretirement obligations deferred income taxes and valuation of goodwill indefinitelived intangible assets and other longlived assets our critical accounting policies are reviewed by the audit committee periodically actual results may differ from estimates 

 

regulation — our natural gas distribution and regulated transmission and storage operations are subject to regulation with respect to rates service maintenance of accounting records and various other matters by the respective regulatory authorities in the states in which we operate we meet the criteria established within accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of a costbased rateregulated entity which requires us to reflect the financial effects of the ratemaking and accounting practices and policies of the various regulatory commissions in our financial statements in accordance with applicable authoritative accounting standards we apply the provisions of this standard to our regulated operations and record regulatory assets for costs that have been deferred for which future recovery through customer rates is considered probable and regulatory liabilities when it is probable that revenues will be reduced for amounts that will be credited to customers through the ratemaking process as a result certain costs that would normally be expensed under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states are permitted to be capitalized or deferred on the balance sheet because it is probable they can be recovered through rates discontinuing the application of this method of accounting for regulatory assets and liabilities could significantly increase our operating expenses as fewer costs would likely be capitalized or deferred on the balance sheet which could reduce our net income further regulation may impact the period in which revenues or expenses are recognized the amounts to be recovered or recognized are based upon historical experience and our understanding of the regulations the impact of regulation on our regulated operations may be affected by decisions of the regulatory authorities or the issuance of new regulations 

 

revenue recognition — sales of natural gas to our natural gas distribution customers are billed on a monthly basis however the billing cycle periods for certain classes of customers do not necessarily coincide with accounting periods used for financial reporting purposes we follow the revenue accrual method of accounting for natural gas distribution segment revenues whereby revenues applicable to gas delivered to customers but not yet billed under the cycle billing method are estimated and accrued and the related costs are charged to expense 

 

on occasion we are permitted to implement new rates that have not been formally approved by our regulatory authorities which are subject to refund we recognize this revenue and establish a reserve for amounts that could be refunded based on our experience for the jurisdiction in which the rates were implemented 

 

rates established by regulatory authorities are adjusted for increases and decreases in our purchased gas costs through purchased gas cost adjustment mechanisms purchased gas cost adjustment mechanisms provide gas utility companies a method of recovering purchased gas costs on an ongoing basis without filing a rate case to address all of the utility company’s nongas costs these mechanisms are commonly utilized when regulatory authorities recognize a particular type of cost such as purchased gas costs that i is subject to significant price fluctuations compared to the utility company’s other costs ii represents a large component of the utility company’s cost of service and iii is generally outside the control of the gas utility company there is no gross profit generated through purchased gas cost adjustments but they provide a dollarfordollar offset to increases or decreases in utility gas costs although substantially all natural gas distribution sales to our customers fluctuate with the cost of gas that we purchase our gross profit is generally not affected by fluctuations in the cost of gas as a result of the purchased gas cost adjustment mechanism the effects of these purchased gas cost adjustment mechanisms are recorded as deferred gas costs on our balance sheet 

 

operating revenues for our regulated transmission and storage and nonregulated segments are recognized in the period in which actual volumes are transported and storage services are provided 

 

operating revenues for our nonregulated segment and the associated carrying value of natural gas inventory inclusive of storage costs are recognized when we sell the gas and physically deliver it to our 

customers operating revenues include realized gains and losses arising from the settlement of financial instruments used in our natural gas marketing activities and unrealized gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value of natural gas inventory designated as a hedged item in a fair value hedge and the associated financial instruments 

 

allowance for doubtful accounts — accounts receivable arise from natural gas sales to residential commercial industrial municipal and other customers for the majority of our receivables we establish an allowance for doubtful accounts based on our collections experience on certain other receivables where we are aware of a specific customer’s inability or reluctance to pay we record an allowance for doubtful accounts against amounts due to reduce the net receivable balance to the amount we reasonably expect to collect however if circumstances change our estimate of the recoverability of accounts receivable could be affected circumstances which could affect our estimates include but are not limited to customer credit issues the level of natural gas prices customer deposits and general economic conditions accounts are written off once they are deemed to be uncollectible 

 

financial instruments and hedging activities — we currently use financial instruments to mitigate commodity price risk additionally we periodically use financial instruments to manage interest rate risk the objectives and strategies for using financial instruments have been tailored to meet the needs of our regulated and nonregulated businesses 

 

we record all of our financial instruments on the balance sheet at fair value as required by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  with changes in fair value ultimately recorded in the income statement the timing of when changes in fair value of our financial instruments are recorded in the income statement depends on whether the financial instrument has been designated and qualifies as a part of a hedging relationship or if regulatory rulings require a different accounting treatment changes in fair value for financial instruments that do not meet one of these criteria are recognized in the income statement as they occur 

 

financial instruments associated with commodity price risk 

 

in our natural gas distribution segment our customers are exposed to the effect of volatile natural gas prices we manage this exposure through a combination of physical storage fixedprice forward contracts and financial instruments primarily overthecounter swap and option contracts in an effort to minimize the impact of natural gas price volatility on our customers during the winter heating season the costs associated with and the gains and losses arising from the use of financial instruments to mitigate commodity price risk in this segment are included in our purchased gas cost adjustment mechanisms in accordance with regulatory requirements therefore changes in the fair value of these financial instruments are initially recorded as a component of deferred gas costs and recognized in the consolidated statement of income as a component of purchased gas cost when the related costs are recovered through our rates and recognized in revenue in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states accordingly there is no earnings impact to our natural gas distribution segment as a result of the use of financial instruments 

 

our nonregulated segment aggregates and purchases gas supply arranges transportation andor storage logistics and ultimately delivers gas to our customers at competitive prices we also perform asset optimization activities in which we seek to maximize the economic value associated with storage and transportation capacity we own or control in both our natural gas distribution and nonregulated businesses as a result of these activities our nonregulated operations are exposed to risks associated with changes in the market price of natural gas we manage our exposure to the risk of natural gas price changes through a combination of physical storage and financial instruments including futures overthecounter and exchangetraded options and swap contracts with counterparties 

 

in our nonregulated segment we have designated the natural gas inventory held by this operating segment as the hedged item in a fairvalue hedge this inventory is marked to market at the end of each month based on the gas daily index with changes in fair value recognized as unrealized gains or losses in revenue in the period of change the financial instruments associated with this natural gas inventory have been designated as fairvalue hedges and are marked to market each month based upon the nymex price with changes in fair value recognized as unrealized gains or losses in revenue in the period of change changes in the spreads 

between the forward natural gas prices used to value the financial instruments designated against our physical inventory nymex and the market spot prices used to value our physical storage gas daily result in unrealized margins until the underlying physical gas is withdrawn and the related financial instruments are settled the difference in the spot price used to value our physical inventory and the forward price used to value the related financial instruments can result in volatility in our reported income as a component of unrealized margins we have elected to exclude this spotforward differential for purposes of assessing the effectiveness of these fairvalue hedges once the gas is withdrawn and the financial instruments are settled the previously unrealized margins associated with these net positions are realized over time we expect gains and losses on the sale of storage gas inventory to be offset by gains and losses on the fairvalue hedges resulting in the realization of the economic gross profit margin we anticipated at the time we structured the original transaction 

 

we have elected to treat fixedprice forward contracts used in our nonregulated segment to deliver gas as normal purchases and normal sales as such these deliveries are recorded on an accrual basis in accordance with our revenue recognition policy financial instruments used to mitigate the commodity price risk associated with these contracts have been designated as cash flow hedges of anticipated purchases and sales at indexed prices accordingly unrealized gains and losses on open financial instruments are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income and are recognized in earnings as a component of revenue when the hedged volumes are sold hedge ineffectiveness to the extent incurred is reported as a component of revenue 

 

we also use storage swaps and futures to capture additional storage arbitrage opportunities in our nonregulated segment that arise after the execution of the original fair value hedge associated with our physical natural gas inventory basis swaps to insulate and protect the economic value of our fixed price and storage books and various overthecounter and exchangetraded options these financial instruments have not been designated as hedges 

 

financial instruments associated with interest rate risk 

 

we periodically manage interest rate risk typically when we issue new or refinance existing longterm debt with treasury lock agreements to fix the treasury yield component of the interest cost associated with anticipated financings we designate these treasury lock agreements as cash flow hedges at the time the agreements are executed accordingly unrealized gains and losses associated with the treasury lock agreements are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss the realized gain or loss recognized upon settlement of each treasury lock agreement is initially recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss and is recognized as a component of interest expense over the life of the related financing arrangement hedge ineffectiveness to the extent incurred is reported as a component of interest expense 

 

impairment assessments — we perform impairment assessments of our goodwill intangible assets subject to amortization and longlived assets as of september 30 2011 we had no indefinitelived intangible assets 

 

we annually evaluate our goodwill balances for impairment during our second fiscal quarter or as impairment indicators arise we use a present value technique based on discounted cash flows to estimate the fair value of our reporting units we have determined our reporting units to be each of our natural gas distribution divisions and whollyowned subsidiaries and goodwill is allocated to the reporting units responsible for the acquisition that gave rise to the goodwill the discounted cash flow calculations used to assess goodwill impairment are dependent on several subjective factors including the timing of future cash flows future growth rates and the discount rate an impairment charge is recognized if the carrying value of a reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds its fair value 

 

we annually assess whether the cost of our intangible assets subject to amortization or other longlived assets is recoverable or that the remaining useful lives may warrant revision we perform this assessment more frequently when specific events or circumstances have occurred that suggest the recoverability of the cost of the intangible and other longlived assets is at risk 

when such events or circumstances are present we assess the recoverability of these assets by determining whether the carrying value will be recovered through expected future cash flows from the operating division or subsidiary to which these assets relate these cash flow projections consider various factors such as the timing of the future cash flows and the discount rate and are based upon the best information available at the time the estimate is made changes in these factors could materially affect the cash flow projections and result in the recognition of an impairment charge an impairment charge is recognized as the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value if the sum of the undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying value of the related asset 

 

pension and other postretirement plans  — pension and other postretirement plan costs and liabilities are determined on an actuarial basis using a september 30 measurement date and are affected by numerous assumptions and estimates including the market value of plan assets estimates of the expected return on plan assets assumed discount rates and current demographic and actuarial mortality data the assumed discount rate and the expected return are the assumptions that generally have the most significant impact on our pension costs and liabilities the assumed discount rate the assumed health care cost trend rate and assumed rates of retirement generally have the most significant impact on our postretirement plan costs and liabilities 

 

the discount rate is utilized principally in calculating the actuarial present value of our pension and postretirement obligations and net periodic pension and postretirement benefit plan costs when establishing our discount rate we consider high quality corporate bond rates based on bonds available in the marketplace that are suitable for settling the obligations changes in those rates from the prior year and the implied discount rate that is derived from matching our projected benefit disbursements with currently available high quality corporate bonds 

 

the expected longterm rate of return on assets is utilized in calculating the expected return on plan assets component of our annual pension and postretirement plan costs we estimate the expected return on plan assets by evaluating expected bond returns equity risk premiums asset allocations the effects of active plan management the impact of periodic plan asset rebalancing and historical performance we also consider the guidance from our investment advisors in making a final determination of our expected rate of return on assets to the extent the actual rate of return on assets realized over the course of a year is greater than or less than the assumed rate that year’s annual pension or postretirement plan costs are not affected rather this gain or loss reduces or increases future pension or postretirement plan costs over a period of approximately ten to twelve years 

 

the marketrelated value of our plan assets represents the fair market value of the plan assets adjusted to smooth out shortterm market fluctuations over a fiveyear period the use of this calculation will delay the impact of current market fluctuations on the pension expense for the period 

 

we estimate the assumed health care cost trend rate used in determining our postretirement net expense based upon our actual health care cost experience the effects of recently enacted legislation and general economic conditions our assumed rate of retirement is estimated based upon our annual review of our participant census information as of the measurement date 

 

actual changes in the fair market value of plan assets and differences between the actual and expected return on plan assets could have a material effect on the amount of pension costs ultimately recognized a 025 percent change in our discount rate would impact our pension and postretirement costs by approximately 19 million a 025 percent change in our expected rate of return would impact our pension and postretirement costs by approximately 08 million 

 

fair value measurements — we report certain assets and liabilities at fair value which is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date exit price we primarily use quoted market prices and other observable market pricing information in valuing our financial assets and liabilities and minimize the use of unobservable pricing inputs in our measurements 

 

prices actively quoted on national exchanges are used to determine the fair value of most of our assets and liabilities recorded on our balance sheet at fair value within our nonregulated operations we utilize a 

midmarket pricing convention the midpoint between the bid and ask prices as a practical expedient for determining fair value measurement as permitted under current accounting standards values derived from these sources reflect the market in which transactions involving these financial instruments are executed we utilize models and other valuation methods to determine fair value when external sources are not available values are adjusted to reflect the potential impact of an orderly liquidation of our positions over a reasonable period of time under thencurrent market conditions we believe the market prices and models used to value these assets and liabilities represent the best information available with respect to closing exchange and overthecounter quotations time value and volatility factors underlying the assets and liabilities 

 

fairvalue estimates also consider our own creditworthiness and the creditworthiness of the counterparties involved our counterparties consist primarily of financial institutions and major energy companies this concentration of counterparties may materially impact our exposure to credit risk resulting from market economic or regulatory conditions adverse developments in the global financial and credit markets in the last few years have made it more difficult and more expensive for companies to access the shortterm capital markets which may negatively impact the creditworthiness of our counterparties a further tightening of the credit markets could cause more of our counterparties to fail to perform we seek to minimize counterparty credit risk through an evaluation of their financial condition and credit ratings and the use of collateral requirements under certain circumstances 

 

amounts reported at fair value are subject to potentially significant volatility based upon changes in market prices the valuation of the portfolio of our contracts maturity and settlement of these contracts and newly originated transactions each of which directly affect the estimated fair value of our financial instruments we believe the market prices and models used to value these financial instruments represent the best information available with respect to closing exchange and overthecounter quotations time value and volatility factors underlying the contracts values are adjusted to reflect the potential impact of an orderly liquidation of our positions over a reasonable period of time under then current market conditions 

 

results of operations 

 

overview 

 

atmos energy corporation is involved in the distribution marketing and transportation of natural gas accordingly our results of operations are impacted by the demand for natural gas particularly during the winter heating season and the volatility of the natural gas markets this generally results in higher operating revenues and net income during the period from october through march of each fiscal year and lower operating revenues and either lower net income or net losses during the period from april through september of each fiscal year as a result of the seasonality of the natural gas industry our second fiscal quarter has historically been our most critical earnings quarter with an average of approximately 62 percent of our consolidated net income having been earned in the second quarter during the three most recently completed fiscal years 

 

additionally the seasonality of our business impacts our working capital differently at various times during the year typically our accounts receivable accounts payable and shortterm debt balances peak by the end of january and then start to decline as customers begin to pay their winter heating bills gas stored underground particularly in our natural gas distribution segment typically peaks in november and declines as we utilize storage gas to serve our customers 

 

during fiscal 2011 we earned 2076 million or 227 per diluted share which represents a one percent increase in net income and a three percent increase in diluted net income per share over fiscal 2010 during fiscal 2011 recent improvements in rate designs in our natural gas distribution segment and a successful regulatory outcome in our regulated transmission and storage segment offset a seven percent yearoveryear decline in consolidated natural gas distribution throughput due to warmer weather and a 108 percent decrease in asset optimization margins as a result of weak natural gas market fundamentals results for fiscal 2011 were influenced by several nonrecurring items which increased diluted earnings per share by 003 the increase in fiscal 2011 earnings per share also reflects the favorable impact of our accelerated share buyback 

agreement initiated in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 and completed in the second quarter of fiscal 2011 which increased diluted earnings per share by 008 

 

on may 12 2011 we entered into a definitive agreement to sell all of our natural gas distribution assets located in missouri illinois and iowa to liberty energy midstates corporation an affiliate of algonquin power  utilities corp for a cash price of approximately 124 million the agreement contains terms and conditions customary for transactions of this type including typical adjustments to the purchase price at closing if applicable the closing of the transaction is subject to the satisfaction of customary conditions including the receipt of applicable regulatory approvals due to the pending sales transaction the results of operations for these three service areas are shown in discontinued operations 

 

on june 10 2011 we issued 400 million of 550 senior notes the effective interest rate on these notes is 5381 percent after giving effect to offering costs and the settlement of the 300 million treasury locks associated with the offering substantially all of the net proceeds of approximately 394 million were used to repay 350 million of outstanding commercial paper the remainder of the net proceeds was used for general corporate purposes the treasury locks were settled on june 7 2011 with the receipt of 201 million from the counterparties due to an increase in the 30year treasury lock rates between inception of the treasury locks and settlement because the treasury locks were effective the net 126 million unrealized gain was recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income and will be recognized as a component of interest expense over the 30year life of the senior notes 

 

during the year ended september 30 2011 we executed on our strategy to streamline our credit facilities as follows 

 

  

after giving effect to these changes we now have 985 million of liquidity available to us from our commercial paper program and four committed credit facilities and have reduced our financing costs we believe this availability provides sufficient liquidity to fund our working capital needs 

consolidated results 

 

the following table presents our consolidated financial highlights for the fiscal years ended september 30 2011 2010 and 2009 

 

 

 

historically our regulated operations arising from our natural gas distribution and regulated transmission and storage operations contributed 65 to 85 percent of our consolidated net income regulated operations contributed 104 percent 81 percent and 83 percent to our consolidated net income for fiscal years 2011 2010 and 2009 our consolidated net income during the last three fiscal years was earned across our business segments as follows 

 

 

 

the following table segregates our consolidated net income and diluted earnings per share between our regulated and nonregulated operations 

 

 

we reported net income of 2076 million or 227 per diluted share for the year ended september 30 2011 compared with net income of 2058 million or 220 per diluted share in the prior year income from continuing operations was 1989 million or 217 per diluted share compared with 1983 million or 212 per diluted share in the prioryear period income from discontinued operations was 87 million or 010 per diluted share for the year compared with 76 million or 008 per diluted share in the prior year unrealized losses in our nonregulated operations during the current year reduced net income by 66 million or 007 per diluted share compared with net losses recorded in the prior year of 43 million or 005 per diluted share additionally net income in both periods was impacted by nonrecurring items in the prior year net income included the net positive impact of a state sales tax refund of 46 million or 005 per diluted share in the current year net income includes the net positive impact of several onetime items totaling 32 million or 003 per diluted share related to the following pretax amounts 

 

  

net income during fiscal 2010 increased eight percent over fiscal 2009 net income from our regulated operations increased six percent during fiscal 2010 the increase primarily reflects colder than normal weather in most of our service areas during fiscal 2010 as well as the net favorable impact of various ratemaking activities in our natural gas distribution segment net income in our nonregulated operations increased 53 million during fiscal 2010 primarily due to the impact of unrealized margins noncash net unrealized losses totaled 43 million which reduced earnings per share by 005 per diluted share in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 when net unrealized losses totaled 216 million which reduced earnings per share by 023 per diluted share 

 

see the following discussion regarding the results of operations for each of our business operating segments 

 

natural gas distribution segment 

 

the primary factors that impact the results of our natural gas distribution operations are our ability to earn our authorized rates of return the cost of natural gas competitive factors in the energy industry and economic conditions in our service areas 

 

our ability to earn our authorized rates is based primarily on our ability to improve the rate design in our various ratemaking jurisdictions by reducing or eliminating regulatory lag and ultimately separating the recovery of our approved margins from customer usage patterns improving rate design is a longterm process and is further complicated by the fact that we operate in multiple rate jurisdictions the “ratemaking activity” section of this form 10k describes our current rate strategy progress towards implementing that strategy and recent ratemaking initiatives in more detail 

 

we are generally able to pass the cost of gas through to our customers without markup under purchased gas cost adjustment mechanisms therefore the cost of gas typically does not have an impact on our gross profit as increases in the cost of gas are offset by a corresponding increase in revenues accordingly we believe gross profit is a better indicator of our financial performance than revenues however gross profit in our texas and mississippi service areas include franchise fees and gross receipts taxes which are calculated as a percentage of revenue inclusive of gas costs therefore the amount of these taxes included in revenues is influenced by the cost of gas and the level of gas sales volumes we record the tax expense as a component of taxes other than income although changes in revenuerelated taxes arising from changes in gas costs affect gross profit over time the impact is offset within operating income 

 

as discussed above the cost of gas typically does not have a direct impact on our gross profit however higher gas costs may adversely impact our accounts receivable collections resulting in higher bad debt 

expense and may require us to increase borrowings under our credit facilities resulting in higher interest expense in addition higher gas costs as well as competitive factors in the industry and general economic conditions may cause customers to conserve or in the case of industrial consumers to use alternative energy sources however gas cost risk has been mitigated in recent years through improvements in rate design that allow us to collect from our customers the gas cost portion of our bad debt expense on approximately 73 percent of our residential and commercial margins 

 

in may 2011 we announced that we had entered into a definitive agreement to sell our natural gas distribution operations in missouri illinois and iowa the results of these operations have been separately reported in the following tables and exclude general corporate overhead and interest expense that would normally be allocated to these operations 

 

review of financial and operating results 

 

financial and operational highlights for our natural gas distribution segment for the fiscal years ended september 30 2011 2010 and 2009 are presented below 

 

 

the following table shows our operating income from continuing operations by natural gas distribution division in order of total rate base for the fiscal years ended september 30 2011 2010 and 2009 the presentation of our natural gas distribution operating income is included for financial reporting purposes and may not be appropriate for ratemaking purposes 

 

 

 

fiscal year ended september 30 2011 compared with fiscal year ended september 30 2010 

 

the 224 million increase in natural gas distribution gross profit primarily reflects a 404 million net increase in rate adjustments primarily in the midtex louisiana kentucky and kansas service areas 

 

these increases were partially offset by 

 

  

operating expenses which include operation and maintenance expense provision for doubtful accounts depreciation and amortization expense and taxes other than income decreased 55 million primarily due to the following 

 

  

these decreases were partially offset by 

 

  

net income for this segment for the yeartodate period was also favorably impacted by a 218 million pretax gain recognized in march 2011 as a result of unwinding two treasury locks and a 50 million income tax benefit related to the administrative settlement of various income tax positions 

 

fiscal year ended september 30 2010 compared with fiscal year ended september 30 2009 

 

the 244 million increase in natural gas distribution gross profit primarily reflects rate adjustments and increased throughput as follows 

 

 44 

 

  

these increases were partially offset by 

 

  

operating expenses which include operation and maintenance expense provision for doubtful accounts depreciation and amortization expense taxes other than income and asset impairments decreased 78 million primarily due to the following 

 

  

these decreases were partially offset by 

 

  

miscellaneous income decreased 44 million due to lower interest income interest charges decreased 55 million primarily due to lower shortterm debt balances and interest rates 

 

additionally results for the fiscal year ended september 30 2009 were favorably impacted by a onetime tax benefit of 105 million during the second quarter of fiscal 2009 the company completed a study of the calculations used to estimate its deferred tax rate and concluded that revisions to these calculations to include more specific jurisdictional tax rates would result in a more accurate calculation of the tax rate at which deferred taxes would reverse in the future accordingly the company modified the tax rate used to calculate deferred taxes from 38 percent to an individual rate for each legal entity these rates vary from 3641 percent depending on the jurisdiction of the legal entity 

 

regulated transmission and storage segment 

 

our regulated transmission and storage segment consists of the regulated pipeline and storage operations of the atmos pipeline — texas division the atmos pipeline — texas division transports natural gas to our midtex division and third parties and manages five underground storage reservoirs in texas we also provide ancillary services customary in the pipeline industry including parking arrangements lending and sales of excess gas 

 

similar to our natural gas distribution segment our regulated transmission and storage segment is impacted by seasonal weather patterns competitive factors in the energy industry and economic conditions in our midtex service area natural gas prices do not directly impact the results of this segment as revenues are derived from the transportation of natural gas however natural gas prices and demand for natural gas could influence the level of drilling activity in the markets that we serve which may influence the level of throughput we may be able to transport on our pipeline further natural gas price differences between the various hubs that we serve could influence customers to transport gas through our pipeline to capture arbitrage gains 

the results of atmos pipeline — texas division are also significantly impacted by the natural gas requirements of the midtex division because it is the primary supplier of natural gas for our midtex division 

 

finally as a regulated pipeline the operations of the atmos pipeline — texas division may be impacted by the timing of when costs and expenses are incurred and when these costs and expenses are recovered through its tariffs 

 

review of financial and operating results 

 

financial and operational highlights for our regulated transmission and storage segment for the fiscal years ended september 30 2011 2010 and 2009 are presented below 

 

 

 

fiscal year ended september 30 2011 compared with fiscal year ended september 30 2010 

 

on april 18 2011 the railroad commission of texas rrc issued an order in the rate case of atmos pipeline — texas apt that was originally filed in september 2010 the rrc approved an annual operating income increase of 204 million as well as the following major provisions that went into effect with bills rendered on and after may 1 2011 

 

 46 

 

the 164 million increase in regulated transmission and storage gross profit was attributable primarily to the following 

 

  

these increases were partially offset by the following 

 

  

operating expenses increased 51 million primarily due to the following 

 

  

these increases were partially offset by the following 

 

  

miscellaneous income includes a 60 million gain recognized in march 2011 as a result of unwinding two treasury locks 

 

fiscal year ended september 30 2010 compared with fiscal year ended september 30 2009 

 

the 66 million decrease in regulated transmission and storage gross profit was attributable primarily to the following factors 

 

  

these decreases were partially offset by the following 

 

  

operating expenses decreased 105 million primarily due to 

 

  

these decreases were partially offset by a 21 million increase in taxes other than income due to higher ad valorem and payroll taxes 

 

miscellaneous income decreased 13 million due primarily to a decline in intercompany interest income 

nonregulated segment 

 

our nonregulated activities are conducted through atmos energy holdings inc aeh which is a whollyowned subsidiary of atmos energy corporation and operates primarily in the midwest and southeast areas of the united states 

 

aeh’s primary business is to deliver gas and provide related services by aggregating and purchasing gas supply arranging transportation and storage logistics and ultimately delivering gas to customers at competitive prices in addition aeh utilizes proprietary and customerowned transportation and storage assets to provide various delivered gas services our customers request including furnishing natural gas supplies at fixed and marketbased prices contract negotiation and administration load forecasting gas storage acquisition and management services transportation services peaking sales and balancing services capacity utilization strategies and gas price hedging through the use of financial instruments as a result aeh’s gas delivery and related services margins arise from the types of commercial transactions we have structured with our customers and our ability to identify the lowest cost alternative among the natural gas supplies transportation and markets to which it has access to serve those customers 

 

aeh’s storage and transportation margins arise from i utilizing its proprietary 21mile pipeline located in new orleans louisiana to aggregate gas supply for our regulated natural gas distribution division in louisiana its gas delivery activities and on a more limited basis for third parties and ii managing proprietary storage in kentucky and louisiana to supplement the natural gas needs of our natural gas distribution divisions during peak periods 

 

aeh also seeks to enhance its gross profit margin by maximizing through asset optimization activities the economic value associated with the storage and transportation capacity it owns or controls in our natural gas distribution and by its subsidiaries we attempt to meet these objectives by engaging in natural gas storage transactions in which we seek to find and profit through the arbitrage of pricing differences in various locations and by recognizing pricing differences that occur over time this process involves purchasing physical natural gas storing it in the storage and transportation assets to which aeh has access and selling financial instruments at advantageous prices to lock in a gross profit margin 

 

aeh continually manages its net physical position to attempt to increase the future economic profit that was created when the original transaction was executed therefore aeh may subsequently change its originally scheduled storage injection and withdrawal plans from one time period to another based on market conditions if aeh elects to accelerate the withdrawal of physical gas it will execute new financial instruments to offset the original financial instruments if aeh elects to defer the withdrawal of gas it will execute new financial instruments to correspond to the revised withdrawal schedule and allow the original financial instrument to settle as contracted 

 

we use financial instruments designated as fair value hedges to hedge our natural gas inventory used in our natural gas marketing storage activities these financial instruments are marked to market each month based upon the nymex price with changes in fair value recognized as unrealized gains and losses in the period of change the hedged natural gas inventory is marked to market at the end of each month based on the gas daily index with changes in fair value recognized as unrealized gains and losses in the period of change changes in the spreads between the forward natural gas prices used to value the financial hedges designated against our physical inventory and the market spot prices used to value our physical storage result in unrealized margins until the underlying physical gas is withdrawn and the related financial instruments are settled once the gas is withdrawn and the financial instruments are settled the previously unrealized margins associated with these net positions are realized 

 

aeh also uses financial instruments to capture additional storage arbitrage opportunities that may arise after the original physical inventory hedge and to attempt to insulate and protect the economic value within its asset optimization activities changes in fair value associated with these financial instruments are recognized as a component of unrealized margins until they are settled 

 

due to the nature of these operations natural gas prices and differences in natural gas prices between the various markets that we serve commonly referred to as basis differentials have a significant impact on our 

nonregulated businesses within our delivered gas activities basis differentials impact our ability to create value from identifying the lowest cost alternative among the natural gas supplies transportation and markets to which we have access further higher natural gas prices may adversely impact our accounts receivable collections resulting in higher bad debt expense and may require us to increase borrowings under our credit facilities resulting in higher interest expense higher gas prices as well as competitive factors in the industry and general economic conditions may also cause customers to conserve or use alternative energy sources within our asset optimization activities higher gas prices could also lead to increased borrowings under our credit facilities resulting in higher interest expense 

 

volatility in natural gas prices also has a significant impact on our nonregulated segment increased price volatility often has a significant impact on the spreads between the market spot prices and forward natural gas prices which creates opportunities to earn higher arbitrage spreads within our asset optimization activities volatility could also impact the basis differentials we capture in our delivered gas activities however increased volatility impacts the amounts of unrealized margins recorded in our gross profit and could cause an increase in the amount of cash required to collateralize our risk management liabilities 

 

review of financial and operating results 

 

financial and operational highlights for our nonregulated segment for the fiscal years ended september 30 2011 2010 and 2009 are presented below gross profit margin consists primarily of margins earned from the delivery of gas and related services requested by our customers margins earned from storage and transportation services and margins earned from asset optimization activities which are derived from the utilization of our proprietary and managed thirdparty storage and transportation assets to capture favorable arbitrage spreads through natural gas trading activities 

 

unrealized margins represent the unrealized gains or losses on our net physical gas position and the related financial instruments used to manage commodity price risk as described above these margins fluctuate based upon changes in the spreads between the physical and forward natural gas prices generally if the physicalfinancial spread narrows we will record unrealized gains or lower unrealized losses if the physicalfinancial spread widens we will record unrealized losses or lower unrealized gains the magnitude of the unrealized gains and losses is also contingent upon the levels of our net physical position at the end of the reporting period 

 

 

 

 

  

fiscal year ended september 30 2011 compared with fiscal year ended september 30 2010 

 

realized margins for gas delivery storage and transportation services and other services were 788 million during the year ended september 30 2011 compared with 781 million for the prioryear period the increase primarily reflects the following 

 

  

the 472 million decrease in realized asset optimization margins from the prior year primarily reflects the unfavorable impact of weak natural gas market fundamentals which provided fewer favorable trading opportunities 

unrealized margins decreased 26 million in the current period compared to the prioryear period primarily due to the timing of yearoveryear realized margins 

 

operating expenses decreased 50 million primarily due to lower employeerelated expenses and ad valorem taxes 

 

during fiscal 2011 our nonregulated segment recognized 303 million of noncash asset impairment charges associated with two projects in march 2011 we recorded a 193 million charge to substantially write off our investment in fort necessity this project began in february 2008 when atmos pipeline and storage llc a subsidiary of aeh announced plans to construct and operate a saltcavern storage project in franklin parish louisiana in march 2010 we entered into an option and acquisition agreement with a third party which provided the third party with the exclusive option to develop the proposed fort necessity saltdome natural gas storage project in july 2010 we agreed with the third party to extend the option period to march 2011 in january 2011 the third party developer notified us that it did not plan to commence the activities required to allow it to exercise the option by march 2011 accordingly the option was terminated at that time we evaluated our strategic alternatives and concluded the project’s returns did not meet our investment objectives additionally during the third quarter of fiscal 2011 we recorded an 110 million noncash charge to impair certain natural gas gathering assets of atmos gathering company the charge reflected a reduction in the value of the project due to the current low natural gas price environment and the adverse impact of an ongoing lawsuit associated with the project 

 

interest charges decreased 66 million primarily due to a decrease in intercompany borrowings 

 

asset optimization activities 

 

aeh monitors the impact of its asset optimization efforts by estimating the gross profit before related fees that it captured through the purchase and sale of physical natural gas and the execution of the associated financial instruments this economic value combined with the effect of the future reversal of unrealized gains or losses currently recognized in the income statement and related fees is referred to as the potential gross profit 

 

we define potential gross profit as the change in aeh’s gross profit in future periods if its optimization efforts are executed as planned this amount does not include other operating expenses and associated income taxes that will be incurred to realize this amount therefore it does not represent an estimated increase in future net income there is no assurance that the economic value or the potential gross profit will be fully realized in the future 

 

we consider this measure a nongaap financial measure as it is calculated using both forwardlooking storage injectionwithdrawal and hedge settlement estimates and historical financial information this measure is presented because we believe it provides a more comprehensive view to investors of our asset optimization efforts and thus a better understanding of these activities than would be presented by gaap measures alone because there is no assurance that the economic value or potential gross profit will be realized in the future corresponding future gaap amounts are not available 

the following table presents aeh’s economic value and its potential gross profit loss at september 30 2011 and 2010 

 

 

 

 

  

during the 2011 fiscal year our nonregulated segment’s economic value increased from a negative economic value of 75 million or 048mcf at september 30 2010 to 49 million or 023mcf at september 30 2011 

 

the increase in economic value was attributable to several factors including an increase in the captured spread value resulting from realizing financial instruments with lower spread values entering into financial hedges with higher average prices and rolling financial instruments to forward periods to capture incremental value additionally as a result of falling gas prices throughout the year we injected a net 53 bcf which reduced the overall weighted average cost of gas held in storage 

 

the economic value is based upon planned storage injection and withdrawal schedules and its realization is contingent upon the execution of this plan weather and other execution factors since aeh actively manages and optimizes its portfolio to attempt to enhance the future profitability of its storage position it may change its scheduled storage injection and withdrawal plans from one time period to another based on market conditions therefore we cannot ensure that the economic value or the potential gross profit as of september 30 2011 will be fully realized in the future nor can we predict in what time periods such realization may occur further if we experience operational or other issues which limit our ability to optimally manage our stored gas positions our earnings could be adversely impacted 

 

fiscal year ended september 30 2010 compared with fiscal year ended september 30 2009 

 

realized margins for gas delivery storage and transportation services and other services contributed 64 percent to total realized margins during fiscal 2010 with asset optimization activities contributing the remaining 36 percent in fiscal 2009 gas delivery storage and transportation services and other services represented 65 percent of the nonregulated segment’s realized margins with asset optimization contributing the remaining 35 percent the 281 million decrease in realized gross profit reflected 

 

 52 

 

the decrease in realized gross profit was offset by a 281 million increase in unrealized margins due to the periodoverperiod timing of storage withdrawal gains and the associated reversal of unrealized gains into realized gains 

 

operating expenses which include operation and maintenance expense provision for doubtful accounts depreciation and amortization expense taxes other than income taxes and asset impairments decreased 51 million primarily due a decrease in employee and other administrative costs partially offset by an increase in gas gathering activities 

 

liquidity and capital resources 

 

the liquidity required to fund our working capital capital expenditures and other cash needs is provided from a variety of sources including internally generated funds and borrowings under our commercial paper program and bank credit facilities additionally we have various uncommitted trade credit lines with our gas suppliers that we utilize to purchase natural gas on a monthly basis finally from time to time we raise funds from the public debt and equity capital markets to fund our liquidity needs 

 

we regularly evaluate our funding strategy and profile to ensure that we have sufficient liquidity for our shortterm and longterm needs in a costeffective manner we also evaluate the levels of committed borrowing capacity that we require during fiscal 2011 we executed on our strategy of consolidating our shortterm facilities used for our regulated operations into a single line of credit including the following 

 

  

as a result of these changes we now have 985 million of availability from our commercial paper program and four committed revolving credit facilities with third parties 

 

our 350 million 7375 senior notes were paid on their maturity date on may 15 2011 using commercial paper borrowings in effect we refinanced this debt on a longterm basis through the issuance of 400 million 550 30year unsecured senior notes on june 10 2011 on september 30 2010 we entered into three treasury lock agreements to fix the treasury yield component of the interest cost of financing the anticipated issuances of senior notes the treasury locks were settled on june 7 2011 with the receipt of 201 million from the counterparties due to an increase in the 30year treasury lock rates between inception of the treasury lock and settlement the effective interest rate on these notes is 5381 percent after giving effect to offering costs and the settlement of the 300 million treasury locks substantially all of the net proceeds of approximately 394 million were used to repay 350 million of outstanding commercial paper the remainder of the net proceeds was used for general corporate purposes 

 

additionally we had planned to issue 250 million of 30year unsecured notes in november 2011 to fund our capital expenditure program in september 2010 we entered into two treasury lock agreements to fix the treasury yield component of the interest cost associated with the anticipated issuance of these senior notes which were designated as cash flow hedges due primarily to stronger than anticipated cash flows primarily resulting from the extension of the bush tax cuts that allow the continued use of bonus depreciation on qualifying expenditures through december 31 2011 the need to issue 250 million of debt in november was eliminated and the related treasury lock agreements were unwound a pretax cash gain of approximately 28 million was recorded in march 2011 

finally we intend to refinance our 250 million unsecured 5125 senior notes that mature in january 2013 through the issuance of 350 million 30year unsecured notes in august 2011 we entered into three treasury lock agreements to fix the treasury yield component of the interest cost associated with the anticipated issuances of these senior notes we designated all of these treasury locks as cash flow hedges 

 

we believe the liquidity provided by our senior notes and committed credit facilities combined with our operating cash flows will be sufficient to fund our working capital needs and capital expenditure program for fiscal year 2012 

 

cash flows 

 

our internally generated funds may change in the future due to a number of factors some of which we cannot control these include regulatory changes the price for our services the demand for such products and services margin requirements resulting from significant changes in commodity prices operational risks and other factors 

 

cash flows from operating investing and financing activities for the years ended september 30 2011 2010 and 2009 are presented below 

 

 

 

cash flows from operating activities 

 

yearoveryear changes in our operating cash flows primarily are attributable to changes in net income working capital changes particularly within our natural gas distribution segment resulting from the price of natural gas and the timing of customer collections payments for natural gas purchases and purchased gas cost recoveries the significant factors impacting our operating cash flow for the last three fiscal years are summarized below 

 

fiscal year ended september 30 2011 compared with fiscal year ended september 30 2010 

 

for the fiscal year ended september 30 2011 we generated operating cash flow of 5828 million from operating activities compared with 7265 million in the prior year the yearoveryear decrease reflects the absence of an 85 million income tax refund received in the prior year coupled with the timing of gas cost recoveries under our purchased gas cost mechanisms and other net working capital changes 

 

fiscal year ended september 30 2010 compared with fiscal year ended september 30 2009 

 

for the fiscal year ended september 30 2010 we generated operating cash flow of 7265 million from operating activities compared with 9192 million in fiscal 2009 primarily due to the fluctuation in gas costs gas costs which reached historically high levels during the 2008 injection season declined sharply when the economy slipped into the recession and have remained relatively stable since that time operating cash flows for the fiscal 2010 period reflect the recovery of lower gas costs through purchased gas recovery mechanisms 

and sales this is in contrast to the fiscal 2009 period where operating cash flows were favorably influenced by the recovery of high gas costs during a period of falling prices 

 

cash flows from investing activities 

 

in recent fiscal years a substantial portion of our cash resources has been used to fund our ongoing construction program and improvements to information technology systems our ongoing construction program enables us to provide safe and reliable natural gas distribution services to our existing customer base expand our natural gas distribution services into new markets enhance the integrity of our pipelines and more recently expand our intrastate pipeline network in executing our current rate strategy we are focusing our capital spending in jurisdictions that permit us to earn an adequate return timely on our investment without compromising the safety or reliability of our system currently our midtex louisiana mississippi and west texas natural gas distribution divisions and our atmos pipeline — texas division have rate designs that provide the opportunity to include in their rate base approved capital costs on a periodic basis without being required to file a rate case 

 

in early fiscal 2010 two coalitions of cities representing the majority of the cities our midtex division serves agreed to a program of installing beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2011 100000 steel service line replacements during fiscal 2011 and 2012 with approved recovery of the associated return depreciation and taxes during fiscal 2011 we replaced 35852 lines for a cost of 497 million the program is progressing on schedule for completion in september 2012 as a result of this project and spending to replace our regulated customer service systems and our nonregulated energy trading risk management system we anticipate capital expenditures will remain elevated during the next fiscal year 

 

for the fiscal year ended september 30 2011 we incurred 6230 million for capital expenditures compared with 5426 million for the fiscal year ended september 30 2010 and 5095 million for the fiscal year ended september 30 2009 

 

the 804 million increase in capital expenditures in fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 primarily reflects spending for the steel service line replacement program in the midtex division the development of new customer billing and information systems for our natural gas distribution and our nonregulated segments and the construction of a new customer contact center in amarillo texas partially offset by costs incurred in the prior fiscal year to relocate the company’s information technology data center 

 

the 331 million increase in capital expenditures in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 primarily reflects spending for the relocation of our information technology data center to a new facility the construction of two service centers and the steel service line replacement program in our midtex division 

 

cash flows from financing activities 

 

for the fiscal year ended september 30 2011 our financing activities generated 440 million in cash while financing activities for the fiscal year ended september 30 2010 used 1630 million in cash compared with cash of 3375 million used for the fiscal year ended september 30 2009 our significant financing activities for the fiscal years ended september 30 2011 2010 and 2009 are summarized as follows

the following table shows the number of shares issued for the fiscal years ended september 30 2011 2010 and 2009 

 

 

 

the number of shares issued in fiscal 2011 compared with the number of shares issued in fiscal 2010 primarily reflects an increased number of shares issued under our 1998 longterm incentive plan due to the exercise of stock options during the current fiscal year this increase was partially offset by the fact that we 

are purchasing shares in the open market rather than issuing new shares for the direct stock purchase plan and the retirement savings plan during fiscal 2011 we cancelled and retired 169793 shares attributable to federal withholdings on equity awards and repurchased and retired 375468 shares attributable to our 2010 accelerated share repurchase agreement described below which are not included in the table above 

 

the yearoveryear decrease in the number of shares issued in fiscal 2010 compared with the number of shares issued in fiscal 2009 primarily reflects the fact that in fiscal 2010 we began to purchase shares in the open market rather than issuing new shares for the direct stock purchase plan and the retirement savings plan further a higher average stock price during the second and third quarters of fiscal 2010 compared to the second and third quarters of 2009 enabled us to issue fewer shares during fiscal 2010 additionally during fiscal 2010 we cancelled and retired 37365 shares attributable to federal withholdings on equity awards and repurchased and retired 2958580 common shares as part of our 2010 accelerated share repurchase agreement described below which are not included in the table above 

 

share repurchase agreement 

 

on july 1 2010 we entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement with goldman sachs  co under which we repurchased 100 million of our outstanding common stock in order to offset stock grants made under our various employee and director incentive compensation plans 

 

we paid 100 million to goldman sachs  co on july 7 2010 for shares of atmos energy common stock in a share forward transaction and received 2958580 shares on march 4 2011 we received and retired an additional 375468 common shares which concluded our share repurchase agreement in total we received and retired 3334048 common shares under the repurchase agreement the final number of shares we ultimately repurchased in the transaction was based generally on the average of the effective share repurchase price of our common stock over the duration of the agreement which was 2999 as a result of this transaction beginning in our fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 the number of outstanding shares used to calculate our earnings per share was reduced by the number of shares received and the 100 million purchase price was recorded as a reduction in shareholders’ equity 

 

share repurchase program 

 

on september 28 2011 the board of directors approved a new program authorizing the repurchase of up to five million shares of common stock over a fiveyear period although the program is authorized for a fiveyear period it may be terminated or limited at any time shares may be repurchased in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions in amounts the company deems appropriate the program is primarily intended to minimize the dilutive effect of equity grants under various benefit related incentive compensation plans of the company 

 

credit facilities 

 

our shortterm borrowing requirements are affected by the seasonal nature of the natural gas business changes in the price of natural gas and the amount of natural gas we need to supply to meet our customers’ needs could significantly affect our borrowing requirements however our shortterm borrowings typically reach their highest levels in the winter months 

 

as of september 30 2011 we financed our shortterm borrowing requirements through a combination of a 7500 million commercial paper program and four committed revolving credit facilities with thirdparty lenders that provided 985 million of working capital funding as of september 30 2011 the amount available to us under our credit facilities net of outstanding letters of credit was 7025 million these facilities are described in further detail in note 7 to the consolidated financial statements 

 

on may 2 2011 we replaced our fiveyear 5667 million unsecured credit facility due to expire in december 2011 with a fiveyear 750 million unsecured credit facility with an accordion feature that could increase our borrowing capacity to 10 billion 

in december 2010 we replaced aem’s 450 million 364day facility with a 200 million threeyear facility the reduced amount of the new facility is due to the current low cost of gas and aem’s ability to access an intercompany facility that was increased in fiscal 2011 however this facility contains an accordion feature that could increase our borrowing capacity to 500 million 

 

in october 2010 we replaced our 200 million 364day revolving credit agreement with a 200 million 180day revolving credit agreement that expired in april 2011 as planned we did not replace or extend this agreement 

 

shelf registration 

 

we have an effective shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission sec that permits us to issue a total of 13 billion in common stock andor debt securities the shelf registration statement has been approved by all requisite state regulatory commissions due to certain restrictions imposed by one state regulatory commission on our ability to issue securities under the new registration statement we were able to issue a total of 950 million in debt securities and 350 million in equity securities at september 30 2011 900 million was available for issuance of this amount 550 million is available for the issuance of debt securities and 350 million remains available for the issuance of equity securities under the shelf until march 2013 

 

credit ratings 

 

our credit ratings directly affect our ability to obtain shortterm and longterm financing in addition to the cost of such financing in determining our credit ratings the rating agencies consider a number of quantitative factors including debt to total capitalization operating cash flow relative to outstanding debt operating cash flow coverage of interest and pension liabilities and funding status in addition the rating agencies consider qualitative factors such as consistency of our earnings over time the quality of our management and business strategy the risks associated with our regulated and nonregulated businesses and the regulatory environment in the states where we operate 

 

our debt is rated by three rating agencies standard  poor’s corporation sp moody’s investors service moody’s and fitch ratings ltd fitch on may 11 2011 moody’s upgraded our senior unsecured debt rating to baa1 from baa2 with a ratings outlook of stable citing steady rate increases improving credit metrics and a strategic focus on lower risk regulated activities as reasons for the upgrade on june 2 2011 fitch upgraded our senior unsecured debt rating to a from bbb with a ratings outlook of stable citing a constructive regulatory environment strategic focus on lower risk regulated activities and the geographic diversity of our regulated operations as key rating factors as of september 30 2011 sp maintained a stable outlook our current debt ratings are all considered investment grade and are as follows 

 

 

 

a significant degradation in our operating performance or a significant reduction in our liquidity caused by more limited access to the private and public credit markets as a result of deteriorating global or national financial and credit conditions could trigger a negative change in our ratings outlook or even a reduction in our credit ratings by the three credit rating agencies this would mean more limited access to the private and public credit markets and an increase in the costs of such borrowings 

 

a credit rating is not a recommendation to buy sell or hold securities the highest investment grade credit rating is aaa for sp aaa for moody’s and aaa for fitch the lowest investment grade credit rating is bbbfor sp baa3 for moody’s and bbb for fitch our credit ratings may be revised or withdrawn at any time by the rating agencies and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating there can be no assurance that a rating will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if in its judgment circumstances so warrant 

debt covenants 

 

we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants as of september 30 2011 our debt covenants are described in note 7 to the consolidated financial statements 

 

capitalization 

 

the following table presents our capitalization as of september 30 2011 and 2010 

 

 

 

total debt as a percentage of total capitalization including shortterm debt was 517 percent and 513 percent at september 30 2011 and 2010 the increase in the debt to capitalization ratio primarily reflects an increase in shortterm debt as of september 30 2011 compared to the prior year our ratio of total debt to capitalization is typically greater during the winter heating season as we make additional shortterm borrowings to fund natural gas purchases and meet our working capital requirements we intend to continue to maintain our debt to capitalization ratio in a target range of 50 to 55 percent 

 

contractual obligations and commercial commitments 

 

the following table provides information about contractual obligations and commercial commitments at september 30 2011 

 

 

 

 

 59 

 

  

aeh has commitments to purchase physical quantities of natural gas under contracts indexed to the forward nymex strip or fixed price contracts at september 30 2011 aeh was committed to purchase 1033 bcf within one year 464 bcf within one to three years and 09 bcf after three years under indexed contracts aeh is committed to purchase 42 bcf within one year and 03 bcf within one to three years under fixed price contracts with prices ranging from 349 to 636 per mcf 

 

with the exception of our midtex division our natural gas distribution segment maintains supply contracts with several vendors that generally cover a period of up to one year commitments for estimated base gas volumes are established under these contracts on a monthly basis at contractually negotiated prices commitments for incremental daily purchases are made as necessary during the month in accordance with the terms of the individual contract our midtex division maintains longterm supply contracts to ensure a reliable source of natural gas for our customers in its service area which obligate it to purchase specified volumes at market prices the estimated commitments under these contract terms as of september 30 2011 are reflected in the table above 

 

risk management activities 

 

we use financial instruments to mitigate commodity price risk and periodically to manage interest rate risk we conduct risk management activities through our natural gas distribution and nonregulated segments in our natural gas distribution segment we use a combination of physical storage fixed physical contracts and fixed financial contracts to reduce our exposure to unusually large winterperiod gas price increases in our nonregulated segments we manage our exposure to the risk of natural gas price changes and lock in our gross profit margin through a combination of storage and financial instruments including futures overthecounter and exchangetraded options and swap contracts with counterparties to the extent our inventory cost and actual sales and actual purchases do not correlate with the changes in the market indices we use in our hedges we could experience ineffectiveness or the hedges may no longer meet the accounting requirements for hedge accounting resulting in the financial instruments being treated as mark to market instruments through earnings 

 

we use financial instruments designated as cash flow hedges of anticipated purchases and sales at index prices to mitigate the commodity price risk in our nonregulated segment associated with deliveries under fixedpriced forward contracts to deliver gas to customers and we use financial instruments designated as fair value hedges to hedge our natural gas inventory used in our asset optimization activities in our nonregulated segment 

 

also in our nonregulated segment we use storage swaps and futures to capture additional storage arbitrage opportunities that arise subsequent to the execution of the original fair value hedge associated with our physical natural gas inventory basis swaps to insulate and protect the economic value of our fixed price and storage books and various overthecounter and exchangetraded options these financial instruments have not been designated as hedges 

we record our financial instruments as a component of risk management assets and liabilities which are classified as current or noncurrent based upon the anticipated settlement date of the underlying financial instrument substantially all of our financial instruments are valued using external market quotes and indices 

 

the following table shows the components of the change in fair value of our natural gas distribution segment’s financial instruments for the fiscal year ended september 30 2011 in thousands 

 

 

 

the fair value of our natural gas distribution segment’s financial instruments at september 30 2011 is presented below by time period and fair value source 

 

 

 

the tables above include 13 million of current liabilities from risk management activities that are classified as liabilities held for sale in conjunction with the sale of our iowa illinois and missouri operations 

 

the following table shows the components of the change in fair value of our nonregulated segment’s financial instruments for the fiscal year ended september 30 2011 in thousands 

 

 

 

the fair value of our nonregulated segment’s financial instruments at september 30 2011 is presented below by time period and fair value source 

 

 

employee benefit programs 

 

an important element of our total compensation program and a significant component of our operation and maintenance expense is the offering of various benefit programs to our employees these programs include medical and dental insurance coverage and pension and postretirement programs 

 

medical and dental insurance 

 

we offer medical and dental insurance programs to substantially all of our employees and we believe these programs are consistent with other programs in our industry since 2005 we have experienced medical and prescription inflation of approximately seven percent in recent years we have strived to actively manage our health care costs through the introduction of a wellness strategy that is focused on helping employees to identify health risks and to manage these risks through improved lifestyle choices 

 

in march 2010 president obama signed the patient protection and affordable care act into law the “health care reform act” the health care reform act will be phased in over an eightyear period although we are still assessing the impact of the health care reform act on the health care benefits we provide to our employees the design of our health care plans has already changed in order to comply with provisions of the health care reform act that have already gone into effect or will be going into effect in fiscal 2012 for example lifetime maximums on benefits have been eliminated coverage for dependent children has been extended to age 26 and all costs of preventive coverage must be paid for by the insurer in 2014 health insurance exchanges will open in each state in order to provide a competitive marketplace for purchasing health insurance by individuals companies who offer health insurance to their employees could face a substantial increase in premiums at that time if they choose to continue to provide such coverage however companies who elect to cease providing health insurance to their employees will be faced with paying significant penalties to the federal government for each employee who receives coverage through an exchange we will continue to monitor all developments on health care reform and continue to comply with all existing relevant laws and regulations 

 

for fiscal 2012 we anticipate an approximate 10 percent medical and prescription drug inflation rate primarily due to anticipated higher claims costs and the implementation of the health care reform act 

 

net periodic pension and postretirement benefit costs 

 

for the fiscal year ended september 30 2011 our total net periodic pension and other benefits costs was 566 million compared with 508 million and 502 million for the fiscal years ended september 30 2010 and 2009 these costs relating to our natural gas distribution operations are recoverable through our gas distribution rates a portion of these costs is capitalized into our gas distribution rate base and the remaining costs are recorded as a component of operation and maintenance expense 

 

our fiscal 2011 costs were determined using a september 30 2010 measurement date as of september 30 2010 interest and corporate bond rates utilized to determine our discount rates were significantly higher than the interest and corporate bond rates as of september 30 2009 the measurement date for our fiscal 2010 net periodic cost accordingly we decreased our discount rate used to determine our fiscal 2011 pension and benefit costs to 539 percent our expected return on our pension plan assets remained constant at 825 percent accordingly our fiscal 2011 pension and postretirement medical costs were higher than in the prior year 

 

the increase in total net periodic pension and other benefits costs during fiscal 2010 compared with fiscal 2009 primarily reflects the decline in fair value of our plan assets the discount rate used to compute the present value of a plan’s liabilities generally is based on rates of highgrade corporate bonds with maturities similar to the average period over which the benefits will be paid at our september 30 2009 measurement date the interest rates were slightly lower than the interest rates at september 30 2008 the measurement date used to determine our fiscal 2009 net periodic cost our expected return on our pension plan assets remained constant at 825 percent 

 

pension and postretirement plan funding 

 

generally our funding policy is to contribute annually an amount that will at least equal the minimum amount required to comply with the employee retirement income security act of 1974 however additional voluntary contributions are made from time to time as considered necessary contributions are intended to provide not only for benefits attributed to service to date but also for those expected to be earned in the future 

 

in accordance with the pension protection act of 2006 ppa we determined the funded status of our plans as of january 1 2011 based on this valuation we were required to contribute cash of 09 million to our pension plans during fiscal 2011 the need for this funding reflects the decline in the fair value of the plans’ assets resulting from the unfavorable market conditions experienced during 2008 and 2009 this contribution will increase the level of our plan assets to achieve a desirable ppa funding threshold 

 

during fiscal 2010 we did not contribute cash to our pension plans as the fair value of the plans’ assets recovered somewhat during the year from the unfavorable market conditions experienced in the latter half of calendar year 2008 and our plan assets were sufficient to achieve a desirable funding threshold as established by the ppa during fiscal 2009 we contributed 210 million to our pension plans to achieve the same desired level of funding as established by the ppa 

 

we contributed 113 million 118 million and 101 million to our postretirement benefits plans for the fiscal years ended september 30 2011 2010 and 2009 the contributions represent the portion of the postretirement costs we are responsible for under the terms of our plan and minimum funding required by state regulatory commissions 

 

outlook for fiscal 2012 and beyond 

 

as of september 30 2011 interest and corporate bond rates utilized to determine our discount rates which impacted our fiscal 2012 net periodic pension and postretirement costs were lower than the interest and corporate bond rates as of september 30 2010 the measurement date for our fiscal 2011 net periodic cost as a result of the lower interest and corporate bond rates we decreased the discount rate used to determine our fiscal 2012 pension and benefit costs to 505 percent we reduced the expected return on our pension plan assets to 775 percent based on historical experience and the current market projection of the target asset allocation although the fair value of our plan assets has declined as the financial markets have declined the impact of this decline is partially mitigated by the fact that assets are smoothed for purposes of determining net periodic pension cost which results in asset gains and losses that are recognized over time as a component of net periodic pension and benefit costs for our pension account plan our largest funded plan due to the decrease in our discount rate and our expected return on plan assets as well as the decline in the fair value of our plan assets we expect our fiscal 2012 pension and postretirement medical costs to increase compared to fiscal 2011 

 

based upon market conditions subsequent to september 30 2011 the current funded position of the plans and the new funding requirements under the ppa we anticipate contributing between 25 million and 30 million to the plans in fiscal 2012 further we will consider whether an additional voluntary contribution is prudent to maintain certain ppa funding thresholds with respect to our postretirement medical plans we anticipate contributing approximately 32 million during fiscal 2012 

 

the projected pension liability future funding requirements and the amount of pension expense or income recognized for the plan are subject to change depending upon the actuarial value of plan assets and the determination of future benefit obligations as of each subsequent actuarial calculation date these amounts are impacted by actual investment returns changes in interest rates and changes in the demographic composition of the participants in the plan 

 

in august 2010 the board of directors of atmos energy approved a proposal to close the pension account plan pap to new participants effective october 1 2010 employees participating in the pap as of october 1 2010 were allowed to make a onetime election to migrate from the pap into our defined contribution plan with enhanced features effective january 1 2011 participants who chose to remain in the pap will continue to earn benefits and interest allocations with no changes to their existing benefits

recent accounting developments and their impact on our financial position results of operations and cash flows are described in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements

 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend  

we are exposed to risks associated with commodity prices and interest rates commodity price risk is the potential loss that we may incur as a result of changes in the fair value of a particular instrument or commodity interestrate risk results from our portfolio of debt and equity instruments that we issue to provide financing and liquidity for our business activities 

 

we conduct risk management activities through both our natural gas distribution and nonregulated segments in our natural gas distribution segment we use a combination of physical storage fixed physical contracts and fixed financial contracts to protect us and our customers against unusually large winter period gas price increases in our nonregulated segment we manage our exposure to the risk of natural gas price changes and lock in our gross profit margin through a combination of storage and financial instruments including futures overthecounter and exchangetraded options and swap contracts with counterparties our risk management activities and related accounting treatment are described in further detail in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements additionally our earnings are affected by changes in shortterm interest rates as a result of our issuance of shortterm commercial paper and our other shortterm borrowings 

 

commodity price risk 

 

natural gas distribution segment 

 

we purchase natural gas for our natural gas distribution operations substantially all of the costs of gas purchased for natural gas distribution operations are recovered from our customers through purchased gas cost adjustment mechanisms therefore our natural gas distribution operations have limited commodity price risk exposure 

 

nonregulated segment 

 

our nonregulated segment is also exposed to risks associated with changes in the market price of natural gas for our nonregulated segment we use a sensitivity analysis to estimate commodity price risk for purposes of this analysis we estimate commodity price risk by applying a 050 change in the forward nymex price to our net open position including existing storage and related financial contracts at the end of each period based on aeh’s net open position including existing storage and related financial contracts at september 30 2011 of 01 bcf a 050 change in the forward nymex price would have had a 01 million impact on our consolidated net income 

 

changes in the difference between the indices used to mark to market our physical inventory gas daily and the related fairvalue hedge nymex can result in volatility in our reported net income but over time gains and losses on the sale of storage gas inventory will be offset by gains and losses on the fairvalue hedges based upon our net physical position at september 30 2011 and assuming our hedges would still qualify as highly effective a 050 change in the difference between the gas daily and nymex indices would impact our reported net income by approximately 67 million 

 

additionally these changes could cause us to recognize a risk management liability which would require us to place cash into an escrow account to collateralize this liability position this in turn would reduce the amount of cash we would have on hand to fund our working capital needs 

 

interest rate risk 

 

our earnings are exposed to changes in shortterm interest rates associated with our shortterm commercial paper program and other shortterm borrowings we use a sensitivity analysis to estimate our shortterm interest rate risk for purposes of this analysis we estimate our shortterm interest rate risk as the difference between our actual interest expense for the period and estimated interest expense for the period assuming a hypothetical average one percent increase in the interest rates associated with our shortterm borrowings had interest rates associated with our shortterm borrowings increased by an average of one percent our interest expense would have increased by approximately 12 million during 2011

overview and strategy 

 

atmos energy corporation headquartered in dallas texas is engaged primarily in the regulated natural gas distribution and transmission and storage businesses as well as other nonregulated natural gas businesses since our incorporation in texas in 1983 we have grown primarily through a series of acquisitions the most recent of which was the acquisition in october 2004 of the natural gas distribution and pipeline operations of txu gas company we are also incorporated in the state of virginia 

 

today we distribute natural gas through regulated sales and transportation arrangements to over three million residential commercial public authority and industrial customers in 12 states located primarily in the south which makes us one of the country’s largest naturalgasonly distributors based on number of customers we also operate one of the largest intrastate pipelines in texas based on miles of pipe 

 

through our nonregulated businesses we primarily provide natural gas management and marketing services to municipalities other local gas distribution companies and industrial customers principally in the midwest and southeast and natural gas transportation along with storage services to certain of our natural gas distribution divisions and third parties 

 

our overall strategy is to 

 

  

we have continued to grow our earnings after giving effect to our acquisitions and have experienced more than 25 consecutive years of increasing dividends and earnings historically we achieved this record of growth through acquisitions while efficiently managing our operating and maintenance expenses and leveraging our technology to achieve more efficient operations in recent years we have also achieved growth by implementing rate designs that reduce or eliminate regulatory lag and separate the recovery of our approved margins from customer usage patterns in addition we have developed various commercial opportunities within our regulated transmission and storage operations 

 

our core values include focusing on our employees and customers while conducting our business with honesty and integrity we continue to strengthen our culture through ongoing communications with our employees and enhanced employee training 

 

operating segments 

 

we operate the company through the following four segments 

 

 4 

 

  

these operating segments are described in greater detail below 

 

natural gas distribution segment overview 

 

our natural gas distribution segment consists of the following six regulated divisions presented in order of total rate base covering service areas in 12 states 

 

  

our natural gas distribution business is a seasonal business gas sales to residential and commercial customers are greater during the winter months than during the remainder of the year the volumes of gas sales during the winter months will vary with the temperatures during these months 

 

revenues in this operating segment are established by regulatory authorities in the states in which we operate these rates are intended to be sufficient to cover the costs of conducting business and to provide a reasonable return on invested capital our primary service areas are located in colorado kansas kentucky louisiana mississippi tennessee and texas we have more limited service areas in georgia illinois iowa missouri and virginia in addition we transport natural gas for others through our distribution system 

 

rates established by regulatory authorities often include cost adjustment mechanisms for costs that i are subject to significant price fluctuations compared to our other costs ii represent a large component of our cost of service and iii are generally outside our control 

 

purchased gas cost adjustment mechanisms represent a common form of cost adjustment mechanism purchased gas cost adjustment mechanisms provide natural gas utility companies a method of recovering purchased gas costs on an ongoing basis without filing a rate case because they provide a dollarfordollar offset to increases or decreases in natural gas distribution gas costs therefore although substantially all of our natural gas distribution operating revenues fluctuate with the cost of gas that we purchase natural gas distribution gross profit which is defined as operating revenues less purchased gas cost is generally not affected by fluctuations in the cost of gas 

 

additionally some jurisdictions have introduced performancebased ratemaking adjustments to provide incentives to natural gas utilities to minimize purchased gas costs through improved storage management and use of financial instruments to lock in gas costs under the performancebased ratemaking adjustment purchased gas costs savings are shared between the utility and its customers 

 

finally regulatory authorities have approved weather normalization adjustments wna for approximately 94 percent of residential and commercial margins in our service areas as a part of our rates wna minimizes the effect of weather that is above or below normal by allowing us to increase customers’ bills to offset lower gas usage when weather is warmer than normal and decrease customers’ bills to offset higher gas usage when weather is colder than normal 

as of september 30 2010 we had wna for our residential and commercial meters in the following service areas for the following periods 

 

 

 

our supply of natural gas is provided by a variety of suppliers including independent producers marketers and pipeline companies and withdrawals of gas from proprietary and contracted storage assets additionally the natural gas supply for our midtex division includes peaking and spot purchase agreements 

 

supply arrangements consist of both base load and swing supply peaking quantities and are contracted from our suppliers on a firm basis with various terms at market prices base load quantities are those that flow at a constant level throughout the month and swing supply quantities provide the flexibility to change daily quantities to match increases or decreases in requirements related to weather conditions 

 

except for local production purchases we select our natural gas suppliers through a competitive bidding process by requesting proposals from suppliers that have demonstrated that they can provide reliable service we select these suppliers based on their ability to deliver gas supply to our designated firm pipeline receipt points at the lowest cost major suppliers during fiscal 2010 were anadarko energy services bp energy company devon gas services lp enbridge marketing us lp iberdrola renewables inc national fuel marketing company llc oneok energy services company lp tenaska marketing texla energy management inc and atmos energy marketing llc our natural gas marketing subsidiary 

 

the combination of base load peaking and spot purchase agreements coupled with the withdrawal of gas held in storage allows us the flexibility to adjust to changes in weather which minimizes our need to enter into longterm firm commitments we estimate our peakday availability of natural gas supply to be approximately 42 bcf the peakday demand for our natural gas distribution operations in fiscal 2010 was on january 8 2010 when sales to customers reached approximately 40 bcf 

 

currently all of our natural gas distribution divisions except for our midtex division utilize 39 pipeline transportation companies both interstate and intrastate to transport our natural gas the pipeline transportation agreements are firm and many of them have “pipeline nonotice” storage service which provides for daily balancing between system requirements and nominated flowing supplies these agreements have been negotiated with the shortest term necessary while still maintaining our right of first refusal the natural gas supply for our midtex division is delivered solely by our atmos pipeline — texas division 

 

to maintain our deliveries to high priority customers we have the ability and have exercised our right to curtail deliveries to certain customers under the terms of interruptible contracts or applicable state regulations or statutes our customers’ demand on our system is not necessarily indicative of our ability to meet current or anticipated market demands or immediate delivery requirements because of factors such as the physical limitations of gathering storage and transmission systems the duration and severity of cold weather the availability of gas reserves from our suppliers the ability to purchase additional supplies on a shortterm basis and actions by federal and state regulatory authorities curtailment rights provide us the flexibility to meet the humanneeds requirements of our customers on a firm basis priority allocations imposed by federal and state regulatory agencies as well as other factors beyond our control may affect our ability to meet the demands of our customers we anticipate no problems with obtaining additional gas supply as needed for our customers 

 

the following briefly describes our six natural gas distribution divisions we operate in our service areas under terms of nonexclusive franchise agreements granted by the various cities and towns that we serve at september 30 2010 we held 1115 franchises having terms generally ranging from five to 35 years a significant number of our franchises expire each year which require renewal prior to the end of their terms we believe that we will be able to renew our franchises as they expire additional information concerning our natural gas distribution divisions is presented under the caption “operating statistics” 

atmos energy midtex division our midtex division serves approximately 550 incorporated and unincorporated communities in the northcentral eastern and western parts of texas including the dallasfort worth metroplex the governing body of each municipality we serve has original jurisdiction over all gas distribution rates operations and services within its city limits except with respect to sales of natural gas for vehicle fuel and agricultural use the railroad commission of texas rrc has exclusive appellate jurisdiction over all rate and regulatory orders and ordinances of the municipalities and exclusive original jurisdiction over rates and services to customers not located within the limits of a municipality 

 

prior to fiscal 2008 this division operated under one systemwide rate structure however in 2008 we reached a settlement with cities representing approximately 80 percent of this division’s customers settled cities that has allowed us beginning in 2008 to update rates for customers in these cities through an annual rate review mechanism rates for the remaining 20 percent of this division’s customers primarily the city of dallas continue to be updated through periodic formal rate proceedings and filings made under texas’ gas reliability infrastructure program grip grip allows us to include in our rate base annually approved capital costs incurred in the prior calendar year provided that we file a complete rate case at least once every five years 

 

atmos energy kentuckymidstates division our kentuckymidstates division operates in more than 420 communities across georgia illinois iowa kentucky missouri tennessee and virginia the service areas in these states are primarily rural however this division serves franklin tennessee and other suburban areas of nashville we update our rates in this division through periodic formal rate filings made with each state’s public service commission 

 

atmos energy louisiana division in louisiana we serve nearly 300 communities including the suburban areas of new orleans the metropolitan area of monroe and western louisiana direct sales of natural gas to industrial customers in louisiana who use gas for fuel or in manufacturing processes and sales of natural gas for vehicle fuel are exempt from regulation and are recognized in our natural gas marketing segment our rates in this division are updated annually through a rate stabilization clause filing without filing a formal rate case 

 

atmos energy west texas division our west texas division serves approximately 80 communities in west texas including the amarillo lubbock and midland areas like our midtex division each municipality we serve has original jurisdiction over all gas distribution rates operations and services within its city limits with the rrc having exclusive appellate jurisdiction over the municipalities and exclusive original jurisdiction over rates and services provided to customers not located within the limits of a municipality prior to fiscal 2008 rates were updated in this division through formal rate proceedings however the west texas division entered into agreements with its west texas service areas during 2008 and its amarillo and lubbock service areas during 2009 to update rates for customers in these service areas through an annual rate review mechanism 

 

atmos energy coloradokansas division our coloradokansas division serves approximately 170 communities throughout colorado and kansas and parts of missouri including the cities of olathe kansas a suburb of kansas city and greeley colorado located near denver we update our rates in this division through periodic formal rate filings made with each state’s public service commission 

atmos energy mississippi division in mississippi we serve about 110 communities throughout the northern half of the state including the jackson metropolitan area our rates in the mississippi division are updated annually through a stable rate filing without filing a formal rate case

regulated transmission and storage segment overview 

 

our regulated transmission and storage segment consists of the regulated pipeline and storage operations of our atmos pipeline — texas division this division transports natural gas to our midtex division transports natural gas for third parties and manages five underground storage reservoirs in texas we also 

provide ancillary services customary in the pipeline industry including parking arrangements lending and sales of excess gas parking arrangements provide shortterm interruptible storage of gas on our pipeline lending services provide shortterm interruptible loans of natural gas from our pipeline to meet market demands gross profit earned from our midtex division and through certain other transportation and storage services is subject to traditional ratemaking governed by the rrc rates are updated through periodic formal rate proceedings and filings made under texas’ gas reliability infrastructure program grip grip allows us to include in our rate base annually approved capital costs incurred in the prior calendar year provided that we file a complete rate case at least once every five years atmos pipeline — texas’ existing regulatory mechanisms allow certain transportation and storage services to be provided under marketbased rates with minimal regulation 

 

these operations include one of the largest intrastate pipeline operations in texas with a heavy concentration in the established natural gasproducing areas of central northern and eastern texas extending into or near the major producing areas of the texas gulf coast and the delaware and val verde basins of west texas nine basins located in texas are believed to contain a substantial portion of the nation’s remaining onshore natural gas reserves this pipeline system provides access to all of these basins

natural gas marketing segment overview 

 

our natural gas marketing activities are conducted through atmos energy marketing aem which is whollyowned by atmos energy holdings inc aeh aeh is a whollyowned subsidiary of aec and operates primarily in the midwest and southeast areas of the united states 

 

aem’s primary business is to aggregate and purchase gas supply arrange transportation and storage logistics and ultimately deliver gas to customers at competitive prices in addition aem utilizes proprietary and customerowned transportation and storage assets to provide various services our customers request including furnishing natural gas supplies at fixed and marketbased prices contract negotiation and administration load forecasting gas storage acquisition and management services transportation services peaking sales and balancing services capacity utilization strategies and gas price hedging through the use of financial instruments aem serves most of its customers under contracts generally having one to two year terms and sells natural gas to some of its industrial customers on a delivered burner tip basis under contract terms ranging from 30 days to two years as a result aem’s margins arise from the types of commercial transactions we have structured with our customers and our ability to identify the lowest cost alternative among the natural gas supplies transportation and markets to which it has access to serve those customers 

 

aem also seeks to maximize through asset optimization activities the economic value associated with the storage and transportation capacity we own or control in our natural gas distribution and natural gas marketing segments we attempt to meet this objective by engaging in natural gas storage transactions in 

which we seek to find and profit through the arbitrage of pricing differences in various locations and by recognizing pricing differences that occur over time this process involves purchasing physical natural gas storing it in the storage and transportation assets to which aem has access and selling financial instruments at advantageous prices to lock in a gross profit margin

pipeline storage and other segment overview 

 

our pipeline storage and other segment primarily consists of the operations of atmos pipeline and storage llc aps which is whollyowned by aeh aps is engaged in nonregulated transmission storage and natural gas gathering services its primary asset is a proprietary 21 mile pipeline located in new orleans louisiana it also owns or controls additional pipeline and storage capacity including interests in underground storage fields in kentucky and louisiana that are used to reduce the need of our natural gas distribution divisions to contract for pipeline capacity to meet customer demand during peak periods 

 

aps’ primary business is to provide storage and transportation services to our louisiana and kentuckymidstates regulated natural gas distribution divisions to our natural gas marketing segment and on a more limited basis to third parties aps earns transportation fees and storage demand charges to aggregate and provide gas supply provide access to storage capacity and transport gas for these customers 

 

aps also engages in various asset optimization activities aps’ primary asset optimization activity involves the administration of two asset management plans with regulated affiliates of the company these arrangements provide aps the opportunity to maximize the economic value associated with the transportation and storage capacity assigned to these plans aps attempts to meet this objective through a variety of activities including engaging in natural gas storage transactions and utilizing excess asset capacity to find and profit through the arbitrage of pricing differences in various locations and by recognizing pricing differences that occur over time these plans require aps to share a portion of the economic value created by these activities with the regulated customers served by these affiliates these arrangements have been approved by applicable state regulatory commissions and are subject to annual regulatory review intended to ensure proper allocation of economic value between our regulated customers and aps 

 

aps also seeks to maximize the economic value associated with the storage and transportation capacity it owns or controls we attempt to meet this objective by engaging in natural gas storage transactions in which we seek to find and profit through the arbitrage of pricing differences in various locations and by recognizing pricing differences that occur over time this process involves purchasing physical natural gas storing it in the storage and transportation assets to which aps has access and in transactions involving storage capacity selling financial instruments at advantageous prices to lock in a gross profit margin

ratemaking activity 

 

overview 

 

the method of determining regulated rates varies among the states in which our natural gas distribution divisions operate the regulatory authorities have the responsibility of ensuring that utilities in their jurisdictions operate in the best interests of customers while providing utility companies the opportunity to earn a reasonable return on their investment generally each regulatory authority reviews rate requests and establishes a rate structure intended to generate revenue sufficient to cover the costs of conducting business and to provide a reasonable return on invested capital 

 

our current rate strategy is to focus on reducing or eliminating regulatory lag obtaining adequate returns and providing stable predictable margins atmos energy has annual ratemaking mechanisms in place in three states that provide for an annual rate review and adjustment to rates for approximately twothirds of our gross margin we also have accelerated recovery of only capital for approximately 20 percent of our gross margin combined we have rate structures with accelerated recovery of all or a portion of our expenditures for over 80 percent of our gross margin additionally we have wna mechanisms in eight states that serve to minimize the effects of weather on approximately 94 percent of our gross margin finally we have the ability to recover the gas cost portion of bad debts for approximately 70 percent of our gross margin these mechanisms work in tandem to provide insulation from volatile margins both for the company and our customers 

 

we will also continue to address various rate design changes including the recovery of bad debt gas costs and inclusion of other taxes in gas costs in future rate filings these design changes would address cost variations that are related to passthrough energy costs beyond our control 

 

although substantial progress has been made in recent years by improving rate design across atmos’ operating areas potential changes in federal energy policy and adverse economic conditions will necessitate continued vigilance by the company and our regulators in meeting the challenges presented by these external factors 

recent ratemaking activity 

 

substantially all of our natural gas distribution revenues in the fiscal years ended september 30 2010 2009 and 2008 were derived from sales at rates set by or subject to approval by local or state authorities net operating income increases resulting from ratemaking activity totaling 568 million 544 million and 406 million became effective in fiscal 2010 2009 and 2008 as summarized below 

 

 

 

additionally the following ratemaking efforts were initiated during fiscal 2010 but had not been completed as of september 30 2010 

 

 

 

 

  

our recent ratemaking activity is discussed in greater detail below 

rate case filings 

 

a rate case is a formal request from atmos energy to a regulatory authority to increase rates that are charged to customers rate cases may also be initiated when the regulatory authorities request us to justify our rates this process is referred to as a “show cause” action adequate rates are intended to provide for recovery of the company’s costs as well as a fair rate of return to our shareholders and ensure that we continue to deliver reliable reasonably priced natural gas service to our customers the following table summarizes our recent rate cases 

 

 

 

 

 17 

 

grip filings 

 

as discussed above in “natural gas distribution segment overview” grip allows natural gas utility companies the opportunity to include in their rate base annually approved capital costs incurred in the prior calendar year the following table summarizes our grip filings with effective dates during the fiscal years ended september 30 2010 2009 and 2008 

 

 

 

 

  

annual rate filing mechanisms 

 

as an instrument to reduce regulatory lag annual rate filing mechanisms allow us to refresh our rates on a periodic basis without filing a formal rate case however these filings still involve discovery by the appropriate regulatory authorities prior to the final determination of rates under these mechanisms as discussed above in “natural gas distribution segment overview” we currently have annual rate filing mechanisms in our louisiana and mississippi divisions and in significant portions of our midtex and west texas divisions these mechanisms are referred to as rate review mechanisms in our midtex and west texas 

divisions stable rate filings in the mississippi division and rate stabilization clause in the louisiana division the following table summarizes filings made under our various annual rate filing mechanisms 

 

 

 

in august 2010 we reached an agreement to extend the rate review mechanism in our midtex division for an additional twoyear period beginning october 1 2010 however the midtex division will be required to file a general systemwide rate case on or before june 1 2013 this extension provides for an annual rate adjustment to reflect changes in the midtex division’s costs of service and additions to capital investment from year to year without the necessity of filing a general rate case 

 

the settlement also allows us to expand our existing program to replace steel service lines in the midtex division’s natural gas delivery system on october 13 2010 the city of dallas approved the recovery of the return depreciation and taxes associated with the replacement of 100000 steel service lines across the midtex division by september 30 2012 the rrm in the midtex division was entered into as a result of a settlement in the september 20 2007 statement of intent case filed with all midtex division cities of the 440 incorporated cities served by the midtex division 439 of these cities are part of the rate review mechanism process 

 

the west texas rate review mechanism was entered into in august 2008 as a result of a settlement with the west texas coalition of cities the lubbock and amarillo rate review mechanisms were entered into in the spring of 2009 the west texas coalition of cities agreed to extend its rrm for one additional cycle as part of the settlement of this year’s filing 

other ratemaking activity 

 

the following table summarizes other ratemaking activity during the fiscal years ended september 30 2010 2009 and 2008 

 

 

 

 

  

other regulation 

 

each of our natural gas distribution divisions is regulated by various state or local public utility authorities we are also subject to regulation by the united states department of transportation with respect to safety requirements in the operation and maintenance of our gas distribution facilities in addition our distribution operations are also subject to various state and federal laws regulating environmental matters from time to time we receive inquiries regarding various environmental matters we believe that our properties and operations substantially comply with and are operated in substantial conformity with applicable safety and environmental statutes and regulations there are no administrative or judicial proceedings arising under environmental quality statutes pending or known to be contemplated by governmental agencies which would 

have a material adverse effect on us or our operations our environmental claims have arisen primarily from former manufactured gas plant sites in tennessee iowa and missouri 

 

the federal energy regulatory commission ferc allows pursuant to section 311 of the natural gas policy act gas transportation services through our atmos pipeline — texas assets “on behalf of” interstate pipelines or local distribution companies served by interstate pipelines without subjecting these assets to the jurisdiction of the ferc additionally the ferc has regulatory authority over the sale of natural gas in the wholesale gas market and the use and release of interstate pipeline and storage capacity as well as authority to detect and prevent market manipulation and to enforce compliance with ferc’s other rules policies and orders by companies engaged in the sale purchase transportation or storage of natural gas in interstate commerce we have taken what we believe are the necessary and appropriate steps to comply with these regulations 

 

we have been replacing certain steel service lines in our midtex division since our acquisition of the natural gas distribution system in 2004 we currently have an existing rrm that should allow us to recover the replacement costs through the end of fiscal 2012 on september 10 2010 the texas railroad commission rrc published for comment a proposed regulation dealing with distribution facility replacement the proposed regulation would require each gas distribution system operator to develop a riskbased program for the removal or replacement of distribution facilities including steel service lines a number of texas operators industry groups and facility component manufacturers filed comments the rrc is presently reviewing the comments with action related to this proposal anticipated later this year or early next year we are committed to replacing the steel service lines on an accelerated schedule to ensure the safety and reliability of our distribution system and as part of this commitment we support the objectives of proposed rulemaking by the rrc for steel serviceline replacements statewide due to the preliminary status of the rulemaking process we cannot accurately anticipate the impact the proposed regulation would have on the company if adopted or the expected cost of the replacement program 

 

competition 

 

although our natural gas distribution operations are not currently in significant direct competition with any other distributors of natural gas to residential and commercial customers within our service areas we do compete with other natural gas suppliers and suppliers of alternative fuels for sales to industrial customers we compete in all aspects of our business with alternative energy sources including in particular electricity electric utilities offer electricity as a rival energy source and compete for the space heating water heating and cooking markets promotional incentives improved equipment efficiencies and promotional rates all contribute to the acceptability of electrical equipment the principal means to compete against alternative fuels is lower prices and natural gas historically has maintained its price advantage in the residential commercial and industrial markets however higher gas prices coupled with the electric utilities’ marketing efforts have increased competition for residential and commercial customers 

 

our regulated transmission and storage operations historically have faced limited competition from other existing intrastate pipelines and gas marketers seeking to provide or arrange transportation storage and other services for customers however in the last two years several new pipelines have been completed which has increased the level of competition in this segment of our business 

 

within our nonregulated operations aem competes with other natural gas marketers to provide natural gas management and other related services primarily to smaller customers requiring higher levels of balancing scheduling and other related management services aem has experienced increased competition in recent years primarily from investment banks and major integrated oil and natural gas companies who offer lower cost basic services the increased competition has reduced margins most notably on its highvolume accounts 

 

employees 

 

at september 30 2010 we had 4913 employees consisting of 4776 employees in our regulated operations and 137 employees in our nonregulated operations

 item 1a   risk factors tableend  

our financial and operating results are subject to a number of risk factors many of which are not within our control although we have tried to discuss key risk factors below please be aware that other or new risks may prove to be important in the future investors should carefully consider the following discussion of risk factors as well as other information appearing in this report these factors include the following 

 

further disruptions in the credit markets could limit our ability to access capital and increase our costs of capital 

 

we rely upon access to both shortterm and longterm credit markets to satisfy our liquidity requirements the global credit markets have experienced significant disruptions and volatility during the last few years to a greater degree than has been seen in decades in some cases the ability or willingness of traditional sources of capital to provide financing has been reduced 

 

historically we have accessed the commercial paper markets to finance our shortterm working capital needs the disruptions in the credit markets during the fall of 2008 temporarily limited our access to the commercial paper markets and increased our borrowing costs consequently for a short period we were forced to borrow directly under our primary credit facility that backstops our commercial paper program to provide much of our working capital this credit facility provides up to 567 million in committed financing through its expiration in december 2011 our borrowings under this facility along with our commercial paper have been used primarily to purchase natural gas supplies for the upcoming winter heating season the amount of our working capital requirements in the nearterm will depend primarily on the market price of natural gas higher natural gas prices may adversely impact our accounts receivable collections and may require us to increase borrowings under our credit facilities to fund our operations we have historically supplemented our commercial paper program with a shortterm committed credit facility no borrowings are currently 

outstanding under our current 200 million shortterm facility which was scheduled to mature in october 2010 in october 2010 this facility was replaced with a 200 million 180day facility which expires in april 2011 on substantially the same terms 

 

our longterm debt is currently rated as “investment grade” by standard  poor’s corporation moody’s investors services inc and fitch ratings ltd if adverse credit conditions were to cause a significant limitation on our access to the private and public credit markets we could see a reduction in our liquidity a significant reduction in our liquidity could in turn trigger a negative change in our ratings outlook or even a reduction in our credit ratings by one or more of the three credit rating agencies such a downgrade could further limit our access to public andor private credit markets and increase the costs of borrowing under each source of credit 

 

further if our credit ratings were downgraded we could be required to provide additional liquidity to our natural gas marketing segment because the commodity financial instruments markets could become unavailable to us our natural gas marketing segment depends primarily upon a committed credit facility to finance its working capital needs which it uses primarily to issue standby letters of credit to its natural gas suppliers a significant reduction in the availability of this facility could require us to provide extra liquidity to support its operations or reduce some of the activities of our natural gas marketing segment our ability to provide extra liquidity is limited by the terms of our existing lending arrangements with aeh which are subject to annual approval by one state regulatory commission 

 

while we believe we can meet our capital requirements from our operations and the sources of financing available to us we can provide no assurance that we will continue to be able to do so in the future especially if the market price of natural gas increases significantly in the nearterm the future effects on our business liquidity and financial results of a further deterioration of current conditions in the credit markets could be material and adverse to us both in the ways described above or in other ways that we do not currently anticipate 

 

the continuation of recent economic conditions could adversely affect our customers and negatively impact our financial results 

 

the slowdown in the us economy together with increased mortgage defaults and significant decreases in the values of homes and investment assets has adversely affected the financial resources of many domestic households it is unclear whether the administrative and legislative responses to these conditions will be successful in improving current economic conditions including the lowering of current high unemployment rates across the us as a result our customers may seek to use even less gas and it may become more difficult for them to pay their gas bills this may slow collections and lead to higher than normal levels of accounts receivable this in turn could increase our financing requirements and bad debt expense additionally our industrial customers may seek alternative energy sources which could result in lower sales volumes 

 

the costs of providing pension and postretirement health care benefits and related funding requirements are subject to changes in pension fund values changing demographics and fluctuating actuarial assumptions and may have a material adverse effect on our financial results in addition the passage of the health care reform act in 2010 could significantly increase the cost of the health care benefits for our employees 

 

we provide a cashbalance pension plan and postretirement healthcare benefits to eligible fulltime employees our costs of providing such benefits and related funding requirements are subject to changes in the market value of the assets funding our pension and postretirement healthcare plans the fluctuations over the last few years in the values of investments that fund our pension and postretirement healthcare plans may significantly differ from or alter the values and actuarial assumptions we use to calculate our future pension plan expense and postretirement healthcare costs and funding requirements under the pension protection act any significant declines in the value of these investments could increase the expenses of our pension and postretirement healthcare plans and related funding requirements in the future our costs of providing such benefits and related funding requirements are also subject to changing demographics including longer life 

expectancy of beneficiaries and an expected increase in the number of eligible former employees over the next five to ten years as well as various actuarial calculations and assumptions which may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions higher or lower withdrawal rates and interest rates and other factors 

 

in addition the costs of providing health care benefits to our employees could significantly increase over the next five to ten years although the full effects of the legislation should not impact the company until 2014 the future cost of compliance with the provisions of the health care reform act is difficult to measure at this time 

 

our operations are exposed to market risks that are beyond our control which could adversely affect our financial results and capital requirements 

 

our risk management operations are subject to market risks beyond our control including market liquidity commodity price volatility caused by market supply and demand dynamics and counterparty creditworthiness although we maintain a risk management policy we may not be able to completely offset the price risk associated with volatile gas prices particularly in our nonregulated business segments which could lead to volatility in our earnings 

 

physical trading in our nonregulated business segments also introduces price risk on any net open positions at the end of each trading day as well as volatility resulting from intraday fluctuations of gas prices and the potential for daily price movements between the time natural gas is purchased or sold for future delivery and the time the related purchase or sale is hedged the determination of our net open position as of the end of any particular trading day requires us to make assumptions as to future circumstances including the use of gas by our customers in relation to our anticipated storage and market positions because the price risk associated with any net open position at the end of such day may increase if the assumptions are not realized we review these assumptions as part of our daily monitoring activities although we manage our business to maintain no open positions there are times when limited net open positions related to our physical storage may occur on a shortterm basis net open positions may increase volatility in our financial condition or results of operations if market prices move in a significantly favorable or unfavorable manner before the open positions can be closed 

 

further the timing of the recognition for financial accounting purposes of gains or losses resulting from changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments designated as hedges usually does not match the timing of the economic profits or losses on the item being hedged this volatility may occur with a resulting increase or decrease in earnings or losses even though the expected profit margin is essentially unchanged from the date the transactions were consummated also if the local physical markets in which we trade do not move consistently with the nymex futures market upon which most of our commodity derivative financial instruments are valued we could experience increased volatility in the financial results of our natural gas marketing and pipeline storage and other segments 

 

our natural gas marketing and pipeline storage and other segments manage margins and limit risk exposure on the sale of natural gas inventory or the offsetting fixedprice purchase or sale commitments for physical quantities of natural gas through the use of a variety of financial instruments however contractual limitations could adversely affect our ability to withdraw gas from storage which could cause us to purchase gas at spot prices in a rising market to obtain sufficient volumes to fulfill customer contracts we could also realize financial losses on our efforts to limit risk as a result of volatility in the market prices of the underlying commodities or if a counterparty fails to perform under a contract any significant tightening of the credit markets could cause more of our counterparties to fail to perform than expected in addition adverse changes in the creditworthiness of our counterparties could limit the level of trading activities with these parties and increase the risk that these parties may not perform under a contract these circumstances could also increase our capital requirements 

 

we are also subject to interest rate risk on our borrowings in recent years we have been operating in a relatively low interestrate environment compared to historical norms for both short and longterm interest rates however increases in interest rates could adversely affect our future financial results 

we are subject to state and local regulations that affect our operations and financial results 

 

our natural gas distribution and regulated transmission and storage segments are subject to various regulated returns on our rate base in each jurisdiction in which we operate we monitor the allowed rates of return and our effectiveness in earning such rates and initiate rate proceedings or operating changes as we believe are needed in addition in the normal course of business in the regulatory environment assets may be placed in service and historical test periods established before rate cases can be filed that could result in an adjustment of our allowed returns once rate cases are filed regulatory bodies have the authority to suspend implementation of the new rates while studying the cases because of this process we must suffer the negative financial effects of having placed assets in service without the benefit of rate relief which is commonly referred to as “regulatory lag” rate cases also involve a risk of rate reduction because once rates have been approved they are still subject to challenge for their reasonableness by appropriate regulatory authorities in addition regulators may review our purchases of natural gas and can adjust the amount of our gas costs that we pass through to our customers finally our debt and equity financings are also subject to approval by regulatory commissions in several states which could limit our ability to access or take advantage of changes in the capital markets 

 

we may experience increased federal state and local regulation of the safety of our operations 

 

we are committed to constantly monitoring and maintaining our pipeline and distribution system to ensure that natural gas is delivered safely reliably and efficiently through our network of more than 77000 miles of pipeline and distribution lines the steel service line replacement program currently underway in our midtex division typifies the preventive maintenance and continual renewal that we perform on our natural gas distribution system in all 12 states in which we operate the safety and protection of the public our customers and our employees is our top priority however due primarily to the recent unfortunate pipeline incident in california we anticipate companies in the natural gas distribution business may be subjected to even greater federal state and local oversight of the safety of their operations in the future accordingly the costs of complying with such increased regulations may have at least a shortterm adverse impact on our operating costs and financial results 

 

some of our operations are subject to increased federal regulatory oversight that could affect our operations and financial results 

 

ferc has regulatory authority that affects some of our operations including sales of natural gas in the wholesale gas market and the use and release of interstate pipeline and storage capacity under legislation passed by congress in 2005 ferc has adopted rules designed to prevent market power abuse and market manipulation and to promote compliance with ferc’s other rules policies and orders by companies engaged in the sale purchase transportation or storage of natural gas in interstate commerce these rules carry increased penalties for violations we are currently under investigation by ferc for possible violations of its posting and competitive bidding regulations for prearranged released firm capacity on interstate natural gas pipelines should ferc conclude that we have committed such violations of its regulations and levies substantial fines andor penalties against us our business financial condition or financial results could be adversely affected in addition although we have taken steps to structure current and future transactions to comply with applicable current ferc regulations changes in ferc regulations or their interpretation by ferc or additional regulations issued by ferc in the future could also adversely affect our business financial condition or financial results 

 

we are subject to environmental regulations which could adversely affect our operations or financial results 

 

we are subject to laws regulations and other legal requirements enacted or adopted by federal state and local governmental authorities relating to protection of the environment and health and safety matters including those legal requirements that govern discharges of substances into the air and water the management and disposal of hazardous substances and waste the cleanup of contaminated sites groundwater quality and availability plant and wildlife protection as well as work practices related to employee health and safety 

environmental legislation also requires that our facilities sites and other properties associated with our operations be operated maintained abandoned and reclaimed to the satisfaction of applicable regulatory authorities failure to comply with these laws regulations permits and licenses may expose us to fines penalties or interruptions in our operations that could be significant to our financial results in addition existing environmental regulations may be revised or our operations may become subject to new regulations 

 

our business may be subject in the future to additional regulatory and financial risks associated with global warming and climate change 

 

there have been a number of new federal and state legislative and regulatory initiatives proposed in an attempt to control or limit the effects of global warming and overall climate change including greenhouse gas emissions such as carbon dioxide for example in june 2009 the us house of representatives approved the american clean energy and security act of 2009  also known as the waxmanmarkey bill or “cap and trade” bill however neither this bill nor a related bill in the us senate the clean energy and emissions power act was passed by congress the adoption of this type of legislation by congress or similar legislation by states or the adoption of related regulations by federal or state governments mandating a substantial reduction in greenhouse gas emissions in the future could have farreaching and significant impacts on the energy industry such new legislation or regulations could result in increased compliance costs for us or additional operating restrictions on our business affect the demand for natural gas or impact the prices we charge to our customers at this time we cannot predict the potential impact of such laws or regulations that may be adopted on our future business financial condition or financial results 

 

the concentration of our distribution pipeline and storage operations in the state of texas exposes our operations and financial results to economic conditions and regulatory decisions in texas 

 

over 50 percent of our natural gas distribution customers and most of our pipeline and storage assets and operations are located in the state of texas this concentration of our business in texas means that our operations and financial results may be significantly affected by changes in the texas economy in general and regulatory decisions by state and local regulatory authorities in texas 

 

adverse weather conditions could affect our operations or financial results 

 

since the 20062007 winter heating season we have had weathernormalized rates for over 90 percent of our residential and commercial meters which has substantially mitigated the adverse effects of warmerthannormal weather for meters in those service areas however there is no assurance that we will continue to receive such regulatory protection from adverse weather in our rates in the future the loss of such weather — normalized rates could have an adverse effect on our operations and financial results in addition our natural gas distribution and regulated transmission and storage operating results may continue to vary somewhat with the actual temperatures during the winter heating season sustained cold weather could adversely affect our natural gas marketing operations as we may be required to purchase gas at spot rates in a rising market to obtain sufficient volumes to fulfill some customer contracts 

 

inflation and increased gas costs could adversely impact our customer base and customer collections and increase our level of indebtedness 

 

inflation has caused increases in some of our operating expenses and has required assets to be replaced at higher costs we have a process in place to continually review the adequacy of our natural gas distribution gas rates in relation to the increasing cost of providing service and the inherent regulatory lag in adjusting those gas rates historically we have been able to budget and control operating expenses and investments within the amounts authorized to be collected in rates and intend to continue to do so however the ability to control expenses is an important factor that could impact future financial results 

 

rapid increases in the costs of purchased gas would cause us to experience a significant increase in shortterm debt we must pay suppliers for gas when it is purchased which can be significantly in advance of when these costs may be recovered through the collection of monthly customer bills for gas delivered increases in 

purchased gas costs also slow our natural gas distribution collection efforts as customers are more likely to delay the payment of their gas bills leading to higher than normal accounts receivable this could result in higher shortterm debt levels greater collection efforts and increased bad debt expense 

 

our growth in the future may be limited by the nature of our business which requires extensive capital spending 

 

we must continually build additional capacity in our natural gas distribution system to enable us to serve any growth in the number of our customers the cost of adding this capacity may be affected by a number of factors including the general state of the economy and weather in addition although we should ultimately recover the cost of the expenditures through rates we must make significant capital expenditures during the next two fiscal years in executing our steel service line replacement program in the midtex division our cash flows from operations generally are sufficient to supply funding for all our capital expenditures including the financing of the costs of new construction along with capital expenditures necessary to maintain our existing natural gas system due to the timing of these cash flows and capital expenditures we often must fund at least a portion of these costs through borrowing funds from third party lenders the cost and availability of which is dependent on the liquidity of the credit markets interest rates and other market conditions this in turn may limit our ability to connect new customers to our system due to constraints on the amount of funds we can invest in our infrastructure 

 

our operations are subject to increased competition 

 

in residential and commercial customer markets our natural gas distribution operations compete with other energy products such as electricity and propane our primary product competition is with electricity for heating water heating and cooking increases in the price of natural gas could negatively impact our competitive position by decreasing the price benefits of natural gas to the consumer this could adversely impact our business if as a result our customer growth slows reducing our ability to make capital expenditures or if our customers further conserve their use of gas resulting in reduced gas purchases and customer billings 

 

in the case of industrial customers such as manufacturing plants adverse economic conditions including higher gas costs could cause these customers to use alternative sources of energy such as electricity or bypass our systems in favor of special competitive contracts with lower perunit costs our regulated transmission and storage operations historically have faced limited competition from other existing intrastate pipelines and gas marketers seeking to provide or arrange transportation storage and other services for customers however in the last two years several new pipelines have been completed which has increased the level of competition in this segment of our business within our nonregulated operations aem competes with other natural gas marketers to provide natural gas management and other related services primarily to smaller customers requiring higher levels of balancing scheduling and other related management services aem has experienced increased competition in recent years primarily from investment banks and major integrated oil and natural gas companies who offer lower cost basic services 

 

distributing and storing natural gas involve risks that may result in accidents and additional operating costs 

 

our natural gas distribution business involves a number of hazards and operating risks that cannot be completely avoided such as leaks accidents and operational problems which could cause loss of human life as well as substantial financial losses resulting from property damage damage to the environment and to our operations we do have liability and property insurance coverage in place for many of these hazards and risks however because our pipeline storage and distribution facilities are near or are in populated areas any loss of human life or adverse financial results resulting from such events could be large if these events were not fully covered by insurance our operations or financial results could be adversely affected 

natural disasters terrorist activities or other significant events could adversely affect our operations or financial results 

 

natural disasters are always a threat to our assets and operations in addition the threat of terrorist activities could lead to increased economic instability and volatility in the price of natural gas that could affect our operations also companies in our industry may face a heightened risk of exposure to actual acts of terrorism which could subject our operations to increased risks as a result the availability of insurance covering such risks may be more limited which could increase the risk that an event could adversely affect our operations or financial results

critical accounting policies and estimates 

 

our consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and the related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities we based our estimates on historical experience and various 

other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including those related to risk management and trading activities fair value measurements allowance for doubtful accounts legal and environmental accruals insurance accruals pension and postretirement obligations deferred income taxes and valuation of goodwill indefinitelived intangible assets and other longlived assets our critical accounting policies are reviewed by the audit committee quarterly actual results may differ from estimates 

 

regulation — our natural gas distribution and regulated transmission and storage operations are subject to regulation with respect to rates service maintenance of accounting records and various other matters by the respective regulatory authorities in the states in which we operate we meet the criteria established within accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of a costbased rateregulated entity which requires us to reflect the financial effects of the ratemaking and accounting practices and policies of the various regulatory commissions in our financial statements in accordance with applicable authoritative accounting standards we apply the provisions of this standard to our regulated operations and record regulatory assets for costs that have been deferred for which future recovery through customer rates is considered probable and regulatory liabilities when it is probable that revenues will be reduced for amounts that will be credited to customers through the ratemaking process as a result certain costs that would normally be expensed under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states are permitted to be capitalized or deferred on the balance sheet because it is probable they can be recovered through rates discontinuing the application of this method of accounting for regulatory assets and liabilities could significantly increase our operating expenses as fewer costs would likely be capitalized or deferred on the balance sheet which could reduce our net income further regulation may impact the period in which revenues or expenses are recognized the amounts to be recovered or recognized are based upon historical experience and our understanding of the regulations the impact of regulation on our regulated operations may be affected by decisions of the regulatory authorities or the issuance of new regulations 

 

revenue recognition — sales of natural gas to our natural gas distribution customers are billed on a monthly basis however the billing cycle periods for certain classes of customers do not necessarily coincide with accounting periods used for financial reporting purposes we follow the revenue accrual method of accounting for natural gas distribution segment revenues whereby revenues applicable to gas delivered to customers but not yet billed under the cycle billing method are estimated and accrued and the related costs are charged to expense 

 

on occasion we are permitted to implement new rates that have not been formally approved by our regulatory authorities which are subject to refund we recognize this revenue and establish a reserve for amounts that could be refunded based on our experience for the jurisdiction in which the rates were implemented 

 

rates established by regulatory authorities are adjusted for increases and decreases in our purchased gas costs through purchased gas cost adjustment mechanisms purchased gas cost adjustment mechanisms provide gas utility companies a method of recovering purchased gas costs on an ongoing basis without filing a rate case to address all of the utility company’s nongas costs these mechanisms are commonly utilized when regulatory authorities recognize a particular type of cost such as purchased gas costs that i is subject to significant price fluctuations compared to the utility company’s other costs ii represents a large component of the utility company’s cost of service and iii is generally outside the control of the gas utility company there is no gross profit generated through purchased gas cost adjustments but they provide a dollarfordollar offset to increases or decreases in utility gas costs although substantially all natural gas distribution sales to our customers fluctuate with the cost of gas that we purchase our gross profit is generally not affected by fluctuations in the cost of gas as a result of the purchased gas cost adjustment mechanism the effects of these purchased gas cost adjustment mechanisms are recorded as deferred gas costs on our balance sheet 

 

operating revenues for our regulated transmission and storage and pipeline storage and other segments are recognized in the period in which actual volumes are transported and storage services are provided 

 

operating revenues for our natural gas marketing segment and the associated carrying value of natural gas inventory inclusive of storage costs are recognized when we sell the gas and physically deliver it to our 

customers operating revenues include realized gains and losses arising from the settlement of financial instruments used in our natural gas marketing activities and unrealized gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value of natural gas inventory designated as a hedged item in a fair value hedge and the associated financial instruments 

 

allowance for doubtful accounts — accounts receivable arise from natural gas sales to residential commercial industrial municipal and other customers for the majority of our receivables we establish an allowance for doubtful accounts based on our collections experience on certain other receivables where we are aware of a specific customer’s inability or reluctance to pay we record an allowance for doubtful accounts against amounts due to reduce the net receivable balance to the amount we reasonably expect to collect however if circumstances change our estimate of the recoverability of accounts receivable could be affected circumstances which could affect our estimates include but are not limited to customer credit issues the level of natural gas prices customer deposits and general economic conditions accounts are written off once they are deemed to be uncollectible 

 

financial instruments and hedging activities — we currently use financial instruments to mitigate commodity price risk additionally we periodically use financial instruments to manage interest rate risk the objectives and strategies for using financial instruments have been tailored to meet the needs of our regulated and nonregulated businesses 

 

we record all of our financial instruments on the balance sheet at fair value as required by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  with changes in fair value ultimately recorded in the income statement the timing of when changes in fair value of our financial instruments are recorded in the income statement depends on whether the financial instrument has been designated and qualifies as a part of a hedging relationship or if regulatory rulings require a different accounting treatment changes in fair value for financial instruments that do not meet one of these criteria are recognized in the income statement as they occur 

 

financial instruments associated with commodity price risk 

 

in our natural gas distribution segment our customers are exposed to the effect of volatile natural gas prices we manage this exposure through a combination of physical storage fixedprice forward contracts and financial instruments primarily overthecounter swap and option contracts in an effort to minimize the impact of natural gas price volatility on our customers during the winter heating season the costs associated with and the gains and losses arising from the use of financial instruments to mitigate commodity price risk in this segment are included in our purchased gas cost adjustment mechanisms in accordance with regulatory requirements therefore changes in the fair value of these financial instruments are initially recorded as a component of deferred gas costs and recognized in the consolidated statement of income as a component of purchased gas cost when the related costs are recovered through our rates and recognized in revenue in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states accordingly there is no earnings impact to our natural gas distribution segment as a result of the use of financial instruments 

 

our natural gas marketing segment aggregates and purchases gas supply arranges transportation andor storage logistics and ultimately delivers gas to our customers at competitive prices we also perform asset optimization activities in both our natural gas marketing segment and pipeline storage and other segment as a result of these activities our nonregulated operations are exposed to risks associated with changes in the market price of natural gas we manage our exposure to the risk of natural gas price changes through a combination of physical storage and financial instruments including futures overthecounter and exchangetraded options and swap contracts with counterparties 

 

in our natural gas marketing and pipeline storage and other segments we have designated the natural gas inventory held by these operating segments as the hedged item in a fairvalue hedge this inventory is marked to market at the end of each month based on the gas daily index with changes in fair value recognized as unrealized gains or losses in revenue in the period of change the financial instruments associated with this natural gas inventory have been designated as fairvalue hedges and are marked to market each month based upon the nymex price with changes in fair value recognized as unrealized gains or losses in revenue in the period of change changes in the spreads between the forward natural gas prices used to value the financial 

instruments designated against our physical inventory nymex and the market spot prices used to value our physical storage gas daily result in unrealized margins until the underlying physical gas is withdrawn and the related financial instruments are settled the difference in the spot price used to value our physical inventory and the forward price used to value the related financial instruments can result in volatility in our reported income as a component of unrealized margins we have elected to exclude this spotforward differential for purposes of assessing the effectiveness of these fairvalue hedges once the gas is withdrawn and the financial instruments are settled the previously unrealized margins associated with these net positions are realized over time we expect gains and losses on the sale of storage gas inventory to be offset by gains and losses on the fairvalue hedges resulting in the realization of the economic gross profit margin we anticipated at the time we structured the original transaction 

 

we have elected to treat fixedprice forward contracts used in our natural gas marketing segment to deliver gas as normal purchases and normal sales as such these deliveries are recorded on an accrual basis in accordance with our revenue recognition policy financial instruments used to mitigate the commodity price risk associated with these contracts have been designated as cash flow hedges of anticipated purchases and sales at indexed prices accordingly unrealized gains and losses on open financial instruments are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income and are recognized in earnings as a component of revenue when the hedged volumes are sold hedge ineffectiveness to the extent incurred is reported as a component of revenue 

 

we also use storage swaps and futures to capture additional storage arbitrage opportunities in our natural gas marketing segment that arise after the execution of the original fair value hedge associated with our physical natural gas inventory basis swaps to insulate and protect the economic value of our fixed price and storage books and various overthecounter and exchangetraded options these financial instruments have not been designated as hedges 

 

financial instruments associated with interest rate risk 

 

we periodically manage interest rate risk typically when we issue new or refinance existing longterm debt with treasury lock agreements to fix the treasury yield component of the interest cost associated with anticipated financings we designate these treasury lock agreements as a cash flow hedge of an anticipated transaction at the time the agreements are executed accordingly unrealized gains and losses associated with the treasury lock agreements were recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss the realized gain or loss recognized upon settlement of each treasury lock agreement was initially recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss and is recognized as a component of interest expense over the life of the related financing arrangement 

 

impairment assessments — we perform impairment assessments of our goodwill intangible assets subject to amortization and longlived assets as of september 30 2010 we had no indefinitelived intangible assets 

 

we annually evaluate our goodwill balances for impairment during our second fiscal quarter or as impairment indicators arise we use a present value technique based on discounted cash flows to estimate the fair value of our reporting units we have determined our reporting units to be each of our natural gas distribution divisions and whollyowned subsidiaries and goodwill is allocated to the reporting units responsible for the acquisition that gave rise to the goodwill the discounted cash flow calculations used to assess goodwill impairment are dependent on several subjective factors including the timing of future cash flows future growth rates and the discount rate an impairment charge is recognized if the carrying value of a reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds its fair value 

 

we annually assess whether the cost of our intangible assets subject to amortization or other longlived assets is recoverable or that the remaining useful lives may warrant revision we perform this assessment more frequently when specific events or circumstances have occurred that suggest the recoverability of the cost of the intangible and other longlived assets is at risk 

 

when such events or circumstances are present we assess the recoverability of these assets by determining whether the carrying value will be recovered through expected future cash flows from the 

operating division or subsidiary to which these assets relate these cash flow projections consider various factors such as the timing of the future cash flows and the discount rate and are based upon the best information available at the time the estimate is made changes in these factors could materially affect the cash flow projections and result in the recognition of an impairment charge an impairment charge is recognized as the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value if the sum of the undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying value of the related asset 

 

pension and other postretirement plans  — pension and other postretirement plan costs and liabilities are determined on an actuarial basis and are affected by numerous assumptions and estimates including the market value of plan assets estimates of the expected return on plan assets assumed discount rates and current demographic and actuarial mortality data prior to fiscal 2009 we reviewed the estimates and assumptions underlying our pension and other postretirement plan costs and liabilities annually based upon a june 30 measurement date effective october 1 2008 we changed our measurement date to september 30 the assumed discount rate and the expected return are the assumptions that generally have the most significant impact on our pension costs and liabilities the assumed discount rate the assumed health care cost trend rate and assumed rates of retirement generally have the most significant impact on our postretirement plan costs and liabilities 

 

the discount rate is utilized principally in calculating the actuarial present value of our pension and postretirement obligations and net periodic pension and postretirement benefit plan costs when establishing our discount rate we consider high quality corporate bond rates based on bonds available in the marketplace that are suitable for settling the obligations changes in those rates from the prior year and the implied discount rate that is derived from matching our projected benefit disbursements with currently available high quality corporate bonds 

 

the expected longterm rate of return on assets is utilized in calculating the expected return on plan assets component of our annual pension and postretirement plan costs we estimate the expected return on plan assets by evaluating expected bond returns equity risk premiums asset allocations the effects of active plan management the impact of periodic plan asset rebalancing and historical performance we also consider the guidance from our investment advisors in making a final determination of our expected rate of return on assets to the extent the actual rate of return on assets realized over the course of a year is greater than or less than the assumed rate that year’s annual pension or postretirement plan costs are not affected rather this gain or loss reduces or increases future pension or postretirement plan costs over a period of approximately ten to twelve years 

 

the marketrelated value of our plan assets represents the fair market value of the plan assets adjusted to smooth out shortterm market fluctuations over a fiveyear period the use of this calculation will delay the impact of current market fluctuations on the pension expense for the period 

 

we estimate the assumed health care cost trend rate used in determining our postretirement net expense based upon our actual health care cost experience the effects of recently enacted legislation and general economic conditions our assumed rate of retirement is estimated based upon our annual review of our participant census information as of the measurement date 

 

actual changes in the fair market value of plan assets and differences between the actual return on plan assets and the expected return on plan assets could have a material effect on the amount of pension costs ultimately recognized a 025 percent change in our discount rate would impact our pension and postretirement costs by approximately 19 million a 025 percent change in our expected rate of return would impact our pension and postretirement costs by approximately 09 million 

 

fair value measurements — we report certain assets and liabilities at fair value which is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date exit price we primarily use quoted market prices and other observable market pricing information in valuing our financial assets and liabilities and minimize the use of unobservable pricing inputs in our measurements 

prices actively quoted on national exchanges are used to determine the fair value of most of our assets and liabilities recorded on our balance sheet at fair value within our nonregulated operations we utilize a midmarket pricing convention the midpoint between the bid and ask prices as a practical expedient for determining fair value measurement as permitted under current accounting standards values derived from these sources reflect the market in which transactions involving these financial instruments are executed we utilize models and other valuation methods to determine fair value when external sources are not available values are adjusted to reflect the potential impact of an orderly liquidation of our positions over a reasonable period of time under thencurrent market conditions we believe the market prices and models used to value these assets and liabilities represent the best information available with respect to closing exchange and overthecounter quotations time value and volatility factors underlying the assets and liabilities 

 

fairvalue estimates also consider our own creditworthiness and the creditworthiness of the counterparties involved our counterparties consist primarily of financial institutions and major energy companies this concentration of counterparties may materially impact our exposure to credit risk resulting from market economic or regulatory conditions adverse developments in the global financial and credit markets in the last few years have made it more difficult and more expensive for companies to access the shortterm capital markets which may negatively impact the creditworthiness of our counterparties a further tightening of the credit markets could cause more of our counterparties to fail to perform we seek to minimize counterparty credit risk through an evaluation of their financial condition and credit ratings and the use of collateral requirements under certain circumstances 

 

amounts reported at fair value are subject to potentially significant volatility based upon changes in market prices the valuation of the portfolio of our contracts maturity and settlement of these contracts and newly originated transactions each of which directly affect the estimated fair value of our financial instruments we believe the market prices and models used to value these financial instruments represent the best information available with respect to closing exchange and overthecounter quotations time value and volatility factors underlying the contracts values are adjusted to reflect the potential impact of an orderly liquidation of our positions over a reasonable period of time under then current market conditions 

 

results of operations 

 

overview 

 

atmos energy corporation is involved in the distribution marketing and transportation of natural gas accordingly our results of operations are impacted by the demand for natural gas particularly during the winter heating season and the volatility of the natural gas markets this generally results in higher operating revenues and net income during the period from october through march of each fiscal year and lower operating revenues and either lower net income or net losses during the period from april through september of each fiscal year as a result of the seasonality of the natural gas industry our second fiscal quarter has historically been our most critical earnings quarter with an average of approximately 61 percent of our consolidated net income having been earned in the second quarter during the three most recently completed fiscal years 

 

additionally the seasonality of our business impacts our working capital differently at various times during the year typically our accounts receivable accounts payable and shortterm debt balances peak by the end of january and then start to decline as customers begin to pay their winter heating bills gas stored underground particularly in our natural gas distribution segment typically peaks in november and declines as we utilize storage gas to serve our customers 

 

during the current year colderthannormal weather and recent improvements in rate designs in our natural gas distribution segment partially offset the decline in demand for natural gas which contributed to a 19 percent yearoveryear decrease in consolidated throughput in our regulated transmission and storage segment and a 5 percent yearoveryear decrease in consolidated sales volumes in our natural gas marketing segment 

during the year we continued to successfully access the capital markets and received updated debt ratings from three rating agencies in december 2009 we renewed a 450 million 364day committed credit facility for our nonregulated operations in march 2010 moody’s upgraded our rating outlook from stable to positive and affirmed the existing credit rating on our senior longterm debt and commercial paper while sp affirmed our rating outlook as stable and our senior longterm debt credit rating in june 2010 fitch upgraded our rating outlook from stable to positive and affirmed the existing credit rating on our senior unsecured debt and commercial paper in october 2010 we replaced our 200 million 364day revolving credit agreement prior to its expiration with a 200 million 180day revolving credit agreement the new credit facilities should help ensure we have sufficient liquidity to fund our working capital needs while our credit ratings should help us continue to obtain financing at a reasonable cost in the future 

 

on july 1 2010 we entered into an accelerated share repurchase program with goldman sachs  co as part of our ongoing efforts to improve shareholder value the shares that will be repurchased under this program should offset the dilutive impact of stock grants made under our various employee and director incentive compensation plans the impact of the shares repurchased under the program during fiscal 2010 increased diluted earnings per share by approximately 001 

 

consolidated results 

 

the following table presents our consolidated financial highlights for the fiscal years ended september 30 2010 2009 and 2008 

 

 

 

historically our regulated operations arising from our natural gas distribution and regulated transmission and storage operations contributed 65 to 85 percent of our consolidated net income regulated operations contributed 81 percent 83 percent and 74 percent to our consolidated net income for fiscal years 2010 2009 and 2008 our consolidated net income during the last three fiscal years was earned across our business segments as follows 

 

 

the following table segregates our consolidated net income and diluted earnings per share between our regulated and nonregulated operations 

 

 

 

net income during fiscal 2010 increased eight percent over fiscal 2009 net income from our regulated operations increased six percent during fiscal 2010 the increase primarily reflects colder than normal weather in most of our service areas as well as the net favorable impact of various ratemaking activities in our natural gas distribution segment net income in our nonregulated operations increased 53 million during fiscal 2010 primarily due to the impact of unrealized margins noncash net unrealized margins totaled 43 million which reduced earnings per share by 005 per diluted share compared to the prior year when net unrealized losses totaled 216 million which reduced earnings per share by 023 per diluted share 

 

net income in both periods was impacted by nonrecurring items the current year period includes the positive impact of a state sales tax refund of 46 million or 005 per diluted share net income in the prioryear period included the net positive impact of several onetime items totaling 171 million or 019 per diluted share related to the following pretax amounts 

 

  

net income during fiscal 2009 increased six percent over fiscal 2008 driven largely from an 18 percent increase in net income from regulated operations during fiscal 2009 the increase primarily reflects a 323 million increase in gross profit resulting from the net favorable impact of various ratemaking activities in our natural gas distribution segment partially offset by higher depreciation expense pipeline maintenance costs and interest expense net income in our nonregulated operations decreased 131 million primarily due to the impact of unrealized margins pretax unrealized margins totaled 359 million which reduced earnings per share by 023 per diluted share the overall increase in consolidated net income was also favorably affected by nonrecurring items totaling 171 million or 019 per diluted share related to the items noted above 

 

see the following discussion regarding the results of operations for each of our business operating segments 

 

natural gas distribution segment 

 

the primary factors that impact the results of our natural gas distribution operations are our ability to earn our authorized rates of return the cost of natural gas competitive factors in the energy industry and economic conditions in our service areas 

 

our ability to earn our authorized rates is based primarily on our ability to improve the rate design in our various ratemaking jurisdictions by reducing or eliminating regulatory lag and ultimately separating the recovery of our approved margins from customer usage patterns improving rate design is a longterm process 

and is further complicated by the fact that we operate in multiple rate jurisdictions the “ratemaking activity” section of this form 10k describes our current rate strategy progress towards implementing that strategy and recent ratemaking initiatives in more detail 

 

we are generally able to pass the cost of gas through to our customers without markup under purchased gas cost adjustment mechanisms therefore the cost of gas typically does not have an impact on our gross profit as increases in the cost of gas are offset by a corresponding increase in revenues accordingly we believe gross profit is a better indicator of our financial performance than revenues however gross profit in our texas and mississippi service areas include franchise fees and gross receipts taxes which are calculated as a percentage of revenue inclusive of gas costs therefore the amount of these taxes included in revenues is influenced by the cost of gas and the level of gas sales volumes we record the tax expense as a component of taxes other than income although changes in revenuerelated taxes arising from changes in gas costs affect gross profit over time the impact is offset within operating income prior to january 1 2009 timing differences existed between the recognition of revenue for franchise fees collected from our customers and the recognition of expense of franchise taxes these timing differences had a significant temporary effect on operating income in periods with volatile gas prices particularly in our midtex division beginning january 1 2009 changes in our franchise fee agreements in our midtex division became effective which have significantly reduced the impact of this timing difference however this timing difference is still present for gross receipts taxes 

 

as discussed above the cost of gas typically does not have a direct impact on our gross profit however higher gas costs may adversely impact our accounts receivable collections resulting in higher bad debt expense and may require us to increase borrowings under our credit facilities resulting in higher interest expense in addition higher gas costs as well as competitive factors in the industry and general economic conditions may cause customers to conserve or in the case of industrial consumers to use alternative energy sources however gas cost risk has been mitigated in recent years through improvements in rate design that allow us to collect from our customers the gas cost portion of our bad debt expense on approximately 65 percent of our residential and commercial margins 

review of financial and operating results 

 

financial and operational highlights for our natural gas distribution segment for the fiscal years ended september 30 2010 2009 and 2008 are presented below 

 

 

 

the following table shows our operating income by natural gas distribution division for the fiscal years ended september 30 2010 2009 and 2008 the presentation of our natural gas distribution operating income is included for financial reporting purposes and may not be appropriate for ratemaking purposes 

 

 

 

fiscal year ended september 30 2010 compared with fiscal year ended september 30 2009 

 

the 248 million increase in natural gas distribution gross profit primarily reflects rate adjustments and increased throughput as follows 

 

 44 

 

  

these increases were partially offset by 

 

  

operating expenses which include operation and maintenance expense provision for doubtful accounts depreciation and amortization expense taxes other than income and asset impairments decreased 86 million primarily due to the following 

 

  

these decreases were partially offset by 

 

  

miscellaneous income decreased 44 million due to lower interest income interest charges decreased 56 million primarily due to lower shortterm debt balances and interest rates 

 

additionally results for the fiscal year ended september 30 2009 were favorably impacted by a onetime tax benefit of 105 million during the second quarter of fiscal 2009 the company completed a study of the calculations used to estimate its deferred tax rate and concluded that revisions to these calculations to include more specific jurisdictional tax rates would result in a more accurate calculation of the tax rate at which deferred taxes would reverse in the future accordingly the company modified the tax rate used to calculate deferred taxes from 38 percent to an individual rate for each legal entity these rates vary from 3641 percent depending on the jurisdiction of the legal entity 

 

fiscal year ended september 30 2009 compared with fiscal year ended september 30 2008 

 

the 186 million increase in natural gas distribution gross profit primarily reflects an increase in rates the major components of the increase are as follows 

 

 45 

 

these increases were partially offset by 

 

  

operating expenses which include operation and maintenance expense provision for doubtful accounts depreciation and amortization expense taxes other than income and asset impairments decreased 93 million primarily due to the following 

 

  

these decreases were partially offset by 

 

  

as discussed above the results for fiscal 2009 include a 105 million tax benefit in the natural gas distribution segment in addition results for fiscal 2008 included a 12 million gain on the sale of irrigation assets in our west texas division 

 

interest charges increased 61 million primarily due to the effect of the company’s march 2009 issuance of 450 million 850 senior notes to repay 400 million 400 senior notes in april 2009 in addition we experienced higher average shortterm debt balances interest rates and commitment fees during the current year compared to the prior year 

 

regulated transmission and storage segment 

 

our regulated transmission and storage segment consists of the regulated pipeline and storage operations of the atmos pipeline — texas division the atmos pipeline — texas division transports natural gas to our midtex division and third parties and manages five underground storage reservoirs in texas we also provide ancillary services customary in the pipeline industry including parking arrangements lending and sales of excess gas 

 

similar to our natural gas distribution segment our regulated transmission and storage segment is impacted by seasonal weather patterns competitive factors in the energy industry and economic conditions in our service areas natural gas prices do not directly impact the results of this segment as revenues are derived from the transportation of natural gas however natural gas prices and demand for natural gas could influence the level of drilling activity in the markets that we serve which may influence the level of throughput we may be able to transport on our pipeline further natural gas price differences between the various hubs that we serve could influence customers to transport gas through our pipeline to capture arbitrage gains 

 

the results of atmos pipeline — texas division are also significantly impacted by the natural gas requirements of the midtex division because it is the sole supplier of natural gas for our midtex division 

finally as a regulated pipeline the operations of the atmos pipeline — texas division may be impacted by the timing of when costs and expenses are incurred and when these costs and expenses are recovered through its tariffs

fiscal year ended september 30 2010 compared with fiscal year ended september 30 2009 

 

the 66 million decrease in regulated transmission and storage gross profit was attributable primarily to the following factors 

 

  

these decreases were partially offset by the following 

 

  

operating expenses decreased 105 million primarily due to 

 

 47 

 

these decreases were partially offset by a 21 million increase in taxes other than income due to higher ad valorem and payroll taxes 

 

miscellaneous income decreased 13 million due primarily to a decline in intercompany interest income 

 

fiscal year ended september 30 2009 compared with fiscal year ended september 30 2008 

 

the 137 million increase in regulated transmission and storage gross profit was attributable primarily to the following factors 

 

  

these increases were primarily offset by an 84 million decrease associated with a decrease in transportation volumes to our midtex division due to warmer weather and a decrease in electrical generation barnett shale and hub deliveries 

 

operating expenses increased 103 million primarily due to higher levels of pipeline maintenance activities 

 

results for the currentyear period also include a 17 million tax benefit associated with updating the rates used to determine our deferred taxes 

 

natural gas marketing segment 

 

aem’s primary business is to aggregate and purchase gas supply arrange transportation and storage logistics and ultimately deliver gas to customers at competitive prices in addition aem utilizes proprietary and customerowned transportation and storage assets to provide various services our customers request including furnishing natural gas supplies at fixed and marketbased prices contract negotiation and administration load forecasting gas storage acquisition and management services transportation services peaking sales and balancing services capacity utilization strategies and gas price hedging through the use of financial instruments as a result aem’s margins arise from the types of commercial transactions we have structured with our customers and our ability to identify the lowest cost alternative among the natural gas supplies transportation and markets to which it has access to serve those customers 

 

aem seeks to enhance its gross profit margin from delivering gas by maximizing through asset optimization activities the economic value associated with the storage and transportation capacity we own or control in our natural gas distribution and natural gas marketing segments we attempt to meet this objective by engaging in natural gas storage transactions in which we seek to find and profit through the arbitrage of pricing differences in various locations and by recognizing pricing differences that occur over time this process involves purchasing physical natural gas storing it in the storage and transportation assets to which aem has access and selling financial instruments at advantageous prices to lock in a gross profit margin 

 

aem continually manages its net physical position to attempt to increase the future economic profit that was created when the original transaction was executed therefore aem may subsequently change its originally scheduled storage injection and withdrawal plans from one time period to another based on market conditions and recognize any associated gains or losses at that time if aem elects to accelerate the withdrawal of physical gas it will execute new financial instruments to hedge the original financial instruments if aem elects to defer the withdrawal of gas it will reset its positions by settling the original financial instruments and executing new financial instruments to correspond to the revised withdrawal schedule 

 

we use financial instruments designated as fair value hedges to hedge our natural gas inventory used in our natural gas marketing storage activities these financial instruments are marked to market each month based upon the nymex price with changes in fair value recognized as unrealized gains and losses in the 

period of change the hedged natural gas inventory is marked to market at the end of each month based on the gas daily index with changes in fair value recognized as unrealized gains and losses in the period of change changes in the spreads between the forward natural gas prices used to value the financial hedges designated against our physical inventory and the market spot prices used to value our physical storage result in unrealized margins until the underlying physical gas is withdrawn and the related financial instruments are settled once the gas is withdrawn and the financial instruments are settled the previously unrealized margins associated with these net positions are realized 

 

aem also uses financial instruments to capture additional storage arbitrage opportunities that may arise after the original physical inventory hedge and to attempt to insulate and protect the economic value within its asset optimization activities changes in fair value associated with these financial instruments are recognized as a component of unrealized margins until they are settled 

 

due to the nature of these operations natural gas prices and differences in natural gas prices between the various markets that we serve commonly referred to as basis differentials have a significant impact on our natural gas marketing operations within our delivered gas activities basis differentials impact our ability to create value from identifying the lowest cost alternative among the natural gas supplies transportation and markets to which we have access further higher natural gas prices may adversely impact our accounts receivable collections resulting in higher bad debt expense and may require us to increase borrowings under our credit facilities resulting in higher interest expense higher gas prices as well as competitive factors in the industry and general economic conditions may also cause customers to conserve or use alternative energy sources within our asset optimization activities higher gas prices could also lead to increased borrowings under our credit facilities resulting in higher interest expense 

 

volatility in natural gas prices also has a significant impact on our natural gas marketing segment increased price volatility often has a significant impact on the spreads between the market spot prices and forward natural gas prices which creates opportunities to earn higher arbitrage spreads within our asset optimization activities volatility could also impact the basis differentials we capture in our delivered gas activities however increased volatility impacts the amounts of unrealized margins recorded in our gross profit and could impact the amount of cash required to collateralize our risk management liabilities 

 

review of financial and operating results 

 

financial and operational highlights for our natural gas marketing segment for the fiscal years ended september 30 2010 2009 and 2008 are presented below gross profit margin consists primarily of margins earned from the delivery of gas and related services requested by our customers and margins earned from asset optimization activities which are derived from the utilization of our proprietary and managed third party storage and transportation assets to capture favorable arbitrage spreads through natural gas trading activities 

 

unrealized margins represent the unrealized gains or losses on our net physical position and the related financial instruments used to manage commodity price risk as described above these margins fluctuate based upon changes in the spreads between the physical and forward natural gas prices generally if the physicalfinancial spread narrows we will record unrealized gains or lower unrealized losses if the physicalfinancial spread widens we will record unrealized losses or lower unrealized gains the magnitude of the unrealized gains and losses is also dependent upon the levels of our net physical position at the end of the reporting period 

 

 

 

fiscal year ended september 30 2010 compared with fiscal year ended september 30 2009 

 

aem’s delivered gas business contributed 62 percent of total realized margins during the fiscal year ended september 30 2010 with asset optimization activities contributing the remaining 38 percent the 163 million decrease in realized gross profit reflected the following 

 

  

the decrease in realized gross profit was more than offset by a 176 million increase in unrealized margins due to the periodoverperiod timing of storage withdrawal gains and the associated reversal of unrealized gains into realized gains 

 

operating expenses which include operation and maintenance expense provision for doubtful accounts depreciation and amortization expense taxes other than income taxes and asset impairments decreased 65 million primarily due to a decrease in employee and other administrative costs 

 

miscellaneous income increased 17 million due to proceeds received from a classaction legal settlement in the current year interest charges decreased 36 million primarily due to a decrease in intercompany borrowings 

 

asset optimization activities 

 

aem monitors the impact of its asset optimization efforts by estimating the gross profit before related fees that it captured through the purchase and sale of physical natural gas and the execution of the associated 

financial instruments this economic value combined with the effect of the future reversal of unrealized gains or losses currently recognized in the income statement and related fees is referred to as the potential gross profit 

 

we define potential gross profit as the change in aem’s gross profit in future periods if its optimization efforts are executed as planned this amount does not include other operating expenses and associated income taxes that will be incurred to realize this amount therefore it does not represent an estimated increase in future net income there is no assurance that the economic value or the potential gross profit will be fully realized in the future 

 

we consider this measure a nongaap financial measure as it is calculated using both forwardlooking storage injectionwithdrawal and hedge settlement estimates and historical financial information this measure is presented because we believe it provides a more comprehensive view to investors of our asset optimization efforts and thus a better understanding of these activities than would be presented by gaap measures alone because there is no assurance that the economic value or potential gross profit will be realized in the future corresponding future gaap amounts are not available 

 

the following table presents aem’s economic value and its potential gross profit loss at september 30 2010 and 2009 

 

 

 

 

  

during the fiscal year ended september 30 2010 aem’s economic value decreased from 286 million or 207mcf at september 30 2009 to a negative economic value of 78 million or 057mcf 

 

early in the first quarter of fiscal 2010 aem withdrew gas and realized previously captured spread values as current cash prices declined during the first fiscal quarter aem injected gas and rolled positions into the second fiscal quarter to increase economic value these positions were settled in the second fiscal quarter and the associated economic value was realized however during the year weak market fundamentals have caused cash prices to remain low and have contracted spottoforward spread values which has limited opportunities to capture economic value therefore during the fiscal third and fourth quarters aem elected to forego capturing these narrower spread values and maintained a shortterm trading position we anticipate spottoforward spread values will expand in the near term and we expect to be able to roll positions and capture greater economic value than what we can capture as of september 30 2010 however the shortdated nature of aem’s trading positions combined with current shortterm forward prices that are lower than the cost of gas that was injected into storage in prior periods resulted in negative economic value as of september 30 2010 

 

the economic value is based upon planned storage injection and withdrawal schedules and its realization is contingent upon the execution of this plan weather and other execution factors since aem actively manages and optimizes its portfolio to attempt to enhance the future profitability of its storage position it may 

change its scheduled storage injection and withdrawal plans from one time period to another based on market conditions therefore we cannot ensure that the economic value or the potential gross profit or loss calculated as of september 30 2010 will be fully realized in the future nor can we predict in what time periods such realization may occur further if we experience operational or other issues which limit our ability to optimally manage our stored gas positions our earnings could be adversely impacted 

 

fiscal year ended september 30 2009 compared with fiscal year ended september 30 2008 

 

aem’s delivered gas business contributed 67 percent to total realized margins during fiscal 2009 with asset optimization activities contributing the remaining 33 percent in the prior year delivered gas activities represented substantially all of aem’s realized gross profit margin the 455 million increase in realized gross profit reflected 

 

  

the increase in realized gross profit was more than offset by a 539 million decrease in unrealized margins attributable to the following 

 

  

operating expenses which include operation and maintenance expense provision for doubtful accounts depreciation and amortization expense taxes other than income taxes and asset impairments increased 16 million primarily due the following factors 

 

  

pipeline storage and other segment 

 

our pipeline storage and other segment consists primarily of the operations of atmos pipeline and storage llc aps aps is engaged in nonregulated transmission storage and natural gasgathering services its primary asset is a proprietary 21 mile pipeline located in new orleans louisiana that is principally used to aggregate gas supply for our regulated natural gas distribution division in louisiana our natural gas marketing segment and on a more limited basis for third parties aps also owns or has an interest in underground storage fields in kentucky and louisiana that are used to reduce the need of our natural gas distribution divisions to contract for additional pipeline capacity to meet customer demand during peak periods 

 

in addition aps engages in asset optimization activities whereby it seeks to maximize the economic value associated with the storage and transportation capacity it owns or controls certain of these arrangements 

are with regulated affiliates of the company which have been approved by applicable state regulatory commissions generally these asset management plans require aps to share with our regulated customers a portion of the profits earned from these arrangements aps also seeks to maximize the economic value associated with the storage and transportation capacity it owns or controls by engaging in natural gas storage transactions in which it seeks to find and profit from the pricing differences that occur over time 

 

results for this segment are primarily impacted by seasonal weather patterns and similar to our natural gas marketing segment volatility in the natural gas markets additionally this segment’s results include an unrealized component as aps hedges its risk associated with its asset optimization activities 

 

review of financial and operating results 

 

financial and operational highlights for our pipeline storage and other segment for the fiscal years ended september 30 2010 2009 and 2008 are presented below 

 

 

 

fiscal year ended september 30 2010 compared with fiscal year ended september 30 2009 

 

gross profit from our pipeline storage and other segment decreased 14 million primarily due to the following 

 

  

operating expenses increased 14 million primarily due to increased operating costs associated with aps’ gas gathering activities and administrative costs 

 

miscellaneous income decreased 32 million primarily due to lower intercompany interest income earned by this segment 

fiscal year ended september 30 2009 compared with fiscal year ended september 30 2008 

 

gross profit from our pipeline storage and other segment increased 12 million primarily due to the following 

 

  

operating expenses increased 30 million primarily due to increased employee costs and higher depreciation expense which was largely attributable to additional assets placed in service during the year 

 

liquidity and capital resources 

 

the liquidity required to fund our working capital capital expenditures and other cash needs is provided from a variety of sources including internally generated funds and borrowings under our commercial paper program and bank credit facilities additionally we have various uncommitted trade credit lines with our gas suppliers that we utilize to purchase natural gas on a monthly basis finally from time to time we raise funds from the public debt and equity capital markets to fund our liquidity needs 

 

we regularly evaluate our funding strategy and profile to ensure that we have sufficient liquidity for our shortterm and longterm needs in a costeffective manner we also evaluate the levels of committed borrowing capacity that we require in fiscal 2011 we anticipate consolidating our shortterm facilities used for our regulated operations into a single line of credit in october 2010 we replaced our 200 million 364day revolving credit agreement with a 200 million 180day revolving credit agreement additionally we intend to replace aem’s 450 million 364day facility with a 200 million threeyear facility when it expires in december 2010 

 

our 350 million unsecured 7375 senior notes will mature in may 2011 we intend to refinance this debt on a longterm basis through the issuance of 30year unsecured senior notes in june 2011 additionally we plan to issue 250 million of 30year unsecured senior notes in november 2011 to fund our capital expenditure program on september 30 2010 we entered into five treasury lock agreements to fix the treasury yield component of the interest cost of financing the anticipated issuances of senior notes we designated all of the treasury lock agreements as cash flow hedges of an anticipated transaction any realized gain or loss incurred when these agreements are settled will be recognized as a component of interest expense over the life of the related longterm debt 

 

we believe the liquidity provided by our senior notes and committed credit facilities combined with our operating cash flows will be sufficient to fund our working capital needs and capital expenditure program for fiscal year 2011 

 

cash flows 

 

our internally generated funds may change in the future due to a number of factors some of which we cannot control these include regulatory changes the price for our services the demand for such products and services margin requirements resulting from significant changes in commodity prices operational risks and other factors 

cash flows from operating investing and financing activities for the years ended september 30 2010 2009 and 2008 are presented below 

 

 

 

cash flows from operating activities 

 

yearoveryear changes in our operating cash flows primarily are attributable to changes in net income working capital changes particularly within our natural gas distribution segment resulting from the price of natural gas and the timing of customer collections payments for natural gas purchases and purchased gas cost recoveries the significant factors impacting our operating cash flow for the last three fiscal years are summarized below 

 

fiscal year ended september 30 2010 compared with fiscal year ended september 30 2009 

 

for the fiscal year ended september 30 2010 we generated operating cash flow of 7265 million from operating activities compared with 9192 million in the prior year primarily due to the fluctuation in gas costs gas costs which reached historically high levels during the 2008 injection season declined sharply when the economy slipped into the recession and have remained relatively stable since that time operating cash flows for the fiscal 2010 period reflect the recovery of lower gas costs through purchased gas recovery mechanisms and sales this is in contrast to the fiscal 2009 period where operating cash flows were favorably influenced by the recovery of high gas costs during a period of falling prices 

 

fiscal year ended september 30 2009 compared with fiscal year ended september 30 2008 

 

operating cash flows were 5483 million higher in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 primarily due to the following 

 

  

cash flows from investing activities 

 

in recent fiscal years a substantial portion of our cash resources has been used to fund acquisitions and growth projects our ongoing construction program and improvements to information technology systems our ongoing construction program enables us to provide natural gas distribution services to our existing customer base expand our natural gas distribution services into new markets enhance the integrity of our pipelines and more recently expand our intrastate pipeline network in executing our current rate strategy we are focusing our capital spending in jurisdictions that permit us to earn an adequate return timely on our investment without 

compromising the safety or reliability of our system currently our midtex louisiana mississippi and west texas natural gas distribution divisions and our atmos pipeline — texas division have rate designs that provide the opportunity to include in their rate base approved capital costs on a periodic basis without being required to file a rate case 

 

since early 2010 we have been discussing the financial and operational details of an accelerated steel service line replacement program with representatives of 440 municipalities served by our midtex division two coalitions of cities representing the majority of the cities our midtex division serves have agreed to a program of installing 100000 replacements during the next two years with approved recovery of the associated return depreciation and taxes under the terms of the agreement the accelerated replacement program will commence in fiscal 2011 at a total projected capital cost of 80 — 120 million with completion expected in september 2012 as a result of this project and spending to replace our regulated customer service systems and our nonregulated energy trading risk management system we anticipate capital expenditures will increase significantly during the next two fiscal years 

 

for the fiscal year ended september 30 2010 we incurred 5426 million for capital expenditures compared with 5095 million for the fiscal year ended september 30 2009 and 4723 million for the fiscal year ended september 30 2008 

 

the 331 million increase in capital expenditures in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 primarily reflects spending for the relocation of our information technology data center to a new facility the construction of two service centers and the steel service line replacement program in our midtex division 

 

the increase in capital expenditures in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 primarily reflects 326 million related to spending for a regulated transmission pipeline project completed in the fourth quarter of 2009 

 

cash flows from financing activities 

 

for the fiscal year ended september 30 2010 our financing activities used 1630 million in cash while financing activities for the fiscal year ended september 30 2009 used 3375 million in cash compared with cash of 981 million provided for the fiscal year ended september 30 2008 our significant financing activities for the fiscal years ended september 30 2010 2009 and 2008 are summarized as follows 

 

 

during the fiscal year ended september 30 2010 we 

 

  

 

during the fiscal year ended september 30 2009 we 

 

 56 

 

  

 

during the fiscal year ended september 30 2008 we 

 

  

the following table shows the number of shares issued for the fiscal years ended september 30 2010 2009 and 2008 

 

 

 

the yearoveryear decrease in the number of shares issued primarily reflects the fact that in fiscal 2010 shares have begun to be purchased in the open market rather than by being issued by us to the direct stock purchase plan and the retirement savings plan in addition we awarded fewer shares under our 1998 longterm incentive plan due to the company achieving a lower level of performance relative to the target performance established under the plan during fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 further a higher average stock price during the second and third quarters of fiscal 2010 compared to the second and third quarters of 2009 enabled us to issue fewer shares during the current year 

 

during the fiscal year we repurchased 2958580 common shares as part of the accelerated share repurchase agreement that is described in further detail below additionally we repurchased 37365 shares attributable to equity awards during the year the repurchased share activity is not included in the table above 

 

share repurchase agreement 

 

on july 1 2010 we entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement with goldman sachs  co under which we repurchased 100 million of our outstanding common stock in order to offset stock grants made under our various employee and director incentive compensation plans 

 

we paid 100 million to goldman sachs  co on july 7 2010 for shares of atmos energy common stock in a share forward transaction and received 2958580 shares we will receive the balance of the shares at the conclusion of the term of the repurchase agreement the specific number of shares we will ultimately repurchase in the transaction will be based generally on the average of the daily volumeweighted average share price of our common stock over the duration of the agreement the agreement is scheduled to end in 

march 2011 although the termination date may be accelerated at the option of goldman sachs  co as a result of this transaction beginning in our fourth fiscal quarter the number of outstanding shares used to calculate our earnings per share was reduced by the number of shares received and the 100 million purchase price was recorded as a reduction in shareholders’ equity the number of shares used to calculate our earnings per share in fiscal 2011 will continue to be reduced by the shares we received in july 2010 however the total impact to diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2011 will be dependent upon the average share price of our common stock over the remainder of the agreement 

 

credit facilities 

 

our shortterm borrowing requirements are affected by the seasonal nature of the natural gas business changes in the price of natural gas and the amount of natural gas we need to supply to meet our customers’ needs could significantly affect our borrowing requirements however our shortterm borrowings typically reach their highest levels in the winter months 

 

as of september 30 2010 we financed our shortterm borrowing requirements through a combination of a 5667 million commercial paper program and four committed credit facilities with thirdparty lenders that provide approximately 12 billion of working capital funding as of september 30 2010 the amount available to us under our credit facilities net of outstanding letters of credit was 8348 million these facilities are described in further detail in note 6 to the consolidated financial statements 

 

in october 2010 our 200 million 364day facility expired and our fiveyear 5667 million facility will expire in december 2011 we replaced the 200 million 364day facility before its expiration with a 200 million 180day credit facility that will expire in april 2011 we do not plan to replace this facility upon expiration we expect to begin discussions in fiscal 2011 to replace the expiring fiveyear 5667 million facility with a larger multiyear credit facility we believe our existing fiveyear facility will provide adequate shortterm borrowing capacity until we can successfully execute a new multiyear credit facility 

 

additionally on december 9 2010 aem’s existing 450 million committed revolving credit facility will expire in october 2010 we received regulatory approval to increase aeh’s intercompany demand credit facility with aec from 200 million to 350 million effective december 1 2010 through december 31 2011 as a result of this increase we are in discussions with our thirdparty lenders to replace aem’s 450 million committed revolving credit facility with a 200 million threeyear committed revolving credit facility with an accordion feature that could increase aem’s borrowing capacity to 500 million as a result of consolidating and reducing the amounts available under our facilities we expect to reduce our shortterm financing costs 

 

shelf registration 

 

on march 31 2010 we filed a registration statement with the securities and exchange commission sec to issue from time to time up to 13 billion in common stock andor debt securities available for issuance we had already received approvals from all requisite state regulatory commissions to issue a total of 13 billion in common stock andor debt securities under the new shelf registration statement including the carryforward of the 450 million of securities remaining available for issuance under our shelf registration statement filed with the sec on march 23 2009 due to certain restrictions imposed by one state regulatory commission on our ability to issue securities under the new registration statement we will be able to issue a total of 950 million in debt securities and 350 million in equity securities 

 

credit ratings 

 

our credit ratings directly affect our ability to obtain shortterm and longterm financing in addition to the cost of such financing in determining our credit ratings the rating agencies consider a number of quantitative factors including debt to total capitalization operating cash flow relative to outstanding debt operating cash flow coverage of interest and pension liabilities and funding status in addition the rating agencies consider qualitative factors such as consistency of our earnings over time the quality of our management and business strategy the risks associated with our regulated and nonregulated businesses and the regulatory structures that govern our rates in the states where we operate 

our debt is rated by three rating agencies standard  poor’s corporation sp moody’s investors service moody’s and fitch ratings ltd fitch in march 2010 moody’s upgraded our rating outlook from stable to positive and affirmed the credit rating on our senior longterm debt at baa2 and on our commercial paper at p2 moody’s stated that the key driver for the upgrade was successful rate case outcomes over the past year in march 2010 sp affirmed our senior longterm debt credit rating of bbb and our rating outlook as stable in june 2010 fitch reaffirmed our senior longterm debt rating of bbb and commercial paper ratings of f2 and upgraded our rating outlook from stable to positive fitch cited our effective management of the regulatory process as well as our consistent financial and operational performance as the primary reasons for the upgrade our current debt ratings are all considered investment grade and are as follows 

 

 

 

a significant degradation in our operating performance or a significant reduction in our liquidity caused by more limited access to the private and public credit markets as a result of deteriorating global or national financial and credit conditions could trigger a negative change in our ratings outlook or even a reduction in our credit ratings by the three credit rating agencies this would mean more limited access to the private and public credit markets and an increase in the costs of such borrowings 

 

a credit rating is not a recommendation to buy sell or hold securities the highest investment grade credit rating for is aaa for sp aaa for moody’s and aaa for fitch the lowest investment grade credit rating is bbb for sp baa3 for moody’s and bbb for fitch our credit ratings may be revised or withdrawn at any time by the rating agencies and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating there can be no assurance that a rating will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if in its judgment circumstances so warrant 

 

debt covenants 

 

we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants as of september 30 2010 our debt covenants are described in note 6 to the consolidated financial statements 

 

capitalization 

 

the following table presents our capitalization as of september 30 2010 and 2009 

 

 

 

total debt as a percentage of total capitalization including shortterm debt was 513 percent and 507 percent at september 30 2010 and 2009 the increase in the debt to capitalization ratio primarily reflects an increase in shortterm debt as of september 30 2010 compared to the prior year our ratio of total debt to capitalization is typically greater during the winter heating season as we make additional shortterm borrowings to fund natural gas purchases and meet our working capital requirements we intend to maintain our debt to capitalization ratio in a target range of 50 to 55 percent 

contractual obligations and commercial commitments 

 

the following table provides information about contractual obligations and commercial commitments at september 30 2010 

 

 

 

 

  

aem has commitments to purchase physical quantities of natural gas under contracts indexed to the forward nymex strip or fixed price contracts at september 30 2010 aem was committed to purchase 695 bcf within one year 284 bcf within one to three years and 32 bcf after three years under indexed contracts aem is committed to purchase 31 bcf within one year and 03 bcf within one to three years under fixed price contracts with prices ranging from 355 to 636 per mcf 

 

with the exception of our midtex division our natural gas distribution segment maintains supply contracts with several vendors that generally cover a period of up to one year commitments for estimated 

base gas volumes are established under these contracts on a monthly basis at contractually negotiated prices commitments for incremental daily purchases are made as necessary during the month in accordance with the terms of the individual contract our midtex division maintains longterm supply contracts to ensure a reliable source of gas for our customers in its service area which obligate it to purchase specified volumes at market prices the estimated commitments under these contract terms as of september 30 2010 are reflected in the table above 

 

risk management activities 

 

we use financial instruments to mitigate commodity price risk and periodically to manage interest rate risk we conduct risk management activities through our natural gas distribution natural gas marketing and pipeline storage and other segments in our natural gas distribution segment we use a combination of physical storage fixed physical contracts and fixed financial contracts to reduce our exposure to unusually large winterperiod gas price increases in our natural gas marketing and pipeline storage and other segments we manage our exposure to the risk of natural gas price changes and lock in our gross profit margin through a combination of storage and financial instruments including futures overthecounter and exchangetraded options and swap contracts with counterparties to the extent our inventory cost and actual sales and actual purchases do not correlate with the changes in the market indices we use in our hedges we could experience ineffectiveness or the hedges may no longer meet the accounting requirements for hedge accounting resulting in the financial instruments being treated as mark to market instruments through earnings 

 

we use financial instruments designated as cash flow hedges of anticipated purchases and sales at index prices to mitigate the commodity price risk in our natural gas marketing segment associated with deliveries under fixedpriced forward contracts to deliver gas to customers and we use financial instruments designated as fair value hedges to hedge our natural gas inventory used in our asset optimization activities in our natural gas marketing and pipeline storage and other segments 

 

also in our natural gas marketing segment we use storage swaps and futures to capture additional storage arbitrage opportunities that arise subsequent to the execution of the original fair value hedge associated with our physical natural gas inventory basis swaps to insulate and protect the economic value of our fixed price and storage books and various overthecounter and exchangetraded options these financial instruments have not been designated as hedges 

 

we record our financial instruments as a component of risk management assets and liabilities which are classified as current or noncurrent based upon the anticipated settlement date of the underlying financial instrument substantially all of our financial instruments are valued using external market quotes and indices 

 

the following table shows the components of the change in fair value of our natural gas distribution segment’s financial instruments for the fiscal year ended september 30 2010 in thousands 

 

 

the fair value of our natural gas distribution segment’s financial instruments at september 30 2010 is presented below by time period and fair value source 

 

 

 

the following table shows the components of the change in fair value of our natural gas marketing segment’s financial instruments for the fiscal year ended september 30 2010 in thousands 

 

 

 

the fair value of our natural gas marketing segment’s financial instruments at september 30 2010 is presented below by time period and fair value source 

 

 

 

employee benefit programs 

 

an important element of our total compensation program and a significant component of our operation and maintenance expense is the offering of various benefit programs to our employees these programs include medical and dental insurance coverage and pension and postretirement programs 

 

medical and dental insurance 

 

we offer medical and dental insurance programs to substantially all of our employees and we believe these programs are consistent with other programs in our industry since 2005 we have experienced medical and prescription inflation of approximately seven percent in recent years we have strived to actively manage our health care costs through the introduction of a wellness strategy that is focused on helping employees to identify health risks and to manage these risks through improved lifestyle choices 

 

net periodic pension and postretirement benefit costs 

 

for the fiscal year ended september 30 2010 our total net periodic pension and other benefits costs was 508 million compared with 502 million and 479 million for the fiscal years ended september 30 2009 

and 2008 these costs relating to our natural gas distribution operations are recoverable through our gas distribution rates a portion of these costs is capitalized into our gas distribution rate base and the remaining costs are recorded as a component of operation and maintenance expense 

 

the increase in total net periodic pension and other benefits costs during fiscal 2010 compared with fiscal 2009 primarily reflects the decline in fair value of our plan assets the discount rate used to compute the present value of a plan’s liabilities generally is based on rates of highgrade corporate bonds with maturities similar to the average period over which the benefits will be paid at our september 30 2009 measurement date the interest rates were slightly lower than the interest rates at september 30 2008 the measurement date used to determine our fiscal 2009 net periodic cost our expected return on our pension plan assets remained constant at 825 

 

the increase in total net periodic pension and other benefits costs during fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008 primarily reflects the change in assumptions we made during our annual pension plan valuation completed september 30 2008 the discount rate used to compute the present value of a plan’s liabilities generally was based on rates of highgrade corporate bonds with maturities similar to the average period over which the benefits will be paid at our september 30 2008 measurement date the interest rates were approximately 130 basis points higher than the interest rates at june 30 2007 the measurement date used to determine our fiscal 2008 net periodic cost the corresponding increase in the discount rate was the primary driver for the increase in our fiscal 2009 pension and benefit costs our expected return on our pension plan assets remained constant at 825 

 

pension and postretirement plan funding 

 

generally our funding policy is to contribute annually an amount that will at least equal the minimum amount required to comply with the employee retirement income security act of 1974 however additional voluntary contributions are made from time to time as considered necessary contributions are intended to provide not only for benefits attributed to service to date but also for those expected to be earned in the future 

 

during fiscal 2010 we did not contribute cash to our pension plans as the fair value of the plans’ assets recovered somewhat during the year from the unfavorable market conditions experienced in the latter half of calendar year 2008 and our plan assets were sufficient to achieve a desirable funding threshold as established by the pension protection act of 2006 ppa during fiscal 2009 we contributed 210 million to our pension plans to achieve the same desired level of funding as established by the ppa during fiscal 2008 we voluntarily contributed 23 million to the atmos energy corporation retirement plan for mississippi valley gas union employees this contribution achieved a desired level of funding for this plan for the 2007 plan year 

 

we contributed 118 million 101 million and 96 million to our postretirement benefits plans for the fiscal years ended september 30 2010 2009 and 2008 the contributions represent the portion of the postretirement costs we are responsible for under the terms of our plan and minimum funding required by state regulatory commissions 

 

outlook for fiscal 2011 and beyond 

 

as of september 30 2010 interest and corporate bond rates utilized to determine our discount rates which impacted our fiscal 2011 net periodic pension and postretirement costs were lower than the interest and corporate bond rates as of september 30 2009 the measurement date for our fiscal 2010 net periodic cost as a result of the lower interest and corporate bond rates we decreased the discount rate used to determine our fiscal 2011 pension and benefit costs to 539 percent we maintained the expected return on our pension plan assets at 825 percent despite the recent uncertainty in the financial markets as we believe this rate reflects the average rate of expected earnings on plan assets that will fund our projected benefit obligation although the fair value of our plan assets has declined as the financial markets have declined the impact of this decline is partially mitigated by the fact that assets are smoothed for purposes of determining net periodic pension cost which results in asset gains and losses that are recognized over time as a component of net periodic pension and benefit costs for our pension account plan our largest funded plan due to the decline in the fair value of 

our plan assets we expect our fiscal 2011 pension and postretirement medical costs to increase compared to fiscal 2010 based upon market conditions subsequent to september 30 2010 the current funded position of the plans and the new funding requirements under the ppa we believe it is reasonably possible that we will be required to contribute to the plans in fiscal 2011 further we will consider whether an additional voluntary contribution is prudent to maintain certain ppa funding thresholds however we cannot anticipate with certainty whether such contributions will be made and the amount of such contributions with respect to our postretirement medical plans we anticipate contributing approximately 130 million during fiscal 2011 

 

the projected pension liability future funding requirements and the amount of pension expense or income recognized for the plan are subject to change depending upon the actuarial value of plan assets and the determination of future benefit obligations as of each subsequent actuarial calculation date these amounts are impacted by actual investment returns changes in interest rates and changes in the demographic composition of the participants in the plan 

 

in august 2010 the board of directors of atmos energy approved a proposal to close the pension account plan pap to new participants effective october 1 2010 employees participating in the pap as of october 1 2010 will be allowed to make a onetime election to migrate from the pap into our defined contribution plan with enhanced features effective january 1 2011 participants who choose to remain in the pap will continue to earn benefits and interest allocations with no changes to their existing benefits 

 

in march 2010 president obama signed the patient protection and affordable care act into law the “health care reform act” the health care reform act will be phased in over an eightyear period although we are still assessing the impact of the health care reform act on the health care benefits we provide to our employees the design of our health care plans has already changed in order to comply with provisions of the health care reform act that have already gone into effect or will be going into effect in 2011 for example lifetime maximums on benefits have been eliminated coverage for dependent children has been extended to age 26 and all costs of preventive coverage must be paid for by the insurer in 2014 health insurance exchanges will open in each state in order to provide a competitive marketplace for purchasing health insurance by individuals companies who offer health insurance to their employees could face a substantial increase in premiums at that time if they choose to continue to provide such coverage however companies who elect to cease providing health insurance to their employees will be faced with paying significant penalties to the federal government for each employee who receives coverage through an exchange we will continue to monitor all developments on health care reform and continue to comply with all existing relevant laws and regulations 

 

for fiscal 2011 we anticipate an approximate 10 percent medical and prescription drug inflation rate primarily due to anticipated higher claims costs and the initial implementation of the health care reform act 

 

recent accounting developments 

 

recent accounting developments and their impact on our financial position results of operations and cash flows are described in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements

 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend  

we are exposed to risks associated with commodity prices and interest rates commodity price risk is the potential loss that we may incur as a result of changes in the fair value of a particular instrument or commodity interestrate risk results from our portfolio of debt and equity instruments that we issue to provide financing and liquidity for our business activities 

 

we conduct risk management activities through both our natural gas distribution and natural gas marketing segments in our natural gas distribution segment we use a combination of physical storage fixed physical contracts and fixed financial contracts to protect us and our customers against unusually large winter period gas price increases in our natural gas marketing segment we manage our exposure to the risk of natural gas price changes and lock in our gross profit margin through a combination of storage and financial instruments including futures overthecounter and exchangetraded options and swap contracts with 

counterparties our risk management activities and related accounting treatment are described in further detail in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements additionally our earnings are affected by changes in shortterm interest rates as a result of our issuance of shortterm commercial paper and our other shortterm borrowings 

 

commodity price risk 

 

natural gas distribution segment 

 

we purchase natural gas for our natural gas distribution operations substantially all of the costs of gas purchased for natural gas distribution operations are recovered from our customers through purchased gas cost adjustment mechanisms therefore our natural gas distribution operations have limited commodity price risk exposure 

 

natural gas marketing and pipeline storage and other segments 

 

our natural gas marketing segment is also exposed to risks associated with changes in the market price of natural gas for our natural gas marketing segment we use a sensitivity analysis to estimate commodity price risk for purposes of this analysis we estimate commodity price risk by applying a 050 change in the forward nymex price to our net open position including existing storage and related financial contracts at the end of each period based on aeh’s net open position including existing storage and related financial contracts at september 30 2010 of 01 bcf a 050 change in the forward nymex price would have had a 01 million impact on our consolidated net income 

 

changes in the difference between the indices used to mark to market our physical inventory gas daily and the related fairvalue hedge nymex can result in volatility in our reported net income but over time gains and losses on the sale of storage gas inventory will be offset by gains and losses on the fairvalue hedges based upon our net physical position at september 30 2010 and assuming our hedges would still qualify as highly effective a 050 change in the difference between the gas daily and nymex indices would impact our reported net income by approximately 48 million 

 

additionally these changes could cause us to recognize a risk management liability which would require us to place cash into an escrow account to collateralize this liability position this in turn would reduce the amount of cash we would have on hand to fund our working capital needs 

 

interest rate risk 

 

our earnings are exposed to changes in shortterm interest rates associated with our shortterm commercial paper program and other shortterm borrowings we use a sensitivity analysis to estimate our shortterm interest rate risk for purposes of this analysis we estimate our shortterm interest rate risk as the difference between our actual interest expense for the period and estimated interest expense for the period assuming a hypothetical average one percent increase in the interest rates associated with our shortterm borrowings had interest rates associated with our shortterm borrowings increased by an average of one percent our interest expense would have increased by approximately 15 million during 2010 

 

as of september 30 2010 we were not engaged in other activities that would cause exposure to the risk of material earnings or cash flow loss due to changes in interest rates or market commodity prices

overview and strategy 

 

atmos energy corporation headquartered in dallas texas is engaged primarily in the regulated natural gas distribution and transmission and storage businesses as well as other nonregulated natural gas businesses since our incorporation in texas in 1983 we have grown primarily through a series of acquisitions the most recent of which was the acquisition in october 2004 of the natural gas distribution and pipeline operations of txu gas company we are also incorporated in the state of virginia 

 

today we distribute natural gas through regulated sales and transportation arrangements to over 3 million residential commercial public authority and industrial customers in 12 states located primarily in the south which makes us one of the country’s largest naturalgasonly distributors based on number of customers we also operate one of the largest intrastate pipelines in texas based on miles of pipe 

 

through our nonregulated businesses we primarily provide natural gas management and marketing services to municipalities other local gas distribution companies and industrial customers primarily in the midwest and southeast and natural gas transportation along with storage services to certain of our natural gas distribution divisions and third parties 

 

our overall strategy is to 

 

  

we have experienced more than 25 consecutive years of increasing dividends and earnings growth after giving effect to our acquisitions historically we achieved this record of growth through acquisitions while efficiently managing our operating and maintenance expenses and leveraging our technology to achieve more efficient operations in recent years we have also achieved growth by implementing rate designs that reduce or eliminate regulatory lag and separate the recovery of our approved margins from customer usage patterns in addition we have developed various commercial opportunities within our regulated transmission and storage operations finally we have strengthened our nonregulated businesses by increasing sales volumes and improving perunit margins 

 

our core values include focusing on our employees and customers while conducting our business with honesty and integrity we continue to strengthen our culture through ongoing communications with our employees and enhanced employee training 

 

operating segments 

 

we operate the company through the following four segments 

 

 4 

 

  

these operating segments are described in greater detail below 

 

natural gas distribution segment overview 

 

our natural gas distribution segment consists of the following six regulated divisions presented in order of total customers served covering service areas in 12 states 

 

  

our natural gas distribution business is a seasonal business gas sales to residential and commercial customers are greater during the winter months than during the remainder of the year the volumes of gas sales during the winter months will vary with the temperatures during these months 

 

revenues in this operating segment are established by regulatory authorities in the states in which we operate these rates are intended to be sufficient to cover the costs of conducting business and to provide a reasonable return on invested capital our primary service areas are located in colorado kansas kentucky louisiana mississippi tennessee and texas we have more limited service areas in georgia illinois iowa missouri and virginia in addition we transport natural gas for others through our distribution system 

 

rates established by regulatory authorities often include cost adjustment mechanisms for costs that i are subject to significant price fluctuations compared to our other costs ii represent a large component of our cost of service and iii are generally outside our control 

 

purchased gas cost mechanisms represent a common form of cost adjustment mechanism purchased gas cost adjustment mechanisms provide natural gas utility companies a method of recovering purchased gas costs on an ongoing basis without filing a rate case because they provide a dollarfordollar offset to increases or decreases in natural gas distribution gas costs therefore although substantially all of our natural gas distribution operating revenues fluctuate with the cost of gas that we purchase natural gas distribution gross profit which is defined as operating revenues less purchased gas cost is generally not affected by fluctuations in the cost of gas 

 

additionally some jurisdictions have introduced performancebased ratemaking adjustments to provide incentives to natural gas utilities to minimize purchased gas costs through improved storage management and use of financial instruments to lock in gas costs under the performancebased ratemaking adjustment purchased gas costs savings are shared between the utility and its customers 

 

finally regulatory authorities have approved weather normalization adjustments wna for over 90 percent of residential and commercial meters in our service areas as a part of our rates wna minimizes the effect of weather that is above or below normal by allowing us to increase customers’ bills to offset lower gas usage when weather is warmer than normal and decrease customers’ bills to offset higher gas usage when weather is colder than normal 

as of september 30 2009 we had wna for our residential and commercial meters in the following service areas for the following periods 

 

 

 

financial results for this segment are affected by the cost of natural gas and economic conditions in the areas that we serve as discussed above we are generally able to pass the cost of gas through to our customers under purchased gas adjustment clauses therefore the cost of gas typically does not have a direct impact on our gross profit however higher gas costs may cause customers to conserve or in the case of industrial customers to use alternative energy sources higher gas costs may also adversely impact our accounts receivable collections resulting in higher bad debt expense and may require us to increase borrowings under our credit facilities resulting in higher interest expense 

 

our supply of natural gas is provided by a variety of suppliers including independent producers marketers and pipeline companies and withdrawals of gas from proprietary and contracted storage assets additionally the natural gas supply for our midtex division includes peaking and spot purchase agreements 

 

supply arrangements consist of both base load and swing supply peaking quantities and are contracted from our suppliers on a firm basis with various terms at market prices base load quantities are those that flow at a constant level throughout the month and swing supply quantities provide the flexibility to change daily quantities to match increases or decreases in requirements related to weather conditions 

 

currently all of our natural gas distribution divisions except for our midtex division utilize 39 pipeline transportation companies both interstate and intrastate to transport our natural gas the pipeline transportation agreements are firm and many of them have “pipeline nonotice” storage service which provides for daily balancing between system requirements and nominated flowing supplies these agreements have been negotiated with the shortest term necessary while still maintaining our right of first refusal the natural gas supply for our midtex division is delivered by our atmos pipeline — texas division 

 

except for local production purchases we select our natural gas suppliers through a competitive bidding process by requesting proposals from suppliers that have demonstrated that they can provide reliable service we select these suppliers based on their ability to deliver gas supply to our designated firm pipeline receipt points at the lowest cost major suppliers during fiscal 2009 were anadarko energy services chesapeake energy marketing inc conocophillips company devon gas services lp enbridge marketing us lp iberdrola renewables inc national fuel marketing company llc oneok energy services company lp tenaska marketing and atmos energy marketing llc our natural gas marketing subsidiary 

 

the combination of base load peaking and spot purchase agreements coupled with the withdrawal of gas held in storage allows us the flexibility to adjust to changes in weather which minimizes our need to enter into longterm firm commitments we estimate our peakday availability of natural gas supply to be approximately 42 bcf the peakday demand for our natural gas distribution operations in fiscal 2009 was on january 15 2009 when sales to customers reached approximately 31 bcf 

 

to maintain our deliveries to high priority customers we have the ability and have exercised our right to curtail deliveries to certain customers under the terms of interruptible contracts or applicable state regulations or statutes our customers’ demand on our system is not necessarily indicative of our ability to meet current or anticipated market demands or immediate delivery requirements because of factors such as the physical limitations of gathering storage and transmission systems the duration and severity of cold weather the 

availability of gas reserves from our suppliers the ability to purchase additional supplies on a shortterm basis and actions by federal and state regulatory authorities curtailment rights provide us the flexibility to meet the humanneeds requirements of our customers on a firm basis priority allocations imposed by federal and state regulatory agencies as well as other factors beyond our control may affect our ability to meet the demands of our customers we anticipate no problems with obtaining additional gas supply as needed for our customers 

 

the following briefly describes our six natural gas distribution divisions we operate in our service areas under terms of nonexclusive franchise agreements granted by the various cities and towns that we serve at september 30 2009 we held 1111 franchises having terms generally ranging from five to 35 years a significant number of our franchises expire each year which require renewal prior to the end of their terms we believe that we will be able to renew our franchises as they expire additional information concerning our natural gas distribution divisions is presented under the caption “operating statistics” 

 

atmos energy midtex division our midtex division serves approximately 550 incorporated and unincorporated communities in the northcentral eastern and western parts of texas including the dallasfort worth metroplex the governing body of each municipality we serve has original jurisdiction over all gas distribution rates operations and services within its city limits except with respect to sales of natural gas for vehicle fuel and agricultural use the railroad commission of texas rrc has exclusive appellate jurisdiction over all rate and regulatory orders and ordinances of the municipalities and exclusive original jurisdiction over rates and services to customers not located within the limits of a municipality 

 

prior to fiscal 2008 this division operated under one systemwide rate structure however in 2008 we reached a settlement with cities representing approximately 80 percent of this division’s customers settled cities that has allowed us beginning in 2008 to update rates for customers in these cities through an annual rate review mechanism rates for the remaining 20 percent of this division’s customers primarily the city of dallas continue to be updated through periodic formal rate proceedings and filings made under texas’ gas reliability infrastructure program grip grip allows us to include in our rate base annually approved capital costs incurred in the prior calendar year provided that we file a complete rate case at least once every five years 

 

atmos energy kentuckymidstates division our kentuckymidstates division operates in more than 420 communities across georgia illinois iowa kentucky missouri tennessee and virginia the service areas in these states are primarily rural however this division serves franklin tennessee and other suburban areas of nashville we update our rates in this division through periodic formal rate filings made with each state’s public service commission 

 

atmos energy louisiana division in louisiana we serve nearly 300 communities including the suburban areas of new orleans the metropolitan area of monroe and western louisiana direct sales of natural gas to industrial customers in louisiana who use gas for fuel or in manufacturing processes and sales of natural gas for vehicle fuel are exempt from regulation and are recognized in our natural gas marketing segment our rates in this division are updated annually through a rate stabilization clause filing without filing a formal rate case 

 

atmos energy west texas division our west texas division serves approximately 80 communities in west texas including the amarillo lubbock and midland areas like our midtex division each municipality we serve has original jurisdiction over all gas distribution rates operations and services within its city limits with the rrc having exclusive appellate jurisdiction over the municipalities and exclusive original jurisdiction over rates and services provided to customers not located within the limits of a municipality prior to fiscal 2008 rates were updated in this division through formal rate proceedings however the west texas division entered into agreements with its west texas service areas during 2008 and its amarillo and lubbock service area during 2009 to update rates for customers in these service areas through an annual rate review mechanism 

 

atmos energy mississippi division in mississippi we serve about 110 communities throughout the northern half of the state including the jackson metropolitan area our rates in the mississippi division are updated annually through a stable rate filing without filing a formal rate case 

atmos energy coloradokansas division our coloradokansas division serves approximately 170 communities throughout colorado and kansas and parts of missouri including the cities of olathe kansas a suburb of kansas city and greeley colorado located near denver we update our rates in this division through periodic formal rate filings made with each state’s public service commission

regulated transmission and storage segment overview 

 

our regulated transmission and storage segment consists of the regulated pipeline and storage operations of our atmos pipeline — texas division this division transports natural gas to our midtex division transports natural gas for third parties and manages five underground storage reservoirs in texas we also provide ancillary services customary in the pipeline industry including parking arrangements lending and sales of inventory on hand parking arrangements provide shortterm interruptible storage of gas on our pipeline 

lending services provide shortterm interruptible loans of natural gas from our pipeline to meet market demands gross profit earned from our midtex division and through certain other transportation and storage services is subject to traditional ratemaking governed by the rrc however atmos pipeline — texas’ existing regulatory mechanisms allow certain transportation and storage services to be provided under marketbased rates with minimal regulation 

 

these operations include one of the largest intrastate pipeline operations in texas with a heavy concentration in the established natural gasproducing areas of central northern and eastern texas extending into or near the major producing areas of the texas gulf coast and the delaware and val verde basins of west texas nine basins located in texas are believed to contain a substantial portion of the nation’s remaining onshore natural gas reserves this pipeline system provides access to all of these basins

natural gas marketing segment overview 

 

our natural gas marketing activities are conducted through atmos energy marketing aem which is whollyowned by atmos energy holdings inc aeh aeh is a whollyowned subsidiary of aec and operates primarily in the midwest and southeast areas of the united states 

 

aem’s primary business is to aggregate and purchase gas supply arrange transportation and storage logistics and ultimately deliver gas to customers at competitive prices in addition aem utilizes proprietary and customerowned transportation and storage assets to provide various services our customers request including furnishing natural gas supplies at fixed and marketbased prices contract negotiation and administration load forecasting gas storage acquisition and management services transportation services peaking sales and balancing services capacity utilization strategies and gas price hedging through the use of financial instruments aem serves most of its customers under contracts generally having one to two year terms and sells natural gas to some of its industrial customers on a delivered burner tip basis under contract terms ranging from 30 days to two years as a result aem’s margins arise from the types of commercial transactions we have structured with our customers and our ability to identify the lowest cost alternative among the natural gas supplies transportation and markets to which it has access to serve those customers 

 

aem also seeks to maximize through asset optimization activities the economic value associated with the storage and transportation capacity we own or control in our natural gas distribution and natural gas marketing segments we attempt to meet this objective by engaging in natural gas storage transactions in which we seek to find and profit through the arbitrage of pricing differences in various locations and by recognizing pricing differences that occur over time this process involves purchasing physical natural gas storing it in the storage and transportation assets to which aem has access and selling financial instruments at advantageous prices to lock in a gross profit margin

pipeline storage and other segment overview 

 

our pipeline storage and other segment primarily consists of the operations of atmos pipeline and storage llc aps which is whollyowned by aeh aps is engaged in nonregulated transmission storage and natural gas gathering services its primary asset is a proprietary 21 mile pipeline located in new orleans louisiana it also owns or controls additional pipeline and storage capacity including interests in underground storage fields in kentucky and louisiana that are used to reduce the need of our natural gas distribution divisions to contract for pipeline capacity to meet customer demand during peak periods 

 

aps’ primary business is to provide storage and transportation services to our louisiana and kentuckymidstates regulated natural gas distribution divisions to our natural gas marketing segment and on a more limited basis to third parties aps earns transportation fees and storage demand charges to aggregate and provide gas supply provide access to storage capacity and transport gas for these customers 

 

aps also engages in various asset optimization activities aps’ primary asset optimization activity involves the administration of two asset management plans with regulated affiliates of the company these arrangements provide aps the opportunity to maximize the economic value associated with the transportation and storage capacity assigned to these plans aps attempts to meet this objective through a variety of activities including engaging in natural gas storage transactions and utilizing excess asset capacity to find and profit through the arbitrage of pricing differences in various locations and by recognizing pricing differences that occur over time these plans require aps to share a portion of the economic value created by these activities with the regulated customers served by these affiliates these arrangements have been approved by applicable state regulatory commissions and are subject to annual regulatory review intended to ensure proper allocation of economic value between our regulated customers and aps 

 

aps also seeks to maximize the economic value associated with the storage and transportation capacity it owns or controls we attempt to meet this objective by engaging in natural gas storage transactions in which we seek to find and profit through the arbitrage of pricing differences in various locations and by recognizing pricing differences that occur over time this process involves purchasing physical natural gas storing it in the storage and transportation assets to which aps has access and in transactions involving storage capacity selling financial instruments at advantageous prices to lock in a gross profit margin

the method of determining regulated rates varies among the states in which our natural gas distribution divisions operate the regulatory authorities have the responsibility of ensuring that utilities in their jurisdictions operate in the best interests of customers while providing utility companies the opportunity to earn a reasonable return on their investment generally each regulatory authority reviews rate requests and establishes a rate structure intended to generate revenue sufficient to cover the costs of conducting business and to provide a reasonable return on invested capital 

 

our current rate strategy is to focus on reducing or eliminating regulatory lag obtaining adequate returns and providing stable predictable margins atmos energy has annual ratemaking mechanisms in place in three states that provide for an annual rate review and adjustment to rates for approximately 68 percent of our customers additionally we have wna mechanisms in eight states these mechanisms work in tandem to provide insulation from volatile margins both for the company and our customers 

 

we will also continue to address various rate design changes including the recovery of bad debt gas costs inclusion of other taxes in gas costs and stratification of rates to benefit low income households in future rate filings these design changes would address cost variations that are related to passthrough energy costs beyond our control 

 

although substantial progress has been made in recent years by improving rate design across atmos’ operating area potential changes in federal energy policy and adverse economic conditions will necessitate continued vigilance by the company and our regulators in meeting the challenges presented by these external factors 

recent ratemaking activity 

 

substantially all of our natural gas distribution revenues in the fiscal years ended september 30 2009 2008 and 2007 were derived from sales at rates set by or subject to approval by local or state authorities annual net operating income increases resulting from ratemaking activity totaling 544 million 406 million and 452 million became effective in fiscal 2009 2008 and 2007 as summarized below 

 

 

 

additionally the following ratemaking efforts were initiated during fiscal 2009 but had not been completed as of september 30 2009 

 

 

 

 

  

in october 2009 we filed rate cases in georgia and kentucky requesting an increase in operating income of 38 million and 95 million 

our recent ratemaking activity is discussed in greater detail below 

 

rate case filings 

 

a rate case is a formal request from atmos energy to a regulatory authority to increase rates that are charged to customers rate cases may also be initiated when the regulatory authorities request us to justify our rates this process is referred to as a “show cause” action adequate rates are intended to provide for recovery of the company’s costs as well as a fair rate of return to our shareholders and ensure that we continue to deliver reliable reasonably priced natural gas service to our customers the following table summarizes our recent rate cases

grip filings 

 

as discussed above in “natural gas distribution segment overview” grip allows natural gas utility companies the opportunity to include in their rate base annually approved capital costs incurred in the prior calendar year the following table summarizes our grip filings with effective dates during the fiscal years ended september 30 2009 2008 and 2007 

 

 

 

 

  

annual rate filing mechanisms 

 

as an instrument to reduce regulatory lag annual rate filing mechanisms allow us to refresh our rates on a periodic basis without filing a formal rate case however these filings still involve discovery by the appropriate regulatory authorities prior to the final determination of rates under these mechanisms as discussed above in “natural gas distribution segment overview” we currently have annual rate filing mechanisms in our louisiana and mississippi divisions and in significant portions of our midtex and west texas divisions these mechanisms are referred to as rate review mechanisms in our midtex and west texas 

divisions stable rate filings in the mississippi division and rate stabilization clause in the louisiana division the following table summarizes filings made under our various annual rate filing mechanisms 

 

 

 

the rate review mechanism in the midtex division was entered into as a result of a settlement in the september 20 2007 statement of intent case filed with all midtex division cities of the 439 incorporated cities served by the midtex division 438 of these cities are part of the rate review mechanism process the west texas rate review mechanism was entered into in august 2008 as a result of a settlement with the west texas coalition of cities the lubbock and amarillo rate review mechanisms were entered into in the spring of 2009 all mechanisms have been implemented on a three year trial period of which three began in fiscal 2009 based upon calendar 2007 financial information and two of which began in fiscal 2009 based on 2008 financial information the third rate review mechanism in the midtex division will be filed in march 2010 based upon calendar 2009 financial information this filing will be the last filing under the three year trial period 

other ratemaking activity 

 

the following table summarizes other ratemaking activity during the fiscal years ended september 30 2009 2008 and 2007 

 

 

 

 

  

in may 2007 our midtex division filed for a 36month gas contract review filing this filing was mandated by prior rrc orders and related to the prudency of gas purchases made from november 2003 through october 2006 which total approximately 27 billion in february 2009 the rrc approved the hearing examiner’s recommendation to disallow no gas costs 

 

in march 2009 the rrc established a procedural schedule in gud 9696 to examine the 36month gas contract review process in august 2009 the full commission approved an order to eliminate the 36 month gas contract review at its august 2009 meeting 

 

other regulation 

 

each of our natural gas distribution divisions is regulated by various state or local public utility authorities we are also subject to regulation by the united states department of transportation with respect to safety requirements in the operation and maintenance of our gas distribution facilities in addition our distribution operations are also subject to various state and federal laws regulating environmental matters from time to time we receive inquiries regarding various environmental matters we believe that our properties and operations substantially comply with and are operated in substantial conformity with applicable safety and environmental statutes and regulations there are no administrative or judicial proceedings arising under 

environmental quality statutes pending or known to be contemplated by governmental agencies which would have a material adverse effect on us or our operations our environmental claims have arisen primarily from former manufactured gas plant sites in tennessee iowa and missouri 

 

the federal energy regulatory commission ferc allows pursuant to section 311 of the natural gas policy act gas transportation services through our atmos pipeline — texas assets “on behalf of” interstate pipelines or local distribution companies served by interstate pipelines without subjecting these assets to the jurisdiction of the ferc additionally the ferc has regulatory authority over the sale of natural gas in the wholesale gas market and the use and release of interstate pipeline and storage capacity as well as authority to detect and prevent market manipulation and to enforce compliance with ferc’s other rules policies and orders by companies engaged in the sale purchase transportation or storage of natural gas in interstate commerce we have taken what we believe are all necessary and appropriate steps to comply with these regulations 

 

in september 2008 the rrc issued a final rule requiring the replacement of known compression couplings at prebent gas meter risers by november 2009 this rule primarily affected the operations of the midtex division compliance with this rule has required us to expend significant amounts of capital in the midtex division but these prudent and mandatory expenditures have been recoverable through our rates as of september 30 2009 we had substantially completed our prebent riser replacement program in the midtex division 

 

competition 

 

although our natural gas distribution operations are not currently in significant direct competition with any other distributors of natural gas to residential and commercial customers within our service areas we do compete with other natural gas suppliers and suppliers of alternative fuels for sales to industrial customers we compete in all aspects of our business with alternative energy sources including in particular electricity electric utilities offer electricity as a rival energy source and compete for the space heating water heating and cooking markets promotional incentives improved equipment efficiencies and promotional rates all contribute to the acceptability of electrical equipment the principal means to compete against alternative fuels is lower prices and natural gas historically has maintained its price advantage in the residential commercial and industrial markets however periods of higher gas prices coupled with the electric utilities’ marketing efforts increase competition for residential and commercial customers in addition aem competes with other natural gas marketers to provide natural gas management and other related services to customers 

 

our regulated transmission and storage operations currently face limited competition from other existing intrastate pipelines and gas marketers seeking to provide or arrange transportation storage and other services for customers 

 

employees 

 

at september 30 2009 we had 4891 employees consisting of 4753 employees in our regulated operations and 138 employees in our nonregulated operations

 item 1a   risk factors tableend  

our financial and operating results are subject to a number of risk factors many of which are not within our control although we have tried to discuss key risk factors below please be aware that other or new risks may prove to be important in the future investors should carefully consider the following discussion of risk factors as well as other information appearing in this report these factors include the following 

 

further disruptions in the credit markets could limit our ability to access capital and increase our costs of capital 

 

we rely upon access to both shortterm and longterm credit markets to satisfy our liquidity requirements the global credit markets have experienced significant disruptions and volatility during the last two years to a greater degree than has been seen in decades in some cases the ability or willingness of traditional sources of capital to provide financing has been reduced 

 

historically we have accessed the commercial paper markets to finance our shortterm working capital needs the disruptions in the credit markets during the fall of 2008 temporarily limited our access to the commercial paper markets and increased our borrowing costs consequently for a short period we were forced to borrow directly under our primary credit facility that backstops our commercial paper program to provide much of our working capital this credit facility provides up to 567 million in committed financing through its expiration in december 2011 our borrowings under this facility along with our commercial paper have been used primarily to purchase natural gas supplies for the upcoming winter heating season the amount of our working capital requirements in the nearterm will depend primarily on the market price of natural gas higher natural gas prices may adversely impact our accounts receivable collections and may require us to increase borrowings under our credit facilities to fund our operations the cost of both our borrowings under the primary credit facility and our commercial paper has increased significantly since september 2008 we have historically supplemented our commercial paper program with a shortterm committed credit facility that must be renewed annually no borrowings are currently outstanding under our current 200 million shortterm facility which matures in october 2010 

 

our longterm debt is currently rated as “investment grade” by standard  poor’s corporation moody’s investors services inc and fitch ratings ltd if adverse credit conditions were to cause a significant limitation on our access to the private and public credit markets we could see a reduction in our liquidity a significant reduction in our liquidity could in turn trigger a negative change in our ratings outlook or even a reduction in our credit ratings by one or more of the three credit rating agencies such a downgrade could further limit our access to public andor private credit markets and increase the costs of borrowing under each source of credit 

 

further if our credit ratings were downgraded we could be required to provide additional liquidity to our natural gas marketing segment because the commodity financial instruments markets could become unavailable to us our natural gas marketing segment depends primarily upon a committed 450 million credit facility to finance its working capital needs which it uses primarily to issue standby letters of credit to its natural gas 

suppliers a significant reduction in the availability of this facility could require us to provide extra liquidity to support its operations or reduce some of the activities of our natural gas marketing segment our ability to provide extra liquidity is limited by the terms of our existing lending arrangements with aeh which are subject to annual approval by one state regulatory commission 

 

while we believe we can meet our capital requirements from our operations and the sources of financing available to us we can provide no assurance that we will continue to be able to do so in the future especially if the market price of natural gas increases significantly in the nearterm the future effects on our business liquidity and financial results of a further deterioration of current conditions in the credit markets could be material and adverse to us both in the ways described above or in other ways that we do not currently anticipate 

 

the continuation of recent economic conditions could adversely affect our customers and negatively impact our financial results 

 

the slowdown in the us economy together with increased mortgage defaults and significant decreases in the values of homes and investment assets has adversely affected the financial resources of many domestic households it is unclear whether the administrative and legislative responses to these conditions will be successful in ending the current recession including the lowering of current high unemployment rates across the us as a result our customers may seek to use even less gas and it may become more difficult for them to pay their gas bills this may slow collections and lead to higher than normal levels of accounts receivable this in turn could increase our financing requirements and bad debt expense 

 

the costs of providing pension and postretirement health care benefits and related funding requirements are subject to changes in pension fund values changing demographics and fluctuating actuarial assumptions and may have a material adverse effect on our financial results 

 

we provide a cashbalance pension plan and postretirement healthcare benefits to eligible fulltime employees our costs of providing such benefits and related funding requirements are subject to changes in the market value of the assets funding our pension and postretirement healthcare plans the fluctuations over the last two years in the values of investments that fund our pension and postretirement healthcare plans may significantly differ from or alter the values and actuarial assumptions we use to calculate our future pension plan expense and postretirement healthcare costs and funding requirements under the pension protection act any significant declines in the value of these investments could increase the expenses of our pension and postretirement healthcare plans and related funding requirements in the future our costs of providing such benefits and related funding requirements are also subject to changing demographics including longer life expectancy of beneficiaries and an expected increase in the number of eligible former employees over the next five to ten years as well as various actuarial calculations and assumptions which may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions higher or lower withdrawal rates and interest rates and other factors 

 

our operations are exposed to market risks that are beyond our control which could adversely affect our financial results and capital requirements 

 

our risk management operations are subject to market risks beyond our control including market liquidity commodity price volatility and counterparty creditworthiness although we maintain a risk management policy we may not be able to completely offset the price risk associated with volatile gas prices or the risk in our natural gas marketing and pipeline storage and other segments which could lead to volatility in our earnings physical trading also introduces price risk on any net open positions at the end of each trading day as well as volatility resulting from intraday fluctuations of gas prices and the potential for daily price movements between the time natural gas is purchased or sold for future delivery and the time the related purchase or sale is hedged although we manage our business to maintain no open positions there are times when limited net open positions related to our physical storage may occur on a shortterm basis the determination of our net open position as of the end of any particular trading day requires us to make assumptions as to future circumstances including the use of gas by our customers in relation to our anticipated 

storage and market positions because the price risk associated with any net open position at the end of such day may increase if the assumptions are not realized we review these assumptions as part of our daily monitoring activities net open positions may increase volatility in our financial condition or results of operations if market prices move in a significantly favorable or unfavorable manner because the timing of the recognition of profits or losses on the hedges for financial accounting purposes usually do not match up with the timing of the economic profits or losses on the item being hedged this volatility may occur with a resulting increase or decrease in earnings or losses even though the expected profit margin is essentially unchanged from the date the transactions were consummated further if the local physical markets in which we trade do not move consistently with the nymex futures market we could experience increased volatility in the financial results of our natural gas marketing and pipeline storage and other segments 

 

our natural gas marketing and pipeline storage and other segments manage margins and limit risk exposure on the sale of natural gas inventory or the offsetting fixedprice purchase or sale commitments for physical quantities of natural gas through the use of a variety of financial instruments however contractual limitations could adversely affect our ability to withdraw gas from storage which could cause us to purchase gas at spot prices in a rising market to obtain sufficient volumes to fulfill customer contracts we could also realize financial losses on our efforts to limit risk as a result of volatility in the market prices of the underlying commodities or if a counterparty fails to perform under a contract further tightening of the credit markets could cause more of our counterparties to fail to perform than expected in addition adverse changes in the creditworthiness of our counterparties could limit the level of trading activities with these parties and increase the risk that these parties may not perform under a contract these circumstances could also increase our capital requirements 

 

we are also subject to interest rate risk on our borrowings in recent years we have been operating in a relatively low interestrate environment with both short and longterm interest rates being relatively low compared to historical interest rates however increases in interest rates could adversely affect our future financial results 

 

we are subject to state and local regulations that affect our operations and financial results 

 

our natural gas distribution and regulated transmission and storage segments are subject to various regulated returns on our rate base in each jurisdiction in which we operate we monitor the allowed rates of return and our effectiveness in earning such rates and initiate rate proceedings or operating changes as we believe are needed in addition in the normal course of business in the regulatory environment assets may be placed in service and historical test periods established before rate cases can be filed that could result in an adjustment of our allowed returns once rate cases are filed regulatory bodies have the authority to suspend implementation of the new rates while studying the cases because of this process we must suffer the negative financial effects of having placed assets in service without the benefit of rate relief which is commonly referred to as “regulatory lag” rate cases also involve a risk of rate reduction because once rates have been approved they are still subject to challenge for their reasonableness by appropriate regulatory authorities in addition regulators may review our purchases of natural gas and can adjust the amount of our gas costs that we pass through to our customers finally our debt and equity financings are also subject to approval by regulatory commissions in several states which could limit our ability to access or take advantage of changes in the capital markets 

 

some of our operations are subject to increased federal regulatory oversight that could affect our operations and financial results 

 

ferc has regulatory authority that affects some of our operations including sales of natural gas in the wholesale gas market and the use and release of interstate pipeline and storage capacity under legislation passed by congress in 2005 ferc has adopted rules designed to prevent market power abuse and market manipulation and to promote compliance with ferc’s other rules policies and orders by companies engaged in the sale purchase transportation or storage of natural gas in interstate commerce these rules carry increased penalties for violations we are currently under investigation by ferc for possible violations of its posting and competitive bidding regulations for prearranged released firm capacity on interstate natural gas 

pipelines should ferc conclude that we have committed such violations of its regulations and levies substantial fines andor penalties against us our business financial condition or financial results could be adversely affected in addition although we have taken steps to structure current and future transactions to comply with applicable current ferc regulations changes in ferc regulations or their interpretation by ferc or additional regulations issued by ferc in the future could also adversely affect our business financial condition or financial results 

 

we are subject to environmental regulations which could adversely affect our operations or financial results 

 

we are subject to laws regulations and other legal requirements enacted or adopted by federal state and local governmental authorities relating to protection of the environment and health and safety matters including those legal requirements that govern discharges of substances into the air and water the management and disposal of hazardous substances and waste the cleanup of contaminated sites groundwater quality and availability plant and wildlife protection as well as work practices related to employee health and safety environmental legislation also requires that our facilities sites and other properties associated with our operations be operated maintained abandoned and reclaimed to the satisfaction of applicable regulatory authorities failure to comply with these laws regulations permits and licenses may expose us to fines penalties or interruptions in our operations that could be significant to our financial results in addition existing environmental regulations may be revised or our operations may become subject to new regulations 

 

our business may be subject in the future to additional regulatory and financial risks associated with global warming and climate change 

 

there are a number of new federal and state legislative and regulatory initiatives being proposed and adopted in an attempt to control or limit the effects of global warming and overall climate change including greenhouse gas emissions such as carbon dioxide for example in june 2009 the us house of representatives approved the american clean energy and security act of 2009  also known as the waxmanmarkey bill or “cap and trade” bill the legislation which strives to promote energy efficiency in the united states and reduce the amount of greenhouse gases produced has implications for the natural gas industry the bill if adopted would accelerate significantly the reduction in energy use per customer through a number of measures including a dramatic tightening of building and appliance codes and other practices designed to put an increased focus on building and appliance efficiency according to the bill overall nationwide energy savings would total 75 percent by the year 2030 as a result of adopting its provisions if adopted the waxmanmarkey bill would establish a phasedin greenhouse gas emission capandtrade program that would reduce overall greenhouse gas emissions from capped sources by 17 percent by 2020 compared to emissions from such sources in 2005 these caps would be postponed on natural gas residential and commercial customers until 2016 subsequent to the adoption by the house of this bill a similar bill was introduced in the us senate entitled the clean energy jobs and american power act also known as the kerryboxer bill at this time the kerryboxer bill is awaiting senate action the adoption of this legislation by congress or similar legislation by states or the adoption of related regulations by federal or state governments mandating a substantial reduction in greenhouse gas emissions could have farreaching and significant impacts on the energy industry such new legislation or regulations could result in increased compliance costs for us or additional operating restrictions on our business affect the demand for natural gas or impact the prices we charge to our customers at this time we cannot predict the potential impact of such laws or regulations on our future business financial condition or financial results 

 

the concentration of our distribution pipeline and storage operations in the state of texas exposes our operations and financial results to economic conditions and regulatory decisions in texas 

 

over 50 percent of our natural gas distribution customers and most of our pipeline and storage assets and operations are located in the state of texas this concentration of our business in texas means that our operations and financial results may be significantly affected by changes in the texas economy in general and regulatory decisions by state and local regulatory authorities in texas 

adverse weather conditions could affect our operations or financial results 

 

since the 20062007 winter heating season we have had weathernormalized rates for over 90 percent of our residential and commercial meters which has substantially mitigated the adverse effects of warmerthannormal weather for meters in those service areas however there is no assurance that we will continue to receive such regulatory protection from adverse weather in our rates in the future the loss of such weather — normalized rates could have an adverse effect on our operations and financial results in addition our natural gas distribution and regulated transmission and storage operating results may continue to vary somewhat with the actual temperatures during the winter heating season sustained cold weather could adversely affect our natural gas marketing operations as we may be required to purchase gas at spot rates in a rising market to obtain sufficient volumes to fulfill some customer contracts 

 

inflation and increased gas costs could adversely impact our customer base and customer collections and increase our level of indebtedness 

 

inflation has caused increases in some of our operating expenses and has required assets to be replaced at higher costs we have a process in place to continually review the adequacy of our natural gas distribution gas rates in relation to the increasing cost of providing service and the inherent regulatory lag in adjusting those gas rates historically we have been able to budget and control operating expenses and investments within the amounts authorized to be collected in rates and intend to continue to do so however the ability to control expenses is an important factor that could impact future financial results 

 

rapid increases in the costs of purchased gas would cause us to experience a significant increase in shortterm debt we must pay suppliers for gas when it is purchased which can be significantly in advance of when these costs may be recovered through the collection of monthly customer bills for gas delivered increases in purchased gas costs also slow our natural gas distribution collection efforts as customers are more likely to delay the payment of their gas bills leading to higher than normal accounts receivable this could result in higher shortterm debt levels greater collection efforts and increased bad debt expense 

 

our growth in the future may be limited by the nature of our business which requires extensive capital spending 

 

we must continually build additional capacity in our natural gas distribution system to enable us to adequately serve any significant amount of additional customers the cost of adding this capacity may be affected by a number of factors including the general state of the economy and weather our cash flows from operations generally are sufficient to supply funding for all our capital expenditures including the financing of the costs of new construction along with capital expenditures necessary to maintain our existing natural gas system due to the timing of these cash flows and capital expenditures we often must fund at least a portion of these costs through borrowing funds from third party lenders the cost and availability of which is dependent on the liquidity of the credit markets interest rates and other market conditions this in turn may limit our ability to connect new customers to our system due to constraints on the amount of funds we can invest in our infrastructure 

 

our operations are subject to increased competition 

 

in residential and commercial customer markets our natural gas distribution operations compete with other energy products such as electricity and propane our primary product competition is with electricity for heating water heating and cooking increases in the price of natural gas could negatively impact our competitive position by decreasing the price benefits of natural gas to the consumer this could adversely impact our business if as a result our customer growth slows reducing our ability to make capital expenditures or if our customers further conserve their use of gas resulting in reduced gas purchases and customer billings 

 

in the case of industrial customers such as manufacturing plants adverse economic conditions including higher gas costs could cause these customers to use alternative sources of energy such as electricity or bypass our systems in favor of special competitive contracts with lower perunit costs our regulated transmission and 

storage segment currently faces limited competition from other existing intrastate pipelines and gas marketers seeking to provide or arrange transportation storage and other services for customers however competition may increase if new intrastate pipelines are constructed near our existing facilities 

 

distributing and storing natural gas involve risks that may result in accidents and additional operating costs 

 

our natural gas distribution business involves a number of hazards and operating risks that cannot be completely avoided such as leaks accidents and operational problems which could cause loss of human life as well as substantial financial losses resulting from property damage damage to the environment and to our operations we do have liability and property insurance coverage in place for many of these hazards and risks however because our pipeline storage and distribution facilities are near or are in populated areas any loss of human life or adverse financial results resulting from such events could be large if these events were not fully covered by insurance our operations or financial results could be adversely affected 

 

natural disasters terrorist activities or other significant events could adversely affect our operations or financial results 

 

natural disasters are always a threat to our assets and operations in addition the threat of terrorist activities could lead to increased economic instability and volatility in the price of natural gas that could affect our operations also companies in our industry may face a heightened risk of exposure to actual acts of terrorism which could subject our operations to increased risks as a result the availability of insurance covering such risks may be more limited which could increase the risk that an event could adversely affect our operations or financial results

this section provides management’s discussion of the financial condition changes in financial condition and results of operations of atmos energy corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries with specific information on results of operations and liquidity and capital resources it includes management’s interpretation of our financial results the factors affecting these results the major factors expected to affect future operating results and future investment and financing plans this discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 

 

several factors exist that could influence our future financial performance some of which are described in item 1a above “risk factors” they should be considered in connection with evaluating forwardlooking statements contained in this report or otherwise made by or on behalf of us since these factors could cause actual results and conditions to differ materially from those set out in such forwardlooking statements 

 

cautionary statement for the purposes of the safe harbor under the private securities litigation reform act of 1995

critical accounting policies and estimates 

 

our consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and the related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities we based our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances on an ongoing basis we evaluate 

our estimates including those related to risk management and trading activities fair value measurements allowance for doubtful accounts legal and environmental accruals insurance accruals pension and postretirement obligations deferred income taxes and valuation of goodwill indefinitelived intangible assets and other longlived assets our critical accounting policies are reviewed by the audit committee quarterly actual results may differ from estimates 

 

regulation — our natural gas distribution and regulated transmission and storage operations are subject to regulation with respect to rates service maintenance of accounting records and various other matters by the respective regulatory authorities in the states in which we operate we meet the criteria established within accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of a costbased rateregulated entity which requires us to reflect the financial effects of the ratemaking and accounting practices and policies of the various regulatory commissions in our financial statements in accordance with applicable authoritative accounting standards we apply the provisions of this standard to our regulated operations and record regulatory assets for costs that have been deferred for which future recovery through customer rates is considered probable and regulatory liabilities when it is probable that revenues will be reduced for amounts that will be credited to customers through the ratemaking process as a result certain costs that would normally be expensed under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states are permitted to be capitalized or deferred on the balance sheet because it is probable they can be recovered through rates discontinuing the application of this method of accounting for regulatory assets and liabilities could significantly increase our operating expenses as fewer costs would likely be capitalized or deferred on the balance sheet which could reduce our net income further regulation may impact the period in which revenues or expenses are recognized the amounts to be recovered or recognized are based upon historical experience and our understanding of the regulations the impact of regulation on our regulated operations may be affected by decisions of the regulatory authorities or the issuance of new regulations 

 

revenue recognition — sales of natural gas to our natural gas distribution customers are billed on a monthly basis however the billing cycle periods for certain classes of customers do not necessarily coincide with accounting periods used for financial reporting purposes we follow the revenue accrual method of accounting for natural gas distribution segment revenues whereby revenues applicable to gas delivered to customers but not yet billed under the cycle billing method are estimated and accrued and the related costs are charged to expense 

 

on occasion we are permitted to implement new rates that have not been formally approved by our regulatory authorities which are subject to refund we recognize this revenue and establish a reserve for amounts that could be refunded based on our experience for the jurisdiction in which the rates were implemented 

 

rates established by regulatory authorities are adjusted for increases and decreases in our purchased gas costs through purchased gas cost adjustment mechanisms purchased gas cost adjustment mechanisms provide gas utility companies a method of recovering purchased gas costs on an ongoing basis without filing a rate case to address all of the utility company’s nongas costs these mechanisms are commonly utilized when regulatory authorities recognize a particular type of cost such as purchased gas costs that i is subject to significant price fluctuations compared to the utility company’s other costs ii represents a large component of the utility company’s cost of service and iii is generally outside the control of the gas utility company there is no gross profit generated through purchased gas cost adjustments but they provide a dollarfordollar offset to increases or decreases in utility gas costs although substantially all natural gas distribution sales to our customers fluctuate with the cost of gas that we purchase our gross profit is generally not affected by fluctuations in the cost of gas as a result of the purchased gas cost adjustment mechanism the effects of these purchased gas cost adjustment mechanisms are recorded as deferred gas costs on our balance sheet 

 

operating revenues for our regulated transmission and storage and pipeline storage and other segments are recognized in the period in which actual volumes are transported and storage services are provided 

 

operating revenues for our natural gas marketing segment and the associated carrying value of natural gas inventory inclusive of storage costs are recognized when we sell the gas and physically deliver it to our customers operating revenues include realized gains and losses arising from the settlement of financial 

instruments used in our natural gas marketing activities and unrealized gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value of natural gas inventory designated as a hedged item in a fair value hedge and the associated financial instruments 

 

allowance for doubtful accounts — accounts receivable arise from natural gas sales to residential commercial industrial municipal and other customers for the majority of our receivables we establish an allowance for doubtful accounts based on our collections experience on certain other receivables where we are aware of a specific customer’s inability or reluctance to pay we record an allowance for doubtful accounts against amounts due to reduce the net receivable balance to the amount we reasonably expect to collect however if circumstances change our estimate of the recoverability of accounts receivable could be affected circumstances which could affect our estimates include but are not limited to customer credit issues the level of natural gas prices customer deposits and general economic conditions accounts are written off once they are deemed to be uncollectible 

 

financial instruments and hedging activities — we currently use financial instruments to mitigate commodity price risk additionally we periodically use financial instruments to manage interest rate risk the objectives and strategies for using financial instruments have been tailored to meet the needs of our regulated and nonregulated businesses 

 

we record all of our financial instruments on the balance sheet at fair value as required by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  with changes in fair value ultimately recorded in the income statement the timing of when changes in fair value of our financial instruments are recorded in the income statement depends on whether the financial instrument has been designated and qualifies as a part of a hedging relationship or if regulatory rulings require a different accounting treatment changes in fair value for financial instruments that do not meet one of these criteria are recognized in the income statement as they occur 

 

financial instruments associated with commodity price risk 

 

in our natural gas distribution segment our customers are exposed to the effect of volatile natural gas prices we manage this exposure through a combination of physical storage fixedprice forward contracts and financial instruments primarily overthecounter swap and option contracts in an effort to minimize the impact of natural gas price volatility on our customers during the winter heating season the costs associated with and the gains and losses arising from the use of financial instruments to mitigate commodity price risk in this segment are included in our purchased gas adjustment mechanisms in accordance with regulatory requirements therefore changes in the fair value of these financial instruments are initially recorded as a component of deferred gas costs and recognized in the consolidated statement of income as a component of purchased gas cost when the related costs are recovered through our rates and recognized in revenue in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states accordingly there is no earnings impact to our natural gas distribution segment as a result of the use of financial instruments 

 

our natural gas marketing segment aggregates and purchases gas supply arranges transportation andor storage logistics and ultimately delivers gas to our customers at competitive prices we also perform asset optimization activities in both our natural gas marketing segment and pipeline storage and other segment as a result of these activities our nonregulated operations are exposed to risks associated with changes in the market price of natural gas we manage our exposure to the risk of natural gas price changes through a combination of physical storage and financial instruments including futures overthecounter and exchangetraded options and swap contracts with counterparties 

 

in our natural gas marketing and pipeline storage and other segments we have designated the natural gas inventory held by these operating segments as the hedged item in a fairvalue hedge this inventory is marked to market at the end of each month based on the gas daily index with changes in fair value recognized as unrealized gains or losses in revenue in the period of change the financial instruments associated with this natural gas inventory have been designated as fairvalue hedges and are marked to market each month based upon the nymex price with changes in fair value recognized as unrealized gains or losses in revenue in the period of change changes in the spreads between the forward natural gas prices used to value the financial instruments designated against our physical inventory nymex and the market spot prices used to value 

our physical storage gas daily result in unrealized margins until the underlying physical gas is withdrawn and the related financial instruments are settled the difference in the spot price used to value our physical inventory and the forward price used to value the related financial instruments can result in volatility in our reported income as a component of unrealized margins we have elected to exclude this spotforward differential for purposes of assessing the effectiveness of these fairvalue hedges once the gas is withdrawn and the financial instruments are settled the previously unrealized margins associated with these net positions are realized over time we expect gains and losses on the sale of storage gas inventory to be offset by gains and losses on the fairvalue hedges resulting in the realization of the economic gross profit margin we anticipated at the time we structured the original transaction 

 

we have elected to treat fixedprice forward contracts used in our natural gas marketing segment to deliver gas as normal purchases and normal sales as such these deliveries are recorded on an accrual basis in accordance with our revenue recognition policy financial instruments used to mitigate the commodity price risk associated with these contracts have been designated as cash flow hedges of anticipated purchases and sales at indexed prices accordingly unrealized gains and losses on open financial instruments are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income and are recognized in earnings as a component of revenue when the hedged volumes are sold hedge ineffectiveness to the extent incurred is reported as a component of revenue 

 

we also use storage swaps and futures to capture additional storage arbitrage opportunities in our natural gas marketing segment that arise after the execution of the original fair value hedge associated with our physical natural gas inventory basis swaps to insulate and protect the economic value of our fixed price and storage books and various overthecounter and exchangetraded options these financial instruments have not been designated as hedges 

 

financial instruments associated with interest rate risk 

 

we periodically manage interest rate risk typically when we issue new or refinance existing longterm debt as of september 30 2009 we had no financial instruments in place to manage interest rate risk however in prior years we entered into treasury lock agreements to fix the treasury yield component of the interest cost associated with anticipated financings we designated these treasury lock agreements as a cash flow hedge of an anticipated transaction at the time the agreements were executed accordingly unrealized gains and losses associated with the treasury lock agreements were recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss the realized gain or loss recognized upon settlement of each treasury lock agreement was initially recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss and is recognized as a component of interest expense over the life of the related financing arrangement 

 

impairment assessments — we perform impairment assessments of our goodwill intangible assets subject to amortization and longlived assets as of september 30 2009 we had no indefinitelived intangible assets 

 

we annually evaluate our goodwill balances for impairment during our second fiscal quarter or as impairment indicators arise we use a present value technique based on discounted cash flows to estimate the fair value of our reporting units we have determined our reporting units to be each of our natural gas distribution divisions and whollyowned subsidiaries and goodwill is allocated to the reporting units responsible for the acquisition that gave rise to the goodwill the discounted cash flow calculations used to assess goodwill impairment are dependent on several subjective factors including the timing of future cash flows future growth rates and the discount rate an impairment charge is recognized if the carrying value of a reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds its fair value 

 

we annually assess whether the cost of our intangible assets subject to amortization or other longlived assets is recoverable or that the remaining useful lives may warrant revision we perform this assessment more frequently when specific events or circumstances have occurred that suggest the recoverability of the cost of the intangible and other longlived assets is at risk 

 

when such events or circumstances are present we assess the recoverability of these assets by determining whether the carrying value will be recovered through expected future cash flows from the 

operating division or subsidiary to which these assets relate these cash flow projections consider various factors such as the timing of the future cash flows and the discount rate and are based upon the best information available at the time the estimate is made changes in these factors could materially affect the cash flow projections and result in the recognition of an impairment charge an impairment charge is recognized as the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value if the sum of the undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying value of the related asset 

 

pension and other postretirement plans — pension and other postretirement plan costs and liabilities are determined on an actuarial basis and are affected by numerous assumptions and estimates including the market value of plan assets estimates of the expected return on plan assets assumed discount rates and current demographic and actuarial mortality data prior to fiscal 2009 we reviewed the estimates and assumptions underlying our pension and other postretirement plan costs and liabilities annually based upon a june 30 measurement date effective october 1 2008 we changed our measurement date to september 30 the assumed discount rate and the expected return are the assumptions that generally have the most significant impact on our pension costs and liabilities the assumed discount rate the assumed health care cost trend rate and assumed rates of retirement generally have the most significant impact on our postretirement plan costs and liabilities 

 

the discount rate is utilized principally in calculating the actuarial present value of our pension and postretirement obligations and net pension and postretirement costs when establishing our discount rate we consider high quality corporate bond rates changes in those rates from the prior year and the implied discount rate that is derived from matching our projected benefit disbursements with a high quality corporate bond spot rate curve 

 

the expected longterm rate of return on assets is utilized in calculating the expected return on plan assets component of our annual pension and postretirement plan costs we estimate the expected return on plan assets by evaluating expected bond returns equity risk premiums asset allocations the effects of active plan management the impact of periodic plan asset rebalancing and historical performance we also consider the guidance from our investment advisors in making a final determination of our expected rate of return on assets to the extent the actual rate of return on assets realized over the course of a year is greater than or less than the assumed rate that year’s annual pension or postretirement plan costs are not affected rather this gain or loss reduces or increases future pension or postretirement plan costs over a period of approximately ten to twelve years 

 

we estimate the assumed health care cost trend rate used in determining our postretirement net expense based upon our actual health care cost experience the effects of recently enacted legislation and general economic conditions our assumed rate of retirement is estimated based upon our annual review of our participant census information as of the measurement date 

 

actual changes in the fair market value of plan assets and differences between the actual return on plan assets and the expected return on plan assets could have a material effect on the amount of pension costs ultimately recognized a 025 percent change in our discount rate would impact our pension and postretirement costs by approximately 08 million a 025 percent change in our expected rate of return would impact our pension and postretirement costs by approximately 09 million 

 

fair value measurements — we report certain assets and liabilities at fair value which is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date exit price we primarily use quoted market prices and other observable market pricing information in valuing our financial assets and liabilities and minimize the use of unobservable pricing inputs in our measurements 

 

prices actively quoted on national exchanges are used to determine the fair value of most of our assets and liabilities recorded on our balance sheet at fair value within our nonregulated operations we utilize a midmarket pricing convention the midpoint between the bid and ask prices as a practical expedient for determining fair value measurement as permitted under current accounting standards values derived from these sources reflect the market in which transactions involving these financial instruments are executed we 

utilize models and other valuation methods to determine fair value when external sources are not available values are adjusted to reflect the potential impact of an orderly liquidation of our positions over a reasonable period of time under thencurrent market conditions we believe the market prices and models used to value these assets and liabilities represent the best information available with respect to closing exchange and overthecounter quotations time value and volatility factors underlying the assets and liabilities 

 

fairvalue estimates also consider our own creditworthiness and the creditworthiness of the counterparties involved our counterparties consist primarily of financial institutions and major energy companies this concentration of counterparties may materially impact our exposure to credit risk resulting from market economic or regulatory conditions recent adverse developments in the global financial and credit markets have made it more difficult and more expensive for companies to access the shortterm capital markets which may negatively impact the creditworthiness of our counterparties a continued tightening of the credit markets could cause more of our counterparties to fail to perform we seek to minimize counterparty credit risk through an evaluation of their financial condition and credit ratings and the use of collateral requirements under certain circumstances 

 

amounts reported at fair value are subject to potentially significant volatility based upon changes in market prices the valuation of the portfolio of our contracts maturity and settlement of these contracts and newly originated transactions each of which directly affect the estimated fair value of our financial instruments we believe the market prices and models used to value these financial instruments represent the best information available with respect to closing exchange and overthecounter quotations time value and volatility factors underlying the contracts values are adjusted to reflect the potential impact of an orderly liquidation of our positions over a reasonable period of time under then current market conditions 

 

results of operations 

 

overview 

 

atmos energy corporation is involved in the distribution marketing and transportation of natural gas accordingly our results of operations are impacted by the demand for natural gas particularly during the winter heating season and the volatility of the natural gas markets this generally results in higher operating revenues and net income during the period from october through march of each fiscal year and lower operating revenues and either lower net income or net losses during the period from april through september of each fiscal year as a result of the seasonality of the natural gas industry our second fiscal quarter has historically been our most critical earnings quarter with an average of approximately 64 percent of our consolidated net income having been earned in the second quarter during the three most recently completed fiscal years 

 

additionally the seasonality of our business impacts our working capital differently at various times during the year typically our accounts receivable accounts payable and shortterm debt balances peak by the end of january and then start to decline as customers begin to pay their winter heating bills gas stored underground particularly in our natural gas distribution segment typically peaks in november and declines as we utilize storage gas to serve our customers 

 

during the current year several external factors have impacted atmos energy including but not limited to adverse developments in the global and financial credit markets and the unfavorable impact of the economic recession 

 

the tightening of the credit markets has made it more difficult and more expensive for us to access the capital markets however during the fiscal year we took several steps to improve our financial position in march 2009 we successfully completed an offering of 450 million 85 senior notes and used most of the proceeds in april 2009 to redeem 400 million of senior notes that were scheduled to mature in october 2009 additionally we enhanced our liquidity sources in various ways in october 2008 we replaced our former 300 million 364day committed credit facility with a new 364day 2125 million committed credit facility then in october 2009 we replaced the 2125 million 364day committed credit facility with a new 364day 200 million committed credit facility we also converted aem’s former 580 million uncommitted credit 

facility to a 364day 375 million committed credit facility in december 2008 this facility was subsequently increased to 450 million in april 2009 finally in april 2009 we replaced an expiring 18 million unsecured committed credit facility with a 25 million unsecured committed credit facility after entering into these new facilities we currently have a total of approximately 9020 million available to us under four committed credit facilities as a result of these developments and our continued successful financial performance standard  poor’s corporation sp upgraded our credit rating from bbb to bbb in december 2008 and moody’s investors service moody’s upgraded the credit rating on our senior longterm debt from baa3 to baa2 and our commercial paper from p3 to p2 in may 2009 these ratings upgrades have improved our ability to access the shortterm capital markets to satisfy our liquidity requirements on more economical terms 

 

however the turmoil in the financial markets did also have a direct financial impact on our results of operations we determined that the decline in fair value for certain availableforsale securities in our supplemental executive benefit plans experienced during the year ended september 30 2009 was other than temporary and accordingly recorded a 54 million noncash charge to impair the assets as a result of these impairments we do not maintain any investments that are in an unrealized loss position 

 

finally challenging economic times resulted in a general decline in throughput across most of our business segments the impact of the economic downturn is most apparent in a general decline in throughput our natural gas distribution segment has experienced a yearoveryear 5 percent decrease in consolidated throughput primarily associated with lower residential commercial and industrial consumption declines in the demand for natural gas as a result of idle production and plant closures have contributed to an 11 percent yearoveryear decrease in consolidated throughput in our regulated transmission and storage segment and a 5 percent yearoveryear decrease in consolidated sales volumes in our natural gas marketing segment however recent improvements in rate design in our natural gas distribution segment and the ability to earn higher perunit margins in our regulated transmission and storage and natural gas marketing segments has more than offset the decline in throughput and sales volumes additionally reduced demand for natural gas has resulted in lower natural gas prices which has contributed significantly to the increase in our operating cash flow 

 

consolidated results 

 

the following table presents our consolidated financial highlights for the fiscal years ended september 30 2009 2008 and 2007 

 

 

 

historically our regulated operations arising from our natural gas distribution and regulated transmission and storage operations contributed 65 to 85 percent of our consolidated net income regulated operations contributed 83 percent 74 percent and 64 percent to our consolidated net income for fiscal years 2009 2008 

and 2007 our consolidated net income during the last three fiscal years was earned across our business segments as follows 

 

 

 

the following table segregates our consolidated net income and diluted earnings per share between our regulated and nonregulated operations 

 

 

 

net income during fiscal 2009 increased six percent over fiscal 2008 net income from our regulated operations increased 18 percent during fiscal 2009 the increase primarily reflects a 323 million increase in gross profit resulting from the net favorable impact of various ratemaking activities in our natural gas distribution segment partially offset by higher depreciation expense pipeline maintenance costs and interest expense net income in our nonregulated operations decreased 131 million primarily due to the impact of unrealized margins unrealized margins totaled 359 million which reduced earnings per share by 023 per diluted share the overall increase in consolidated net income was also favorably affected by nonrecurring items totaling 171 million or 019 per diluted share related to the following pretax amounts 

 

  

net income during fiscal 2008 increased seven percent over fiscal 2007 net income from our regulated operations increased 24 percent during fiscal 2008 the increase primarily reflects a 538 million increase in gross profit resulting from our ratemaking efforts coupled with higher perunit transportation margins and an 18 percent increase in consolidated throughput in our atmos pipeline — texas division these increases were partially offset by a four percent increase in operating expenses net income in our nonregulated operations experienced a 24 percent decline as less volatile natural gas market conditions significantly reduced our asset optimization margins however higher delivered gas margins in our natural gas marketing segment and unrealized margins partially offset this decrease 

 

see the following discussion regarding the results of operations for each of our business operating segments 

natural gas distribution segment 

 

the primary factors that impact the results of our natural gas distribution operations are our ability to earn our authorized rates of return the cost of natural gas competitive factors in the energy industry and economic conditions in our service areas 

 

our ability to earn our authorized rates is based primarily on our ability to improve the rate design in our various ratemaking jurisdictions by reducing or eliminating regulatory lag and ultimately separating the recovery of our approved margins from customer usage patterns improving rate design is a longterm process and is further complicated by the fact that we operate in multiple rate jurisdictions the “ratemaking activity” section of this form 10k describes our current rate strategy and recent ratemaking initiatives in more detail 

 

our natural gas distribution operations are also affected by the cost of natural gas the cost of gas is passed through to our customers without markup therefore increases in the cost of gas are offset by a corresponding increase in revenues accordingly we believe gross profit is a better indicator of our financial performance than revenues however gross profit in our texas and mississippi service areas include franchise fees and gross receipts taxes which are calculated as a percentage of revenue inclusive of gas costs therefore the amount of these taxes included in revenues is influenced by the cost of gas and the level of gas sales volumes we record the tax expense as a component of taxes other than income although changes in revenuerelated taxes arising from changes in gas costs affect gross profit over time the impact is offset within operating income prior to january 1 2009 timing differences existed between the recognition of revenue for franchise fees collected from our customers and the recognition of expense of franchise taxes these timing differences had a significant temporary effect on operating income in periods with volatile gas prices particularly in our midtex division beginning january 1 2009 changes in our franchise fee agreements in our midtex division became effective which should significantly reduce the impact of this timing difference on a prospective basis although this timing difference will still be present for gross receipts taxes the timing differences described above should be less significant 

 

higher gas costs may also adversely impact our accounts receivable collections resulting in higher bad debt expense and may require us to increase borrowings under our credit facilities resulting in higher interest expense finally higher gas costs as well as competitive factors in the industry and general economic conditions may cause customers to conserve or use alternative energy sources 

review of financial and operating results 

 

financial and operational highlights for our natural gas distribution segment for the fiscal years ended september 30 2009 2008 and 2007 are presented below 

 

 

 

the following table shows our operating income by natural gas distribution division for the fiscal years ended september 30 2009 2008 and 2007 the presentation of our natural gas distribution operating income is included for financial reporting purposes and may not be appropriate for ratemaking purposes 

 

 

fiscal year ended september 30 2009 compared with fiscal year ended september 30 2008 

 

the 186 million increase in natural gas distribution gross profit primarily reflects an increase in rates the major components of the increase are as follows 

 

  

these increases were partially offset by 

 

  

operating expenses which include operation and maintenance expense provision for doubtful accounts depreciation and amortization expense taxes other than income and asset impairments decreased 93 million primarily due to the following 

 

  

these decreases were partially offset by 

 

  

results for the current year include a 105 million tax benefit associated with updating the rates used to determine our deferred taxes in addition results for the prior year included a 12 million gain on the sale of irrigation assets in our west texas division 

 

interest charges increased 61 million primarily due to the effect of the company’s march 2009 issuance of 450 million 850 senior notes to repay 400 million 400 senior notes in april 2009 in addition we experienced higher average shortterm debt balances interest rates and commitment fees during the current year compared to the prior year 

fiscal year ended september 30 2008 compared with fiscal year ended september 30 2007 

 

the 534 million increase in natural gas distribution gross profit is primarily the result of increased rates and higher revenuerelated taxes the major components of the increase are as follows 

 

  

operating expenses which include operation and maintenance expense provision for doubtful accounts depreciation and amortization expense and taxes other than income increased by a net 134 million primarily due to the following 

 

  

these increases were offset by a 32 million decrease in the provision for doubtful accounts which reflects our continued effective collection efforts 

 

the increase in miscellaneous income primarily reflects the recognition of a 12 million gain on the sale of irrigation assets in our west texas division during the fiscal 2008 second quarter 

 

interest charges allocated to the natural gas distribution segment decreased 37 million due to lower average outstanding shortterm debt balances in fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007 

 

regulated transmission and storage segment 

 

our regulated transmission and storage segment consists of the regulated pipeline and storage operations of the atmos pipeline — texas division the atmos pipeline — texas division transports natural gas to our midtex division and third parties and manages five underground storage reservoirs in texas we also provide ancillary services customary in the pipeline industry including parking arrangements lending and sales of inventory on hand 

 

similar to our natural gas distribution segment our regulated transmission and storage segment is impacted by seasonal weather patterns competitive factors in the energy industry and economic conditions in our service areas natural gas prices do not directly impact the results of this segment as revenues are derived from the transportation of natural gas however natural gas prices could influence the level of drilling activity in the markets that we serve which may influence the level of throughput we may be able to transport on our pipeline additionally pricing differences that occur between the natural gas hubs served by our pipeline could significantly impact our results as we can profit through the arbitrage of these spreads spread differences are influenced by supply and demand constraints not only in the markets we directly serve but in other markets as well further as the atmos pipeline — texas division operations supply all of the natural gas for our midtex division the results of this segment are highly dependent upon the natural gas requirements of the midtex division finally as a regulated pipeline the operations of the atmos pipeline — texas division may be impacted by the timing of when costs and expenses are incurred and when these costs and expenses are recovered through its tariffs 

review of financial and operating results 

 

financial and operational highlights for our regulated transmission and storage segment for the fiscal years ended september 30 2009 2008 and 2007 are presented below 

 

 

 

fiscal year ended september 30 2009 compared with fiscal year ended september 30 2008 

 

the 137 million increase in regulated transmission and storage gross profit was attributable primarily to the following factors 

 

  

these increases were partially offset by an 84 million decrease associated with a decrease in transportation volumes to our midtex division due to warmer weather and a decrease in electrical generation barnett shale and hub deliveries 

 

operating expenses increased 103 million primarily due to higher levels of pipeline maintenance activities 

 

results for the currentyear period also include a 17 million tax benefit associated with updating the rates used to determine our deferred taxes 

 

fiscal year ended september 30 2008 compared with fiscal year ended september 30 2007 

 

the 327 million increase in regulated transmission and storage gross profit is primarily the result of rate adjustments and increased volumes the major components of the increase are as follows 

 

 47 

 

  

operating expenses increased 228 million primarily due to increased pipeline integrity and maintenance costs 

 

natural gas marketing segment 

 

aem’s primary business is to aggregate and purchase gas supply arrange transportation and storage logistics and ultimately deliver gas to customers at competitive prices in addition aem utilizes proprietary and customerowned transportation and storage assets to provide various services our customers request including furnishing natural gas supplies at fixed and marketbased prices contract negotiation and administration load forecasting gas storage acquisition and management services transportation services peaking sales and balancing services capacity utilization strategies and gas price hedging through the use of financial instruments as a result aem’s margins arise from the types of commercial transactions we have structured with our customers and our ability to identify the lowest cost alternative among the natural gas supplies transportation and markets to which it has access to serve those customers 

 

aem seeks to enhance its gross profit margin by maximizing through asset optimization activities the economic value associated with the storage and transportation capacity we own or control in our natural gas distribution and natural gas marketing segments we attempt to meet this objective by engaging in natural gas storage transactions in which we seek to find and profit through the arbitrage of pricing differences in various locations and by recognizing pricing differences that occur over time this process involves purchasing physical natural gas storing it in the storage and transportation assets to which aem has access and selling financial instruments at advantageous prices to lock in a gross profit margin 

 

aem continually manages its net physical position to attempt to increase the future economic profit that was created when the original transaction was executed therefore aem may subsequently change its originally scheduled storage injection and withdrawal plans from one time period to another based on market conditions and recognize any associated gains or losses at that time if aem elects to accelerate the withdrawal of physical gas it will execute new financial instruments to hedge the original financial instruments if aem elects to defer the withdrawal of gas it will reset its financial instruments by settling the original financial instruments and executing new financial instruments to correspond to the revised withdrawal schedule 

 

we use financial instruments designated as fair value hedges to hedge our natural gas inventory used in our natural gas marketing storage activities these financial instruments are marked to market each month based upon the nymex price with changes in fair value recognized as unrealized gains and losses in the period of change the hedged natural gas inventory is marked to market at the end of each month based on the gas daily index with changes in fair value recognized as unrealized gains and losses in the period of change changes in the spreads between the forward natural gas prices used to value the financial hedges designated against our physical inventory and the market spot prices used to value our physical storage result in unrealized margins until the underlying physical gas is withdrawn and the related financial instruments are settled once the gas is withdrawn and the financial instruments are settled the previously unrealized margins associated with these net positions are realized 

 

aem also uses financial instruments to capture additional storage arbitrage opportunities that may arise after the original physical inventory hedge and to attempt to insulate and protect the economic value within its asset optimization activities changes in fair value associated with these financial instruments are recognized as a component of unrealized margins until they are settled 

 

due to the nature of these operations natural gas prices have a significant impact on our natural gas marketing operations within our delivered gas activities higher natural gas prices may adversely impact our 

accounts receivable collections resulting in higher bad debt expense and may require us to increase borrowings under our credit facilities resulting in higher interest expense higher gas prices as well as competitive factors in the industry and general economic conditions may also cause customers to conserve or use alternative energy sources within our asset optimization activities higher gas prices could also lead to increased borrowings under our credit facilities resulting in higher interest expense 

 

volatility in natural gas prices also has a significant impact on our natural gas marketing segment increased price volatility often has a significant impact on the spreads between the market spot prices and forward natural gas prices which creates opportunities to earn higher arbitrage spreads within our asset optimization activities however increased volatility impacts the amounts of unrealized margins recorded in our gross profit and could impact the amount of cash required to collateralize our risk management liabilities 

 

review of financial and operating results 

 

financial and operational highlights for our natural gas marketing segment for the fiscal years ended september 30 2009 2008 and 2007 are presented below gross profit margin consists primarily of margins earned from the delivery of gas and related services requested by our customers and margins earned from asset optimization activities which are derived from the utilization of our proprietary and managed third party storage and transportation assets to capture favorable arbitrage spreads through natural gas trading activities 

 

unrealized margins represent the unrealized gains or losses on our net physical position and the related financial instruments used to manage commodity price risk as described above these margins fluctuate based upon changes in the spreads between the physical and forward natural gas prices generally if the physicalfinancial spread narrows we will record unrealized gains or lower unrealized losses if the physicalfinancial spread widens we will record unrealized losses or lower unrealized gains the magnitude of the unrealized gains and losses is also dependent upon the levels of our net physical position at the end of the reporting period 

 

 

fiscal year ended september 30 2009 compared with fiscal year ended september 30 2008 

 

aem’s delivered gas business contributed 67 percent to total realized margins during fiscal 2009 with asset optimization activities contributing the remaining 33 percent in the prior year delivered gas activities represented substantially all of aem’s realized gross profit margin the 455 million increase in realized gross profit reflected 

 

  

the increase in realized gross profit was more than offset by a 539 million decrease in unrealized margins attributable to the following 

 

  

operating expenses which include operation and maintenance expense provision for doubtful accounts depreciation and amortization expense taxes other than income taxes and asset impairments increased 16 million primarily due the following factors 

 

  

asset optimization activities 

 

aem monitors the impact of its asset optimization efforts by estimating the gross profit before related fees that it captured through the purchase and sale of physical natural gas and the execution of the associated financial instruments this economic value combined with the effect of the future reversal of unrealized gains or losses currently recognized in the income statement and related fees is referred to as the potential gross profit 

 

we define potential gross profit as the change in aem’s gross profit in future periods if its optimization efforts are executed as planned this amount does not include other operating expenses and associated income taxes that will be incurred to realize this amount therefore it does not represent an estimated increase in future net income there is no assurance that the economic value or the potential gross profit will be fully realized in the future 

 

we consider this measure a nongaap financial measure as it is calculated using both forwardlooking storage injectionwithdrawal and hedge settlement estimates and historical financial information this measure is presented because we believe it provides a more comprehensive view to investors of our asset optimization efforts and thus a better understanding of these activities than would be presented by gaap measures alone 

the following table presents aem’s economic value and its potential gross profit loss at september 30 2009 and 2008 

 

 

 

 

  

during the year ended september 30 2009 aem’s economic value decreased from 485 million or 608mcf at september 30 2008 to 286 million or 207mcf as discussed above in the fiscal 2009 first quarter aem withdrew gas and realized substantially all of the economic value that it captured as of september 30 2008 during the remainder of the year as a result of falling current cash prices aem deferred certain storage withdrawals and has been a net injector of gas into storage to increase economic value that it can realize in future periods 

 

the economic value is based upon planned storage injection and withdrawal schedules and its realization is contingent upon the execution of this plan weather and other execution factors since aem actively manages and optimizes its portfolio to attempt to enhance the future profitability of its storage position it may change its scheduled storage injection and withdrawal plans from one time period to another based on market conditions therefore we cannot ensure that the economic value or the potential gross profit calculated as of september 30 2009 will be fully realized in the future nor can we ensure in what time periods such realization may occur further if we experience operational or other issues which limit our ability to optimally manage our stored gas positions our earnings could be adversely impacted assuming aem fully executes its plan in place on september 30 2009 without encountering operational or other issues we anticipate the majority of the potential gross profit as of september 30 2009 will be recognized during the first and second quarters of fiscal 2010 

 

fiscal year ended september 30 2008 compared with fiscal year ended september 30 2007 

 

aem’s delivered gas business represented substantially all of aem’s realized gross profit margin in fiscal 2008 in fiscal 2007 aem’s delivered gas business contributed 66 percent to total realized margins during the year with asset optimization activities contributing the remaining 34 percent the 184 million decrease in realized gross profit reflected 

 

 51 

  

the decrease in realized gross profit was partially offset by a 71 million increase in unrealized margins attributable to 

 

  

operating expenses increased 74 million primarily due to the following 

 

  

pipeline storage and other segment 

 

our pipeline storage and other segment consists primarily of the operations of atmos pipeline and storage llc aps aps is engaged in nonregulated transmission storage and natural gasgathering services its primary asset is a proprietary 21 mile pipeline located in new orleans louisiana that is primarily used to aggregate gas supply for our regulated natural gas distribution division in louisiana and for our natural gas marketing segment and on a more limited basis to third parties aps also owns or has an interest in underground storage fields in kentucky and louisiana that are used to reduce the need of our natural gas distribution divisions to contract for additional pipeline capacity to meet customer demand during peak periods 

 

aps also engages in asset optimization activities whereby it seeks to maximize the economic value associated with the storage and transportation capacity it owns or controls certain of these arrangements are with regulated affiliates of the company which have been approved by applicable state regulatory commissions generally these asset management plans require aps to share with our regulated customers a portion of the profits earned from these arrangements aps also seeks to maximize the economic value associated with the storage and transportation capacity it owns or controls by engaging in natural gas storage transactions in which we seek to find and profit from the pricing differences that occur over time 

 

results for this segment are primarily impacted by seasonal weather patterns and similar to our natural gas marketing segment volatility in the natural gas markets additionally this segment’s results include an unrealized component as aps hedges its risk associated with its asset optimization activities 

review of financial and operating results 

 

financial and operational highlights for our pipeline storage and other segment for the fiscal years ended september 30 2009 2008 and 2007 are presented below 

 

 

 

fiscal year ended september 30 2009 compared with fiscal year ended september 30 2008 

 

gross profit from our pipeline storage and other segment increased 12 million primarily due to the following 

 

  

operating expenses increased 30 million primarily due to increased employee costs and higher depreciation expense which was largely attributable to additional assets placed in service during the year 

 

fiscal year ended september 30 2008 compared with fiscal year ended september 30 2007 

 

gross profit from our pipeline storage and other segment decreased 43 million primarily due to the following factors 

 

  

operating expenses decreased 23 million primarily due to the absence in fiscal 2008 of a 30 million noncash charge recorded in fiscal 2007 related to the writeoff of costs associated with a natural gas gathering project 

 

liquidity and capital resources 

 

the liquidity required to fund our working capital capital expenditures and other cash needs is provided from a variety of sources including internally generated funds and borrowings under our commercial paper program and bank credit facilities additionally we have various uncommitted trade credit lines with our gas suppliers that we utilize to purchase natural gas on a monthly basis without using our credit facilities finally from time to time we raise funds from the public debt and equity capital markets to fund our liquidity needs 

the primary means we use to fund our working capital needs and growth is to utilize internally generated funds and to access the commercial paper markets adverse developments in global financial and credit markets during the first fiscal quarter of 2009 made it more difficult and more expensive for the company to access the shortterm capital markets including the commercial paper market to satisfy our liquidity requirements consequently during the first quarter we experienced higher than normal borrowings under our fiveyear credit facility used to backstop our commercial paper program in lieu of commercial paper borrowings to fund our working capital needs however subsequent to the end of the first quarter credit market conditions improved both as to availability and interest rates and we have been able to access the commercial paper markets on more reasonably economical terms further as a result of our financing activities described below we received credit rating upgrades from two of the three credit rating agencies which has reduced the cost of our commercial paper borrowings at september 30 2009 we had commercial paper outstanding of 726 million under this facility and 4941 million was available 

 

on march 26 2009 we closed our offering of 450 million of 850 senior notes due 2019 most of the net proceeds of approximately 446 million were used to redeem our 400 million 400 unsecured senior notes on april 30 2009 prior to their october 2009 maturity in connection with the repayment of the 400 million 400 unsecured senior notes we paid a 66 million call premium in accordance with the terms of the senior notes and accrued interest of approximately 06 million the remaining net proceeds were used for general corporate purposes 

 

in october 2009 we replaced our former 2125 million 364day committed credit facility that was entered into in october 2008 with a new 364day credit facility on similar terms that will allow borrowings up to 2000 million and expires in october 2010 

 

in december 2008 we converted aem’s former 580 million uncommitted credit facility to a 375 million committed credit facility that will expire in december 2009 effective april 1 2009 we exercised the accordion feature of this facility to increase the credit available under the facility to 450 million we are currently negotiating to renew this facility in addition we replaced our 18 million unsecured committed credit facility that expired in march 2009 with a 25 million unsecured facility effective april 1 2009 as a result of executing these new agreements we have a total of approximately 13 billion available to us under four committed credit facilities as of september 30 2009 the amount available to us under our credit facilities net of outstanding letters of credit was approximately 902 million 

 

we believe the liquidity provided by our committed credit facilities combined with our operating cash flows will be sufficient to fund our working capital needs capital expenditures and other expenditures for fiscal year 2010 

 

cash flows 

 

our internally generated funds may change in the future due to a number of factors some of which we cannot control these include regulatory changes the price for our services the demand for such products and services margin requirements resulting from significant changes in commodity prices operational risks and other factors 

 

cash flows from operating investing and financing activities for the years ended september 30 2009 2008 and 2007 are presented below 

 

 

cash flows from operating activities 

 

yearoveryear changes in our operating cash flows primarily are attributable to changes in net income working capital changes particularly within our natural gas distribution segment resulting from the price of natural gas and the timing of customer collections payments for natural gas purchases and purchased gas cost recoveries the significant factors impacting our operating cash flow for the last three fiscal years are summarized below 

 

fiscal year ended september 30 2009 compared with fiscal year ended september 30 2008 

 

operating cash flows were 5483 million higher in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 primarily due to the following 

 

  

fiscal year ended september 30 2008 compared with fiscal year ended september 30 2007 

 

operating cash flows were 1762 million lower in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 primarily due to the following 

 

  

cash flows from investing activities 

 

in recent fiscal years a substantial portion of our cash resources has been used to fund acquisitions and growth projects our ongoing construction program and improvements to information technology systems our ongoing construction program enables us to provide natural gas distribution services to our existing customer base expand our natural gas distribution services into new markets enhance the integrity of our pipelines and more recently expand our intrastate pipeline network in executing our current rate strategy we are focusing our capital spending in jurisdictions that permit us to earn an adequate return timely on our investment without compromising the safety or reliability of our system currently our midtex louisiana mississippi and west texas natural gas distribution divisions and our atmos pipeline — texas division have rate designs that provide the opportunity to include in their rate base approved capital costs on a periodic basis without being required to file a rate case 

 

for the fiscal year ended september 30 2009 we incurred 5095 million for capital expenditures compared with 4723 million for the fiscal year ended september 30 2008 and 3924 million for the fiscal year ended september 30 2007 

 

the increase in capital expenditures in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 primarily reflects 326 million related to spending for a regulated transmission pipeline project completed in the fourth quarter of 2009 

 

the increase in capital expenditures in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 primarily reflects the following 

 

 55 

 

cash flows from financing activities 

 

for the fiscal year ended september 30 2009 our financing activities used 3375 million in cash while financing activities for the fiscal year ended september 30 2008 provided 981 million in cash compared with cash of 1593 million used for the fiscal year ended september 30 2007 our significant financing activities for the fiscal years ended september 30 2009 2008 and 2007 are summarized as follows

the following table shows the number of shares issued for the fiscal years ended september 30 2009 2008 and 2007 

 

 

 

credit facilities 

 

as of september 30 2009 we had three committed credit facilities in our regulated operations totaling 8042 million these facilities included 1 a fiveyear 5667 million unsecured facility expiring december 2011 2 a 2125 million unsecured facility expiring october 2009 and 3 a 25 million unsecured facility expiring march 31 2010 at the time the 5667 million credit facility was established borrowings under the facility were limited to 600 million however in march 2009 the facility was amended to reduce the amount available to 5667 million to reflect the bankruptcy of one lender that participated in the facility in october 2009 we replaced our 2125 million facility at its termination with a new 200 million unsecured 364day facility after giving effect to these changes the amount available to us under our committed credit facilities was 7917 million as of september 30 2009 we had no outstanding letters of credit under these facilities 

 

aem has a committed credit facility that can provide up to 450 million to support its nonregulated activities primarily the issuance of letters of credit to natural gas suppliers as of september 30 2009 the amount available to us under this credit facility net of outstanding letters of credit was 1704 million our credit capacity and the amount of unused borrowing capacity are affected by the seasonal nature of the natural gas business and our shortterm borrowing requirements which are typically highest during colder winter months 

 

our working capital needs can vary significantly due to changes in the price of natural gas charged by suppliers and the increased gas supplies required to meet customers’ needs during periods of cold weather however we believe these credit facilities combined with our operating cash flows will be sufficient to fund our working capital needs our fiscal 2010 capital expenditure program and our common stock dividends these facilities are described in further detail in note 6 to the consolidated financial statements 

 

shelf registration 

 

on march 23 2009 we filed a registration statement with the securities and exchange commission sec to issue from time to time up to 900 million in common stock andor debt securities available for issuance including approximately 450 million of capacity carried over from our prior shelf registration statement filed with the sec in december 2006 immediately following the filing of the registration statement we issued 450 million of 850 senior notes due 2019 under the registration statement most of the net proceeds of approximately 446 million were used to repay our 400 million unsecured 400 senior notes on april 30 2009 as of september 30 2009 we had 450 million of availability remaining under the registration statement however due to certain restrictions placed by one state regulatory commission on our ability to issue securities under the registration statement we now have remaining and available for issuance a total of approximately 200 million of equity securities and 250 million of debt securities 

credit ratings 

 

our credit ratings directly affect our ability to obtain shortterm and longterm financing in addition to the cost of such financing in determining our credit ratings the rating agencies consider a number of quantitative factors including debt to total capitalization operating cash flow relative to outstanding debt operating cash flow coverage of interest and pension liabilities and funding status in addition the rating agencies consider qualitative factors such as consistency of our earnings over time the quality of our management and business strategy the risks associated with our regulated and nonregulated businesses and the regulatory structures that govern our rates in the states where we operate 

 

our debt is rated by three rating agencies standard  poor’s corporation sp moody’s investors services inc moody’s and fitch ratings ltd fitch in december 2008 sp upgraded our senior longterm debt credit rating from bbb to bbb and changed our rating outlook from positive to stable sp cited improved financial performance and rate case decisions that have increased cash flow as the key drivers for the upgrade in may 2009 moody’s upgraded the credit rating on our senior longterm debt from baa3 to baa2 and on our commercial paper from p3 to p2 moody’s stated that the key drivers for the upgrade were the completion of a major debt refinancing and the company improving its alternate liquidity resources while maintaining solid financial performance as of september 30 2009 all three rating agencies maintained a stable outlook none of our ratings are currently under review our current debt ratings are all considered investment grade and are as follows 

 

 

 

a significant reduction in our liquidity caused by more limited access to the private and public credit markets as a result of the recent adverse global financial and credit conditions could trigger a negative change in our ratings outlook or even a reduction in our credit ratings by the three credit rating agencies this would mean more limited access to the private and public credit markets and an increase in the costs of such borrowings 

 

a credit rating is not a recommendation to buy sell or hold securities the highest investment grade credit rating for sp is aaa moody’s is aaa and fitch is aaa the lowest investment grade credit rating for sp is bbb moody’s is baa3 and fitch is bbb our credit ratings may be revised or withdrawn at any time by the rating agencies and each rating should be evaluated independent of any other rating there can be no assurance that a rating will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if in its judgment circumstances so warrant 

 

debt covenants 

 

we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants as of september 30 2009 our debt covenants are described in note 6 to the consolidated financial statements 

 

capitalization 

 

the following table presents our capitalization as of september 30 2009 and 2008 

 

 

total debt as a percentage of total capitalization including shortterm debt was 507 percent and 546 percent at september 30 2009 and 2008 the decrease in the debt to capitalization ratio primarily reflects a decrease in shortterm debt as of september 30 2009 compared to the prior year our ratio of total debt to capitalization is typically greater during the winter heating season as we make additional shortterm borrowings to fund natural gas purchases and meet our working capital requirements we consider our optimal capitalization ratio to be in the range of 50 to 55 percent and seek to maintain this range through cash flow generated from operations continued issuance of new common stock under our direct stock purchase plan and retirement savings plan and access to the equity capital markets 

 

contractual obligations and commercial commitments 

 

the following table provides information about contractual obligations and commercial commitments at september 30 2009 

 

 

 

 

 59 

 

aem has commitments to purchase physical quantities of natural gas under contracts indexed to the forward nymex strip or fixed price contracts at september 30 2009 aem was committed to purchase 726 bcf within one year 194 bcf within one to three years and 22 bcf after three years under indexed contracts aem was committed to purchase 29 bcf within one year under fixed price contracts with prices ranging from 295 to 768 per mcf 

 

with the exception of our midtex division our natural gas distribution segment maintains supply contracts with several vendors that generally cover a period of up to one year commitments for estimated base gas volumes are established under these contracts on a monthly basis at contractually negotiated prices commitments for incremental daily purchases are made as necessary during the month in accordance with the terms of the individual contract our midtex division maintains longterm supply contracts to ensure a reliable source of gas for our customers in its service area which obligate it to purchase specified volumes at market prices the estimated commitments under these contract terms as of september 30 2009 are reflected in the table above 

 

risk management activities 

 

we use financial instruments to mitigate commodity price risk and periodically to manage interest rate risk we conduct risk management activities through our natural gas distribution natural gas marketing and pipeline storage and other segments in our natural gas distribution segment we use a combination of physical storage fixed physical contracts and fixed financial contracts to reduce our exposure to unusually large winterperiod gas price increases in our natural gas marketing and pipeline storage and other segments we manage our exposure to the risk of natural gas price changes and lock in our gross profit margin through a combination of storage and financial instruments including futures overthecounter and exchangetraded options and swap contracts with counterparties to the extent our inventory cost and actual sales and actual purchases do not correlate with the changes in the market indices we use in our hedges we could experience ineffectiveness or the hedges may no longer meet the accounting requirements for hedge accounting resulting in the financial instruments being treated as mark to market instruments through earnings 

 

we use financial instruments designated as cash flow hedges of anticipated purchases and sales at index prices to mitigate the commodity price risk in our natural gas marketing segment associated with deliveries under fixedpriced forward contracts to deliver gas to customers and we use financial instruments designated as fair value hedges to hedge our natural gas inventory used in our asset optimization activities in our natural gas marketing and pipeline storage and other segments 

 

also in our natural gas marketing segment we use storage swaps and futures to capture additional storage arbitrage opportunities that arise subsequent to the execution of the original fair value hedge associated with our physical natural gas inventory basis swaps to insulate and protect the economic value of our fixed price and storage books and various overthecounter and exchangetraded options these financial instruments have not been designated as hedges 

 

we record our financial instruments as a component of risk management assets and liabilities which are classified as current or noncurrent based upon the anticipated settlement date of the underlying financial instrument substantially all of our financial instruments are valued using external market quotes and indices 

 

the following table shows the components of the change in fair value of our natural gas distribution segment’s financial instruments for the fiscal year ended september 30 2009 in thousands

pension and postretirement benefits obligations 

 

net periodic pension and postretirement benefit costs 

 

for the fiscal year ended september 30 2009 our total net periodic pension and other benefits costs was 502 million compared with 479 million and 486 million for the fiscal years ended september 30 2008 and 2007 these costs relating to our natural gas distribution operations are recoverable through our gas distribution rates a portion of these costs is capitalized into our gas distribution rate base and the remaining costs are recorded as a component of operation and maintenance expense 

 

the increase in total net periodic pension and other benefits costs during fiscal 2009 compared with fiscal 2008 primarily reflects the change in assumptions we made during our annual pension plan valuation completed september 30 2008 the discount rate used to compute the present value of a plan’s liabilities generally is based on rates of highgrade corporate bonds with maturities similar to the average period over which the benefits will be paid at our september 30 2008 measurement date the interest rates were approximately 130 basis points higher than the interest rates at june 30 2007 the measurement date used to determine our fiscal 2008 net periodic cost the corresponding increase in the discount rate was the primary 

driver for the increase in our fiscal 2009 pension and benefit costs our expected return on our pension plan assets remained constant at 825 percent 

 

the periodic pension and other benefits costs remained relatively unchanged during fiscal 2008 compared with fiscal 2007 as the assumptions we made during our annual pension plan valuation completed june 30 2007 were consistent with the prior year at our june 30 2007 measurement date the interest rates were consistent with rates at our prioryear measurement date which resulted in no change to our 630 percent discount rate used to determine our fiscal 2008 net periodic and postretirement cost in addition our expected return on our pension plan assets remained constant at 825 percent 

 

pension and postretirement plan funding 

 

generally our funding policy is to contribute annually an amount that will at least equal the minimum amount required to comply with the employee retirement income security act of 1974 including the funding requirements under the pension protection act of 2006 ppa however additional voluntary contributions are made from time to time as considered necessary contributions are intended to provide not only for benefits attributed to service to date but also for those expected to be earned in the future 

 

during fiscal 2009 we contributed 210 million in cash to our pension plans to achieve a desired level of funding for the 2008 plan year while maximizing the tax deductibility of this payment the need for this funding reflected the decline in the fair value of the plans’ assets resulting from the unfavorable market conditions experienced during the latter half of calendar year 2008 this contribution increased the level of our plan assets to achieve a desirable funding threshold as established by the ppa during fiscal 2008 we voluntarily contributed 23 million to the atmos energy corporation retirement plan for mississippi valley gas union employees this contribution achieved a desired level of funding for this plan for the 2007 plan year during fiscal 2007 we did not contribute to our pension plans 

 

we contributed 101 million 96 million and 118 million to our postretirement benefits plans for the fiscal years ended september 30 2009 2008 and 2007 the contributions represent the portion of the postretirement costs we are responsible for under the terms of our plan and minimum funding required by state regulatory commissions 

 

outlook for fiscal 2010 

 

as of september 30 2009 interest and corporate bond rates utilized to determine our discount rates which impacted our fiscal 2010 net periodic pension and postretirement costs were lower than the interest and corporate bond rates as of september 30 2008 the measurement date for our fiscal 2009 net periodic cost as a result of the lower interest and corporate bond rates we decreased the discount rate used to determine our fiscal 2010 pension and benefit costs to 552 percent we maintained the expected return on our pension plan assets at 825 percent despite the recent decline in the financial markets as we believe this rate reflects the average rate of expected earnings on plan assets that will fund our projected benefit obligation although the fair value of our plan assets has declined as the financial markets have declined the impact of this decline is mitigated by the fact that assets are smoothed for purposes of determining net periodic pension cost which results in asset gains and losses that are recognized over time as a component of net periodic pension and benefit costs for our pension account plan our largest funded plan accordingly we expect our fiscal 2010 pension and postretirement medical costs to be materially the same as in fiscal 2009 based upon market conditions subsequent to september 30 2009 the current funded position of the plans and the new funding requirements under the ppa we believe it is reasonably possible that we will be required to contribute to the plans in fiscal 2010 further we will consider whether an additional voluntary contribution is prudent to maintain certain ppa funding thresholds however we cannot anticipate with certainty whether such contributions will be made and the amount of such contributions with respect to our postretirement medical plans we anticipate contributing approximately 122 million during fiscal 2010 

 

as of september 30 2009 the board of directors approved a change to the cost sharing methodology for employees who had not met the participation requirements by that date for the retiree medical plan for retirees and disabled employees of atmos energy corporation the “retiree medical plan” starting in five 

years on january 1 2015 the contribution rates that will apply to all nongrandfathered participants will be determined using a new cost sharing methodology by which atmos energy will limit its contribution to a three percent cost increase in claims and administrative costs each year if medical costs covered by the retiree medical plan increase more than three percent annually participants will be responsible for the additional cost 

 

during the last fiscal year the company has worked with our independent compensation consultant to develop and implement a new serp design for any new executives or current employees selected for participation in the serp arrangement on a prospective basis only those executives who are currently members of our management committee as well as those individuals who may be selected in the future to serve on the management committee plus those executives who are active serp participants as of august 5 2009 will continue to participate in the current serp arrangement until their respective retirement dates the current serp arrangement is a 60 percent of covered compensation defined benefit arrangement in which benefits from the underlying qualified defined benefit plan are an offset to the serp benefit the new serp arrangement for new participants in the company’s executive retirement program is a modified defined benefit approach in which the company will contribute to a nominal account for each participant an amount equal to ten percent of each participant’s base salary and bonus following the participant’s completion of a plan year of service other provisions of the plan mirror that of the company’s underlying qualified plan the pension account plan at this time only one employee has been selected for participation in the new serp arrangement 

 

the projected pension liability future funding requirements and the amount of pension expense or income recognized for the plan are subject to change depending upon the actuarial value of plan assets and the determination of future benefit obligations as of each subsequent actuarial calculation date these amounts are impacted by actual investment returns changes in interest rates and changes in the demographic composition of the participants in the plan

we conduct risk management activities through both our natural gas distribution and natural gas marketing segments in our natural gas distribution segment we use a combination of physical storage fixed physical contracts and fixed financial contracts to protect us and our customers against unusually large winter period gas price increases in our natural gas marketing segment we manage our exposure to the risk of natural gas price changes and lock in our gross profit margin through a combination of storage and financial instruments including futures overthecounter and exchangetraded options and swap contracts with counterparties our risk management activities and related accounting treatment are described in further detail in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements additionally our earnings are affected by changes in shortterm interest rates as a result of our issuance of shortterm commercial paper and our other shortterm borrowings 

 

commodity price risk 

 

natural gas distribution segment 

 

we purchase natural gas for our natural gas distribution operations substantially all of the costs of gas purchased for natural gas distribution operations are recovered from our customers through purchased gas cost 

adjustment mechanisms therefore our natural gas distribution operations have limited commodity price risk exposure 

 

natural gas marketing and pipeline storage and other segments 

 

our natural gas marketing segment is also exposed to risks associated with changes in the market price of natural gas for our natural gas marketing segment we use a sensitivity analysis to estimate commodity price risk for purposes of this analysis we estimate commodity price risk by applying a 050 change in the forward nymex price to our net open position including existing storage and related financial contracts at the end of each period based on aeh’s net open position including existing storage and related financial contracts at september 30 2009 of 04 bcf a 050 change in the forward nymex price would have had a 02 million impact on our consolidated net income 

 

changes in the difference between the indices used to mark to market our physical inventory gas daily and the related fairvalue hedge nymex can result in volatility in our reported net income but over time gains and losses on the sale of storage gas inventory will be offset by gains and losses on the fairvalue hedges based upon our net physical position at september 30 2009 and assuming our hedges would still qualify as highly effective a 050 change in the difference between the gas daily and nymex indices would impact our reported net income by approximately 52 million 

 

additionally these changes could cause us to recognize a risk management liability which would require us to place cash into an escrow account to collateralize this liability position this in turn would reduce the amount of cash we would have on hand to fund our working capital needs 

 

interest rate risk 

 

our earnings are exposed to changes in shortterm interest rates associated with our shortterm commercial paper program and other shortterm borrowings we use a sensitivity analysis to estimate our shortterm interest rate risk for purposes of this analysis we estimate our shortterm interest rate risk as the difference between our actual interest expense for the period and estimated interest expense for the period assuming a hypothetical average one percent increase in the interest rates associated with our shortterm borrowings had interest rates associated with our shortterm borrowings increased by an average of one percent our interest expense would have increased by approximately 37 million during 2009 

 

as of september 30 2009 we were not engaged in other activities that would cause exposure to the risk of material earnings or cash flow loss due to changes in interest rates or market commodity prices

overview and strategy 

 

atmos energy corporation headquartered in dallas texas is engaged primarily in the regulated natural gas distribution and transmission and storage businesses as well as other nonregulated natural gas businesses since our incorporation in texas in 1983 we have grown primarily through a series of acquisitions the most recent of which was the acquisition in october 2004 of the natural gas distribution and pipeline operations of txu gas company we are also incorporated in the state of virginia 

 

today we distribute natural gas through regulated sales and transportation arrangements to approximately 32 million residential commercial public authority and industrial customers in 12 states located primarily in the south which makes us one of the country’s largest naturalgasonly distributors based on number of customers we also operate one of the largest intrastate pipelines in texas based on miles of pipe 

 

through our nonregulated businesses we primarily provide natural gas management and marketing services to municipalities other local gas distribution companies and industrial customers primarily in the midwest and southeast and natural gas transportation along with storage services to certain of our natural gas distribution divisions and third parties 

 

our overall strategy is to 

 

  

we have experienced more than 20 consecutive years of increasing dividends and earnings growth after giving effect to our acquisitions historically we achieved this record of growth through acquisitions while efficiently managing our operating and maintenance expenses and leveraging our technology such as our 24hour call centers to achieve more efficient operations in recent years we have also achieved growth by implementing rate designs that reduce or eliminate regulatory lag and separate the recovery of our approved margins from customer usage patterns in addition we have developed various commercial opportunities within our regulated transmission and storage operations finally we have strengthened our nonregulated businesses by increasing sales volumes and actively pursuing opportunities to increase the amount of storage available to us 

 

our core values include focusing on our employees and customers while conducting our business with honesty and integrity we continue to strengthen our culture through ongoing communications with our employees and enhanced employee training 

 

operating segments 

 

we operate the company through the following four segments 

 

 4 

 

  

these operating segments are described in greater detail below 

 

natural gas distribution segment overview 

 

our natural gas distribution segment consists of the following six regulated divisions in order of total customers served covering service areas in 12 states 

 

  

our natural gas distribution business is a seasonal business gas sales to residential and commercial customers are greater during the winter months than during the remainder of the year the volumes of gas sales during the winter months will vary with the temperatures during these months 

 

revenues in this operating segment are established by regulatory authorities in the states in which we operate these rates are intended to be sufficient to cover the costs of conducting business and to provide a reasonable return on invested capital our primary service areas are located in colorado kansas kentucky louisiana mississippi tennessee and texas we have more limited service areas in georgia illinois iowa missouri and virginia in addition we transport natural gas for others through our distribution system 

 

rates established by regulatory authorities often include cost adjustment mechanisms that i are subject to significant price fluctuations compared to our other costs ii represent a large component of our cost of service and iii are generally outside our control 

 

purchased gas mechanisms represent a common form of cost adjustment mechanism purchased gas adjustment mechanisms provide natural gas utility companies a method of recovering purchased gas costs on an ongoing basis without filing a rate case because they provide a dollarfordollar offset to increases or decreases in natural gas distribution gas costs therefore although substantially all of our natural gas distribution operating revenues fluctuate with the cost of gas that we purchase natural gas distribution gross profit which is defined as operating revenues less purchased gas cost is generally not affected by fluctuations in the cost of gas 

 

additionally some jurisdictions have introduced performancebased ratemaking adjustments to provide incentives to natural gas utilities to minimize purchased gas costs through improved storage management and use of financial instruments to lock in gas costs under the performancebased ratemaking adjustment purchased gas costs savings are shared between the utility and its customers 

 

finally regulatory authorities for over 90 percent of residential and commercial meters in our service areas have approved weather normalization adjustments wna as a part of our rates wna minimizes the effect of weather that is above or below normal by allowing us to increase customers’ bills to offset lower gas usage when weather is warmer than normal and decrease customers’ bills to offset higher gas usage when weather is colder than normal 

as of september 30 2008 we had wna for our residential and commercial meters in the following service areas for the following periods 

 

 

 

in addition to seasonality financial results for this segment are affected by the cost of natural gas and economic conditions in the areas that we serve higher gas costs which we are generally able to pass through to our customers under purchased gas adjustment clauses may cause customers to conserve or in the case of industrial customers to use alternative energy sources higher gas costs may also adversely impact our accounts receivable collections resulting in higher bad debt expense and may require us to increase borrowings under our credit facilities resulting in higher interest expense 

 

our supply of natural gas is provided by a variety of suppliers including independent producers marketers and pipeline companies and withdrawals of gas from proprietary and contracted storage assets additionally the natural gas supply for our midtex division includes peaking and spot purchase agreements 

 

supply arrangements are contracted from our suppliers on a firm basis with various terms at market prices the firm supply consists of both base load and swing supply peaking quantities base load quantities are those that flow at a constant level throughout the month and swing supply quantities provide the flexibility to change daily quantities to match increases or decreases in requirements related to weather conditions 

 

currently all of our natural gas distribution divisions except for our midtex division utilize 37 pipeline transportation companies both interstate and intrastate to transport our natural gas the pipeline transportation agreements are firm and many of them have “pipeline nonotice” storage service which provides for daily balancing between system requirements and nominated flowing supplies these agreements have been negotiated with the shortest term necessary while still maintaining our right of first refusal the natural gas supply for our midtex division is delivered by our atmos pipeline — texas division 

 

except for local production purchases we select our natural gas suppliers through a competitive bidding process by requesting proposals from suppliers that have demonstrated that they can provide reliable service we select these suppliers based on their ability to deliver gas supply to our designated firm pipeline receipt points at the lowest cost major suppliers during fiscal 2008 were anadarko energy services bp energy company chesapeake energy marketing inc conocophillips company devon gas services lp enbridge marketing us lp national fuel marketing company llc oneok energy services company lp tenaska marketing and atmos energy marketing llc our natural gas marketing subsidiary 

 

the combination of base load peaking and spot purchase agreements coupled with the withdrawal of gas held in storage allows us the flexibility to adjust to changes in weather which minimizes our need to enter into longterm firm commitments we estimate our peakday availability of natural gas supply to be approximately 42 bcf the peakday demand for our natural gas distribution operations in fiscal 2008 was on january 2 2008 when sales to customers reached approximately 31 bcf 

 

to maintain our deliveries to high priority customers we have the ability and have exercised our right to curtail deliveries to certain customers under the terms of interruptible contracts or applicable state statutes or regulations our customers’ demand on our system is not necessarily indicative of our ability to meet current or anticipated market demands or immediate delivery requirements because of factors such as the physical limitations of gathering storage and transmission systems the duration and severity of cold weather the availability of gas reserves from our suppliers the ability to purchase additional supplies on a shortterm basis 

and actions by federal and state regulatory authorities curtailment rights provide us the flexibility to meet the humanneeds requirements of our customers on a firm basis priority allocations imposed by federal and state regulatory agencies as well as other factors beyond our control may affect our ability to meet the demands of our customers we anticipate no problems with obtaining additional gas supply as needed for our customers 

 

the following briefly describes our six natural gas distribution divisions we operate in our service areas under terms of nonexclusive franchise agreements granted by the various cities and towns that we serve at september 30 2008 we held 1107 franchises having terms generally ranging from five to 35 years a significant number of our franchises expire each year which require renewal prior to the end of their terms we believe that we will be able to renew our franchises as they expire additional information concerning our natural gas distribution divisions is presented under the caption “operating statistics” 

 

atmos energy midtex division our midtex division serves approximately 550 incorporated and unincorporated communities in the northcentral eastern and western parts of texas including the dallasfort worth metroplex the governing body of each municipality we serve has original jurisdiction over all gas distribution rates operations and services within its city limits except with respect to sales of natural gas for vehicle fuel and agricultural use the railroad commission of texas rrc has exclusive appellate jurisdiction over all rate and regulatory orders and ordinances of the municipalities and exclusive original jurisdiction over rates and services to customers not located within the limits of a municipality 

 

prior to fiscal 2008 this division operated under one systemwide rate structure however beginning in 2008 we reached a settlement with cities representing approximately 80 percent of this division’s customers settled cities that will allow us to update rates for customers in these cities through an annual rate review mechanism rates for the remaining 20 percent of this division’s customers including the city of dallas continue to be updated through periodic formal rate proceedings and filings made under texas’ gas reliability infrastructure program grip grip allows us to include in our rate base annually approved capital costs incurred in the prior calendar year provided that we file a complete rate case at least once every five years 

 

atmos energy kentuckymidstates division our kentuckymidstates division operates in more than 420 communities across georgia illinois iowa kentucky missouri tennessee and virginia the service areas in these states are primarily rural however this division serves franklin tennessee and other suburban areas of nashville we update our rates in this division through periodic formal rate filings made with each state’s public service commission 

 

atmos energy louisiana division in louisiana we serve nearly 300 communities including the suburban areas of new orleans the metropolitan area of monroe and western louisiana direct sales of natural gas to industrial customers in louisiana who use gas for fuel or in manufacturing processes and sales of natural gas for vehicle fuel are exempt from regulation and are recognized in our natural gas marketing segment our rates in this division are updated annually through a stable rate filing without filing a formal rate case 

 

atmos energy west texas division our west texas division serves approximately 80 communities in west texas including the amarillo lubbock and midland areas like our midtex division each municipality we serve has original jurisdiction over all gas distribution rates operations and services within its city limits with the rrc having exclusive appellate jurisdiction over the municipalities and exclusive original jurisdiction over rates and services provided to customers not located within the limits of a municipality prior to fiscal 2008 rates were updated in this division through formal rate proceedings however during 2008 the west texas division entered into agreements with its lubbock and west texas service areas to update rates for customers in these service areas through an annual rate review mechanism rates for the division’s amarillo service area continue to be updated through periodic formal rate proceedings and filings made under grip 

 

atmos energy mississippi division in mississippi we serve about 110 communities throughout the northern half of the state including the jackson metropolitan area our rates in the mississippi division are updated annually through a stable rate filing without filing a formal rate case 

atmos energy coloradokansas division our coloradokansas division serves approximately 170 communities throughout colorado and kansas and parts of missouri including the cities of olathe kansas a suburb of kansas city and greeley colorado a suburb of denver we update our rates in this division through periodic formal rate filings made with each state’s public service commission

regulated transmission and storage segment overview 

 

our regulated transmission and storage segment consists of the regulated pipeline and storage operations of our atmos pipeline — texas division this division transports natural gas to our midtex division transports natural gas for third parties and manages five underground storage reservoirs in texas we also provide ancillary services customary in the pipeline industry including parking arrangements lending and sales of inventory on hand parking arrangements provide shortterm interruptible storage of gas on our pipeline lending services provide shortterm interruptible loans of natural gas from our pipeline to meet market demands these operations represent one of the largest intrastate pipeline operations in texas with a heavy concentration in the established natural gasproducing areas of central northern and eastern texas extending into or near the major producing areas of the texas gulf coast and the delaware and val verde basins of west texas nine basins located in texas are believed to contain a substantial portion of the nation’s remaining onshore natural gas reserves this pipeline system provides access to all of these basins gross profit earned from our midtex division and through certain other transportation and storage services is subject to traditional ratemaking governed by the rrc however atmos pipeline — texas’ existing regulatory mechanisms allow certain transportation and storage services to be provided under marketbased rates with minimal regulation

natural gas marketing segment overview 

 

our natural gas marketing activities are conducted through atmos energy marketing aem which is whollyowned by atmos energy holdings inc aeh aeh is a whollyowned subsidiary of aec and operates primarily in the midwest and southeast areas of the united states aem aggregates and purchases gas supply arranges transportation and storage logistics and ultimately delivers gas to customers at competitive prices to facilitate this process we utilize proprietary and customerowned transportation and storage assets to provide various services our customers request including furnishing natural gas supplies at fixed and marketbased prices contract negotiation and administration load forecasting gas storage acquisition and management services transportation services peaking sales and balancing services capacity utilization strategies and gas price hedging through the use of financial instruments as a result our revenues arise from the types of commercial transactions we have structured with our customers and include the value we extract by optimizing the storage and transportation capacity we own or control as well as revenues for services we deliver 

 

our asset optimization activities seek to maximize the economic value associated with the storage and transportation capacity we own or control we attempt to meet this objective by engaging in natural gas storage transactions in which we seek to find and profit from the pricing differences that occur over time we 

purchase physical natural gas and then sell financial instruments at advantageous prices to lock in a gross profit margin we also seek to participate in transactions in which we combine the natural gas commodity and transportation costs to minimize our costs incurred to serve our customers by identifying the lowest cost alternative within the natural gas supplies transportation and markets to which we have access through the use of transportation and storage services and financial instruments we are able to capture gross profit margin through the arbitrage of pricing differences in various locations and by recognizing pricing differences that occur over time 

 

aem’s management of natural gas requirements involves the sale of natural gas and the management of storage and transportation supplies under contracts with customers generally having one to two year terms aem also sells natural gas to some of its industrial customers on a delivered burner tip basis under contract terms ranging from 30 days to two years

pipeline storage and other segment overview 

 

our pipeline storage and other segment primarily consists of the operations of atmos pipeline and storage llc aps atmos energy services llc aes and atmos power systems inc which are each whollyowned by aeh 

 

aps owns and operates a 21 mile pipeline located in new orleans louisiana this pipeline is primarily used to aggregate gas supply for our regulated natural gas distribution division in louisiana and for aem however it also provides limited third party transportation services aps also owns or has an interest in underground storage fields in kentucky and louisiana we use these storage facilities to reduce the need to contract for additional pipeline capacity to meet customer demand during peak periods finally beginning in fiscal 2006 aps initiated activities in the natural gas gathering business as of september 30 2008 these activities were limited in nature 

 

aps also engages in limited asset optimization activities whereby it seeks to maximize the economic value associated with the storage and transportation capacity it owns or controls most of these arrangements are with regulated affiliates of the company and have been approved by applicable state regulatory commissions generally these arrangements require aps to share with our regulated customers a portion of the profits earned from these arrangements 

 

aes through december 31 2006 provided natural gas management services to our natural gas distribution operations other than the midtex division these services included aggregating and purchasing gas supply arranging transportation and storage logistics and ultimately delivering the gas to our natural gas distribution service areas at competitive prices effective january 1 2007 our shared services function began 

providing these services to our natural gas distribution operations aes continues to provide limited services to our natural gas distribution divisions and the revenues aes receives are equal to the costs incurred to provide those services 

 

through atmos power systems inc we have constructed electric peaking powergenerating plants and associated facilities and lease these plants through lease agreements that are accounted for as sales under generally accepted accounting principles

ratemaking activity 

 

overview 

 

the method of determining regulated rates varies among the states in which our natural gas distribution divisions operate the regulatory authorities have the responsibility of ensuring that utilities in their jurisdictions operate in the best interests of customers while providing utility companies the opportunity to earn a reasonable return on their investment generally each regulatory authority reviews rate requests and establishes a rate structure intended to generate revenue sufficient to cover the costs of conducting business and to provide a reasonable return on invested capital 

 

our current rate strategy is to focus on reducing or eliminating regulatory lag obtaining adequate returns and providing stable predictable margins atmos energy has annual ratemaking mechanisms in place in three states that provide for an annual rate review and adjustment to rates for approximately 65 percent of our customers additionally we have wna mechanisms in eight states these mechanisms work in tandem to provide insulation from volatile margins both for the company and our customers 

 

we will also continue to address various rate design changes including the recovery of bad debt gas costs inclusion of other taxes in gas costs and stratification of rates to benefit low income households in future rate filings these design changes would address cost variations that are related to passthrough energy costs beyond our control 

 

improving rate design is a longterm process in the interim we are addressing regulatory lag issues by directing discretionary capital spending to jurisdictions where recovery rules minimize the regulatory lag which helps us to keep actual returns more closely aligned with allowed returns 

recent ratemaking activity 

 

approximately 97 percent of our natural gas distribution revenues in the fiscal years ended september 30 2008 2007 and 2006 were derived from sales at rates set by or subject to approval by local or state authorities net annual revenue increases resulting from ratemaking activity totaling 345 million 401 million and 390 million became effective in fiscal 2008 2007 and 2006 as summarized below 

 

 

 

additionally the following ratemaking efforts were initiated during fiscal 2008 but had not been completed as of september 30 2008 

 

 

 

 

 16 

 

our recent ratemaking activity is discussed in greater detail below 

 

rate case filings 

 

a rate case is a formal request from atmos energy to a regulatory authority to increase rates that are charged to customers rate cases may also be initiated when the regulatory authorities request us to justify our rates this process is referred to as a “show cause” action adequate rates are intended to provide for recovery of the company’s costs as well as a fair rate of return to our shareholders and ensure that we continue to deliver reliable reasonably priced natural gas service to our customers the following table summarizes our recent rate cases 

 

 

 

 

 17 

  

grip filings 

 

as discussed above in “natural gas distribution segment overview” grip allows natural gas utility companies the opportunity to include in their rate base annually approved capital costs incurred in the prior calendar year the following table summarizes our grip filings with effective dates during the fiscal years ended september 30 2008 2007 and 2006 

 

 

 

 

  

annual rate filing mechanisms 

 

as an instrument to reduce regulatory lag annual rate filing mechanisms allow us to refresh our rates on a periodic basis without filing a formal rate case however these filings still involve discovery by the appropriate regulatory authorities prior to the final determination of rates under these mechanisms as discussed above in “natural gas distribution segment overview” we currently have annual rate filing mechanisms in our louisiana and mississippi divisions and in significant portions of our midtex and west texas divisions these mechanisms are referred to as rate review mechanisms in our midtex and west texas 

divisions and stable rate filings in our louisiana and mississippi divisions the following table summarizes filings made under our various annual rate filing mechanisms 

 

 

 

the rate review mechanism in the midtex division was entered into as a result of a settlement in the september 20 2007 statement of intent case filed with all midtex division cities of the 439 incorporated cities served by the midtex division 438 of these cities are part of the rate review mechanism process the west texas rate review mechanism was entered into in august 2008 as a result of a settlement with the west texas coalition of cities the lubbock customer conservation value plan ccvp was entered into in may 2008 as a result of a settlement to resolve ongoing rate issues all three mechanisms have been implemented under a three year trial basis beginning in fiscal 2009 based upon calendar 2007 financial information 

 

other ratemaking activity 

 

the following table summarizes other ratemaking activity during the fiscal years ended september 30 2008 2007 and 2006 

 

 

 

see footnotes on the following page 

 

  

in addition to the activity above in december 2006 the louisiana public service commission issued a staff report allowing the deferral of 43 million in operating and maintenance expenses in our louisiana division to allow recovery of all incremental operation and maintenance expense incurred in fiscal 2005 and 2006 in connection with our hurricane katrina recovery efforts 

 

in september 2006 our midtex division filed its annual gas cost reconciliation with the rrc the filing reflects approximately 24 million in refunds of amounts that were overcollected from customers between july 2005 and june 2006 the midtex division received approval to refund these amounts over a sixmonth period which began in november 2006 the ruling had no impact on the gross profit for the midtex division 

 

in may 2007 our midtex division filed a 36month gas contract review filing this filing is mandated by prior rrc orders and relates to the prudency of gas purchases made from november 2003 through october 2006 which total approximately 27 billion an agreedupon procedural schedule was filed with the rrc which established a hearing schedule beginning in december 2007 in july 2008 the city of dallas filed testimony recommending a disallowance of approximately 58 million and the acsc coalition of cities filed testimony recommending a disallowance of approximately 89 million however the midtex division has historically been able to settle similar gas contract reviews for significantly less than the requested disallowance amounts a hearing was held at the rrc in september 2008 and initial and reply briefs were filed by all parties in midoctober 2008 a proposal for decision on this matter is expected by the end of march 2009 

 

other regulation 

 

each of our natural gas distribution divisions is regulated by various state or local public utility authorities we are also subject to regulation by the united states department of transportation with respect to safety requirements in the operation and maintenance of our gas distribution facilities in addition our distribution operations are also subject to various state and federal laws regulating environmental matters from time to time we receive inquiries regarding various environmental matters we believe that our properties and operations substantially comply with and are operated in substantial conformity with applicable safety and environmental statutes and regulations there are no administrative or judicial proceedings arising under environmental quality statutes pending or known to be contemplated by governmental agencies which would have a material adverse effect on us or our operations our environmental claims have arisen primarily from former manufactured gas plant sites in tennessee iowa and missouri 

 

the federal energy regulatory commission ferc allows pursuant to section 311 of the natural gas policy act gas transportation services through our atmos pipeline — texas assets “on behalf of” interstate pipelines or local distribution companies served by interstate pipelines without subjecting these assets to the jurisdiction of the ferc 

 

the rrc has issued a final rule requiring the replacement of known compression couplings at prebent gas meter risers by november 2009 this rule affects the operations of the midtex division but is presently not anticipated to have a significant impact on our west texas division this rule requires us to expend significant amounts of capital in the midtex division but these prudent and mandatory expenditures should be recoverable through our rates 

competition 

 

although our natural gas distribution operations are not currently in significant direct competition with any other distributors of natural gas to residential and commercial customers within our service areas we do compete with other natural gas suppliers and suppliers of alternative fuels for sales to industrial customers we compete in all aspects of our business with alternative energy sources including in particular electricity electric utilities offer electricity as a rival energy source and compete for the space heating water heating and cooking markets promotional incentives improved equipment efficiencies and promotional rates all contribute to the acceptability of electrical equipment the principal means to compete against alternative fuels is lower prices and natural gas historically has maintained its price advantage in the residential commercial and industrial markets however higher gas prices coupled with the electric utilities’ marketing efforts have increased competition for residential and commercial customers in addition aem competes with other natural gas marketers to provide natural gas management and other related services to customers 

 

our regulated transmission and storage operations currently face limited competition from other existing intrastate pipelines and gas marketers seeking to provide or arrange transportation storage and other services for customers 

 

employees 

 

at september 30 2008 we had 4750 employees consisting of 4618 employees in our regulated operations and 132 employees in our nonregulated operations

 item 1a   risk factors tableend  

our financial and operating results are subject to a number of risk factors many of which are not within our control although we have tried to discuss key risk factors below please be aware that other or new risks may prove to be important in the future investors should carefully consider the following discussion of risk factors as well as other information appearing in this report these factors include the following 

 

the continuation of the unprecedented disruptions in the credit markets could limit our ability to access capital and increase our costs of capital 

 

we rely upon access to both shortterm and longterm credit markets to satisfy our liquidity requirements the global credit markets have been experiencing significant disruption and volatility in recent months to a greater degree than has been seen in decades in some cases the ability or willingness of traditional sources of capital to provide financing has been reduced 

 

historically we have accessed the commercial paper markets to finance our shortterm working capital needs however the disruptions in the credit markets since midseptember 2008 have limited our access to the commercial paper markets consequently we have borrowed directly under our primary credit facility that backstops our commercial paper program to provide much of our working capital this credit facility provides up to 600 million in committed financing through its expiration in december 2011 however one lender with a 555 share of the commitments has ceased funding effectively reducing the facility’s size to 567 million our borrowings under this facility along with our commercial paper have been used primarily to purchase natural gas supply for the upcoming winter heating season the amount of our working capital requirements in the nearterm will depend primarily on the market price of natural gas higher natural gas prices may adversely impact our accounts receivable collections and may require us to increase borrowings under our credit facilities to fund our operations the cost of both our borrowings under the primary credit facility and our commercial paper has increased significantly since midseptember 2008 we have historically supplemented our commercial paper program with a shortterm committed credit facility that must be renewed annually no borrowings are currently outstanding under this 2125 million facility which matures at the end of october 2009 

 

our longterm debt is currently rated as “investment grade” by standard  poor’s corporation moody’s investors services inc and fitch ratings ltd if continuing adverse credit conditions cause a significant limitation on our access to the private and public credit markets we could see a reduction in our liquidity a significant reduction in our liquidity could in turn trigger a negative change in our ratings outlook or even a reduction in our credit ratings by one or more of the three credit rating agencies if we were to lose our investmentgrade rating from any of the three credit rating agencies we would lose our ability to issue unsecured longterm debt in the capital markets without further regulatory approval due to restrictions imposed by one of the state regulatory commissions that regulates our natural gas distribution business additionally such a downgrade could even further limit our access to private credit markets and increase the costs of borrowing under credit lines that could be available 

 

further if our credit ratings were downgraded we could be required to provide additional liquidity to our natural gas marketing segment because the commodity financial instruments markets could become unavailable to us our natural gas marketing segment depends primarily upon an uncommitted demand 580 million credit facility to finance its working capital needs which it uses primarily to issue standby letters of credit to its natural gas suppliers although the availability of credit under this facility has not yet been affected the continuation of current market conditions could adversely affect such availability a significant reduction in such availability could require us to provide extra liquidity to support its operations or reduce some of the activities of our natural gas marketing segment our ability to provide extra liquidity is limited by the terms of our existing lending arrangements with aeh which are subject to annual approval by one state regulatory commission 

 

a continuation of the recent deterioration in credit markets could also adversely impact our plans to refinance debt that matures at the beginning of fiscal 2010 we financed our txu gas acquisition in october 2004 in part with the proceeds of our 4 senior notes due 2009 the 400 million principal amount of these 

notes matures in october 2009 and we plan to access the capital markets to refinance this debt prior to maturity a continuation of current market conditions could adversely affect the cost or other terms of such refinancing 

 

while we believe we can meet our capital requirements from our operations and the sources of financing available to us we can provide no assurance that we will continue to be able to do so in the future especially if the market price of natural gas increases significantly in the nearterm the future effects on our business liquidity and financial results of a continuation of current market conditions could be material and adverse to us both in the ways described above or in other ways that we do not currently anticipate 

 

the continuation of recent economic conditions could adversely affect our customers and negatively impact our financial results 

 

the slowdown in the us economy together with increased mortgage defaults and significant decreases in the values of homes and investment assets has adversely affected the financial resources of many domestic households it is unclear whether the administrative and legislative responses to these conditions will be successful in avoiding a recession or in lessening the severity or duration of a recession as a result our customers may seek to use less gas in upcoming heating seasons and it may become more difficult for them to pay their gas bills this may slow collections and lead to higher than normal levels of accounts receivable this in turn could increase our financing requirements and bad debt expense 

 

the costs of providing pension and postretirement health care benefits and related funding requirements are subject to changes in pension fund values changing demographics and fluctuating actuarial assumptions and may have a material adverse effect on our financial results 

 

we provide a cashbalance pension plan and postretirement healthcare benefits to eligible fulltime employees our costs of providing such benefits and related funding requirements are subject to changes in the market value of the assets funding our pension and postretirement healthcare plans the recent significant decline in the value of investments that fund our pension and postretirement healthcare plans may significantly differ from or alter the values and actuarial assumptions we use to calculate our future pension plan expense and postretirement healthcare costs a continuation or further decline in the value of these investments could increase the expenses of our pension and postretirement healthcare plans and related funding requirements in the future our costs of providing such benefits and related funding requirements are also subject to changing demographics including longer life expectancy of beneficiaries and an expected increase in the number of eligible former employees over the next five to ten years as well as various actuarial calculations and assumptions which may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions higher or lower withdrawal rates and interest rates and other factors 

 

our operations are exposed to market risks that are beyond our control which could adversely affect our financial results and capital requirements 

 

our risk management operations are subject to market risks beyond our control including market liquidity commodity price volatility and counterparty creditworthiness although we maintain a risk management policy we may not be able to completely offset the price risk associated with volatile gas prices or the risk in our natural gas marketing and pipeline storage and other segments which could lead to volatility in our earnings physical trading also introduces price risk on any net open positions at the end of each trading day as well as volatility resulting from intraday fluctuations of gas prices and the potential for daily price movements between the time natural gas is purchased or sold for future delivery and the time the related purchase or sale is hedged although we manage our business to maintain no open positions there are times when limited net open positions related to our physical storage may occur on a shortterm basis the determination of our net open position as of the end of any particular trading day requires us to make assumptions as to future circumstances including the use of gas by our customers in relation to our anticipated storage and market positions because the price risk associated with any net open position at the end of such day may increase if the assumptions are not realized we review these assumptions as part of our daily monitoring activities net open positions may increase volatility in our financial condition or results of 

operations if market prices move in a significantly favorable or unfavorable manner because the timing of the recognition of profits or losses on the hedges for financial accounting purposes usually do not match up with the timing of the economic profits or losses on the item being hedged this volatility may occur with a resulting increase or decrease in earnings or losses even though the expected profit margin is essentially unchanged from the date the transactions were consummated further if the local physical markets in which we trade do not move consistently with the nymex futures market we could experience increased volatility in the financial results of our natural gas marketing and pipeline storage and other segments 

 

our natural gas marketing and pipeline storage and other segments manage margins and limit risk exposure on the sale of natural gas inventory or the offsetting fixedprice purchase or sale commitments for physical quantities of natural gas through the use of a variety of financial instruments however contractual limitations could adversely affect our ability to withdraw gas from storage which could cause us to purchase gas at spot prices in a rising market to obtain sufficient volumes to fulfill customer contracts we could also realize financial losses on our efforts to limit risk as a result of volatility in the market prices of the underlying commodities or if a counterparty fails to perform under a contract a continued tightening of the credit market could cause more of our counterparties to fail to perform than expected and reserved in addition adverse changes in the creditworthiness of our counterparties could limit the level of trading activities with these parties and increase the risk that these parties may not perform under a contract these circumstances could also increase our capital requirements 

 

we are also subject to interest rate risk on our borrowings in recent years we have been operating in a relatively low interestrate environment with both short and longterm interest rates being relatively low compared to historical interest rates however increases in interest rates could adversely affect our future financial results 

 

we are subject to state and local regulations that affect our operations and financial results 

 

our natural gas distribution and regulated transmission and storage segments are subject to various regulated returns on our rate base in each jurisdiction in which we operate we monitor the allowed rates of return and our effectiveness in earning such rates and initiate rate proceedings or operating changes as we believe are needed in addition in the normal course of business in the regulatory environment assets may be placed in service and historical test periods established before rate cases can be filed that could result in an adjustment of our returns once rate cases are filed regulatory bodies have the authority to suspend implementation of the new rates while studying the cases because of this process we must suffer the negative financial effects of having placed assets in service without the benefit of rate relief which is commonly referred to as “regulatory lag” rate cases also involve a risk of rate reduction because once rates have been approved they are still subject to challenge for their reasonableness by appropriate regulatory authorities in addition regulators may review our purchases of natural gas and can adjust the amount of our gas costs that we pass through to our customers finally our debt and equity financings are also subject to approval by regulatory bodies in several states which could limit our ability to access or take advantage of changes in the capital markets 

 

some of our operations are subject to increased federal regulatory oversight that could affect our operations and financial results 

 

ferc has regulatory authority that affects some of our operations including sales of natural gas in the wholesale gas market and the use and release of interstate pipeline and storage capacity under legislation passed by congress in 2005 ferc has adopted rules designed to prevent market power abuse and market manipulation and to promote compliance with ferc’s other rules policies and orders by companies engaged in the sale purchase transportation or storage of natural gas in interstate commerce these rules carry increased penalties for violations we are currently under investigation by ferc for possible violations of ferc’s posting and competitive bidding regulations for prearranged released firm capacity on interstate natural gas pipelines although we are currently taking action to structure current and future transactions to comply with applicable ferc regulations we are unable to predict the impact that these rules or any future regulatory activities of ferc and other federal agencies will have on our operations or financial results changes in regulations or their interpretation or additional regulations could adversely affect our business or financial results 

we are subject to environmental regulations which could adversely affect our operations or financial results 

 

we are subject to laws regulations and other legal requirements enacted or adopted by federal state and local governmental authorities relating to protection of the environment and health and safety matters including those legal requirements that govern discharges of substances into the air and water the management and disposal of hazardous substances and waste the cleanup of contaminated sites groundwater quality and availability plant and wildlife protection as well as work practices related to employee health and safety environmental legislation also requires that our facilities sites and other properties associated with our operations be operated maintained abandoned and reclaimed to the satisfaction of applicable regulatory authorities failure to comply with these laws regulations permits and licenses may expose us to fines penalties or interruptions in our operations that could be significant to our financial results in addition existing environmental regulations may be revised or our operations may become subject to new regulations in addition there are a number of new federal and state legislative and regulatory initiatives being proposed and adopted in an attempt to control or limit the effects of global warming and overall climate change including greenhouse gas emissions such as carbon dioxide such revised or new regulations could result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions which could adversely affect our business financial condition or financial results 

 

the concentration of our distribution pipeline and storage operations in the state of texas exposes our operations and financial results to economic conditions and regulatory decisions in texas 

 

as a result of our acquisition of the distribution pipeline and storage operations of txu gas in october 2004 over 50 percent of our natural gas distribution customers and most of our pipeline and storage assets and operations are located in the state of texas this concentration of our business in texas means that our operations and financial results may be significantly affected by changes in the texas economy in general and regulatory decisions by state and local regulatory authorities in texas 

 

adverse weather conditions could affect our operations or financial results 

 

since the 20062007 winter heating season we have had weathernormalized rates for over 90 percent of our residential and commercial meters which has substantially mitigated the adverse effects of warmerthannormal weather for meters in those service areas however there is no assurance that we will continue to receive such regulatory protection from adverse weather in our rates in the future the loss of such weather — normalized rates could have an adverse effect on our operations and financial results in addition our natural gas distribution and regulated transmission and storage operating results may continue to vary somewhat with the actual temperatures during the winter heating season sustained cold weather could adversely affect our natural gas marketing operations as we may be required to purchase gas at spot rates in a rising market to obtain sufficient volumes to fulfill some customer contracts 

 

inflation and increased gas costs could adversely impact our customer base and customer collections and increase our level of indebtedness 

 

inflation has caused increases in some of our operating expenses and has required assets to be replaced at higher costs we have a process in place to continually review the adequacy of our natural gas distribution gas rates in relation to the increasing cost of providing service and the inherent regulatory lag in adjusting those gas rates historically we have been able to budget and control operating expenses and investments within the amounts authorized to be collected in rates and intend to continue to do so however the ability to control expenses is an important factor that could impact future financial results 

 

rapid increases in the costs of purchased gas which has occurred in recent years cause us to experience a significant increase in shortterm debt we must pay suppliers for gas when it is purchased which can be significantly in advance of when these costs may be recovered through the collection of monthly customer bills for gas delivered increases in purchased gas costs also slow our natural gas distribution collection efforts as customers are more likely to delay the payment of their gas bills leading to higher than normal accounts 

receivable this could result in higher shortterm debt levels greater collection efforts and increased bad debt expense 

 

our growth in the future may be limited by the nature of our business which requires extensive capital spending 

 

we must continually build additional capacity in our natural gas distribution system to maintain the growth in the number of our customers the cost of adding this capacity may be affected by a number of factors including the general state of the economy and weather our cash flows from operations generally are sufficient to supply funding for all our capital expenditures including the financing of the costs of new construction along with capital expenditures necessary to maintain our existing natural gas system due to the timing of these cash flows and capital expenditures we often must fund at least a portion of these costs through borrowing funds from third party lenders the cost and availability of which is dependent on the liquidity of the credit markets interest rates and other market conditions this in turn may limit our ability to connect new customers to our system due to constraints on the amount of funds we can invest in our infrastructure 

 

our operations are subject to increased competition 

 

in residential and commercial customer markets our natural gas distribution operations compete with other energy products such as electricity and propane our primary product competition is with electricity for heating water heating and cooking increases in the price of natural gas could negatively impact our competitive position by decreasing the price benefits of natural gas to the consumer this could adversely impact our business if as a result our customer growth slows reducing our ability to make capital expenditures or if our customers further conserve their use of gas resulting in reduced gas purchases and customer billings 

 

in the case of industrial customers such as manufacturing plants adverse economic conditions including higher gas costs could cause these customers to use alternative sources of energy such as electricity or bypass our systems in favor of special competitive contracts with lower perunit costs our regulated transmission and storage segment currently faces limited competition from other existing intrastate pipelines and gas marketers seeking to provide or arrange transportation storage and other services for customers however competition may increase if new intrastate pipelines are constructed near our existing facilities 

 

distributing and storing natural gas involve risks that may result in accidents and additional operating costs 

 

our natural gas distribution business involves a number of hazards and operating risks that cannot be completely avoided such as leaks accidents and operational problems which could cause loss of human life as well as substantial financial losses resulting from property damage damage to the environment and to our operations we do have liability and property insurance coverage in place for many of these hazards and risks however because our pipeline storage and distribution facilities are near or are in populated areas any loss of human life or adverse financial results resulting from such events could be large if these events were not fully covered by insurance our operations or financial results could be adversely affected 

 

natural disasters terrorist activities or other significant events could adversely affect our operations or financial results 

 

natural disasters are always a threat to our assets and operations in addition the threat of terrorist activities could lead to increased economic instability and volatility in the price of natural gas that could affect our operations also companies in our industry may face a heightened risk of exposure to actual acts of terrorism which could subject our operations to increased risks as a result the availability of insurance covering such risks may be more limited which could increase the risk that an event could adversely affect our operations or financial results

several factors exist that could influence our future financial performance some of which are described in item 1a above “risk factors” they should be considered in connection with evaluating forwardlooking statements contained in this report or otherwise made by or on behalf of us since these factors could cause actual results and conditions to differ materially from those set out in such forwardlooking statements 

 

cautionary statement for the purposes of the safe harbor under the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 

 

the statements contained in this annual report on form 10k may contain “forwardlooking statements” within the meaning of section 27a of the securities act of 1933 and section 21e of the securities exchange act of 1934 all statements other than statements of historical fact included in this report are forwardlooking statements made in good faith by us and are intended to qualify for the safe harbor from liability established by the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 when used in this report or any other of our documents or oral presentations the words “anticipate” “believe” “estimate” “expect” “forecast” “goal” “intend” “objective” “plan” “projection” “seek” “strategy” or similar words are intended to identify forwardlooking statements such forwardlooking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the statements relating to our strategy operations markets services rates recovery of costs availability of gas supply and other factors these risks and uncertainties include the following our ability to continue to access the credit markets to satisfy our liquidity requirements the impact of recent economic conditions on our customers increased costs of providing pension and postretirement health care benefits and increased funding requirements market risks beyond our control affecting our risk management activities including market liquidity commodity price volatility increasing interest rates and counterparty creditworthiness regulatory trends and decisions including the impact of rate proceedings before various state regulatory commissions increased federal regulatory oversight and potential penalties the impact of environmental regulations on our business the concentration of our distribution pipeline and storage operations in texas adverse weather conditions the effects of inflation and changes in the availability and price of natural gas the capitalintensive nature of our gas distribution business increased competition from energy suppliers and alternative forms of energy the inherent hazards and risks involved in operating our gas distribution business natural disasters terrorist activities or other events and other risks and uncertainties discussed herein especially those discussed in item 1a above all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond our control accordingly while we believe these forwardlooking statements to be reasonable there can be no assurance that they will approximate actual experience or that the expectations derived from them will be realized further we undertake no obligation to update or revise any of our forwardlooking statements whether as a result of new information future events or otherwise 

 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

 

our consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and the related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities we based our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including those related to risk management and trading activities allowance for doubtful 

accounts legal and environmental accruals insurance accruals pension and postretirement obligations deferred income taxes and valuation of goodwill indefinitelived intangible assets and other longlived assets our critical accounting policies are reviewed by the audit committee quarterly actual results may differ from estimates 

 

regulation — our natural gas distribution and regulated transmission and storage operations are subject to regulation with respect to rates service maintenance of accounting records and various other matters by the respective regulatory authorities in the states in which we operate our regulated operations are accounted for in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas 71 accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation  this statement requires costbased rateregulated entities that meet certain criteria to reflect the financial effects of the ratemaking and accounting practices and policies of the various regulatory commissions in their financial statements we record regulatory assets for costs that have been deferred for which future recovery through customer rates is considered probable regulatory liabilities are recorded when it is probable that revenues will be reduced for amounts that will be credited to customers through the ratemaking process as a result certain costs that would normally be expensed under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states are permitted to be capitalized or deferred on the balance sheet because they can be recovered through rates discontinuing the application of sfas 71 could significantly increase our operating expenses as fewer costs would likely be capitalized or deferred on the balance sheet which could reduce our net income further regulation may impact the period in which revenues or expenses are recognized the amounts to be recovered or recognized are based upon historical experience and our understanding of the regulations the impact of regulation on our natural gas distribution operations may be affected by decisions of the regulatory authorities or the issuance of new regulations 

 

revenue recognition — sales of natural gas to our natural gas distribution customers are billed on a monthly basis however the billing cycle periods for certain classes of customers do not necessarily coincide with accounting periods used for financial reporting purposes we follow the revenue accrual method of accounting for natural gas distribution segment revenues whereby revenues applicable to gas delivered to customers but not yet billed under the cycle billing method are estimated and accrued and the related costs are charged to expense 

 

on occasion we are permitted to implement new rates that have not been formally approved by our regulatory authorities which are subject to refund as permitted by sfas no 71 we recognize this revenue and establish a reserve for amounts that could be refunded based on our experience for the jurisdiction in which the rates were implemented 

 

rates established by regulatory authorities are adjusted for increases and decreases in our purchased gas costs through purchased gas adjustment mechanisms purchased gas adjustment mechanisms provide gas utility companies a method of recovering purchased gas costs on an ongoing basis without filing a rate case to address all of the utility company’s nongas costs these mechanisms are commonly utilized when regulatory authorities recognize a particular type of cost such as purchased gas costs that i is subject to significant price fluctuations compared to the utility company’s other costs ii represents a large component of the utility company’s cost of service and iii is generally outside the control of the gas utility company there is no gross profit generated through purchased gas adjustments but they provide a dollarfordollar offset to increases or decreases in utility gas costs although substantially all natural gas distribution sales to our customers fluctuate with the cost of gas that we purchase our gross profit is generally not affected by fluctuations in the cost of gas as a result of the purchased gas adjustment mechanism the effects of these purchased gas adjustment mechanisms are recorded as deferred gas costs on our balance sheet 

 

operating revenues for our regulated transmission and storage and pipeline storage and other segments are recognized in the period in which actual volumes are transported and storage services are provided 

 

operating revenues for our natural gas marketing segment and the associated carrying value of natural gas inventory inclusive of storage costs are recognized when we sell the gas and physically deliver it to our customers operating revenues include realized gains and losses arising from the settlement of financial instruments used in our natural gas marketing activities and unrealized gains and losses arising from changes 

in the fair value of natural gas inventory designated as a hedged item in a fair value hedge and the associated financial instruments 

 

allowance for doubtful accounts — accounts receivable consist of natural gas sales to residential commercial industrial municipal and other customers for the majority of our receivables we establish an allowance for doubtful accounts based on our collections experience on certain other receivables where we are aware of a specific customer’s inability or reluctance to pay we record an allowance for doubtful accounts against amounts due to reduce the net receivable balance to the amount we reasonably expect to collect however if circumstances change our estimate of the recoverability of accounts receivable could be affected circumstances which could affect our estimates include but are not limited to customer credit issues the level of natural gas prices customer deposits and general economic conditions accounts are written off once they are deemed to be uncollectible 

 

financial instruments and hedging activities — we currently use financial instruments to mitigate commodity price risk additionally we periodically use financial instruments to manage interest rate risk the objectives and strategies for using financial instruments have been tailored to meet the needs of our regulated and nonregulated businesses 

 

we record all of our financial instruments on the balance sheet at fair value as required by sfas 133 accounting for derivatives and hedging activities with changes in fair value ultimately recorded in the income statement we determine fair values primarily through prices actively quoted on national exchanges which we believe correspond to the market in which transactions involving these financial instruments are executed we utilize models and other valuation methods to determine fair value in those limited circumstances where external sources are not available values are adjusted accordingly to reflect the potential impact of an orderly liquidation of our positions over a reasonable period of time under then current market conditions amounts reported at fair value are subject to potentially significant volatility based upon changes in market prices the valuation of the portfolio of our contracts maturity and settlement of these contracts and newly originated transactions each of which directly affect the estimated fair value of our financial instruments we believe the market prices and models used to value these financial instruments represent the best information available with respect to closing exchange and overthecounter quotations time value and volatility factors underlying the contracts values are adjusted to reflect the potential impact of an orderly liquidation of our positions over a reasonable period of time under then current market conditions 

 

fair value estimates also consider the creditworthiness of our counterparties our counterparties consist primarily of financial institutions and major energy companies this concentration of counterparties may materially impact our exposure to credit risk resulting from market economic or regulatory conditions recent adverse developments in the global financial and credit markets have made it more difficult and more expensive for companies to access the shortterm capital markets which may negatively impact the creditworthiness of our counterparties we seek to minimize counterparty credit risk through an evaluation of their financial condition and credit ratings and collateral requirements under certain circumstances including the use of master netting agreements in our natural gas marketing segment 

 

the timing of when changes in fair value of our financial instruments are recorded in the income statement depends on whether the financial instrument has been designated and qualifies as a part of a hedging relationship or if regulatory rulings require a different accounting treatment changes in fair value for financial instruments that do not meet one of these criteria are recognized in the income statement as they occur 

 

financial instruments associated with commodity price risk 

 

in our natural gas distribution segment our customers are exposed to the effect of volatile natural gas prices we manage this exposure through a combination of physical storage fixedprice forward contracts and financial instruments primarily overthecounter swap and option contracts in an effort to minimize the impact of natural gas price volatility on our customers during the winter heating season the costs associated with and the gains and losses arising from the use of financial instruments to mitigate commodity price risk in this segment are included in our purchased gas adjustment mechanisms in accordance with regulatory requirements therefore changes in the fair value of these financial instruments are initially recorded as a 

component of deferred gas costs and recognized in the consolidated statement of income as a component of purchased gas cost when the related costs are recovered through our rates and recognized in revenue in accordance with sfas 71 accordingly there is no earnings impact to our natural gas distribution segment as a result of the use of financial instruments 

 

our natural gas marketing segment aggregates and purchases gas supply arranges transportation andor storage logistics and ultimately delivers gas to our customers at competitive prices we also perform asset optimization activities in both our natural gas marketing segment and pipeline storage and other segment as a result of these activities our nonregulated operations are exposed to risks associated with changes in the market price of natural gas we manage our exposure to the risk of natural gas price changes through a combination of physical storage and financial instruments including futures overthecounter and exchangetraded options and swap contracts with counterparties 

 

in our natural gas marketing and pipeline storage and other segments we have designated the natural gas inventory held by these operating segments as the hedged item in a fairvalue hedge this inventory is marked to market at the end of each month based on the gas daily index with changes in fair value recognized as unrealized gains or losses in revenue in the period of change the financial instruments associated with this natural gas inventory have been designated as fairvalue hedges and are marked to market each month based upon the nymex price with changes in fair value recognized as unrealized gains or losses in revenue in the period of change changes in the spreads between the forward natural gas prices used to value the financial instruments designated against our physical inventory nymex and the market spot prices used to value our physical storage gas daily result in unrealized margins until the underlying physical gas is withdrawn and the related financial instruments are settled the difference in the spot price used to value our physical inventory and the forward price used to value the related financial instruments can result in volatility in our reported income as a component of unrealized margins we have elected to exclude this spotforward differential for purposes of assessing the effectiveness of these fairvalue hedges once the gas is withdrawn and the financial instruments are settled the previously unrealized margins associated with these net positions are realized over time we expect gains and losses on the sale of storage gas inventory to be offset by gains and losses on the fairvalue hedges resulting in the realization of the economic gross profit margin we anticipated at the time we structured the original transaction 

 

we have elected to treat fixedprice forward contracts used in our natural gas marketing segment to deliver gas as normal purchases and normal sales as such these deliveries are recorded on an accrual basis in accordance with our revenue recognition policy financial instruments used to mitigate the commodity price risk associated with these contracts have been designated as cash flow hedges of anticipated purchases and sales at indexed prices accordingly unrealized gains and losses on open financial instruments are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income and are recognized in earnings as a component of revenue when the hedged volumes are sold hedge ineffectiveness to the extent incurred is reported as a component of revenue 

 

we also use storage swaps and futures to capture additional storage arbitrage opportunities in our natural gas marketing segment that arise after the execution of the original fair value hedge associated with our physical natural gas inventory basis swaps to insulate and protect the economic value of our fixed price and storage books and various overthecounter and exchangetraded options these financial instruments have not been designated as hedges in accordance with sfas 133 

 

financial instruments associated with interest rate risk 

 

we periodically manage interest rate risk typically when we issue new or refinance existing longterm debt currently we do not have any financial instruments in place to manage interest rate risk however in prior years we entered into treasury lock agreements to fix the treasury yield component of the interest cost associated with anticipated financings we designated these treasury lock agreements as a cash flow hedge of an anticipated transaction at the time the agreements were executed accordingly unrealized gains and losses associated with the treasury lock agreements were recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss the realized gain or loss recognized upon settlement of each treasury lock agreement was 

initially recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss and is recognized as a component of interest expense over the life of the related financing arrangement 

 

impairment assessments — we perform impairment assessments of our goodwill intangible assets subject to amortization and longlived assets we currently have no indefinitelived intangible assets 

 

we annually evaluate our goodwill balances for impairment during our second fiscal quarter or as impairment indicators arise we use a present value technique based on discounted cash flows to estimate the fair value of our reporting units we have determined our reporting units to be each of our natural gas distribution divisions and whollyowned subsidiaries and goodwill is allocated to the reporting units responsible for the acquisition that gave rise to the goodwill the discounted cash flow calculations used to assess goodwill impairment are dependent on several subjective factors including the timing of future cash flows future growth rates and the discount rate an impairment charge is recognized if the carrying value of a reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds its fair value 

 

we annually assess whether the cost of our intangible assets subject to amortization or other longlived assets is recoverable or that the remaining useful lives may warrant revision we perform this assessment more frequently when specific events or circumstances have occurred that suggest the recoverability of the cost of the intangible and other longlived assets is at risk 

 

when such events or circumstances are present we assess the recoverability of these assets by determining whether the carrying value will be recovered through expected future cash flows from the operating division or subsidiary to which these assets relate these cash flow projections consider various factors such as the timing of the future cash flows and the discount rate and are based upon the best information available at the time the estimate is made changes in these factors could materially affect the cash flow projections and result in the recognition of an impairment charge an impairment charge is recognized as the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value if the sum of the undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying value of the related asset 

 

pension and other postretirement plans  — pension and other postretirement plan costs and liabilities are determined on an actuarial basis and are affected by numerous assumptions and estimates including the market value of plan assets estimates of the expected return on plan assets assumed discount rates and current demographic and actuarial mortality data through fiscal 2008 we reviewed the estimates and assumptions underlying our pension and other postretirement plan costs and liabilities annually based upon a june 30 measurement date effective october 1 2008 we changed our measurement date to september 30 the assumed discount rate and the expected return are the assumptions that generally have the most significant impact on our pension costs and liabilities the assumed discount rate the assumed health care cost trend rate and assumed rates of retirement generally have the most significant impact on our postretirement plan costs and liabilities 

 

the discount rate is utilized principally in calculating the actuarial present value of our pension and postretirement obligations and net pension and postretirement costs when establishing our discount rate we consider high quality corporate bond rates based on moody’s aa bond index changes in those rates from the prior year and the implied discount rate that is derived from matching our projected benefit disbursements with a high quality corporate bond spot rate curve 

 

the expected longterm rate of return on assets is utilized in calculating the expected return on plan assets component of our annual pension and postretirement plan costs we estimate the expected return on plan assets by evaluating expected bond returns equity risk premiums asset allocations the effects of active plan management the impact of periodic plan asset rebalancing and historical performance we also consider the guidance from our investment advisors in making a final determination of our expected rate of return on assets to the extent the actual rate of return on assets realized over the course of a year is greater than or less than the assumed rate that year’s annual pension or postretirement plan costs are not affected rather this gain or loss reduces or increases future pension or postretirement plan costs over a period of approximately ten to twelve years 

we estimate the assumed health care cost trend rate used in determining our postretirement net expense based upon our actual health care cost experience the effects of recently enacted legislation and general economic conditions our assumed rate of retirement is estimated based upon our annual review of our participant census information as of the measurement date 

 

actual changes in the fair market value of plan assets and differences between the actual return on plan assets and the expected return on plan assets could have a material effect on the amount of pension costs ultimately recognized a 025 percent change in our discount rate would impact our pension and postretirement costs by approximately 09 million a 025 percent change in our expected rate of return would impact our pension and postretirement costs by approximately 09 million 

 

results of operations 

 

overview 

 

atmos energy corporation is involved in the distribution marketing and transportation of natural gas accordingly our results of operations are impacted by the demand for natural gas particularly during the winter heating season and the volatility of the natural gas markets this generally results in higher operating revenues and net income during the period from october through march of each fiscal year and lower operating revenues and either lower net income or net losses during the period from april through september of each fiscal year as a result of the seasonality of the natural gas industry our second fiscal quarter has historically been our most critical earnings quarter with an average of approximately 62 percent of our consolidated net income having been earned in the second quarter during the three most recently completed fiscal years 

 

additionally the seasonality of our business impacts our working capital differently at various times during the year typically our accounts receivable accounts payable and shortterm debt balances peak by the end of january and then start to decline as customers begin to pay their winter heating bills gas stored underground particularly in our natural gas distribution segment typically peaks in november and declines as we utilize storage gas to serve our customers 

 

during the current year prices for several world energy commodities rose to historic levels most significantly seen in unprecedented oil prices while natural gas prices did not reach historic levels they were impacted by financial speculators and large hedge fund trading particularly during the summer months as a result our natural gas distribution segment’s cost of natural gas per mcf sold increased 12 percent to 905 for the current fiscal year compared with 809 in the prior fiscal year despite these higher prices we experienced lower price volatility which reduced our natural gas marketing segment’s opportunity to earn arbitrage gains 

 

although gas costs do not directly impact our natural gas distribution gross profit margin higher natural gas prices could cause our natural gas distribution customers and customers served by our other operating segments to conserve or in the case of industrial customers switch to less expensive fuel sources further higher natural gas prices may adversely impact our accounts receivable collections resulting in higher bad debt expense and may require us to increase borrowings under our credit facilities resulting in higher interest expense 

 

we normally access the commercial paper markets to finance our working capital needs and growth however recent adverse developments in global financial and credit markets have made it more difficult and more expensive for the company to access the shortterm capital markets including the commercial paper market to satisfy our liquidity requirements despite these conditions we believe the amounts available to us under our credit facilities coupled with our operating cash flows will provide the necessary liquidity to fund our working capital needs for fiscal year 2009 

consolidated results 

 

the following table presents our consolidated financial highlights for the fiscal years ended september 30 2008 2007 and 2006 

 

 

 

historically our regulated operations arising from our natural gas distribution and regulated transmission and storage operations contributed 65 to 85 percent of our consolidated net income regulated operations contributed 74 percent 64 percent and 54 percent to our consolidated net income for fiscal years 2008 2007 and 2006 our consolidated net income during the last three fiscal years was earned across our business segments as follows 

 

 

 

the following table segregates our consolidated net income and diluted earnings per share between our regulated and nonregulated operations 

 

 

 

yearoveryear net income during fiscal 2008 increased seven percent net income from our regulated operations increased 24 percent during fiscal 2008 the increase primarily reflects a net 538 million increase in gross profit resulting from our ratemaking efforts coupled with higher perunit transportation margins and an 18 percent increase in consolidated throughput in our atmos pipeline — texas division these increases were partially offset by a four percent increase in operating expenses net income in our nonregulated 

operations experienced a 24 percent decline as less volatile natural gas market conditions significantly reduced our asset optimization margins however higher delivered gas margins in our natural gas marketing segment and unrealized margins partially offset this decrease 

 

the 14 percent yearoveryear increase in net income during fiscal 2007 reflects improvements across all business segments results from our regulated operations reflect the net favorable impact of various ratemaking rulings in our natural gas distribution segment including the implementation of wna in our midtex and louisiana divisions coupled with increased throughput and incremental gross profit margins from our north side loop project and other pipeline compression projects completed in fiscal 2006 the decrease in net income from our nonregulated operations primarily reflects the impact of a less volatile natural gas market which reduced delivered gas margins despite a 31 percent increase in sales volumes however our nonregulated operations benefited from higher asset optimization margins primarily in the pipeline storage and other segment 

 

other key financial and significant events for the fiscal year ended september 30 2008 include the following 

 

  

see the following discussion regarding the results of operations for each of our business operating segments 

 

fiscal year ended september 30 2008 compared with fiscal year ended september 30 2007 

 

natural gas distribution segment 

 

the primary factors that impact the results of our natural gas distribution operations are our ability to earn our authorized rates of return the cost of natural gas competitive factors in the energy industry and economic conditions in our service areas 

 

our ability to earn our authorized rates is based primarily on our ability to improve the rate design in our various ratemaking jurisdictions by reducing or eliminating regulatory lag and ultimately separating the recovery of our approved margins from customer usage patterns improving rate design is a longterm process and is further complicated by the fact that we operate in multiple rate jurisdictions the “ratemaking activity” section of this form 10k describes our current rate strategy and recent ratemaking initiatives in more detail 

 

our natural gas distribution operations are also affected by the cost of natural gas the cost of gas is passed through to our customers without markup therefore increases in the cost of gas are offset by a corresponding increase in revenues accordingly we believe gross profit is a better indicator of our financial performance than revenues however gross profit in our texas and mississippi service areas include franchise 

fees and gross receipts taxes which are calculated as a percentage of revenue inclusive of gas costs therefore the amount of these taxes included in revenues is influenced by the cost of gas and the level of gas sales volumes we record the tax expense as a component of taxes other than income although changes in revenuerelated taxes arising from changes in gas costs affect gross profit over time the impact is offset within operating income timing differences exist between the recognition of revenue for franchise fees collected from our customers and the recognition of expense of franchise taxes the effect of these timing differences can be significant in periods of volatile gas prices particularly in our midtex division these timing differences may favorably or unfavorably affect net income however these amounts should offset over time with no permanent impact on net income 

 

higher gas costs may also adversely impact our accounts receivable collections resulting in higher bad debt expense and may require us to increase borrowings under our credit facilities resulting in higher interest expense finally higher gas costs as well as competitive factors in the industry and general economic conditions may cause customers to conserve or use alternative energy sources 

 

review of financial and operating results 

 

financial and operational highlights for our natural gas distribution segment for the fiscal years ended september 30 2008 and 2007 are presented below 

 

 

the following table shows our operating income by natural gas distribution division for the fiscal years ended september 30 2008 and 2007 the presentation of our natural gas distribution operating income is included for financial reporting purposes and may not be appropriate for ratemaking purposes 

 

 

 

the 534 million increase in natural gas distribution gross profit primarily reflects a 407 million net increase in rates the net increase in rates primarily was attributable to the midtex division which increased 292 million as a result of its 2006 grip filing the previous and current year midtex rate cases and the absence of a one time grip refund that occurred in the prior year the current year also reflects 144 million in rate increases in our kansas kentucky louisiana tennessee and west texas service areas in addition the prior year includes a 75 million accrual for estimated unrecoverable gas costs that did not recur in the current year 

 

gross profit also increased approximately 86 million from revenuerelated taxes primarily due to higher revenues on which the tax is calculated in the current year compared to the prior year this increase partially offset by a 72 million periodoverperiod increase in the associated franchise and state gross receipts tax expense recorded as a component of taxes other than income resulted in a 14 million increase in operating income when compared with the prior year 

 

operating expenses which include operation and maintenance expense provision for doubtful accounts depreciation and amortization expense and taxes other than income increased by a net 134 million 

 

the net increase was primarily reflected in our operation and maintenance expense excluding the provision for doubtful accounts which increased 133 million compared with the prior year the increase principally reflects higher employee and administrative costs in addition to increased natural gas odorization and fuel costs attributable to higher commodity prices the increase in operation and maintenance expense also reflects the absence in the currentyear period of a nonrecurring 43 million deferral of hurricanerelated operation and maintenance expenses in the prior year 

 

the provision for doubtful accounts decreased 32 million to 166 million for the fiscal year ended september 30 2008 which reflects our continued effective collection efforts despite a 12 percent rise in our average cost of gas per mcf sold as a result of these efforts our provision for doubtful accounts as a percentage of revenue decreased from 061 percent in fiscal 2007 to 047 percent in fiscal 2008 

 

operating expenses for the prior year also include a 33 million noncash charge associated with the writeoff of software costs 

 

the decrease in operating expenses attributable to the lower provision for doubtful accounts and the absence of the prior year charge were offset by the aforementioned increase in franchise and gross receipt taxes 

 

miscellaneous income 

 

the increase in miscellaneous income primarily reflects the recognition of a 12 million gain on the sale of irrigation assets in our west texas division during the fiscal 2008 second quarter 

interest charges 

 

interest charges allocated to the natural gas distribution segment decreased 37 million due to lower average outstanding shortterm debt balances in the current year compared with the prior year 

 

regulated transmission and storage segment 

 

our regulated transmission and storage segment consists of the regulated pipeline and storage operations of the atmos pipeline — texas division the atmos pipeline — texas division transports natural gas to our midtex division and third parties and manages five underground storage reservoirs in texas we also provide ancillary services customary in the pipeline industry including parking arrangements lending and sales of inventory on hand 

 

similar to our natural gas distribution segment our regulated transmission and storage segment is impacted by seasonal weather patterns competitive factors in the energy industry and economic conditions in our service areas natural gas prices do not directly impact the results of this segment as revenues are derived from the transportation of natural gas however natural gas prices could influence the level of drilling activity in the markets that we serve which may influence the level of throughput we may be able to transport on our pipeline further as the atmos pipeline — texas division operations supply all of the natural gas for our midtex division the results of this segment are highly dependent upon the natural gas requirements of the midtex division finally as a regulated pipeline the operations of the atmos pipeline — texas division may be impacted by the timing of when costs and expenses are incurred and when these costs and expenses are recovered through its tariffs 

 

review of financial and operating results 

 

financial and operational highlights for our regulated transmission and storage segment for the fiscal years ended september 30 2008 and 2007 are presented below 

 

 

 

the 327 million increase in gross profit primarily was attributable to a 131 million increase from rate adjustments resulting from our 2006 and 2007 grip filings and an 83 million increase from transportation volumes consolidated throughput increased 18 percent primarily due to increased transportation in the barnett shale region of texas the improvement in gross profit also reflects increased service fees and perunit transportation margins due to favorable market conditions which contributed 80 million new compression 

contracts and transportation capacity enhancements also contributed 15 million in addition sales of excess gas increased 13 million compared to the prior year 

 

operating expenses increased 228 million primarily due to increased pipeline integrity and maintenance costs 

 

natural gas marketing segment 

 

our natural gas marketing activities are conducted through aem which aggregates and purchases gas supply arranges transportation andor storage logistics and ultimately delivers gas to our customers at competitive prices to facilitate this process we utilize proprietary and customerowned transportation and storage assets to provide the various services our customers request including furnishing natural gas supplies at fixed and marketbased prices contract negotiation and administration load forecasting gas storage acquisition and management services transportation services peaking sales and balancing services capacity utilization strategies and gas price hedging through the use of financial instruments as a result our revenues arise from the types of commercial transactions we have structured with our customers and include the value we extract by optimizing the storage and transportation capacity we own or control as well as revenues for services we deliver 

 

our asset optimization activities seek to maximize the economic value associated with the storage and transportation capacity we own or control we attempt to meet this objective by engaging in natural gas storage transactions in which we seek to find and profit from the pricing differences that occur over time we purchase physical natural gas and then sell financial instruments at advantageous prices to lock in a gross profit margin we also seek to participate in transactions in which we combine the natural gas commodity and transportation costs to minimize our costs incurred to serve our customers by identifying the lowest cost alternative within the natural gas supplies transportation and markets to which we have access through the use of transportation and storage services and financial instruments we also seek to capture gross profit margin through the arbitrage of pricing differences that exist in various locations and by recognizing pricing differences that occur over time 

 

aem continually manages its net physical position to attempt to increase the future economic profit that was created when the original transaction was executed therefore aem may subsequently change its originally scheduled storage injection and withdrawal plans from one time period to another based on market conditions and recognize any associated gains or losses at that time if aem elects to accelerate the withdrawal of physical gas it will execute new financial instruments to hedge the original financial instruments if aem elects to defer the withdrawal of gas it will reset its financial instruments to correspond to the revised withdrawal schedule and execute new financial instruments to offset the original financial instruments 

 

we use financial instruments designated as fair value hedges to hedge our natural gas inventory used in our natural gas marketing storage activities these financial instruments are marked to market each month based upon the nymex price with changes in fair value recognized as unrealized gains and losses in the period of change the hedged natural gas inventory is marked to market at the end of each month based on the gas daily index with changes in fair value recognized as unrealized gains and losses in the period of change changes in the spreads between the forward natural gas prices used to value the financial hedges designated against our physical inventory and the market spot prices used to value our physical storage result in unrealized margins until the underlying physical gas is withdrawn and the related financial instruments are settled once the gas is withdrawn and the financial instruments are settled the previously unrealized margins associated with these net positions are realized 

 

aem also uses financial instruments to capture additional storage arbitrage opportunities that may arise after the original physical inventory hedge and to attempt to insulate and protect the economic value within its asset optimization activities changes in fair value associated with these financial instruments are recognized as a component of unrealized margins until they are settled 

due to the nature of these operations natural gas prices have a significant impact on our natural gas marketing operations within our delivered gas activities higher natural gas prices may adversely impact our accounts receivable collections resulting in higher bad debt expense and may require us to increase borrowings under our credit facilities resulting in higher interest expense higher gas prices as well as competitive factors in the industry and general economic conditions may also cause customers to conserve or use alternative energy sources within our asset optimization activities higher gas prices could also lead to increased borrowings under our credit facilities resulting in higher interest expense 

 

volatility in natural gas prices also has a significant impact on our natural gas marketing segment increased price volatility often has a significant impact on the spreads between the market spot prices and forward natural gas prices which creates opportunities to earn higher arbitrage spreads within our asset optimization activities however increased volatility impacts the amounts of unrealized margins recorded in our gross profit and could impact the amount of cash required to collateralize our risk management liabilities 

 

review of financial and operating results 

 

financial and operational highlights for our natural gas marketing segment for the fiscal years ended september 30 2008 and 2007 are presented below gross profit margin consists primarily of margins earned from the delivery of gas and related services requested by our customers and margins earned from asset optimization activities which are derived from the utilization of our proprietary and managed third party storage and transportation assets to capture favorable arbitrage spreads through natural gas trading activities 

 

unrealized margins represent the unrealized gains or losses on our net physical position and the related financial instruments used to manage commodity price risk as described above these margins fluctuate based upon changes in the spreads between the physical and forward natural gas prices generally if the physicalfinancial spread narrows we will record unrealized gains or lower unrealized losses if the physicalfinancial spread widens we will record unrealized losses or lower unrealized gains the magnitude of the unrealized gains and losses is also dependent upon the levels of our net physical position at the end of the reporting period 

 

 

 

the 113 million decrease in our natural gas marketing segment’s gross profit primarily reflects a 350 million decrease in realized asset optimization margins as a result of less volatile natural gas market conditions experienced during the current year aem regularly deferred storage withdrawals and reset the 

associated financial instruments to increase the potential gross profit it could realize from its asset optimization activities in future periods as a result aem recognized settlement losses without corresponding storage withdrawal gains during the current year additionally aem experienced increased storage fees charged by third parties during the current year in the prior year aem was able to recognize arbitrage gains as changes in its originally scheduled storage injection and withdrawal plans had a significantly smaller impact than in the current year 

 

the decrease in realized asset optimization margins was partially offset by a 166 million increase in realized delivered gas margins the increase reflects both increased sales volumes and increased perunit margins gross sales volumes increased eight percent compared with the prior year the increase in sales volumes reflects the successful execution of our marketing strategies our perunit margin increased 19 percent which reflects increased basis gains on certain contracts coupled with improved marketing efforts excluding the impact of these basis gains our perunit margins increased seven percent in the current year 

 

gross profit margin was also favorably impacted by a 71 million increase in unrealized margins attributable to a narrowing of the spreads between current cash prices and forward natural gas prices the change in unrealized margins also reflects the recognition of previously unrealized margins as a component of realized margins as a result of injecting and withdrawing gas and settling financial instruments as a part of aem’s asset optimization activities 

 

operating expenses increased 74 million primarily reflecting a 24 million increase associated with property taxes coupled with a 50 million increase in other administrative costs 

 

economic gross profit 

 

aem monitors the impact of its asset optimization efforts by estimating the gross profit before associated storage fees that it captured through the purchase and sale of physical natural gas and the execution of the associated financial instruments this economic gross profit combined with the effect of the future reversal of unrealized gains or losses currently recognized in the income statement is referred to as the potential gross profit 1 the following table presents aem’s economic gross profit and its potential gross profit at september 30 2008 2007 and 2006 

 

 

 

 

  

as of september 30 2008 based upon aem’s planned inventory withdrawal schedule and associated planned settlement of financial instruments the economic gross profit was 485 million this amount will be reduced by 364 million of net unrealized gains recorded in the financial statements as of september 30 2008 that will reverse when the inventory is withdrawn and the accompanying financial instruments are settled therefore the potential gross profit was 121 million at september 30 2008 

the economic gross profit is based upon planned storage injection and withdrawal schedules and its realization is contingent upon the execution of this plan weather and other execution factors since aem actively manages and optimizes its portfolio to attempt to enhance the future profitability of its storage position it may change its scheduled storage injection and withdrawal plans from one time period to another based on market conditions therefore we cannot ensure that the economic gross profit or the potential gross profit calculated as of september 30 2008 will be fully realized in the future nor can we predict in what time periods such realization may occur further if we experience operational or other issues which limit our ability to optimally manage our stored gas positions our earnings could be adversely impacted assuming aem fully executes its plan in place on september 30 2008 without encountering operational or other issues we anticipate the majority of the potential gross profit as of september 30 2008 will be recognized during the first quarter of fiscal 2009 with the remainder recognized over the remaining months in fiscal 2009 

 

pipeline storage and other segment 

 

our pipeline storage and other segment primarily consists of the operations of atmos pipeline and storage llc aps atmos energy services llc aes and atmos power systems inc which are each whollyowned by aeh 

 

aps owns and operates a 21 mile pipeline located in new orleans louisiana this pipeline is primarily used to aggregate gas supply for our regulated natural gas distribution division in louisiana and for aem however it also provides limited third party transportation services aps also owns or has an interest in underground storage fields in kentucky and louisiana we use these storage facilities to reduce the need to contract for additional pipeline capacity to meet customer demand during peak periods finally beginning in fiscal 2006 aps initiated activities in the natural gas gathering business as of september 30 2008 these activities were limited in nature 

 

aps also engages in limited asset optimization activities whereby it seeks to maximize the economic value associated with the storage and transportation capacity it owns or controls most of these arrangements are with regulated affiliates of the company and have been approved by applicable state regulatory commissions generally these arrangements require aps to share with our regulated customers a portion of the profits earned from these arrangements 

 

aes through december 31 2006 provided natural gas management services to our natural gas distribution operations other than the midtex division these services included aggregating and purchasing gas supply arranging transportation and storage logistics and ultimately delivering the gas to our natural gas distribution service areas at competitive prices effective january 1 2007 our shared services function began providing these services to our natural gas distribution operations aes continues to provide limited services to our natural gas distribution divisions and the revenues aes receives are equal to the costs incurred to provide those services 

 

through atmos power systems inc we have constructed electric peaking powergenerating plants and associated facilities and lease these plants through lease agreements that are accounted for as sales under generally accepted accounting principles 

 

results for this segment are primarily impacted by seasonal weather patterns and similar to our natural gas marketing segment volatility in the natural gas markets additionally this segment’s results include an unrealized component as aps hedges its risk associated with its asset optimization activities 

review of financial and operating results 

 

financial and operational highlights for our pipeline storage and other segment for the fiscal years ended september 30 2008 and 2007 are presented below 

 

 

 

pipeline storage and other gross profit decreased 43 million primarily due to a 67 million decrease in asset optimization margins as a result of a less volatile natural gas market the decrease in asset optimization margins was partially offset by an increase of 26 million in unrealized margins associated with asset optimization activities 

 

operating expenses decreased 23 million primarily due to the absence in the current year of a 30 million noncash charge recorded in the prior year related to the writeoff of costs associated with a natural gas gathering project 

fiscal year ended september 30 2007 compared with fiscal year ended september 30 2006 

 

natural gas distribution segment 

 

financial and operational highlights for our natural gas distribution segment for the fiscal years ended september 30 2007 and 2006 are presented below 

 

 

 

the following table shows our operating income by natural gas distribution division for the fiscal years ended september 30 2007 and 2006 the presentation of our natural gas distribution operating income is included for financial reporting purposes and may not be appropriate for ratemaking purposes 

 

 

 

 

  

the 276 million increase in natural gas distribution gross profit primarily reflects a nine percent increase in throughput and the impact of having wna coverage for more than 90 percent of our residential 

and commercial customers partially offset by an accrual for estimated unrecoverable gas costs and lower irrigation margins discussed below the impact of higher throughput and greater wna coverage increased gross profit by 386 million included in this amount was a 108 million increase associated with the implementation of wna in our midtex and louisiana divisions beginning with the 20062007 winter heating season 

 

as a result of the midtex rate case our gas distribution gross profit increased by 54 million compared to the prior year this increase was partially offset by a decrease in midtex transportation revenue as the rate case reduced the transportation rates for certain customer classes the midtex rate case also required the refund of 29 million collected under grip which reduced gross profit in the current year 

 

favorable regulatory activity in the current year increased gross profit by 244 million primarily due to an 118 million increase in griprelated recoveries and a 102 million increase from our rate stabilization clause rsc filings in our louisiana service areas these increases were partially offset by an 116 million decrease in gross profit associated with regulatory rulings in our tennessee louisiana and virginia jurisdictions 

 

offsetting these increases in gross profit was a reduction in revenuerelated taxes due to a significant decline in the cost of gas in the currentyear period compared with the prioryear period franchise and state gross receipts taxes included in gross profit decreased approximately 27 million however franchise and state gross receipts tax expense recorded as a component of taxes other than income decreased 54 million which resulted in a 27 million increase in operating income when compared with the prioryear period 

 

natural gas distribution gross profit also reflects a 75 million accrual for estimated unrecoverable gas costs the remaining decrease in gross profit primarily is attributable to lower irrigation margins and a reduction in passthrough surcharges used to recover various costs as these costs were fully recovered by the end of fiscal 2006 and during fiscal 2007 

 

operating expenses which include operation and maintenance expense provision for doubtful accounts depreciation and amortization expense taxes other than income and impairment of longlived assets increased to 7315 million for the fiscal year ended september 30 2007 from 7232 million for the fiscal year ended september 30 2006 

 

operation and maintenance expense excluding the provision for doubtful accounts increased 224 million primarily due to increased employee and other administrative costs these increases include the personnel and other operating costs associated with the transfer of our gas supply function from our pipeline storage and other segment to our natural gas distribution segment effective january 1 2007 partially offsetting these increases was the deferral of 43 million of operation and maintenance expense in our louisiana division resulting from the louisiana public service commission’s ruling to allow recovery of all incremental operation and maintenance expense incurred in fiscal 2005 and 2006 in connection with our hurricane katrina recovery efforts 

 

the provision for doubtful accounts decreased 08 million to 198 million for the fiscal year ended september 30 2007 the decrease primarily was attributable to reduced collection risk as a result of lower natural gas prices in the natural gas distribution segment the average cost of natural gas for the fiscal year ended september 30 2007 was 809 per mcf compared with 1002 per mcf for the year ended september 30 2006 

 

depreciation and amortization expense increased 127 million for the fiscal year ended september 30 2007 compared with the prioryear period the increase was primarily attributable to increases in assets placed in service during fiscal 2007 additionally the increase was partially attributable to the absence in the currentyear period of a 28 million reduction in depreciation expense recorded in the prioryear period arising from the mississippi public service commission’s decision to allow certain deferred costs in our rate base 

 

operating expenses for the fiscal year ended september 30 2007 included a 33 million noncash charge associated with the writeoff of costs for software that will no longer be used fiscal 2006 results included a 229 million noncash charge to impair the west texas division irrigation properties 

interest charges 

 

interest charges allocated to the natural gas distribution segment for the fiscal year ended september 30 2007 decreased to 1216 million from 1265 million for the fiscal year ended september 30 2006 the decrease primarily was attributable to lower average outstanding shortterm debt balances in the currentyear period compared with the prioryear period 

 

regulated transmission and storage segment 

 

financial and operational highlights for our regulated transmission and storage segment for the fiscal years ended september 30 2007 and 2006 are presented below 

 

 

 

the 221 million increase in gross profit primarily is attributable to a 23 percent increase in throughput due to colder weather in the current year and incremental volumes from the north side loop and other compression projects these activities increased gross profit by 162 million of which 108 million was associated with our north side loop and other compression projects completed in fiscal 2006 increases in gross profit also include a 31 million increase from rate adjustments resulting from our 2005 grip filing a 21 million increase from the sale of excess gas inventory and a 20 million increase from new or renegotiated blending and capacity enhancement contracts 

 

operating expenses increased to 834 million for the fiscal year ended september 30 2007 from 778 million for the fiscal year ended september 30 2006 due to higher administrative and other operating costs primarily associated with the north side loop and other compression projects that were completed in fiscal 2006 

 

interest charges 

 

interest charges allocated to the pipeline and storage segment for the fiscal year ended september 30 2007 increased to 279 million from 228 million for the fiscal year ended september 30 2006 the increase was attributable to the use of updated allocation factors for fiscal 2007 these factors are reviewed and updated on an annual basis 

natural gas marketing segment 

 

financial and operational highlights for our natural gas marketing segment for the fiscal years ended september 30 2007 and 2006 are presented below 

 

 

 

the 263 million decrease in our natural gas marketing segment’s gross profit primarily reflects a 302 million decrease in delivered gas margins this decrease reflects the impact of a less volatile market which reduced opportunities to take advantage of pricing differences between hubs partially offset by a 31 percent increase in sales volumes attributable to successful execution of our marketing strategies and colder weather in the 2007 fiscal year compared with the 2006 fiscal year 

 

asset optimization margins increased 26 million compared with the 2006 fiscal year the increase reflects greater cycled storage volumes as a result of accelerating storage withdrawals scheduled in future periods to capture greater arbitrage gains during the currentyear period partially offset by an increase in storage fees and park and loan fees which reduced the arbitrage spreads available 

 

gross profit margin was also favorably impacted by a 13 million increase in unrealized margins attributable to a narrowing of the spreads between current cash prices and forward natural gas prices the change in unrealized margins also reflects the recognition of previously unrealized margins as a component of realized margins as a result of injecting and withdrawing gas and settling financial instruments as a part of aem’s asset optimization activities 

 

operating expenses which include operation and maintenance expense provision for doubtful accounts depreciation and amortization expense and taxes other than income taxes increased to 293 million for the fiscal year ended september 30 2007 from 284 million for the fiscal year ended september 30 2006 the increase in operating expense primarily was attributable to an increase in employee and other administrative costs 

 

miscellaneous income 

 

miscellaneous income increased to 64 million for the fiscal year ended september 30 2007 from 26 million for the fiscal year ended september 30 2006 the increase primarily was attributable to increased investment income earned on overnight investments during the currentyear period combined with increased 

interest income earned on our margin account associated with increased margin requirements during the current year 

 

interest charges 

 

interest charges for the fiscal year ended september 30 2007 decreased to 58 million from 85 million for the fiscal year ended september 30 2006 the decrease was attributable to lower borrowing requirements during the currentyear period 

 

pipeline storage and other segment 

 

financial and operational highlights for our pipeline storage and other segment for the fiscal years ended september 30 2007 and 2006 are presented below 

 

 

 

gross profit increased 81 million primarily due to aps’ ability to capture more favorable arbitrage spreads from its asset optimization activities an increase in asset optimization contracts and increased transportation margins 

 

operating expenses increased to 104 million for the fiscal year ended september 30 2007 from 96 million for the fiscal year ended september 30 2006 primarily due to a 30 million noncash charge associated with the writeoff of costs associated with a natural gas gathering project this increase was partially offset by a decrease in employee and other administrative costs associated with the transfer of gas supply operations from the pipeline storage and other segment to our natural gas distribution segment effective january 1 2007 

 

miscellaneous income 

 

miscellaneous income increased to 82 million for the fiscal year ended september 30 2007 from 69 million for the fiscal year ended september 30 2006 the increase was primarily attributable to 21 million received from leasing certain mineral interests coupled with an increase in interest income recorded in the pipeline storage and other segment 

 

interest charges 

 

interest charges allocated to the pipeline storage and other segment for the fiscal year ended september 30 2007 decreased to 61 million from 65 million for the fiscal year ended september 30 2006 

the decrease was attributable to the use of updated allocation factors for fiscal 2007 these factors are reviewed and updated on an annual basis 

 

liquidity and capital resources 

 

our internally generated funds and borrowings under our credit facilities and commercial paper program generally provide the liquidity needed to fund our working capital capital expenditures and other cash needs additionally from time to time we raise funds from the public debt and equity capital markets to fund our liquidity needs 

 

we normally access the commercial paper markets to finance our working capital needs and growth however recent adverse developments in global financial and credit markets including the recent failure of a major investment bank and the bailout of or merger between several large financial institutions have made it more difficult and more expensive for the company to access the shortterm capital markets including the commercial paper market to satisfy our liquidity requirements 

 

consequently as of september 30 2008 we had borrowed 3305 million directly under our fiveyear committed credit facility that backstops our commercial paper program to fund most of our working capital until recently our fiveyear committed credit facility allowed us to borrow up to 600 million however one lender with a 555 share of the commitments has ceased funding under the facility this has effectively limited the amount that we can borrow to approximately 567 million the amounts borrowed under the credit facility have been primarily used to purchase large volumes of natural gas in preparation for the upcoming winter heating season although our natural gas marketing operations have not been impacted directly in a significant manner yet continued disruptions in the capital markets could adversely affect the availability of the uncommitted demand credit facility on which such operations substantially relies to conduct its business a significant reduction in such availability would mean that the company would need to provide extra liquidity to support the activities of our natural gas marketing business and other nonregulated businesses our ability to provide extra liquidity is limited by the terms of our existing lending arrangements with aeh 

 

we have historically supplemented our commercial paper program with a shortterm 300 million committed credit facility that must be renewed annually there were no borrowings under this facility as of september 30 2008 in october 2008 we replaced this facility upon its termination with a new facility that will allow borrowings up to 2125 million and expires in october 2009 additionally as more fully described in note 5 the borrowing costs under the new facility will be significantly higher than under the prior facility 

 

we believe the amounts available to us under our existing and new credit facilities coupled with operating cash flow will provide the necessary liquidity to fund our working capital needs capital expenditures and other expenditures for fiscal year 2009 

 

cash flows 

 

our internally generated funds may change in the future due to a number of factors some of which we cannot control these include regulatory changes the price for our services the demand for our services margin requirements resulting from significant changes in commodity prices operational risks and other factors 

 

cash flows from operating activities 

 

yearoveryear changes in our operating cash flows primarily are attributable to changes in net income working capital changes particularly within our natural gas distribution segment resulting from the price of natural gas and the timing of customer collections payments for natural gas purchases and deferred gas cost recoveries 

 

for the fiscal year ended september 30 2008 we generated operating cash flow of 3709 million compared with 5471 million in fiscal 2007 and 3114 million in fiscal 2006 the significant factors impacting our operating cash flow for the last three fiscal years are summarized below 

fiscal year ended september 30 2008 

 

operating cash flows were 1762 million lower in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 the decrease primarily reflects an increase in cash required to collateralize risk management liabilities in our natural gas marketing segment which reduced operating cash flow by 957 million and the unfavorable timing of gas cost collections in our natural gas distribution segment which reduced operating cash flow by 926 million 

 

fiscal year ended september 30 2007 

 

fiscal 2007 operating cash flows reflect the favorable timing of payments for accounts payable and accrued liabilities which increased operating cash flow by 1076 million additionally improved management of our deferred gas costs balances increased operating cash flow by 1252 million finally increased net income and other favorable working capital changes contributed to the increase in operating cash flow partially offsetting these increases in operating cash flow was a decrease in customer collections of 848 million due to the decrease in the price of natural gas during the fiscal year 

 

fiscal year ended september 30 2006 

 

fiscal 2006 operating cash flows reflect the adverse impact of significantly higher natural gas prices yearoveryear unfavorable timing of payments for accounts payable and other accrued liabilities reduced operating cash flow by 5230 million partially offsetting these outflows were higher customer collections 2451 million and reduced payments for natural gas inventories 1021 million additionally favorable movements in the market indices used to value our natural gas marketing segment risk management assets and liabilities reduced the amount that we were required to deposit in margin accounts and therefore favorably affected operating cash flow by 1263 million 

 

cash flows from investing activities 

 

in recent fiscal years a substantial portion of our cash resources has been used to fund acquisitions and growth projects our ongoing construction program and improvements to information systems our ongoing construction program enables us to provide natural gas distribution services to our existing customer base expand our natural gas distribution services into new markets enhance the integrity of our pipelines and more recently expand our intrastate pipeline network in executing our current rate strategy we are directing discretionary capital spending to jurisdictions that permit us to earn a timely return on our investment currently our midtex louisiana mississippi and west texas natural gas distribution divisions and our atmos pipeline — texas division have rate designs that provide the opportunity to include in their rate base approved capital costs on a periodic basis without being required to file a rate case 

 

for the fiscal year ended september 30 2008 we incurred 4723 million for capital expenditures compared with 3924 million for the fiscal year ended september 30 2007 and 4253 million for the fiscal year ended september 30 2006 the increase in fiscal 2008 primarily reflects an increase in compliance spending and main replacements in our midtex division spending in the natural gas distribution segment for our new automated meter reading initiative and spending for two nonregulated growth projects the decrease in capital expenditures in fiscal 2007 primarily reflects the absence of capital expenditures associated with our north side loop and other pipeline compression projects which were completed during the fiscal 2006 third quarter 

 

cash flows from financing activities 

 

for the fiscal years ended september 30 2008 and 2006 our financing activities provided 981 million and 1553 million in cash compared with cash of 1593 million used for the fiscal year ended september 30 2007 our significant financing activities for the fiscal years ended september 30 2008 2007 and 2006 are summarized as follows 

 

 56 

  

  

the following table shows the number of shares issued for the fiscal years ended september 30 2008 2007 and 2006 

 

 

 

credit facilities 

 

as of september 30 2008 we had three committed credit facilities totaling 918 million these facilities included 1 a fiveyear 600 million unsecured facility expiring december 2011 2 a 300 million unsecured 364day facility expiring october 2008 and 3 an 18 million unsecured facility expiring march 2009 however one lender with a 555 share of the commitments under our 600 million and 300 million facilities has ceased funding under these facilities further in october 2008 we replaced our 300 million facility at its termination with a new 2125 million unsecured 364day facility after giving effect to these changes the amount available to us under our committed credit facilities was 7972 million as of september 30 2008 we had no outstanding letters of credit under these facilities 

aem has an uncommitted credit facility that can provide up to 580 million as of september 30 2008 the amount available to us under this credit facility net of outstanding letters of credit was 2121 million borrowings under our uncommitted credit facilities are made on a whenandasneeded basis at the discretion of the banks our credit capacity and the amount of unused borrowing capacity are affected by the seasonal nature of the natural gas business and our shortterm borrowing requirements which are typically highest during colder winter months 

 

our working capital needs can vary significantly due to changes in the price of natural gas charged by suppliers and the increased gas supplies required to meet customers’ needs during periods of cold weather however we believe these credit facilities combined with our operating cash flows will be sufficient to fund our working capital needs our fiscal 2009 capital expenditure program and our common stock dividends these facilities are described in further detail in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements 

 

shelf registration 

 

on december 4 2006 we filed a registration statement with the securities and exchange commission sec to issue from time to time up to 900 million in new common stock andor debt securities available for issuance as of september 30 2008 we had approximately 450 million available for issuance under the registration statement due to certain restrictions imposed by one state regulatory commission on our ability to issue securities under the registration statement we are permitted to issue a total of approximately 200 million of equity securities and 250 million of senior debt securities in addition due to restrictions imposed by another state regulatory commission if the credit ratings on our senior unsecured debt were to fall below investment grade from either standard  poor’s corporation bbb moody’s investors services inc baa3 or fitch ratings ltd bbb our ability to issue any type of debt securities under the registration statement would be suspended until an investment grade rating from all three credit rating agencies was achieved 

 

credit ratings 

 

our credit ratings directly affect our ability to obtain shortterm and longterm financing in addition to the cost of such financing in determining our credit ratings the rating agencies consider a number of quantitative factors including debt to total capitalization operating cash flow relative to outstanding debt operating cash flow coverage of interest and pension liabilities and funding status in addition the rating agencies consider qualitative factors such as consistency of our earnings over time the quality of our management and business strategy the risks associated with our regulated and nonregulated businesses and the regulatory structures that govern our rates in the states where we operate 

 

our debt is rated by three rating agencies standard  poor’s corporation sp moody’s investors services inc moody’s and fitch ratings ltd fitch our current debt ratings are all considered investment grade and are as follows 

 

 

 

currently with respect to our unsecured senior longterm debt sp maintains its positive outlook and fitch maintains its stable outlook moody’s recently reaffirmed its stable outlook none of our ratings are currently under review however a significant reduction in our liquidity caused by more limited access to the private and public credit markets as a result of the recent adverse global financial and credit conditions could trigger a negative change in our ratings outlook or even a reduction in our credit ratings by the three credit rating agencies this would mean even more limited access to the private and public credit markets and an increase in the costs of such borrowings 

 

a credit rating is not a recommendation to buy sell or hold securities the highest investment grade credit rating for sp is aaa moody’s is aaa and fitch is aaa the lowest investment grade credit rating for sp is bbb moody’s is baa3 and fitch is bbb our credit ratings may be revised or withdrawn at any time by the rating agencies and each rating should be evaluated independent of any other rating there can be 

no assurance that a rating will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if in its judgment circumstances so warrant 

 

debt covenants 

 

we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants as of september 30 2008 our debt covenants are described in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements 

 

capitalization 

 

the following table presents our capitalization as of september 30 2008 and 2007 

 

 

 

total debt as a percentage of total capitalization including shortterm debt was 546 percent and 537 percent at september 30 2008 and 2007 the increase in the debt to capitalization ratio primarily reflects an increase in natural gas prices as of september 30 2008 compared to the prior year our ratio of total debt to capitalization is typically greater during the winter heating season as we make additional shortterm borrowings to fund natural gas purchases and meet our working capital requirements we intend to maintain our capitalization ratio in a target range of 50 to 55 percent through cash flow generated from operations continued issuance of new common stock under our direct stock purchase plan and retirement savings plan and access to the equity capital markets 

contractual obligations and commercial commitments 

 

the following table provides information about contractual obligations and commercial commitments at september 30 2008 

 

 

 

 

  

aem has commitments to purchase physical quantities of natural gas under contracts indexed to the forward nymex strip or fixed price contracts at september 30 2008 aem was committed to purchase 558 bcf within one year 356 bcf within one to three years and 05 bcf after three years under indexed contracts aem was committed to purchase 15 bcf within one year and less than 01 bcf within one to three years under fixed price contracts with prices ranging from 358 to 1320 per mcf 

with the exception of our midtex division our natural gas distribution segment maintains supply contracts with several vendors that generally cover a period of up to one year commitments for estimated base gas volumes are established under these contracts on a monthly basis at contractually negotiated prices commitments for incremental daily purchases are made as necessary during the month in accordance with the terms of the individual contract our midtex division maintains longterm supply contracts to ensure a reliable source of gas for our customers in its service area which obligate it to purchase specified volumes at market prices the estimated commitments under these contract terms as of september 30 2008 are reflected in the table above 

 

risk management activities 

 

we conduct risk management activities through our natural gas distribution natural gas marketing and pipeline storage and other segments in our natural gas distribution segment we use a combination of physical storage fixed physical contracts and fixed financial contracts to reduce our exposure to unusually large winterperiod gas price increases in our natural gas marketing and pipeline storage and other segments we manage our exposure to the risk of natural gas price changes and lock in our gross profit margin through a combination of storage and financial instruments including futures overthecounter and exchangetraded options and swap contracts with counterparties to the extent our inventory cost and actual sales and actual purchases do not correlate with the changes in the market indices we use in our hedges we could experience ineffectiveness or the hedges may no longer meet the accounting requirements for hedge accounting resulting in the financial instruments being treated as mark to market instruments through earnings 

 

we record our financial instruments as a component of risk management assets and liabilities which are classified as current or noncurrent based upon the anticipated settlement date of the underlying financial instrument substantially all of our financial instruments are valued using external market quotes and indices 

 

the following table shows the components of the change in fair value of our natural gas distribution segment’s financial instruments for the fiscal year ended september 30 2008 in thousands 

 

 

 

the fair value of our natural gas distribution segment’s financial instruments at september 30 2008 is presented below by time period and fair value source

the fair value of our natural gas marketing segment’s financial instruments at september 30 2008 is presented below by time period and fair value source 

 

 

 

pension and postretirement benefits obligations 

 

net periodic pension and postretirement benefit costs 

 

for the fiscal year ended september 30 2008 our total net periodic pension and other benefits costs was 479 million compared with 486 million and 500 million for the fiscal years ended september 30 2007 and 2006 these costs relating to our natural gas distribution operations are recoverable through our gas distribution rates however a portion of these costs is capitalized into our gas distribution rate base the remaining costs are recorded as a component of operation and maintenance expense 

 

our total net periodic pension and other benefit costs remained relatively unchanged during the currentyear period when compared with the prioryear period as the assumptions we made during our annual pension plan valuation completed june 30 2007 were consistent with the prior year the discount rate used to compute the present value of a plan’s liabilities generally is based on rates of highgrade corporate bonds with maturities similar to the average period over which the benefits will be paid at our june 30 2007 measurement date the interest rates were consistent with rates at our prioryear measurement date which resulted in no change to our 630 percent discount rate used to determine our fiscal 2008 net periodic and postretirement cost in addition our expected return on our pension plan assets remained constant at 825 percent 

 

the decrease in total net periodic pension and other benefits costs during fiscal 2007 compared with fiscal 2006 primarily reflects changes in assumptions we made during our annual pension plan valuation completed june 30 2006 the discount rate used to compute the present value of a plan’s liabilities generally is based on rates of highgrade corporate bonds with maturities similar to the average period over which the benefits will be paid in the period leading up to our june 30 2006 measurement date these interest rates were increasing which resulted in a 130 basis point increase in our discount rate used to determine our fiscal 2007 net periodic and postretirement cost to 630 percent this increase had the effect of decreasing the present value of our plan liabilities and associated expenses this favorable impact was partially offset by the unfavorable impact of reducing the expected return on our pension plan assets by 25 basis points to 825 percent which has the effect of increasing our pension and postretirement benefit costs 

pension and postretirement plan funding 

 

generally our funding policy is to contribute annually an amount that will at least equal the minimum amount required to comply with the employee retirement income security act of 1974 however additional voluntary contributions are made from time to time as considered necessary contributions are intended to provide not only for benefits attributed to service to date but also for those expected to be earned in the future 

 

during fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2006 we voluntarily contributed 23 million and 29 million to the atmos energy corporation retirement plan for mississippi valley gas union employees these contributions achieved a desired level of funding for this plan for plan years 2007 and 2005 during fiscal 2007 we did not contribute to our pension plans 

 

we contributed 96 million 118 million and 109 million to our postretirement benefits plans for the fiscal years ended september 30 2008 2007 and 2006 the contributions represent the portion of the postretirement costs we are responsible for under the terms of our plan and minimum funding required by state regulatory commissions 

 

outlook for fiscal 2009 

 

effective october 1 2008 the company adopted the requirement under sfas 158 employers’ accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans an amendment of fasb statements no 87 88 106 and 132r that the measurement date used to determine our projected benefit and postretirement obligations and net periodic pension and postretirement costs must correspond to a fiscal year end in accordance with the transition rules the fiscal 2009 expense will be based upon market conditions as of september 30 2008 

 

as of september 30 2008 interest and corporate bond rates utilized to determine our discount rates which will impact our fiscal 2009 net periodic pension and postretirement costs were significantly higher than the interest and corporate bond rates as of june 30 2007 the measurement date for our fiscal 2008 net periodic cost accordingly we increased our discount rate used to determine our fiscal 2009 pension and benefit costs to 757 we maintained the expected return on our pension plan assets at 825 percent despite the recent decline in the financial markets as we believe this rate reflects the average rate of expected earnings on plan assets that will fund our projected benefit obligation although the fair value of our plan assets has declined as the financial markets have declined the impact of this decline is mitigated by the fact that assets are smoothed for purposes of determining net periodic pension cost accordingly asset gains and losses are recognized over time as a component of net periodic pension and benefit costs for our pension account plan our largest funded plan accordingly we expect our fiscal 2009 pension and postretirement medical costs to be materially the same as in fiscal 2008 

 

despite the recent decline in the fair value of the plans’ assets we were not required to make a minimum funding contribution to our pension plans during fiscal 2008 however based upon market conditions subsequent to september 30 2008 the current funded position of the plans and the new funding requirements under the pension protection act ppa we believe it is reasonably possible that we will be required to contribute to the plans in fiscal 2009 further we will consider whether an additional voluntary contribution is prudent to maintain certain ppa funding thresholds however we cannot anticipate with certainty whether such contributions will be made and the amount of such contributions with respect to our postretirement medical plans we anticipate contributing approximately 38 million during fiscal 2009 

 

the projected pension liability future funding requirements and the amount of pension expense or income recognized for the plan are subject to change depending upon the actuarial value of plan assets and the determination of future benefit obligations as of each subsequent actuarial calculation date these amounts are impacted by actual investment returns changes in interest rates and changes in the demographic composition of the participants in the plan 

recent accounting developments 

 

recent accounting developments and their impact on our financial position results of operations and cash flows are described in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements 

 

tablestart 


 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend  

we are exposed to risks associated with commodity prices and interest rates commodity price risk is the potential loss that we may incur as a result of changes in the fair value of a particular instrument or commodity interestrate risk results from our portfolio of debt and equity instruments that we issue to provide financing and liquidity for our business activities 

 

we conduct risk management activities through both our natural gas distribution and natural gas marketing segments in our natural gas distribution segment we use a combination of physical storage fixed physical contracts and fixed financial contracts to protect us and our customers against unusually large winter period gas price increases in our natural gas marketing segment we manage our exposure to the risk of natural gas price changes and lock in our gross profit margin through a combination of storage and financial instruments including futures overthecounter and exchangetraded options and swap contracts with counterparties our risk management activities and related accounting treatment are described in further detail in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements additionally our earnings are affected by changes in shortterm interest rates as a result of our issuance of shortterm commercial paper and our other shortterm borrowings 

 

commodity price risk 

 

natural gas distribution segment 

 

we purchase natural gas for our natural gas distribution operations substantially all of the costs of gas purchased for natural gas distribution operations are recovered from our customers through purchased gas adjustment mechanisms therefore our natural gas distribution operations have limited commodity price risk exposure 

 

natural gas marketing and pipeline storage and other segments 

 

our natural gas marketing segment is also exposed to risks associated with changes in the market price of natural gas for our natural gas marketing segment we use a sensitivity analysis to estimate commodity price risk for purposes of this analysis we estimate commodity price risk by applying a 050 change in the forward nymex price to our net open position including existing storage and related financial contracts at the end of each period based on aeh’s net open position including existing storage and related financial contracts at september 30 2008 of 05 bcf a 050 change in the forward nymex price would have had a 03 million impact on our consolidated net income 

 

changes in the difference between the indices used to mark to market our physical inventory gas daily and the related fairvalue hedge nymex can result in volatility in our reported net income but over time gains and losses on the sale of storage gas inventory will be offset by gains and losses on the fairvalue hedges based upon our net physical position at september 30 2008 and assuming our hedges would still qualify as highly effective a 050 change in the difference between the gas daily and nymex indices would impact our reported net income by approximately 28 million 

 

additionally these changes could cause us to recognize a risk management liability which would require us to place cash into an escrow account to collateralize this liability position this in turn would reduce the amount of cash we would have on hand to fund our working capital needs 

 

interest rate risk 

 

our earnings are exposed to changes in shortterm interest rates associated with our shortterm commercial paper program and other shortterm borrowings we use a sensitivity analysis to estimate our shortterm 

interest rate risk for purposes of this analysis we estimate our short term interest rate risk as the difference between our actual interest expense for the period and estimated interest expense for the period assuming a hypothetical average one percent increase in the interest rates associated with our shortterm borrowings had interest rates associated with our shortterm borrowings increased by an average of one percent our interest expense would have increased by approximately 21 million during 2008 

 

we also assess market risk for our fixed rate longterm obligations we estimate market risk for our longterm obligations as the potential increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical one percent decrease in interest rates associated with these debt instruments fair value is estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis assuming this one percent hypothetical decrease the fair value of our longterm obligations would have increased by approximately 1442 million 

 

as of september 30 2008 we were not engaged in other activities that would cause exposure to the risk of material earnings or cash flow loss due to changes in interest rates or market commodity prices

the board of directors and shareholders of atmos energy corporation 

 

we have audited atmos energy corporation’s internal control over financial reporting as of september 30 2008 based on criteria established in internal control — integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission the coso criteria atmos energy corporation’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying management’s report on internal control over financial reporting our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit 

 

we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting assessing the risk that a material weakness exists testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion 

 

a company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

 

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

 

in our opinion atmos energy corporation maintained in all material respects effective internal control over financial reporting as of september 30 2008 based on the coso criteria 

 

we also have audited in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states the consolidated balance sheets as of september 30 2008 and 2007 and the related statements of income stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended september 30 2008 of atmos energy corporation and our report dated november 18 2008 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon

overview 

 

atmos energy corporation headquartered in dallas texas is engaged primarily in the regulated natural gas distribution and transmission and storage businesses as well as other nonregulated natural gas businesses we are one of the country’s largest naturalgasonly distributors based on number of customers and one of the largest intrastate pipeline operators in texas based upon miles of pipe as of september 30 2007 we distributed natural gas through sales and transportation arrangements to approximately 32 million residential commercial public authority and industrial customers through our six regulated natural gas distribution divisions which covered service areas in 12 states our primary service areas are located in colorado kansas kentucky louisiana mississippi tennessee and texas we have more limited service areas in georgia illinois iowa missouri and virginia in addition we transport natural gas for others through our distribution system 

 

through our nonregulated businesses we primarily provide natural gas management and marketing services to municipalities other local gas distribution companies and industrial customers in 22 states and natural gas transportation and storage services to certain of our natural gas distribution divisions and to third parties 

 

we were organized under the laws of texas in 1983 as energas company for the purpose of owning and operating the natural gas distribution business of pioneer corporation in texas in september 1988 we changed our name to atmos energy corporation as a result of the merger with united cities gas company in july 1997 we also became incorporated in virginia 

 

operating segments 

 

through august 31 2007 our operations were divided into four segments 

 

  

during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 we completed a series of organizational changes and began reporting the results of our operations under the following new segments effective september 1 2007 

 

 4 

 

strategy 

 

our overall strategy is to 

 

  

over the last five fiscal years we have primarily grown through two significant acquisitions our acquisition in december 2002 of mississippi valley gas company mvg and our acquisition in october 2004 of the natural gas distribution and pipeline operations of txu gas company txu gas 

 

we have experienced over 20 consecutive years of increasing dividends and earnings growth after giving effect to our acquisitions we have achieved this record of growth while efficiently managing our operating and maintenance expenses and leveraging our technology such as our 24hour call centers to achieve more efficient operations in addition we have focused on regulatory rate proceedings to increase revenue to recover rising costs and mitigated weatherrelated risks through weathernormalized rates in most of our service areas we have also strengthened our nonregulated businesses by increasing gross profit margins expanding commercial opportunities in our regulated transmission and storage segment and actively pursuing opportunities to increase the amount of storage available to us 

 

our core values include focusing on our employees and customers while conducting our business with honesty and integrity we continue to strengthen our culture through ongoing communications with our employees and enhanced employee training 

 

natural gas distribution segment overview 

 

our natural gas distribution segment consisted of the following six regulated divisions during the year ended september 30 2007 

 

  

our natural gas distribution business is a seasonal business gas sales to residential and commercial customers are greater during the winter months than during the remainder of the year the volumes of gas sales during the winter months will vary with the temperatures during these months 

 

in addition to seasonality financial results for this segment are affected by the cost of natural gas and economic conditions in the areas that we serve higher gas costs which we are generally able to pass through to our customers under purchased gas adjustment clauses may cause customers to conserve or in the case of industrial customers to use alternative energy sources higher gas costs may also adversely impact our accounts receivable collections resulting in higher bad debt expense and may require us to increase borrowings under our credit facilities resulting in higher interest expense 

 

the effect of weather that is above or below normal is substantially offset through weather normalization adjustments known as wna which are now approved by the regulatory authorities for over 90 percent of residential and commercial meters in our service areas wna allows us to increase customers’ bills to offset lower gas usage when weather is warmer than normal and decrease customers’ bills to offset higher gas usage when weather is colder than normal 

as of september 30 2007 we had wna for our residential and commercial meters in the following service areas for the following periods 

 

 

 

our supply of natural gas is provided by a variety of suppliers including independent producers marketers and pipeline companies and withdrawals of gas from proprietary and contracted storage assets additionally the natural gas supply for our midtex division includes peaking and spot purchase agreements 

 

supply arrangements are contracted from our suppliers on a firm basis with various terms at market prices the firm supply consists of both base load and swing supply peaking quantities base load quantities are those that flow at a constant level throughout the month and swing supply quantities provide the flexibility to change daily quantities to match increases or decreases in requirements related to weather conditions 

 

currently all of our natural gas distribution divisions except for our midtex division utilize 37 pipeline transportation companies both interstate and intrastate to transport our natural gas the pipeline transportation agreements are firm and many of them have “pipeline nonotice” storage service which provides for daily balancing between system requirements and nominated flowing supplies these agreements have been negotiated with the shortest term necessary while still maintaining our right of first refusal the natural gas supply for our midtex division is delivered by our atmos pipeline — texas division 

 

except for local production purchases we select our natural gas suppliers through a competitive bidding process by requesting proposals from suppliers that have demonstrated that they can provide reliable service we select these suppliers based on their ability to deliver gas supply to our designated firm pipeline receipt points at the lowest cost major suppliers during fiscal 2007 were anadarko energy services bp energy company chesapeake energy marketing inc conocophillips company devon gas services lp enbridge marketing us lp national fuel marketing company llc oneok energy services company lp tenaska marketing and atmos energy marketing llc our natural gas marketing subsidiary 

 

the combination of base load peaking and spot purchase agreements coupled with the withdrawal of gas held in storage allows us the flexibility to adjust to changes in weather which minimizes our need to enter into longterm firm commitments we estimate our peakday availability of natural gas supply to be approximately 42 bcf the peakday demand for our natural gas distribution operations in fiscal 2007 was on february 15 2007 when sales to customers reached approximately 34 bcf 

 

to maintain our deliveries to high priority customers we have the ability and have exercised our right to curtail deliveries to certain customers under the terms of interruptible contracts or applicable state statutes or regulations our customers’ demand on our system is not necessarily indicative of our ability to meet current or anticipated market demands or immediate delivery requirements because of factors such as the physical limitations of gathering storage and transmission systems the duration and severity of cold weather the availability of gas reserves from our suppliers the ability to purchase additional supplies on a shortterm basis and actions by federal and state regulatory authorities curtailment rights provide us the flexibility to meet the humanneeds requirements of our customers on a firm basis priority allocations imposed by federal and state regulatory agencies as well as other factors beyond our control may affect our ability to meet the demands of our customers we anticipate no problems with obtaining additional gas supply as needed for our customers 

 

the following briefly describes our six natural gas distribution divisions we operate in our service areas under terms of nonexclusive franchise agreements granted by the various cities and towns that we serve at 

september 30 2007 we held 1106 franchises having terms generally ranging from five to 35 years a significant number of our franchises expire each year which require renewal prior to the end of their terms we believe that we will be able to renew our franchises as they expire additional information concerning our natural gas distribution divisions is presented under the caption “operating statistics” 

 

atmos energy midtex division our midtex division serves approximately 550 communities in the northcentral eastern and western parts of texas including the dallasfort worth metroplex this division currently operates under one systemwide rate structure however the governing body of each municipality we serve has original jurisdiction over all gas distribution rates operations and services within its city limits except with respect to sales of natural gas for vehicle fuel and agricultural use the railroad commission of texas rrc has exclusive appellate jurisdiction over all rate and regulatory orders and ordinances of the municipalities and exclusive original jurisdiction over rates and services to customers not located within the limits of a municipality this division participates in texas’ gas reliability infrastructure program grip which allows us to include in rate base annually approved capital costs incurred in the prior calendar year the program also requires us to file a complete rate case at least once every five years 

 

atmos energy kentuckymidstates division our kentuckymidstates division operates in more than 420 communities across georgia illinois iowa kentucky missouri tennessee and virginia the service areas in these states are primarily rural however this division serves franklin tennessee which is less than 20 miles from downtown nashville we update our rates in this division through periodic formal rate filings made with each state’s public service commission 

 

atmos energy louisiana division in louisiana we serve nearly 300 communities including the suburban areas of new orleans the metropolitan area of monroe and western louisiana direct sales of natural gas to industrial customers in louisiana who use gas for fuel or in manufacturing processes and sales of natural gas for vehicle fuel are exempt from regulation and are recognized in our natural gas marketing segment our rates in this division are updated annually through a stable rate filing without filing a formal rate case 

 

atmos energy west texas division our west texas division serves approximately 80 communities in west texas including the amarillo lubbock and midland areas like our midtex division each municipality we serve has original jurisdiction over all gas distribution rates operations and services within its city limits similarly the west texas division also participates in grip which requires us to file a complete rate case at least once every five years 

 

atmos energy mississippi division in mississippi we serve about 110 communities throughout the northern half of the state including the jackson metropolitan area our rates in the mississippi division are updated annually through a stable rate filing without filing a formal rate case 

 

atmos energy coloradokansas division our coloradokansas division serves approximately 170 communities throughout colorado and kansas and in the southwestern corner of missouri including olathe kansas and greeley colorado olathe is a southern suburb of kansas city near the missouri border greeley is located 20 miles outside of denver we update our rates in this division through periodic formal rate filings made with each state’s public service commission

natural gas marketing segment overview 

 

our natural gas marketing activities are conducted through atmos energy marketing aem which is whollyowned by atmos energy holdings inc aeh a whollyowned subsidiary of aec which operates in 22 states aem provides a variety of natural gas management services to municipalities natural gas utility systems and industrial natural gas consumers primarily in the southeastern and midwestern states and to our coloradokansas kentuckymidstates and louisiana divisions these services primarily consist of furnishing natural gas supplies at fixed and marketbased prices contract negotiation and administration load forecasting gas storage acquisition and management services transportation services peaking sales and balancing services capacity utilization strategies and gas price hedging through the use of derivative instruments we use proprietary and customerowned transportation and storage assets to provide the various services our customers request as a result our revenues arise from the types of commercial transactions we have structured with our customers and include the value we extract by optimizing the storage and transportation capacity we own or control as well as revenues for services we deliver 

 

to optimize the storage and transportation capacity we own or control we participate in transactions in which we combine the natural gas commodity and transportation costs to minimize our costs incurred to serve our customers by identifying the lowest cost alternative within the natural gas supplies transportation and markets to which we have access additionally we engage in natural gas storage transactions in which we seek to find and profit from the pricing differences that occur over time we purchase physical natural gas and then sell financial contracts at favorable prices to lock in a gross profit margin through the use of transportation and storage services and derivative contracts we are able to capture gross profit margin through 

the arbitrage of pricing differences in various locations and by recognizing pricing differences that occur over time 

 

aem’s management of natural gas requirements involves the sale of natural gas and the management of storage and transportation supplies under contracts with customers generally having one to two year terms aem also sells natural gas to some of its industrial customers on a delivered burner tip basis under contract terms from 30 days to two years

pipeline storage and other segment overview 

 

our pipeline storage and other segment primarily consists of the operations of atmos pipeline and storage llc aps atmos energy services llc aes and atmos power systems inc which are each whollyowned by aeh 

 

aps owns or has an interest in underground storage fields in kentucky and louisiana we use these storage facilities to reduce the need to contract for additional pipeline capacity to meet customer demand during peak periods additionally beginning in fiscal 2006 aps initiated activities in the natural gas gathering business as of september 30 2007 these activities were limited in nature 

 

aes through december 31 2006 provided natural gas management services to our natural gas distribution operations other than the midtex division these services included aggregating and purchasing gas supply arranging transportation and storage logistics and ultimately delivering the gas to our natural gas distribution service areas at competitive prices effective january 1 2007 our shared services function began providing these services to our natural gas distribution operations aes continues to provide limited services to our natural gas distribution divisions and the revenues aes receives are equal to the costs incurred to provide those services 

 

through atmos power systems inc we have constructed electric peaking powergenerating plants and associated facilities and lease these plants through lease agreements that are accounted for as sales under generally accepted accounting principles 

 

through january 2004 united cities propane gas inc a whollyowned subsidiary of atmos energy holdings inc owned an approximate 19 percent membership interest in us propane lp usp a joint venture formed in february 2000 with other utility companies to own a limited partnership interest in heritage propane partners lp heritage a publiclytraded marketer of propane through a nationwide retail distribution network during fiscal 2004 we sold our interest in usp and heritage as a result of these transactions we no longer have an interest in the propane business

ratemaking activity 

 

overview 

 

the method of determining regulated rates varies among the states in which our natural gas distribution divisions operate the regulatory authorities have the responsibility of ensuring that utilities under their jurisdictions operate in the best interests of customers while providing utility companies the opportunity to earn a reasonable return on their investment generally each regulatory authority reviews rate requests and establishes a rate structure intended to generate revenue sufficient to cover the costs of doing business and to provide a reasonable return on invested capital 

 

rates established by regulatory authorities often include cost adjustment mechanisms that i are subject to significant price fluctuations compared to the utility’s other costs ii represent a large component of the utility’s cost of service and iii are generally outside the control of the utility 

 

purchased gas mechanisms represent a common form of cost adjustment mechanism purchased gas adjustment mechanisms provide gas utility companies a method of recovering purchased gas costs on an ongoing basis without filing a rate case because they provide a dollarfordollar offset to increases or decreases in natural gas distribution gas costs therefore although substantially all of our natural gas distribution operating revenues fluctuate with the cost of gas that we purchase natural gas distribution gross profit which is defined as operating revenues less purchased gas cost is generally not affected by fluctuations in the cost of gas 

 

additionally some jurisdictions have introduced performancebased ratemaking adjustments to provide incentives to natural gas utilities to minimize purchased gas costs through improved storage management and use of financial hedges to lock in gas costs under the performancebased ratemaking adjustment purchased gas costs savings are shared between the utility company and its customers 

 

current ratemaking strategy 

 

our current rate strategy focuses on seeking rate designs that reduce or eliminate regulatory lag and separate the recovery of our approved margins from customer usage patterns due to weatherrelated variability declining use per customer and energy conservation also known as decoupling additionally we are seeking to stratify rates to benefit low income households and to recover the gas cost portion of our bad debt expense 

 

improving rate design is a longterm process in the interim we are addressing regulatory lag issues by directing discretionary capital spending to jurisdictions that permit us to recover our investment timely and file rate cases on a more frequent basis to minimize the regulatory lag to keep our actual returns more closely aligned with our allowed returns 

recent ratemaking activity 

 

approximately 97 percent of our natural gas distribution revenues in the fiscal years ended september 30 2007 2006 and 2005 were derived from sales at rates set by or subject to approval by local or state authorities of that amount approximately 90 percent of our rate increases over the last three fiscal years have been obtained through rate making mechanisms that allow us to automatically refresh our rates without filing a formal rate case net annual revenue increases resulting from ratemaking activity totaling 401 million 390 million and 63 million became effective in fiscal 2007 2006 and 2005 as summarized below 

 

 

 

additionally the following ratemaking efforts were initiated during fiscal 2007 but had not been completed as of september 30 2007

our recent ratemaking activity is discussed in greater detail below 

 

grip filings 

 

as discussed above in the “natural gas distribution segment overview” grip allows natural gas utility companies the opportunity to include in their rate base annually approved capital costs incurred in the prior calendar year the following table summarizes our grip filings with effective dates during the years ended september 30 2007 2006 and 2005

stable rate filings 

 

as an instrument to reduce regulatory lag a stable rate filing is a regulatory mechanism designed to allow us to refresh our rates on a periodic basis without filing a formal rate case as discussed above in the “natural gas distribution segment overview” we currently have stable rate filings in our louisiana and mississippi divisions the following table summarizes our recent stable rate filings 

 

 

 

rate case filings 

 

a rate case is a formal request from atmos energy to a state’s commission to increase rates that are charged to customers rate cases may also be initiated when the regulatory authorities request us to justify our rates this process is referred to as a “show cause” action adequate rates are intended to provide for recovery of the company’s costs as well as a fair rate of return to our shareholders as well as ensure that we continue to deliver reliable reasonably priced natural gas service to our customers the following table summarizes our recent rate cases 

 

 

see footnotes on the following page 

 

  

other ratemaking activity 

 

the following table summarizes other ratemaking activity during the years ended september 30 2007 2006 and 2005 

 

 

 

in december 2006 the louisiana public service commission issued a staff report allowing the deferral of 43 million in operating and maintenance expenses in our louisiana division to allow recovery of all incremental operation and maintenance expense incurred in fiscal 2005 and 2006 in connection with our hurricane katrina recovery efforts 

 

in september 2006 our midtex division filed its annual gas cost reconciliation with the rrc the filing reflects approximately 24 million in refunds of amounts that were overcollected from customers between july 2005 and june 2006 the midtex division received approval to refund these amounts over a sixmonth period which began in november 2006 the ruling had no impact on the gross profit for the midtex division 

 

in may 2007 our midtex division filed a 36month gas contract review filing this filing is mandated by prior rrc orders and covers the prudence of gas purchases made from november 2003 through october 2006 which total approximately 27 billion an agreedupon procedural schedule has been filed with the rrc which established a hearing schedule beginning in december 2007 

in august 2007 our coloradokansas division agreed with the colorado office of consumer counsel and the staff of the colorado public utility commission to issue a onetime credit to our colorado customers of 11 million on customer bills in january 2008 

 

other regulation 

 

each of our natural gas distribution divisions is regulated by various state or local public utility authorities we are also subject to regulation by the united states department of transportation with respect to safety requirements in the operation and maintenance of our gas distribution facilities in addition our distribution operations are also subject to various state and federal laws regulating environmental matters from time to time we receive inquiries regarding various environmental matters we believe that our properties and operations substantially comply with and are operated in substantial conformity with applicable safety and environmental statutes and regulations there are no administrative nor judicial proceedings arising under environmental quality statutes pending or known to be contemplated by governmental agencies which would have a material adverse effect on us or our operations our environmental claims have arisen primarily from former manufactured gas plant sites in tennessee iowa and missouri 

 

the federal energy regulatory commission ferc allows pursuant to section 311 of the natural gas policy act gas transportation services through our atmos pipeline — texas assets “on behalf of” interstate pipelines or local distribution companies served by interstate pipelines without subjecting these assets to the jurisdiction of the ferc 

 

competition 

 

although our natural gas distribution operations are not currently in significant direct competition with any other distributors of natural gas to residential and commercial customers within our service areas we do compete with other natural gas suppliers and suppliers of alternative fuels for sales to industrial and agricultural customers we compete in all aspects of our business with alternative energy sources including in particular electricity electric utilities offer electricity as a rival energy source and compete for the space heating water heating and cooking markets promotional incentives improved equipment efficiencies and promotional rates all contribute to the acceptability of electrical equipment the principal means to compete against alternative fuels is lower prices and natural gas historically has maintained its price advantage in the residential commercial and industrial markets however higher gas prices coupled with the electric utilities’ marketing efforts have increased competition for residential and commercial customers in addition aem competes with other natural gas brokers in obtaining natural gas supplies for our customers 

 

employees 

 

at september 30 2007 we had 4653 employees consisting of 4526 employees in our regulated operations and 127 employees in our nonregulated operations

 item 1a   risk factors tableend  

our financial and operating results are subject to a number of factors many of which are not within our control although we have tried to discuss key risk factors below please be aware that other risks may prove to be important in the future these factors include the following 

 

we are subject to regulation by each state in which we operate that affect our operations and financial results 

 

our natural gas distribution and regulated transmission and storage businesses are subject to various regulated returns on our rate base in each jurisdiction in which we operate we monitor the allowed rates of return and our effectiveness in earning such rates and initiate rate proceedings or operating changes as we believe are needed in addition in the normal course of the regulatory environment assets may be placed in service and historical test periods established before rate cases can be filed that could result in an adjustment of our returns once rate cases are filed regulatory bodies have the authority to suspend implementation of the new rates while studying the cases because of this process we must suffer the negative financial effects of having placed assets in service without the benefit of rate relief which is commonly referred to as “regulatory lag” in addition rate cases involve a risk of rate reduction because once rates have been approved they are still subject to challenge for their reasonableness by appropriate regulatory authorities our debt and equity financings are also subject to approval by regulatory bodies in several states which could limit our ability to take advantage of favorable market conditions 

 

our business could also be affected by deregulation initiatives including the development of unbundling initiatives in the natural gas industry unbundling is the separation of the provision and pricing of local distribution gas services into discrete components it typically focuses on the separation of the distribution and gas supply components and the resulting opening of the regulated components of sales services to alternative unregulated suppliers of those services although we believe that our enhanced technology and distribution system infrastructures have positively positioned us we cannot provide assurance that there would be no significant adverse effect on our business should unbundling or further deregulation of the natural gas distribution service business occur 

 

our operations are exposed to market risks that are beyond our control which could adversely affect our financial results 

 

our risk management operations are subject to market risks beyond our control including market liquidity commodity price volatility and counterparty creditworthiness 

 

although we maintain a risk management policy we may not be able to completely offset the price risk associated with volatile gas prices or the risk in our natural gas marketing and pipeline and storage segments which could lead to volatility in our earnings physical trading also introduces price risk on any net open positions at the end of each trading day as well as volatility resulting from intraday fluctuations of gas prices and the potential for daily price movements between the time natural gas is purchased or sold for future delivery and the time the related purchase or sale is hedged although we manage our business to maintain no 

open positions there are times when limited net open positions related to our physical storage may occur on a shortterm basis the determination of our net open position as of the end of any particular trading day requires us to make assumptions as to future circumstances including the use of gas by our customers in relation to our anticipated storage and market positions because the price risk associated with any net open position at the end of such day may increase if the assumptions are not realized we review these assumptions as part of our daily monitoring activities net open positions may increase volatility in our financial condition or results of operations if market prices move in a significantly favorable or unfavorable manner because the timing of the recognition of profits or losses on the hedges for financial accounting purposes usually do not match up with the timing of the economic profits or losses on the item being hedged this volatility may occur with a resulting increase or decrease in earnings or losses even though the expected profit margin is essentially unchanged from the date the transactions were consummated further if the local physical markets in which we trade do not move consistently with the nymex futures market we could experience increased volatility in the financial results of our natural gas marketing and pipeline and storage segments 

 

our natural gas marketing and pipeline storage and other segments manage margins and limit risk exposure on the sale of natural gas inventory or the offsetting fixedprice purchase or sale commitments for physical quantities of natural gas through the use of a variety of financial derivatives however contractual limitations could adversely affect our ability to withdraw gas from storage which could cause us to purchase gas at spot prices in a rising market to obtain sufficient volumes to fulfill customer contracts we could also realize financial losses on our efforts to limit risk as a result of volatility in the market prices of the underlying commodities or if a counterparty fails to perform under a contract in addition adverse changes in the creditworthiness of our counterparties could limit the level of trading activities with these parties and increase the risk that these parties may not perform under a contract 

 

we are also subject to interest rate risk on our commercial paper borrowings in recent years we have been operating in a relatively low interestrate environment with both short and longterm interest rates being relatively low compared to historical interest rates however in the last three years the federal reserve has taken actions that have generally resulted in increases in shortterm interest rates future increases in interest rates could adversely affect our future financial results 

 

the concentration of our distribution pipeline and storage operations in the state of texas has increased the exposure of our operations and financial results to economic conditions and regulatory decisions in texas 

 

as a result of our acquisition of the distribution pipeline and storage operations of txu gas in october 2004 over 50 percent of our natural gas distribution customers and most of our pipeline and storage assets and operations are located in the state of texas this concentration of our business in texas means that our operations and financial results are subject to greater impact than before from changes in the texas economy in general and regulatory decisions by state and local regulatory authorities 

 

adverse weather conditions could affect our operations 

 

beginning in the 20062007 winter heating season we have had weathernormalized rates for over 90 percent of our residential and commercial meters which has substantially mitigated the adverse effects of warmerthannormal weather for meters in those service areas however our natural gas distribution and regulated transmission and storage operating results may continue to vary somewhat with the actual temperatures during the winter heating season in addition sustained cold weather could adversely affect our natural gas marketing operations as we may be required to purchase gas at spot rates in a rising market to obtain sufficient volumes to fulfill some customer contracts 

 

the execution of our business plan could be affected by an inability to access capital markets 

 

we rely upon access to both shortterm and longterm capital markets to satisfy our liquidity requirements adverse changes in the economy or these markets the overall health of the industries in which we 

operate and changes to our credit ratings could limit access to these markets increase our cost of capital or restrict the execution of our business plan 

 

our longterm debt is currently rated as “investment grade” by standard  poor’s corporation sp moody’s investors services inc moody’s and fitch ratings ltd fitch the three credit rating agencies that rate our longterm debt securities there can be no assurance that these rating agencies will maintain investment grade ratings for our longterm debt if we were to lose our investmentgrade rating the commercial paper markets and the commodity derivatives markets could become unavailable to us this would increase our borrowing costs for working capital and reduce the borrowing capacity of our gas marketing affiliate in addition if our commercial paper ratings were lowered it would increase the cost of commercial paper financing and could reduce or eliminate our ability to access the commercial paper markets if we were unable to issue commercial paper at reasonable rates we would likely borrow under our bank credit facilities to meet our working capital needs which would likely increase the cost of our working capital financing 

 

inflation and increased gas costs could adversely impact our customer base and customer collections and increase our level of indebtedness 

 

inflation has caused increases in some of our operating expenses and has required assets to be replaced at higher costs we have a process in place to continually review the adequacy of our natural gas distribution gas rates in relation to the increasing cost of providing service and the inherent regulatory lag in adjusting those gas rates historically we have been able to budget and control operating expenses and investments within the amounts authorized to be collected in rates and intend to continue to do so however the ability to control expenses is an important factor that could influence future results 

 

rapid increases in the price of purchased gas which has occurred in recent years cause us to experience a significant increase in shortterm debt we must pay suppliers for gas when it is purchased which can be significantly in advance of when these costs may be recovered through the collection of monthly customer bills for gas delivered increases in purchased gas costs also slow our natural gas distribution collection efforts as customers are more likely to delay the payment of their gas bills leading to higher than normal accounts receivable this could result in higher shortterm debt levels greater collection efforts and increased bad debt expense 

 

our growth in the future may be limited by the nature of our business which requires extensive capital spending 

 

we must continually build additional capacity in our natural gas distribution system to maintain the growth in the number of our customers the cost of adding this capacity may be affected by a number of factors including the general state of the economy and weather our cash flows from operations generally are sufficient to supply funding for all our capital expenditures including the financing of the costs of new construction along with capital expenditures necessary to maintain our existing natural gas system due to the timing of these cash flows and capital expenditures we often must fund at least a portion of these costs through borrowing funds from third party lenders the cost of which is dependent on the interest rates at the time this in turn may limit our ability to connect new customers to our system due to constraints on the amount of funds we can invest in our infrastructure 

 

our operations are subject to increased competition 

 

in the residential and commercial customer markets our natural gas distribution operations compete with other energy products such as electricity and propane our primary product competition is with electricity for heating water heating and cooking increases in the price of natural gas could negatively impact our competitive position by decreasing the price benefits of natural gas to the consumer this could adversely impact our business if as a result our customer growth slows reducing our ability to make capital expenditures or if our customers further conserve their use of gas resulting in reduced gas purchases and customer billings 

in the case of industrial customers such as manufacturing plants and agricultural customers adverse economic conditions including higher gas costs could cause these customers to use alternative sources of energy such as electricity or bypass our systems in favor of special competitive contracts with lower perunit costs our regulated transmission and storage operations currently face limited competition from other existing intrastate pipelines and gas marketers seeking to provide or arrange transportation storage and other services for customers however competition may increase if new intrastate pipelines are constructed near our existing facilities 

 

the cost of providing pension and postretirement health care benefits is subject to changes in pension fund values changing demographics and actuarial assumptions and may have a material adverse effect on our financial results 

 

we provide a cashbalance pension plan and postretirement healthcare benefits to eligible fulltime employees our costs of providing such benefits is subject to changes in the market value of our pension fund assets changing demographics including longer life expectancy of beneficiaries and an expected increase in the number of eligible former employees over the next five to ten years and various actuarial calculations and assumptions the actuarial assumptions used may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions higher or lower withdrawal rates and interest rates and other factors these differences may result in a significant impact on the amount of pension expense or other postretirement benefit costs recorded in future periods 

 

we are subject to environmental regulations which could adversely affect our operations or financial results 

 

we are subject to laws regulations and other legal requirements enacted or adopted by federal state and local governmental authorities relating to protection of the environment and health and safety matters including those legal requirements that govern discharges of substances into the air and water the management and disposal of hazardous substances and waste the cleanup of contaminated sites groundwater quality and availability plant and wildlife protection as well as work practices related to employee health and safety environmental legislation also requires that our facilities sites and other properties associated with our operations be operated maintained abandoned and reclaimed to the satisfaction of applicable regulatory authorities failure to comply with these laws regulations permits and licenses may expose us to fines penalties or interruptions in our operations that could be significant to our financial results in addition existing environmental regulations may be revised or our operations may become subject to new regulations such revised or new regulations could result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

distributing and storing natural gas involve risks that may result in accidents and additional operating costs 

 

our natural gas distribution business involves a number of hazards and operating risks that cannot be completely avoided such as leaks accidents and operational problems which could cause loss of human life as well as substantial financial losses resulting from property damage damage to the environment and to our operations we do have liability and property insurance coverage in place for many of these hazards and risks however because our pipeline storage and distribution facilities are near or are in populated areas any loss of human life or adverse financial results resulting from such events could be large if these events were not fully covered by insurance our financial position and results of operations could be adversely affected 

 

natural disasters terrorist activities or other significant events could adversely affect our operations or financial results 

 

natural disasters are always a threat to our assets and operations in addition the threat of terrorist activities could lead to increased economic instability and volatility in the price of natural gas that could affect our operations also companies in our industry may face a heightened risk of exposure to actual acts of terrorism which could subject our operations to increased risks as a result the availability of insurance 

covering such risks may be more limited which could increase the risk that an event could adversely affect future financial results

several factors exist that could influence our future financial performance some of which are described in item 1a above “risk factors” they should be considered in connection with evaluating forwardlooking statements contained in this report or otherwise made by or on behalf of us since these factors could cause actual results and conditions to differ materially from those set out in such forwardlooking statements 

 

cautionary statement for the purposes of the safe harbor under the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 

 

the statements contained in this annual report on form 10k may contain “forwardlooking statements” within the meaning of section 27a of the securities act of 1933 and section 21e of the securities exchange act of 1934 all statements other than statements of historical fact included in this report are forwardlooking statements made in good faith by us and are intended to qualify for the safe harbor from liability established by the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 when used in this report or any other of our documents or oral presentations the words “anticipate” “believe” “estimate” “expect” “forecast” “goal” “intend” “objective” “plan” “projection” “seek” “strategy” or similar words are intended to identify forwardlooking statements such forwardlooking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the statements relating to our strategy operations markets services rates recovery of costs availability of gas supply and other factors these risks and uncertainties include the following regulatory trends and decisions including deregulation initiatives and the impact of rate proceedings before various state regulatory commissions market risks beyond our control affecting our risk management activities including market liquidity commodity price volatility increasing interest rates and counterparty creditworthiness the concentration of our distribution pipeline and storage operations in one state adverse weather conditions our ability to continue to access the capital markets the effects of inflation and changes in the availability and prices of natural gas including the volatility of natural gas prices the capitalintensive nature of our distribution business increased competition from energy suppliers and alternative forms of energy increased costs of providing pension and postretirement health care benefits the impact of environmental regulations on our business the inherent hazards and risks involved in operating our distribution business natural disasters terrorist activities or other events and other risks and uncertainties discussed herein especially in item 1a above all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond our control accordingly while we believe these forwardlooking statements to be reasonable there can be no assurance that they will approximate actual experience or that the expectations derived from them will be realized further we undertake no obligation to update or revise any of our forwardlooking statements whether as a result of new information future events or otherwise 

 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

 

our consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and the related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities we based our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including those related to risk management and trading activities allowance for doubtful accounts legal and environmental accruals insurance accruals pension and postretirement obligations deferred income taxes and the valuation of goodwill indefinitelived intangible assets and other longlived 

assets our critical accounting policies are reviewed by the audit committee quarterly actual results may differ from estimates 

 

regulation — our natural gas distribution and regulated transmission and storage operations are subject to regulation with respect to rates service maintenance of accounting records and various other matters by the respective regulatory authorities in the states in which we operate our regulated operations are accounted for in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas 71 accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation  this statement requires costbased rateregulated entities that meet certain criteria to reflect the financial effects of the ratemaking and accounting practices and policies of the various regulatory commissions in their financial statements we record regulatory assets for costs that have been deferred for which future recovery through customer rates is considered probable regulatory liabilities are recorded when it is probable that revenues will be reduced for amounts that will be credited to customers through the ratemaking process as a result certain costs that would normally be expensed under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states are permitted to be capitalized or deferred on the balance sheet because they can be recovered through rates discontinuing the application of sfas 71 could significantly increase our operating expenses as fewer costs would likely be capitalized or deferred on the balance sheet which could reduce our net income further regulation may impact the period in which revenues or expenses are recognized the amounts to be recovered or recognized are based upon historical experience and our understanding of the regulations the impact of regulation on our natural gas distribution operations may be affected by decisions of the regulatory authorities or the issuance of new regulations 

 

revenue recognition — sales of natural gas to our natural gas distribution customers are billed on a monthly cycle basis however the billing cycle periods for certain classes of customers do not necessarily coincide with accounting periods used for financial reporting purposes we follow the revenue accrual method of accounting for natural gas distribution segment revenues whereby revenues applicable to gas delivered to customers but not yet billed under the cycle billing method are estimated and accrued and the related costs are charged to expense revenue is recognized in our regulated transmission and storage segment as the services are provided 

 

on occasion we are permitted to implement new rates that have not been formally approved by our regulatory authorities and are subject to refund as permitted by sfas no 71 we recognize this revenue and establish a reserve for amounts that could be refunded based on our experience for the jurisdiction in which the rates were implemented 

 

rates established by regulatory authorities are adjusted for increases and decreases in our purchased gas costs through purchased gas adjustment mechanisms purchased gas adjustment mechanisms provide gas utility companies a method of recovering purchased gas costs on an ongoing basis without filing a rate case to address all of the utility company’s nongas costs these mechanisms are commonly utilized when regulatory authorities recognize a particular type of expense such as purchased gas costs that i is subject to significant price fluctuations compared to the utility company’s other costs ii represents a large component of the utility company’s cost of service and iii is generally outside the control of the gas utility company there is no gross profit generated through purchased gas adjustments but they provide a dollarfordollar offset to increases or decreases in utility gas costs although substantially all natural gas distribution sales to our customers fluctuate with the cost of gas that we purchase our gross profit is generally not affected by fluctuations in the cost of gas as a result of the purchased gas adjustment mechanism the effects of these purchased gas adjustment mechanisms are recorded as deferred gas costs on our balance sheet 

 

energy trading contracts resulting in the delivery of a commodity in which we are the principal in the transaction are recorded as natural gas marketing sales or purchases at the time of physical delivery realized gains and losses from the settlement of financial instruments that do not result in physical delivery related to our natural gas marketing energy trading contracts are included as a component of natural gas marketing revenues 

 

operating revenues for our pipeline storage and other segment are recognized in the period in which actual volumes are transported and storage services are provided 

allowance for doubtful accounts — we record an allowance for doubtful accounts against amounts due to reduce the net receivable balance to the amount we reasonably expect to collect based upon our collections experiences and our assessment of our customers’ inability or reluctance to pay however if circumstances change our estimate of the recoverability of accounts receivable could be different circumstances which could affect our estimates include but are not limited to customer credit issues the level of natural gas prices and general economic conditions accounts are written off once they are deemed to be uncollectible 

 

derivatives and hedging activities — our natural gas distribution segment uses a combination of physical storage and financial derivatives to partially insulate our natural gas distribution customers against gas price volatility during the winter heating season these financial derivatives have not been designated as hedges pursuant to sfas 133 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  accordingly they are recorded at fair value however because the costs associated with and the gains and losses arising from these financial derivatives are included in our purchased gas adjustment mechanisms changes in the fair value of these financial derivatives are initially recorded as a component of deferred gas costs and recognized in the consolidated statement of income as a component of purchased gas costs when the related costs are recovered through our rates in accordance with sfas 71 accordingly there is no earnings impact to our natural gas distribution segment as a result of the use of financial derivatives 

 

our natural gas marketing and pipeline storage and other segments are exposed to commodity price risk associated with our natural gas inventories and in our natural gas marketing segment on our fixedprice contracts we manage this risk through a combination of physical storage and financial derivatives including futures overthecounter and exchangetraded options and swap contracts with counterparties option contracts provide the right but not the requirement to buy or sell the commodity at a fixed price swap contracts require receipt of payment for the commodity based on the difference between a fixed price and the market price on the settlement date the use of these contracts is subject to our risk management policies which are monitored for compliance daily 

 

we have designated the natural gas inventory held by atmos energy marketing and atmos pipeline and storage llc as the hedged item in a fairvalue hedge this inventory is marked to market at the end of each month based on the gas daily index with changes in fair value recognized as unrealized gains or losses in revenue in the period of change the derivatives associated with this natural gas inventory have been designated as fair value hedges and are marked to market each month based upon the nymex price with changes in fair value recognized as unrealized gains or losses in the period of change the difference in the spot price used to value our physical inventory gas daily and the forward price used to value the related fairvalue hedges nymex are reported as a component of revenue and can result in volatility in our reported net income we have elected to exclude this spotforward differential for purposes of assessing the effectiveness of these fairvalue hedges 

 

we recognize revenue and the associated carrying value of the inventory inclusive of storage costs as purchased gas costs in our consolidated statement of income when we sell the gas and deliver it out of the storage facility over time we expect gains and losses on the sale of storage gas inventory to be offset by gains and losses on the fairvalue hedges resulting in the realization of the economic gross profit margin we anticipated at the time we structured the original transaction 

 

we have elected to treat our fixedprice forward contracts as normal purchases and sales and have designated the associated derivative contracts as cash flow hedges of anticipated transactions accordingly unrealized gains and losses on these open derivative contracts are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income and are recognized in earnings as a component of revenue when the hedged volumes are sold hedge ineffectiveness to the extent incurred is reported as a component of revenue 

 

additionally our natural gas marketing segment utilizes storage swaps and futures to capture additional storage arbitrage opportunities that arise subsequent to the execution of the original fair value hedge associated with our physical natural gas inventory basis swaps to insulate and protect the economic value of our fixed price and storage books and various overthecounter and exchangetraded options although the purpose of these instruments is to either reduce basis or other risks or lock in arbitrage opportunities these derivative 

instruments have not been designated as hedges pursuant to sfas 133 accordingly these derivative instruments are recorded at fair value with all changes in fair value included in revenue 

 

in addition to mitigating commodity price risk we periodically manage our exposure to interest rate changes by entering into treasury lock agreements to fix the treasury yield component of the interest cost associated with anticipated financings we have designated each of our previously executed treasury lock agreements as a cash flow hedge of an anticipated transaction at the time the agreements were executed accordingly unrealized gains and losses associated with the treasury lock agreements are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income the realized gain or loss recognized upon settlement of the treasury lock agreement is initially recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income and is recognized as a component of interest expense over the life of the related financing arrangement 

 

the fair value of all of our financial derivatives is determined through a combination of prices actively quoted on national exchanges prices provided by other external sources and prices based on models and other valuation methods changes in the valuation of our financial derivatives primarily result from changes in market prices the valuation of the portfolio of our contracts maturity and settlement of these contracts and newly originated transactions each of which directly affect the estimated fair value of our derivatives we believe the market prices and models used to value these derivatives represent the best information available with respect to closing exchange and overthecounter quotations time value and volatility factors underlying the contracts values are adjusted to reflect the potential impact of an orderly liquidation of our positions over a reasonable period of time under then current market conditions 

 

impairment assessments — we perform impairment assessments of our goodwill intangible assets subject to amortization and longlived assets we currently have no indefinitelived intangible assets 

 

we annually evaluate our goodwill balances for impairment during our second fiscal quarter or as impairment indicators arise we use a present value technique based on discounted cash flows to estimate the fair value of our reporting units we have determined our reporting units to be each of our natural gas distribution divisions and whollyowned subsidiaries goodwill is allocated to the reporting units responsible for the acquisition that gave rise to the goodwill the discounted cash flow calculations used to assess goodwill impairment are dependent on several subjective factors including the timing of future cash flows future growth rates and the discount rate an impairment charge is recognized if the carrying value of a reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds its fair value 

 

we annually assess whether the cost of our intangible assets subject to amortization or other longlived assets is recoverable or that the remaining useful lives may warrant revision we perform this assessment more frequently when specific events or circumstances have occurred that suggest the recoverability of the cost of the intangible and other longlived assets is at risk 

 

when such events or circumstances are present we assess the recoverability of these assets by determining whether the carrying value will be recovered through expected future cash flows from the operating division or subsidiary to which these assets relate these cash flow projections consider various factors such as the timing of the future cash flows and the discount rate and are based upon the best information available at the time the estimate is made changes in these factors could materially affect the cash flow projections and result in the recognition of an impairment charge an impairment charge is recognized as the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value if the sum of the undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying value of the related asset 

 

pension and other postretirement plans  — pension and other postretirement plan costs and liabilities are determined on an actuarial basis and are affected by numerous assumptions and estimates including the market value of plan assets estimates of the expected return on plan assets assumed discount rates and current demographic and actuarial mortality data we review the estimates and assumptions underlying our pension and other postretirement plan costs and liabilities annually based upon a june 30 measurement date the assumed discount rate and the expected return are the assumptions that generally have the most significant impact on our pension costs and liabilities the assumed discount rate the assumed health care cost trend rate 

and assumed rates of retirement generally have the most significant impact on our postretirement plan costs and liabilities 

 

the discount rate is utilized principally in calculating the actuarial present value of our pension and postretirement obligation and net pension and postretirement cost when establishing our discount rate we consider high quality corporate bond rates based on moody’s aa bond index changes in those rates from the prior year and the implied discount rate that is derived from matching our projected benefit disbursements with a high quality corporate bond spot rate curve 

 

the expected longterm rate of return on assets is utilized in calculating the expected return on plan assets component of our annual pension and postretirement plan cost we estimate the expected return on plan assets by evaluating expected bond returns equity risk premiums asset allocations the effects of active plan management the impact of periodic plan asset rebalancing and historical performance we also consider the guidance from our investment advisors in making a final determination of our expected rate of return on assets to the extent the actual rate of return on assets realized over the course of a year is greater than or less than the assumed rate that year’s annual pension or postretirement plan cost is not affected rather this gain or loss reduces or increases future pension or postretirement plan cost over a period of approximately ten to twelve years 

 

we estimate the assumed health care cost trend rate used in determining our postretirement net expense based upon our actual health care cost experience the effects of recently enacted legislation and general economic conditions our assumed rate of retirement is estimated based upon our annual review of our participant census information as of the measurement date 

 

actual changes in the fair market value of plan assets and differences between the actual return on plan assets and the expected return on plan assets could have a material effect on the amount of pension cost ultimately recognized a 025 percent change in our discount rate would impact our pension and postretirement cost by approximately 09 million a 025 percent change in our expected rate of return would impact our pension and postretirement cost by approximately 09 million

atmos energy corporation is involved in the distribution marketing and transportation of natural gas accordingly our results of operations are impacted by the demand for natural gas particularly during the winter heating season and the volatility of the natural gas markets this generally results in higher operating revenues and net income during the period from october through march of each year and lower operating revenues and either lower net income or net losses during the period from april through september of each year as a result of the seasonality of the natural gas industry our second fiscal quarter has historically been our most critical earnings quarter with an average of approximately 63 percent of our consolidated net income having been earned in the second quarter during the three most recently completed fiscal years additionally the seasonality of this industry impacts the levels of accounts receivable accounts payable gas stored underground and shortterm debt balances we report at various time of the fiscal year 

consolidated results 

 

the following table presents our consolidated financial highlights for the fiscal years ended september 30 2007 2006 and 2005 

 

 

 

historically our regulated operations arising from our natural gas distribution operations and beginning in fiscal 2005 from our atmos pipeline — texas division contributed 65 to 85 percent of our consolidated net income however in recent years this contribution has declined due to the growth of our nonregulated natural gas marketing and pipeline and storage businesses coupled with lower natural gas distribution income regulated operations contributed 64 percent 54 percent and 80 percent to our consolidated net income for fiscal years 2007 2006 and 2005 our consolidated net income during the last three fiscal years was earned across our business segments as follows 

 

 

 

the following table segregates our consolidated net income and diluted earnings per share between our regulated and nonregulated operations 

 

 

 

the 14 percent yearoveryear increase in net income during fiscal 2007 reflects improvements across all business segments results from our regulated operations reflect the net favorable impact of various ratemaking rulings in our natural gas distribution segment including the implementation of wna in our mid 

tex and louisiana divisions coupled with increased throughput and incremental gross profit margins from our north side loop and other pipeline compression projects completed in fiscal 2006 the decrease in net income from our nonregulated operations primarily reflects the impact of a less volatile natural gas market which reduced delivered gas margins despite a 31 percent increase in sales volumes however our nonregulated operations benefited from higher asset optimization margins primarily in the pipeline storage and other segment 

 

the nine percent yearoveryear increase in net income during fiscal 2006 primarily reflects strong results in our nonregulated operations partially offset by a decrease in our regulated operations the net income from our nonregulated operations reflect the favorable impact of a volatile natural gas market which provided increased opportunities to maximize delivered gas margins our nonregulated results were also favorably impacted by recording unrealized gains during fiscal 2006 compared to recording unrealized losses in fiscal 2005 the decrease in net income from our regulated operations primarily reflects the adverse effects on our natural gas distribution segment of weather adjusted for wna that was 13 percent warmer than normal the adverse effect of hurricane katrina on our louisiana division and a nonrecurring noncash charge to impair our west texas division irrigation assets 

 

other key financial and significant events for the year ended september 30 2007 include the following

see the following discussion regarding the results of operations for each of our business operating segments 

 

year ended september 30 2007 compared with year ended september 30 2006 

 

natural gas distribution segment 

 

the primary factors that impact the results of our natural gas distribution operations are our ability to earn our authorized rates of return the cost of natural gas competitive factors in the energy industry and economic conditions in our service areas 

 

our ability to earn our authorized rates is based primarily on our ability to improve the rate design in our various ratemaking jurisdictions by reducing or eliminating regulatory lag and ultimately separating the recovery of our approved margins from customer usage patterns improving rate design is a longterm process and is further complicated by the fact that we operate in multiple rate jurisdictions the “ratemaking activity” section of this form 10k describes our current rate strategy and recent ratemaking initiatives in more detail 

 

one example of our recent ratemaking initiatives involves the substantial separation of the recovery of our margins from seasonal weather patterns prior to fiscal 2007 seasonal weather patterns significantly impacted our natural gas distribution results the rate design in our two most weathersensitive jurisdictions the louisiana and midtex divisions which represent approximately 60 percent of our natural gas distribution residential and commercial meters provided for limited weather protection during fiscal 2006 we received wna in these jurisdictions beginning with the 20062007 winter heating season wna substantially offsets the effects of weather that is above or below normal by allowing us to increase the base rate portion of customers’ bills when weather is warmer than normal and to decrease the base rate when weather is colder than normal accordingly gross profit margin in our service areas covered by wna should be based substantially on the amount of gross profit that would result from normal weather despite actual weather conditions that may be either warmer or colder than normal after receiving wna in our louisiana and midtex divisions we have weather protection for over 90 percent of our residential and commercial meters which should substantially reduce the volatility in this segment’s operating results 

 

our natural gas distribution operations are also affected by the cost of natural gas the cost of gas is passed through to our customers without markup therefore increases in the cost of gas are offset by a corresponding increase in revenues accordingly we believe gross profit is a better indicator of our financial performance than revenues however gross profit in our texas and mississippi service areas include franchise fees and gross receipts taxes which are calculated as a percentage of revenue inclusive of gas costs therefore the amount of these taxes included in revenues is influenced by the cost of gas and the level of gas sales volumes we record the tax expense as a component of taxes other than income although changes in revenuerelated taxes arising from changes in gas costs affect gross profit over time the impact is offset within operating income timing differences exist between the recognition of revenue for franchise fees collected from our customers and the recognition of expense of franchise taxes the effect of these timing differences can be significant in periods of volatile gas prices particularly in our midtex division these timing differences may favorably or unfavorably affect net income however these amounts should offset over time with no permanent impact on net income 

 

higher gas costs may also adversely impact our accounts receivable collections resulting in higher bad debt expense and may require us to increase borrowings under our credit facilities resulting in higher interest expense finally higher gas costs as well as competitive factors in the industry and general economic conditions may cause customers to conserve or use alternative energy sources 

review of financial and operating results 

 

financial and operational highlights for our natural gas distribution segment for the year ended september 30 2007 and 2006 are presented below 

 

 

 

the following table shows our operating income by natural gas distribution division for the fiscal years ended september 30 2007 and 2006 the presentation of our natural gas distribution operating income is included for financial reporting purposes and may not be appropriate for ratemaking purposes

the 276 million increase in natural gas distribution gross profit primarily reflects a nine percent increase in throughput and the impact of having wna coverage for more than 90 percent of our residential and commercial customers which increased gross profit by 386 million included in this amount was a 108 million increase associated with the implementation of wna in our midtex and louisiana divisions beginning with the 20062007 winter heating season 

 

as a result of the midtex rate case our gas distribution gross profit increased by 54 million compared to the prior year this increase was partially offset by a decrease in midtex transportation revenue as the rate case reduced the transportation rates for certain customer classes the midtex rate case also required the refund of 29 million collected under grip which reduced gross profit in the current year 

 

favorable regulatory activity in the current year increased gross profit by 244 million primarily due to an 118 million increase in griprelated recoveries and a 102 million increase from our rate stabilization clause rsc filings in our louisiana service areas these increases were partially offset by an 116 million decrease in gross profit associated with regulatory rulings in our tennessee louisiana and virginia jurisdictions 

 

offsetting these increases in gross profit was a reduction in revenuerelated taxes due to a significant decline in the cost of gas in the currentyear period compared with the prioryear period franchise and state gross receipts taxes included in gross profit decreased approximately 17 million however franchise and state gross receipts tax expense recorded as a component of taxes other than income decreased 54 million which resulted in a 37 million increase in operating income when compared with the prioryear period 

 

natural gas distribution gross profit also reflects a 75 million accrual for estimated unrecoverable gas costs the remaining decrease in gross profit primarily is attributable to lower irrigation margins and a reduction in passthrough surcharges used to recover various costs as these costs were fully recovered by the end of fiscal 2006 and during fiscal 2007 

 

operating expenses which include operation and maintenance expense provision for doubtful accounts depreciation and amortization expense taxes other than income and impairment of longlived assets increased to 7315 million for the year ended september 30 2007 from 7232 million for the year ended september 30 2006 

 

operation and maintenance expense excluding the provision for doubtful accounts increased 224 million primarily due to increased employee and other administrative costs these increases include the personnel and other operating costs associated with the transfer of our gas supply function from our pipeline storage and other segment to our natural gas distribution segment effective january 1 2007 partially offsetting these increases was the deferral of 43 million of operation and maintenance expense in our louisiana division resulting from the louisiana public service commission’s ruling to allow recovery of all incremental operation and maintenance expense incurred in fiscal 2005 and 2006 in connection with our hurricane katrina recovery efforts 

 

the provision for doubtful accounts decreased 08 million to 198 million for the year ended september 30 2007 the decrease primarily was attributable to reduced collection risk as a result of lower natural gas prices in the natural gas distribution segment the average cost of natural gas for the year ended september 30 2007 was 809 per mcf compared with 1002 per mcf for the year ended september 30 2006 

 

depreciation and amortization expense increased 127 million for the year ended september 30 2007 compared with the prioryear period the increase was primarily attributable to increases in assets placed in service during fiscal 2007 additionally the increase was partially attributable to the absence in the currentyear period of a 28 million reduction in depreciation expense recorded in the prioryear period arising from the mississippi public service commission’s decision to allow certain deferred costs in our rate base 

 

operating expenses for the year ended september 30 2007 included a 33 million noncash charge associated with the writeoff of costs for software that will no longer be used fiscal 2006 results included a 229 million noncash charge to impair the west texas division irrigation properties 

interest charges 

 

interest charges allocated to the natural gas distribution segment for the year ended september 30 2007 decreased to 1216 million from 1265 million for the year ended september 30 2006 the decrease primarily was attributable to lower average outstanding shortterm debt balances in the currentyear period compared with the prioryear period 

 

regulated transmission and storage segment 

 

our regulated transmission and storage segment consists of the regulated pipeline and storage operations of the atmos pipeline — texas division the atmos pipeline — texas division transports natural gas to our midtex division and third parties and manages five underground storage reservoirs in texas we also provide ancillary services customary in the pipeline industry including parking arrangements lending and sales of inventory on hand 

 

similar to our natural gas distribution segment our regulated transmission and storage segment is impacted by seasonal weather patterns competitive factors in the energy industry and economic conditions in our service areas further as the atmos pipeline — texas division operations supply all of the natural gas for our midtex division the results of this segment are highly dependent upon the natural gas requirements of the midtex division finally as a regulated pipeline the operations of the atmos pipeline — texas division may be impacted by the timing of when costs and expenses are incurred and when these costs and expenses are recovered through its tariffs 

 

review of financial and operating results 

 

financial and operational highlights for our regulated transmission and storage segment for the years ended september 30 2007 and 2006 are presented below 

 

 

 

the 221 million increase in gross profit primarily is attributable to a 23 percent increase in throughput due to colder weather in the current year and incremental volumes from the north side loop and other compression projects these activities increased gross profit by 162 million of which 108 million was associated with our north side loop and other compression projects completed in fiscal 2006 increases in gross profit also include a 31 million increase from rate adjustments resulting from our 2005 grip filing a 

21 million increase from the sale of excess gas inventory and a 20 million increase from new or renegotiated blending and capacity enhancement contracts 

 

operating expenses increased to 834 million for the year ended september 30 2007 from 778 million for the year ended september 30 2006 due to higher administrative and other operating costs primarily associated with the north side loop and other compression projects that were completed in fiscal 2006 

 

interest charges 

 

interest charges allocated to the pipeline and storage segment for the year ended september 30 2007 increased to 279 million from 228 million for the year ended september 30 2006 the increase was attributable to the use of updated allocation factors for fiscal 2007 these factors are reviewed and updated on an annual basis 

 

natural gas marketing segment 

 

our natural gas marketing segment aggregates and purchases gas supply arranges transportation andor storage logistics and ultimately delivers gas to our customers at competitive prices to facilitate this process we utilize proprietary and customerowned transportation and storage assets to provide the various services our customers request including furnishing natural gas supplies at fixed and marketbased prices contract negotiation and administration load forecasting gas storage acquisition and management services transportation services peaking sales and balancing services capacity utilization strategies and gas price hedging through the use of derivative products as a result revenues and gross profit from this segment arise from the types of commercial transactions we have structured with our customers and include the value we extract by optimizing the storage and transportation capacity we own or control as well as revenues for services we perform 

 

to optimize the storage and transportation capacity we own or control we participate in transactions in which we combine the natural gas commodity and transportation costs to minimize our costs incurred to serve our customers by identifying the lowest cost alternative within the natural gas supplies transportation and markets to which we have access additionally we engage in natural gas storage transactions in which we seek to find and profit from the pricing differences that occur over time we purchase physical natural gas and then sell financial contracts at favorable prices to lock in gross profit margins through the use of transportation and storage services and derivative contracts we seek to capture gross profit margin through the arbitrage of pricing differences in various locations and by recognizing pricing differences that occur over time 

 

aem continually manages its net physical position to enhance the future economic profit it captured when an original transaction was executed therefore aem may change its scheduled injection and withdrawal plans from one time period to another based on market conditions or adjust the amount of storage capacity it holds on a discretionary basis in an effort to achieve this objective 

 

the natural gas inventory used in our natural gas marketing storage activities is marked to market at the end of each month based upon the gas daily index with changes in fair value recognized as unrealized gains and losses in the period of change we use derivatives designated as fair value hedges to hedge this natural gas inventory these derivatives are marked to market each month based upon the nymex price with changes in fair value recognized as unrealized gains and losses in the period of change the changes between the spreads between the forward natural gas prices used to value the financial hedges designated against our physical inventory and the market spot prices used to value our physical storage result in the unrealized margins reported as a part of our storage activities until the underlying physical gas is cycled and the related financial derivatives are settled 

 

aem also uses derivative instruments to capture additional storage arbitrage opportunities that arise subsequent to the execution of the original physical inventory hedge and to insulate and protect the economic value within its storage and marketing activities changes in fair value associated with these financial 

instruments are recognized as unrealized gains and losses within aem’s storage and marketing activities until they are settled 

 

review of financial and operating results 

 

financial and operational highlights for our natural gas marketing segment for the years ended september 30 2007 and 2006 are presented below gross profit margin for our natural gas marketing segment consists primarily of margins earned from the delivery of gas and related services requested by our customers and asset optimization activities which are derived from the utilization of our managed proprietary and third party storage and transportation assets to capture favorable arbitrage spreads through natural gas trading activities 

 

unrealized margins represent the unrealized gains or losses on the derivative contracts used by our natural gas marketing segment to manage commodity price risk as described above these margins fluctuate based upon changes in the spreads between the physical and forward natural gas prices generally if the physicalfinancial spread narrows we will record unrealized gains or lower unrealized losses if the physicalfinancial spread widens we will record unrealized losses or lower unrealized gains the magnitude of the unrealized gains and losses is also contingent upon the levels of our net physical position at the end of the reporting period 

 

 

 

the 263 million decrease in our natural gas marketing segment’s gross profit primarily reflects lower delivered gas margins partially offset by higher asset optimization margins 

 

delivered gas margins decreased 302 million compared with the prioryear period this decrease reflects the impact of a less volatile market which reduced opportunities to take advantage of pricing differences between hubs partially offset by a 31 percent increase in sales volumes attributable to successful execution of our marketing strategies and colder weather in the current fiscal year compared with the prior year 

 

asset optimization margins increased 26 million compared with the prioryear period the increase reflects greater cycled storage volumes during the currentyear period partially offset by an increase in storage fees and park and loan fees which reduced the arbitrage spreads available 

 

operating expenses which include operation and maintenance expense provision for doubtful accounts depreciation and amortization expense and taxes other than income taxes increased to 293 million for the 

year ended september 30 2007 from 284 million for the year ended september 30 2006 the increase in operating expense primarily was attributable to an increase in employee and other administrative costs 

 

miscellaneous income 

 

miscellaneous income increased to 64 million for the year ended september 30 2007 from 26 million for the year ended september 30 2006 the increase primarily was attributable to increased investment income earned on overnight investments during the currentyear period combined with increased interest income earned on our margin account associated with increased margin requirements during the current year 

 

interest charges 

 

interest charges for the year ended september 30 2007 decreased to 58 million from 85 million for the year ended september 30 2006 the decrease was attributable to lower borrowing requirements during the currentyear period 

 

economic gross profit 

 

aem monitors the impacts of its asset optimization efforts by estimating the gross profit that it captured through the purchase and sale of physical natural gas and the associated financial derivatives the reconciliation below of the economic gross profit combined with the effect of unrealized gains or losses recognized in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the financial statements in prior periods is presented to provide a measure of the potential gross profit from asset optimization that could occur in future periods if aem’s optimization efforts are executed as planned we consider this measure of potential gross profit a nongaap financial measure as it is calculated using both forwardlooking and historical financial information the following table presents aem’s economic gross profit and its potential gross profit for the last three fiscal years 

 

 

 

as of september 30 2007 based upon aem’s derivatives position and inventory withdrawal schedule the economic gross profit was 408 million this amount is reduced by 108 million of net unrealized gains recorded in the financial statements as of september 30 2007 that will reverse when the inventory is withdrawn and the accompanying financial derivatives are settled therefore the potential gross profit was 300 million this potential gross profit amount will not result in an equal increase in future net income as aem will incur additional storage and other operational expenses and increased income taxes to realize this amount 

 

the economic gross profit is based upon planned injection and withdrawal schedules and the realization of the economic gross profit is contingent upon the execution of this plan weather and other execution factors since aem actively manages and optimizes its portfolio to enhance the future profitability of its storage position it may change its scheduled injection and withdrawal plans from one time period to another based on market conditions therefore we cannot ensure that the economic gross profit or the potential gross profit calculated as of september 30 2007 will be fully realized in the future or in what time period further if we experience operational or other issues which limit our ability to optimally manage our stored gas positions our earnings could be adversely impacted 

pipeline storage and other segment 

 

our pipeline storage and other segment primarily consists of the operations of atmos pipeline and storage llc aps atmos energy services llc aes and atmos power systems inc which are each whollyowned by aeh 

 

aps owns or has an interest in underground storage fields in kentucky and louisiana we use these storage facilities to reduce the need to contract for additional pipeline capacity to meet customer demand during peak periods additionally beginning in fiscal 2006 aps initiated activities in the natural gas gathering business as of september 30 2007 these activities were limited in nature 

 

aes through december 31 2006 provided natural gas management services to our natural gas distribution operations other than the midtex division these services included aggregating and purchasing gas supply arranging transportation and storage logistics and ultimately delivering the gas to our natural gas distribution service areas at competitive prices effective january 1 2007 these activities were moved to our shared services function included in our natural gas distribution segment aes continues to provide limited services to our natural gas distribution divisions and the revenues aes receives are equal to the costs incurred to provide those services 

 

through atmos power systems inc we have constructed electric peaking powergenerating plants and associated facilities and lease these plants through lease agreements that are accounted for as sales under generally accepted accounting principles 

 

results for this segment are primarily impacted by seasonal weather patterns and volatility in the natural gas markets additionally this segment’s results include an unrealized component as aps hedges its risk associated with its asset optimization activities 

 

review of financial and operating results 

 

financial and operational highlights for our pipeline storage and other segment for the years ended september 30 2007 and 2006 are presented below 

 

 

 

gross profit increased 81 million primarily due to aps’ ability to capture more favorable arbitrage spreads from its asset optimization activities an increase in asset optimization contracts and increased transportation margins 

operating expenses increased to 104 million for the year ended september 30 2007 from 96 million for the year ended september 30 2006 primarily due to a 30 million noncash charge associated with the writeoff of costs associated with a natural gas gathering project this increase was partially offset by a decrease in employee and other administrative costs associated with the transfer of gas supply operations from the pipeline storage and other segment to our natural gas distribution segment effective january 1 2007 

 

miscellaneous income 

 

miscellaneous income increased to 82 million for the year ended september 30 2007 from 69 million for the year ended september 30 2006 the increase was primarily attributable to 21 million received from leasing certain mineral interests coupled with an increase in interest income recorded in the pipeline storage and other segment 

 

interest charges 

 

interest charges allocated to the pipeline storage and other segment for the year ended september 30 2007 decreased to 61 million from 65 million for the year ended september 30 2006 the decrease was attributable to the use of updated allocation factors for fiscal 2007 these factors are reviewed and updated on an annual basis 

 

year ended september 30 2006 compared with year ended september 30 2005 

 

natural gas distribution segment 

 

financial and operational highlights for our natural gas distribution segment for the fiscal years ended september 30 2006 and 2005 are presented below 

 

 

the following table shows our operating income by natural gas distribution division for the fiscal years ended september 30 2006 and 2005 the presentation of our natural gas distribution operating income is included for financial reporting purposes and may not be appropriate for ratemaking purposes 

 

 

 

 

  

natural gas distribution gross profit increased to 9251 million for the year ended september 30 2006 from 9074 million for the year ended september 30 2005 total throughput for our natural gas distribution business was 3940 bcf during the current year compared to 4111 bcf in the prior year 

 

the increase in natural gas distribution gross profit despite lower throughput primarily reflects higher franchise fees and state gross receipts taxes which are paid by customers and have no permanent effect on net income additionally margins increased approximately 140 million due to rate increases received from our fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004 grip filings and the recognition of 33 million that had been previously deferred in louisiana following the lpsc’s ratification of our agreement in may 2006 these increases were partially offset by approximately 229 million due to the impact of significantly warmer than normal weather particularly in our midtex and louisiana divisions for the year ended september 30 2006 weather was 13 percent warmer than normal as adjusted for jurisdictions with weathernormalized operations and two percent warmer than the prior year in the midtex and louisiana divisions which did not have weathernormalized rates during the 20052006 winter heating season weather was 28 percent and 22 percent warmer than normal 

 

additionally natural gas distribution gross profit decreased approximately 29 million compared with the prior year in the louisiana division due to the impact of hurricane katrina service has been restored in some areas affected by the storm however it is likely that service will not be restored to all of the affected service areas as more fully described under ratemaking activity we implemented new rates in september 2006 that reflect the impact of hurricane katrina 

 

operating expenses increased to 7232 million for the year ended september 30 2006 from 6710 million for the year ended september 30 2005 the increase reflects a 133 million increase in taxes other than income primarily related to franchise fees and state gross receipts taxes both of which are calculated as a percentage of revenue and are paid by our customers as a component of their monthly bills although these amounts are included as a component of revenue in accordance with our tariffs timing differences between when these amounts are billed to our customers and when we recognize the associated expense may affect net income favorably or unfavorably on a temporary basis however there is no permanent effect on net income 

 

operation and maintenance expense excluding the provision for doubtful accounts increased 78 million primarily due to higher employee costs associated with increased headcount to fill positions that were previously outsourced to a third party higher medical and dental claims and increased pension and 

postretirement costs resulting from changes in the assumptions used to determine our fiscal 2006 costs increased line locate telecommunication and facilities costs also contributed to the overall increase these increases were partially offset by a reduction in thirdparty costs for outsourced administrative and meter reading functions that were insourced during fiscal 2006 operation and maintenance expense for the year ended september 30 2006 was also favorably impacted by the absence of 21 million of merger and integration cost amortization associated with the merger of united cities gas company in july 1997 as these costs were fully amortized by december 2004 

 

the provision for doubtful accounts increased 31 million to 206 million for the year ended september 30 2006 compared with 175 million in the prior year the increase was primarily attributable to increased collection risk associated with higher natural gas prices in the natural gas distribution segment the average cost of natural gas for the year ended september 30 2006 was 1002 per mcf compared with 741 per mcf for the year ended september 30 2005 

 

additionally during the first quarter of fiscal 2006 the mpsc in connection with the modification of our rate design decided to allow the recovery of 28 million in deferred costs which it had originally disallowed in its september 2004 decision this charge was originally recorded in fiscal 2004 this ruling decreased our depreciation expense during the year ended september 30 2006 this decrease was offset by increased depreciation expense associated with the placement of various capital projects into service during the fiscal year 

 

operating expenses were also impacted by a 229 million noncash charge to impair our west texas division’s irrigation assets during the fiscal 2006 fourth quarter we determined that as a result of declining irrigation sales primarily associated with our agricultural customers’ shift from gaspowered pumps to electric pumps the west texas division’s irrigation assets would not be able to generate sufficient future cash flows from operations to recover the net investment in these assets therefore the entire net book value was written off we will continue to operate these assets until we determine a plan for these assets as we are obligated to provide natural gas services to certain customers served by these assets we are currently evaluating an opportunity to sell these assets in the first quarter of fiscal 2008 we do not expect the outcome of this potential transaction to materially affect our results of operations 

 

as a result of the aforementioned factors our natural gas distribution segment operating income for the year ended september 30 2006 decreased to 2019 million from 2364 million for the year ended september 30 2005 

 

miscellaneous income 

 

miscellaneous income for the year ended september 30 2006 was 95 million compared to miscellaneous income of 68 million for the year ended september 30 2005 this increase was primarily attributable to increased interest income on intercompany borrowings to our natural gas marketing segment to fund its working capital needs this increase was partially offset by a 33 million charge recorded during the fiscal 2006 second quarter associated with an adverse ruling in tennessee related to the calculation of a performancebased rate mechanism associated with gas purchases 

 

interest charges 

 

interest charges allocated to the natural gas distribution segment for the year ended september 30 2006 increased to 1265 million from 1124 million for the year ended september 30 2005 the increase was attributable to higher average outstanding shortterm debt balances to fund natural gas purchases at significantly higher prices coupled with an approximate 200 basis point increase in the interest rate on our 300 million unsecured floating rate senior notes due 2007 due to an increase in the threemonth libor rate these increases were partially offset by 48 million of interest savings arising from the early payoff of 725 million of our first mortgage bonds in june 2005 

regulated transmission and storage segment 

 

financial and operational highlights for our regulated transmission and storage segment for the years ended september 30 2006 and 2005 are presented below 

 

 

 

gross profit increased to 1411 million for the year ended september 30 2006 from 1380 million for the year ended september 30 2005 total pipeline transportation volumes were 5813 bcf during the year ended september 30 2006 compared with 5545 bcf for the prior year excluding intersegment transportation volumes total pipeline transportation volumes were 4105 bcf during the current year compared with 3739 bcf in the prior year 

 

the increase in gross profit was primarily attributable to increased thirdparty throughput and ancillary service margins the increase in thirdparty transportation margins was primarily attributable to increases in the electricgeneration market due to the warmer than normal temperatures during the summer of 2006 increased demand for throughsystem transportation services due to a widening of pricing differentials between the pipeline’s hubs and the impact of atmos pipeline — texas’ north side loop and other compression projects that were placed into service in june 2006 storage and parking and lending services on atmos pipeline — texas also increased during fiscal 2006 as a result of the widening of pricing differentials between the pipeline’s hubs which increased the attractiveness of storing gas on the pipeline and our ability to obtain improved margins for these services the increases on atmos pipeline — texas’ system were partially offset by a decrease in margins earned from intercompany transportation services to our midtex division due to the significantly warmer than normal weather experienced during fiscal 2006 additionally these increases were partially offset by the absence of inventory sales of 30 million realized in the prior year 

 

operating expenses increased to 778 million for the year ended september 30 2006 from 722 million for the year ended september 30 2005 due to higher employee benefit costs associated with an increase in headcount increased pension and postretirement costs resulting from changes in the assumptions used to determine our fiscal 2006 costs higher facilities costs and higher pipeline integrity costs 

 

as a result of the aforementioned factors our regulated transmission and storage segment operating income for the year ended september 30 2006 decreased to 633 million from 658 million for the year ended september 30 2005 

natural gas marketing segment 

 

financial and operational highlights for our natural gas marketing segment for the years ended september 30 2006 and 2005 are presented below 

 

 

 

the 687 million increase in our natural gas marketing segment’s gross profit reflects increased delivered gas margins and increased unrealized margins partially offset by a decrease in asset optimization margins 

 

delivered gas margins increased 273 million during fiscal 2006 as a result of increased sales volumes resulting from focusing our marketing efforts on higher margin opportunities partially offset by warmerthannormal weather across our market areas the increase in gas delivery margins also reflected our ability to successfully capture increased per unit margins in certain market areas that experienced higher market volatility 

 

asset optimization margins decreased 18 million primarily due to the realization of less favorable arbitrage spreads during the current year period compared with the prior year coupled with increased storage fees 

 

the favorable unrealized margin variance primarily was due to a favorable movement during the year ended september 30 2006 in the forward natural gas prices associated with financial derivatives used in our gas delivery activities a narrowing of the physicalforward spreads during fiscal 2006 and positive basis ineffectiveness on our financial derivatives these results were magnified by a 76 bcf increase in our net physical position at september 30 2006 compared to the prior year 

 

operating expenses which include operation and maintenance expense provision for doubtful accounts depreciation and amortization expense and taxes other than income taxes increased to 284 million for the year ended september 30 2006 from 210 million for the year ended september 30 2005 the increase in operating expense primarily was attributable to an increase in personnel costs due to increased headcount and an increase in regulatory compliance costs 

 

the improved gross profit margin partially offset by higher operating expenses resulted in an increase in our natural gas marketing segment operating income to 1022 million for the year ended september 30 2006 compared with operating income of 410 million for the year ended september 30 2005

interest charges allocated to the natural gas marketing segment for the year ended september 30 2006 increased to 85 million from 34 million for the year ended september 30 2005 the increase was attributable to higher average outstanding debt balances to fund natural gas purchases at significantly higher prices 

 

pipeline storage and other segment 

 

financial and operational highlights for our pipeline storage and other segment for the years ended september 30 2006 and 2005 are presented below 

 

 

 

gross profit increased to 245 million for the year ended september 30 2006 from 137 million for the year ended september 30 2005 the increase in gross profit was primarily attributable to increased unrealized gains recorded during fiscal 2006 as favorable movements in the forward natural gas prices used to value the financial hedges designated against the physical inventory underlying these contracts resulted in an unrealized gain compared with an unrealized loss in the prior year additionally aps recorded increased margins from its asset optimization activities due to its ability to capture more favorable arbitrage spreads 

 

operating expenses increased to 96 million for the year ended september 30 2006 from 85 million for the year ended september 30 2005 due to higher employee and other administrative costs 

 

as a result of the aforementioned factors our pipeline storage and other segment operating income for the year ended september 30 2006 increased to 149 million from 53 million for the year ended september 30 2005 

 

liquidity and capital resources 

 

our internally generated funds and borrowings under our credit facilities and commercial paper program generally provide the liquidity needed to fund our working capital capital expenditures and other cash needs additionally from time to time we raise funds from the public debt and equity capital markets through our existing shelf registration statement to fund our liquidity needs 

cash flows 

 

our internally generated funds may change in the future due to a number of factors some of which we cannot control these include regulatory changes the price for our services the demand for our services margin requirements resulting from significant changes in commodity prices operational risks and other factors 

 

cash flows from operating activities 

 

yearoveryear changes in our operating cash flows are primarily attributable to working capital changes within our natural gas distribution segment resulting from the impact of the price of natural gas and the timing of customer collections payments for natural gas purchases deferred gas cost recoveries and weather 

 

for the year ended september 30 2007 we generated operating cash flow of 5471 million compared with 3114 million in fiscal 2006 and 3869 million in fiscal 2005 the significant factors impacting our operating cash flow for the last three fiscal years are summarized below 

 

year ended september 30 2007 

 

fiscal 2007 operating cash flows reflect the favorable timing of payments for accounts payable and accrued liabilities which increased operating cash flow by 1076 million additionally improved management of our deferred gas cost balances increased operating cash flow by 1252 million finally increased net income and other favorable working capital changes contributed to the increase in operating cash flow partially offsetting these increases in operating cash flow was a decrease in customer collections of 848 million due to the decrease in the price of natural gas during the current year 

 

year ended september 30 2006 

 

fiscal 2006 operating cash flows reflect the adverse impact of significantly higher natural gas prices yearoveryear unfavorable timing of payments for accounts payable and other accrued liabilities reduced operating cash flow by 5230 million partially offsetting these outflows were higher customer collections 2451 million and reduced payments for natural gas inventories 1021 million additionally favorable movements in the market indices used to value our natural gas marketing segment risk management assets and liabilities reduced the amount that we were required to deposit in a margin account and therefore favorably affected operating cash flow by 1263 million 

 

year ended september 30 2005 

 

fiscal 2005 operating cash flows reflect the effects of a 496 million increase in net income and effective working capital management partially offset by higher natural gas prices working capital management efforts which affected the timing of payments for accounts payable and other accrued liabilities favorably affected operating cash flow by 3541 million however these efforts were partially offset by reduced cash flow generated from accounts receivable changes by 1689 million primarily attributable to higher natural gas prices and an increase in our natural gas inventories attributable to a 13 percent yearoveryear increase in natural gas prices coupled with increased natural gas inventory levels which reduced operating cash flow by 818 million operating cash flow was also adversely impacted by unfavorable movements in the indices used to value our natural gas marketing segment risk management assets and liabilities which resulted in a net liability for the segment accordingly under the terms of the associated derivative contracts we were required to deposit 810 million into a margin account 

 

cash flows from investing activities 

 

in recent years a substantial portion of our cash resources has been used to fund acquisitions and growth projects our ongoing construction program and improvements to information systems our ongoing construction program enables us to provide natural gas distribution services to our existing customer base expand our natural gas distribution services into new markets enhance the integrity of our pipelines and more recently expand our intrastate pipeline network in executing our current rate strategy we are directing discretionary 

capital spending to jurisdictions that permit us to earn a return on our investment timely currently our midtex louisiana mississippi and west texas natural gas distribution divisions and our atmos pipeline — texas division have rate designs that provide the opportunity to include in their rate base approved capital costs on a periodic basis without being required to file a rate case 

 

for the year ended september 30 2007 we incurred 3924 million for capital expenditures compared with 4253 million for the year ended september 30 2006 and 3332 million for the year ended september 30 2005 the decrease in capital expenditures in fiscal 2007 primarily reflects the absence of capital expenditures associated with our north side loop and other pipeline compression projects which were completed during the fiscal 2006 third quarter our cash used for investing activities for the year ended september 30 2005 reflects the 19 billion cash paid for the txu gas acquisition including related transaction costs and expenses 

 

cash flows from financing activities 

 

for the year ended september 30 2007 our financing activities used 1593 million in cash compared with 1553 million and 17 billion provided for the years ended september 30 2006 and 2005 our significant financing activities for the years ended september 30 2007 2006 and 2005 are summarized as follows 

 

 54 

 

in addition to the december 2006 equity offering described above during the year ended september 30 2007 we issued 09 million shares of common stock which generated net proceeds of 249 million in addition we granted 04 million shares of common stock under our 1998 longterm incentive plan to directors officers and other participants in the plan the following table shows the number of shares issued for the years ended september 30 2007 2006 and 2005 

 

 

 

credit facilities 

 

as of september 30 2007 we had a total of approximately 15 billion of credit facilities comprised of three shortterm committed credit facilities totaling 918 million one uncommitted credit facility totaling 25 million and through aem a second uncommitted credit facility that can provide up to 580 million borrowings under our uncommitted credit facilities are made on a whenandasneeded basis at the discretion of the banks our credit capacity and the amount of unused borrowing capacity are affected by the seasonal nature of the natural gas business and our shortterm borrowing requirements which are typically highest during colder winter months our working capital needs can vary significantly due to changes in the price of natural gas charged by suppliers and the increased gas supplies required to meet customers’ needs during periods of cold weather 

 

as of september 30 2007 the amount available to us under our credit facilities net of outstanding letters of credit was 9088 million we believe these credit facilities combined with our operating cash flows will be sufficient to fund our working capital needs these facilities are described in further detail in note 6 to the consolidated financial statements 

 

shelf registration 

 

on december 4 2006 we filed a registration statement with the sec to issue from time to time up to 900 million in common stock andor debt securities available for issuance including approximately 4015 million of capacity carried over from our prior shelf registration statement filed with the sec in august 2004 

 

in december 2006 we sold approximately 63 million shares of common stock in an equity offering under the registration statement and used the net proceeds to reduce shortterm debt in june 2007 we issued 250 million of 635 senior notes due 2017 in a debt offering under the registration statement the net proceeds of approximately 247 million together with 53 million of available cash were used to repay our 300 million unsecured floating rate senior notes in july 2007 

 

after these issuances we have approximately 450 million of availability remaining under the registration statement however due to certain restrictions imposed by one state regulatory commission on our ability to issue securities under the registration statement we now have remaining and available for issuance a total of approximately 100 million of equity securities 50 million of senior debt securities and 300 million of subordinated debt securities in addition due to restrictions imposed by another state regulatory commission if the credit ratings on our senior unsecured debt were to fall below investment grade from either standard  

poor’s corporation bbb moody’s investors services inc baa3 or fitch ratings ltd bbb our ability to issue any type of debt securities under the registration statement would be suspended until an investment grade rating from all three credit rating agencies was achieved 

 

credit ratings 

 

our credit ratings directly affect our ability to obtain shortterm and longterm financing in addition to the cost of such financing in determining our credit ratings the rating agencies consider a number of quantitative factors including debt to total capitalization operating cash flow relative to outstanding debt operating cash flow coverage of interest and pension liabilities and funding status in addition the rating agencies consider qualitative factors such as consistency of our earnings over time the quality of our management and business strategy the risks associated with our regulated and nonregulated businesses and the regulatory structures that govern our rates in the states where we operate 

 

our debt is rated by three rating agencies standard  poor’s corporation sp moody’s investors services inc moody’s and fitch ratings ltd fitch our current debt ratings are all considered investment grade and are as follows 

 

 

 

currently with respect to our unsecured senior longterm debt moody’s and fitch maintain their stable outlook and sp maintains its positive outlook none of our ratings is currently under review 

 

a credit rating is not a recommendation to buy sell or hold securities the highest investment grade credit rating for sp is aaa moody’s is aaa and fitch is aaa the lowest investment grade credit rating for sp is bbb moody’s is baa3 and fitch is bbb our credit ratings may be revised or withdrawn at any time by the rating agencies and each rating should be evaluated independent of any other rating there can be no assurance that a rating will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if in its judgment circumstances so warrant 

 

debt covenants 

 

we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants as of september 30 2007 our debt covenants are described in note 6 to the consolidated financial statements 

 

capitalization 

 

the following table presents our capitalization as of september 30 2007 and 2006 

 

 

 

total debt as a percentage of total capitalization including shortterm debt was 537 percent and 609 percent at september 30 2007 and 2006 the decrease in the debt to capitalization ratio primarily reflects the favorable impact of our december 2006 equity offering and the reduction in shortterm and longterm debt as of september 30 2007 our ratio of total debt to capitalization is typically greater during the winter heating season as we make additional shortterm borrowings to fund natural gas purchases and meet our working capital requirements we intend to maintain our capitalization ratio in a target range of 50 to 55 percent 

through cash flow generated from operations continued issuance of new common stock under our direct stock purchase plan and retirement savings plan and access to the equity capital markets 

 

contractual obligations and commercial commitments 

 

the following table provides information about contractual obligations and commercial commitments at september 30 2007 

 

 

 

 

  

aem has commitments to purchase physical quantities of natural gas under contracts indexed to the forward nymex strip or fixed price contracts at september 30 2007 aem was committed to purchase 804 bcf within one year 381 bcf within one to three years and 14 bcf after three years under indexed contracts aem was committed to purchase 24 bcf within one year and 01 bcf within one to three years under fixed price contracts with prices ranging from 569 to 985 per mcf 

 

with the exception of our midtex division our natural gas distribution segment maintains supply contracts with several vendors that generally cover a period of up to one year commitments for estimated base gas volumes are established under these contracts on a monthly basis at contractually negotiated prices commitments for incremental daily purchases are made as necessary during the month in accordance with the 

terms of the individual contract our midtex division maintains longterm supply contracts to ensure a reliable source of gas for our customers in its service area which obligate it to purchase specified volumes at market prices the estimated commitments under these contract terms as of september 30 2007 are reflected in the table above 

 

risk management activities 

 

we conduct risk management activities through our natural gas distribution natural gas marketing and pipeline storage and other segments in our natural gas distribution segment we use a combination of physical storage fixed physical contracts and fixed financial contracts to reduce our exposure to unusually large winterperiod gas price increases in our natural gas marketing and pipeline storage and other segments we manage our exposure to the risk of natural gas price changes and lock in our gross profit margin through a combination of storage and financial derivatives including futures overthecounter and exchangetraded options and swap contracts with counterparties to the extent our inventory cost and actual sales and actual purchases do not correlate with the changes in the market indices we use in our hedges we could experience ineffectiveness or the hedges may no longer meet the accounting requirements for hedge accounting resulting in the derivatives being treated as mark to market instruments through earnings 

 

we record our derivatives as a component of risk management assets and liabilities which are classified as current or noncurrent based upon the anticipated settlement date of the underlying derivative substantially all of our derivative financial instruments are valued using external market quotes and indices the following table shows the components of the change in fair value of our natural gas distribution and natural gas marketing derivative contract activities for the year ended september 30 2007 in thousands 

 

 

 

the fair value of our natural gas distribution and natural gas marketing derivative contracts at september 30 2007 is segregated below by time period and fair value source 

 

 

 

pension and postretirement benefits obligations 

 

net periodic pension and postretirement benefit costs 

 

for the fiscal year ended september 30 2007 our total net periodic pension and other benefits costs was 486 million compared with 500 million and 364 million for the years ended september 30 2006 and 2005 these costs relating to our natural gas distribution operations are recoverable through our gas distribution rates however a portion of these costs is capitalized into our gas distribution rate base the remaining costs are recorded as a component of operation and maintenance expense 

the decrease in total net periodic pension and other benefits cost during fiscal 2007 compared with fiscal 2006 primarily reflects changes in assumptions we made during our annual pension plan valuation completed june 30 2006 the discount rate used to compute the present value of a plan’s liabilities generally is based on rates of highgrade corporate bonds with maturities similar to the average period over which the benefits will be paid in the period leading up to our june 30 2006 measurement date these interest rates were increasing which resulted in a 130 basis point increase in our discount rate used to determine our fiscal 2007 net periodic and postretirement cost to 630 percent this increase had the effect of decreasing the present value of our plan liabilities and associated expenses this favorable impact was partially offset by the unfavorable impact of reducing the expected return on our pension plan assets by 25 basis points to 825 percent which has the effect of increasing our pension and postretirement benefit cost 

 

the increase in total net periodic pension and other benefits cost during fiscal 2006 compared with the prior year primarily reflects changes in assumptions we made during our annual pension plan valuation completed june 30 2005 the discount rate used to compute the present value of a plan’s liabilities generally is based on rates of highgrade corporate bonds with maturities similar to the average period over which the benefits will be paid in the period leading up to our june 30 2005 measurement date these interest rates were declining which resulted in a 125 basis point reduction in our discount rate to 50 percent this reduction increased the present value of our plan liabilities and associated expenses additionally we reduced the expected return on our pension plan assets by 25 basis points to 85 percent which also increased our pension and postretirement benefit cost 

 

pension and postretirement plan funding 

 

generally our funding policy is to contribute annually an amount in accordance with the requirements of the employee retirement income security act of 1974 however additional voluntary contributions are made from time to time as considered necessary contributions are intended to provide not only for benefits attributed to service to date but also for those expected to be earned in the future 

 

during fiscal 2007 we did not contribute to our pension plans during fiscal 2006 we voluntarily contributed 29 million to the atmos energy corporation retirement plan for mississippi valley gas union employees that contribution achieved a desired level of funding by satisfying the minimum funding requirements while maximizing the tax deductible contribution for this plan for plan year 2005 during fiscal 2005 we voluntarily contributed 30 million to the master trust to maintain the level of funding we desire relative to our accumulated benefit obligation we made the contribution because declining high yield corporate bond yields in the period leading up to our june 30 2005 measurement date resulted in an increase in the present value of our plan liabilities 

 

we contributed 118 million 109 million and 100 million to our postretirement benefits plans for the years ended september 30 2007 2006 and 2005 the contributions represent the portion of the postretirement costs we are responsible for under the terms of our plan and minimum funding required by state regulatory commissions 

 

outlook for fiscal 2008 

 

market conditions as of the june 30 2007 valuation date were similar to market conditions as of our june 30 2006 measurement date therefore we maintained the discount rate for determining our fiscal 2008 pension and benefit costs at 63 percent and the expected return on our pension plan assets at 825 percent accordingly we expect our fiscal 2008 pension and postretirement medical costs to be materially the same as fiscal 2007 

 

we are not required to make a minimum funding contribution to our pension plans during fiscal 2008 nor at this time do we intend to make voluntary contributions during 2008 however we anticipate contributing approximately 12 million to our postretirement medical plans during fiscal 2008 

 

the projected pension liability future funding requirements and the amount of pension expense or income recognized for the plan are subject to change depending upon the actuarial value of plan assets and the 

determination of future benefit obligations as of each subsequent actuarial calculation date these amounts are impacted by actual investment returns changes in interest rates and changes in the demographic composition of the participants in the plan

recent accounting developments and their impact on our financial position results of operations and cash flows are described in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements

 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend  

we are exposed to risks associated with commodity prices and interest rates commodity price risk is the potential loss that we may incur as a result of changes in the fair value of a particular instrument or commodity interestrate risk results from our portfolio of debt and equity instruments that we issue to provide financing and liquidity for our business activities 

 

we conduct risk management activities through both our natural gas distribution and natural gas marketing segments in our natural gas distribution segment we use a combination of physical storage fixed physical contracts and fixed financial contracts to protect us and our customers against unusually large winter period gas price increases in our natural gas marketing segment we manage our exposure to the risk of natural gas price changes and lock in our gross profit margin through a combination of storage and financial derivatives including futures overthecounter and exchangetraded options and swap contracts with counterparties our risk management activities and related accounting treatment are described in further detail in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements additionally our earnings are affected by changes in shortterm interest rates as a result of our issuance of shortterm commercial paper and our other shortterm borrowings 

 

commodity price risk 

 

natural gas distribution segment 

 

we purchase natural gas for our natural gas distribution operations substantially all of the costs of gas purchased for natural gas distribution operations are recovered from our customers through purchased gas adjustment mechanisms however our natural gas distribution operations have commodity price risk exposure to fluctuations in spot natural gas prices related to purchases for sales to our nonregulated energy services customers at fixed prices 

 

for our natural gas distribution segment we use a sensitivity analysis to estimate commodity price risk for purposes of this analysis we estimate commodity price risk by applying a hypothetical 10 percent increase in the portion of our gas costs related to fixedprice nonregulated sales based on these projected nonregulated gas sales a hypothetical 10 percent increase in fixed prices based upon the september 30 2007 three month market strip would increase our purchased gas cost by approximately 05 million in fiscal 2008 

 

natural gas marketing and pipeline storage and other segments 

 

our natural gas marketing segment is also exposed to risks associated with changes in the market price of natural gas for our natural gas marketing segment we use a sensitivity analysis to estimate commodity price risk for purposes of this analysis we estimate commodity price risk by applying a 050 change in the forward nymex price to our net open position including existing storage and related financial contracts at the end of each period based on aeh’s net open position including existing storage and related financial contracts at september 30 2007 of 02 bcf a 050 change in the forward nymex price would have had a 01 million impact on our consolidated net income 

 

changes in the difference between the indices used to mark to market our physical inventory gas daily and the related fairvalue hedge nymex can result in volatility in our reported net income but over time gains and losses on the sale of storage gas inventory will be offset by gains and losses on the fairvalue hedges based upon our net physical position at september 30 2007 and assuming our hedges would still 

qualify as highly effective a 050 change in the difference between the gas daily and nymex indices would impact our reported net income by approximately 43 million 

 

additionally these changes could cause us to recognize a risk management liability which would require us to place cash into an escrow account to collateralize this liability position this in turn would reduce the amount of cash we would have on hand to fund our working capital needs 

 

interest rate risk 

 

our earnings are exposed to changes in shortterm interest rates associated with our shortterm commercial paper program and other shortterm borrowings we use a sensitivity analysis to estimate our shortterm interest rate risk for purposes of this analysis we estimate our shortterm interest rate risk as the difference between our actual interest expense for the period and estimated interest expense for the period assuming a hypothetical average one percent increase in the interest rates associated with our shortterm borrowings had interest rates associated with our shortterm borrowings increased by an average of one percent our interest expense would have increased by approximately 27 million during 2007 

 

we also assess market risk for our fixed rate longterm obligations we estimate market risk for our longterm obligations as the potential increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical one percent decrease in interest rates associated with these debt instruments fair value is estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis assuming this one percent hypothetical decrease the fair value of our longterm obligations would have increased by approximately 1563 million 

 

as of september 30 2007 we were not engaged in other activities that would cause exposure to the risk of material earnings or cash flow loss due to changes in interest rates or market commodity prices

the board of directors 

atmos energy corporation 

 

we have audited atmos energy corporation’s internal control over financial reporting as of september 30 2007 based on criteria established in internal control — integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission the coso criteria atmos energy corporation’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying management’s report on internal control over financial reporting our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit 

 

we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting assessing the risk that a material weakness exists testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion 

 

a company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

 

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

 

in our opinion atmos energy corporation maintained in all material respects effective internal control over financial reporting as of september 30 2007 based on the coso criteria 

 

we also have audited in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states the consolidated balance sheets as of september 30 2007 and 2006 and the related statements of income stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended september 30 2007 of atmos energy corporation and our report dated november 27 2007 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon

over the last five years we have primarily grown through two significant acquisitions our acquisition in december 2002 of mississippi valley gas company mvg and our acquisition in october 2004 of the natural gas distribution and pipeline operations of txu gas company txu gas 

 

we have experienced over 20 consecutive years of increasing dividends and earnings growth after giving effect to our acquisitions we have achieved this record of growth while operating our utility operations efficiently by managing our operating and maintenance expenses and leveraging our technology such as our 24hour call centers to achieve more efficient operations in addition we have focused on regulatory rate 

proceedings to increase revenue as our costs increase and mitigated weatherrelated risks through weathernormalized rates that now apply to most of our service areas we have also strengthened our nonutility businesses by increasing gross profit margins actively pursuing opportunities to increase the amount of storage available to us and expanding commercial opportunities in our pipeline and storage segment

we operated our utility segment through the following seven regulated natural gas utility divisions during the year ended september 30 2006 

 

  

effective october 1 2006 the kentucky and midstates divisions were combined 

 

our natural gas utility distribution business is seasonal and dependent on weather conditions in our service areas gas sales to residential and commercial customers are greater during the winter months than during the remainder of the year the volumes of gas sales during the winter months will vary with the temperatures during these months 

 

in addition to weather our financial results are affected by the cost of natural gas and economic conditions in the areas that we serve higher gas costs which we are generally able to pass through to our customers under purchased gas adjustment clauses may cause customers to conserve or in the case of industrial customers to use alternative energy sources higher gas costs may also adversely impact our accounts receivable collections resulting in higher bad debt expense and may require us to increase borrowings under our credit facilities resulting in higher interest expense 

 

the effect of weather that is above or below normal is substantially offset through weather normalization adjustments known as wna which are now approved by the regulators for over 90 percent of residential and commercial meters in our service areas wna allows us to increase customers’ bills to offset lower gas usage when weather is warmer than normal and decrease customers’ bills to offset higher gas usage when weather is colder than normal 

 

prior to october 1 2006 our largest division the midtex division did not have wna however its operations benefited from a rate structure that combined a monthly customer charge with a declining block rate schedule to partially mitigate the impact of warmerthannormal weather on revenue the combination of the monthly customer charge and the customer billing under the first block of the declining block rate schedule provided for the recovery of most of our fixed costs for such operations under most weather conditions however this rate structure was not as beneficial during periods where weather was significantly warmer than normal 

 

in may 2006 the midtex division filed a statement of intent seeking additional annual revenues of 60 million and several rate design changes including wna in july 2006 the railroad commission of texas 

rrc approved an interim and a permanent wna effective october 1 2006 for the midtex division the agreement provided that the interim wna will be based on the use of 30 years of weather history while the permanent wna will allow the parties to contest the appropriate period of weather data to use in calculating normal weather the permanent wna will also be modified or adjusted to conform to the rate design that the rrc ultimately approves in the case additionally in may 2006 we agreed to a settlement with the louisiana public service commission lpsc that authorized the implementation of wna in our louisiana division effective december 1 2006 

 

as of september 30 2006 we had or received regulatory approvals for wna for our customer meters in the following service areas for the following periods 

 

 

 

 

  

our natural gas supply comes from a variety of thirdparty providers and from gas held in storage we anticipate that the natural gas supply for the upcoming winter heating season will be provided by a variety of suppliers including independent producers marketers and pipeline companies in addition to withdrawals of gas from storage additionally the natural gas supply for our midtex division includes peaking and spot purchase agreements we also contract for storage service in underground storage facilities on many of the interstate pipelines serving us we estimate the peakday availability of natural gas supply from longterm contracts shortterm contracts and withdrawals from underground storage to be approximately 42 bcf the peakday demand for our utility operations in fiscal 2006 was on december 8 2005 when sales to customers reached approximately 34 bcf 

 

supply arrangements are contracted from our suppliers on a firm basis with various terms at market prices the firm supply consists of both base load and swing supply quantities base load quantities are those that flow at a constant level throughout the month and swing supply quantities provide the flexibility to change daily quantities to match increases or decreases in requirements related to weather conditions except for local production purchases we select suppliers through a competitive bidding process by requesting proposals from suppliers that have demonstrated that they can provide reliable service we select these suppliers based on their ability to deliver gas supply to our designated firm pipeline receipt points at the lowest cost major suppliers during fiscal 2006 were anadarko energy services bp energy company chesapeake energy marketing inc conocophillips company cross timbers energy services inc devon gas services lp enbridge marketing us lp ppm energy inc tenaska marketing and atmos energy marketing llc our natural gas marketing subsidiary 

 

the combination of base load peaking and spot purchase agreements coupled with the withdrawal of gas held in storage allows us the flexibility to adjust to changes in weather which minimizes our need to enter into longterm firm commitments 

 

also to maintain our deliveries to high priority customers we have the ability and have exercised our right to curtail deliveries to certain customers under the terms of interruptible contracts or applicable state statutes or regulations our customers’ demand on our system is not necessarily indicative of our ability to 

meet current or anticipated market demands or immediate delivery requirements because of factors such as the physical limitations of gathering storage and transmission systems the duration and severity of cold weather the availability of gas reserves from our suppliers the ability to purchase additional supplies on a shortterm basis and actions by federal and state regulatory authorities curtailment rights provide us the flexibility to meet the humanneeds requirements of our customers on a firm basis priority allocations imposed by federal and state regulatory agencies as well as other factors beyond our control may affect our ability to meet the demands of our customers we anticipate no problems with obtaining additional gas supply as needed for our customers 

 

we receive gas deliveries for all of our utility divisions except for our midtex division through 37 pipeline transportation companies both interstate and intrastate to satisfy our natural gas needs the pipeline transportation agreements are firm and many of them have “pipeline nonotice” storage service which provides for daily balancing between system requirements and nominated flowing supplies these agreements have been negotiated with the shortest term necessary while still maintaining our right of first refusal the natural gas supply for our midtex division is delivered by our atmos pipeline — texas division 

 

the following is a brief description of our seven natural gas utility divisions additional information for our natural gas utility divisions is presented under the caption “operating statistics”

natural gas marketing segment overview 

 

our natural gas marketing and other nonutility segments which are organized under atmos energy holdings inc aeh have operations in 22 states through september 30 2003 atmos energy marketing llc together with its whollyowned subsidiaries woodward marketing llc and trans louisiana industrial gas company inc comprised our natural gas marketing segment effective october 1 2003 our natural gas marketing segment was reorganized the operations of atmos energy marketing llc and trans louisiana industrial gas company inc were merged into woodward marketing llc which was renamed atmos energy marketing llc aem 

 

we acquired a 45 percent interest in woodward marketing llc in july 1997 as a result of the merger of atmos energy and united cities gas company which had acquired that interest in may 1995 in april 

2001 we acquired the remaining 55 percent interest that we did not own for 1423193 restricted shares of our common stock 

 

aem provides a variety of natural gas management services to municipalities natural gas utility systems and industrial natural gas consumers primarily in the southeastern and midwestern states and to our kentucky louisiana and midstates divisions these services primarily consist of furnishing natural gas supplies at fixed and marketbased prices contract negotiation and administration load forecasting gas storage acquisition and management services transportation services peaking sales and balancing services capacity utilization strategies and gas price management through the use of derivative products we use proprietary and customerowned transportation and storage assets to provide the various services our customers request as a result our revenues arise from the types of commercial transactions we have structured with our customers and include the value we extract by optimizing the storage and transportation capacity we own or control as well as revenues for services we deliver 

 

we participate in transactions in which we combine the natural gas commodity and transportation costs to minimize our costs incurred to serve our customers additionally we participate in natural gas storage transactions in which we seek to capture the pricing differences that occur over time we purchase physical natural gas and then sell financial contracts at favorable prices to lock in a gross profit margin through the use of transportation and storage services and derivatives we are able to capture gross profit margin through the arbitrage of pricing differences in various locations and by recognizing pricing differences that occur over time 

 

aem’s management of natural gas requirements involves the sale of natural gas and the management of storage and transportation supplies under contracts with customers generally having one to two year terms aem also sells natural gas to some of its industrial customers on a delivered burner tip basis under contract terms from 30 days to two years at september 30 2006 aem had a total of 679 industrial 73 municipal and 289 other customers 

 

pipeline and storage segment overview 

 

our pipeline and storage segment consists of the regulated pipeline and storage operations of the atmos pipeline — texas division and the nonregulated pipeline and storage operations of atmos pipeline and storage llc aps the atmos pipeline — texas division transports natural gas to our midtex division transports natural gas for third parties and manages five underground storage reservoirs in texas we also provide ancillary services customary in the pipeline industry including parking arrangements lending and sales of inventory on hand parking arrangements provide shortterm interruptible storage of gas on our pipeline and lending services provide shortterm interruptible loans of natural gas from our pipeline to meet market demands both of these services are primarily offered on our atmos pipeline — texas system these operations represent one of the largest intrastate pipeline operations in texas with a heavy concentration in the established natural gasproducing areas of central northern and eastern texas extending into or near the major producing areas of the texas gulf coast and the delaware and val verde basins of west texas nine basins located in texas are believed to contain a substantial portion of the nation’s remaining onshore natural gas reserves this pipeline system provides access to all of these basins 

 

aps owns or has an interest in underground storage fields in kentucky and louisiana we also use these storage facilities to reduce the need to contract for additional pipeline capacity to meet customer demand during peak periods 

 

in may 2006 aps announced plans to form a joint venture with a local natural gas producer to construct a natural gas gathering system in eastern kentucky referred to as the straight creek project the new system is expected to relieve severe gas gathering and transportation constraints that historically have burdened natural gas producers in the area and should improve delivery reliability to natural gas customers in october 2006 the federal energy regulatory commission ferc issued a declaratory order finding that the straight creek project will be exempt from ferc jurisdiction the joint venture provides aps the opportunity to apply its expertise to the upstream gathering business 

other nonutility segment overview 

 

our other nonutility segment consists primarily of the operations of atmos energy services llc aes and atmos power systems inc which are whollyowned by our subsidiary atmos energy holdings inc through aes we provide natural gas management services to our utility operations other than the midtex division these services which began in april 2004 include aggregating and purchasing gas supply arranging transportation and storage logistics and ultimately delivering the gas to our utility service areas at competitive prices in exchange for revenues that are equal to the costs incurred to provide those services through atmos power systems inc we have constructed electric peaking powergenerating plants and associated facilities and have entered into agreements to lease these plants 

 

through january 2004 united cities propane gas inc a whollyowned subsidiary of atmos energy holdings inc owned an approximate 19 percent membership interest in us propane lp usp a joint venture formed in february 2000 with other utility companies to own a limited partnership interest in heritage propane partners lp heritage a publiclytraded marketer of propane through a nationwide retail distribution network during fiscal 2004 we sold our interest in usp and heritage as a result of these transactions we no longer have an interest in the propane business

ratemaking activity 

 

overview 

 

the method of determining regulated rates varies among the states in which our natural gas utility divisions operate the regulators have the responsibility of ensuring that utilities under their jurisdictions operate in the best interests of customers while providing utility companies the opportunity to earn a reasonable return on investment generally each regulatory authority reviews our rate request and establishes a rate structure intended to generate revenue sufficient to cover our costs of doing business and provide a reasonable return on invested capital 

 

rates established by regulatory authorities are adjusted for increases and decreases in our purchased gas cost through purchased gas adjustment mechanisms purchased gas adjustment mechanisms provide gas utility companies a method of recovering purchased gas costs on an ongoing basis without filing a rate case to 

address all of the utility’s nongas costs these mechanisms are commonly utilized when regulatory authorities recognize a particular type of expense such as purchased gas costs that i is subject to significant price fluctuations compared to the utility’s other costs ii represents a large component of the utility’s cost of service and iii is generally outside the control of the gas utility there is no gross profit generated through purchased gas adjustments because they provide a dollarfordollar offset to increases or decreases in utility gas costs although substantially all of our utility sales to our customers fluctuate with the cost of gas that we purchase utility gross profit which is defined as operating revenues less purchased gas cost is generally not affected by fluctuations in the cost of gas due to the purchased gas adjustment mechanism additionally some jurisdictions have introduced performancebased ratemaking adjustments to provide incentives to natural gas utilities to minimize purchased gas costs through improved storage management and use of financial hedges to lock in gas costs under the performancebased ratemaking adjustment purchased gas costs savings are shared between the utility and its customers

recent ratemaking activity 

 

our current rate strategy focuses on seeking rate designs that reduce or eliminate regulatory lag and separate the recovery of our approved margins from customer usage patterns due to weatherrelated variability declining use per customer and energy conservation also known as decoupling additionally we are seeking to stratify rates for low income households and to recover the gas cost portion of our bad debt expense 

 

improving rate design is a longterm process in the interim we are addressing regulatory lag issues by directing discretionary capital spending to jurisdictions that permit us to recover our investment in a timely manner and filing rate cases on a more frequent basis to minimize the regulatory lag to keep our actual returns more closely aligned with our allowed returns 

 

approximately 97 percent of our utility revenues in the fiscal years ended september 30 2006 2005 and 2004 were derived from sales at rates set by or subject to approval by local or state authorities net annual revenue increases resulting from ratemaking activity totaling 390 million 63 million and 162 million became effective in fiscal 2006 2005 and 2004 as summarized below 

 

 

 

 

  

additionally the following ratemaking efforts were initiated during fiscal 2006 but had not been completed as of september 30 2006

our recent ratemaking activity is discussed in greater detail below 

 

atmos pipelinetexas in april 2006 atmos pipeline — texas made a filing under texas’ gas reliability infrastructure program grip to include in rate base approximately 216 million of pipeline capital expenditures incurred during calendar year 2005 which should result in additional annual revenues of approximately 33 million the rrc approved this filing in july 2006 and these new charges were included in the monthly customer charge beginning in august 2006 

 

in september 2005 atmos pipeline — texas made a grip filing to include in rate base approximately 106 million of pipeline capital expenditures incurred during calendar year 2004 which resulted in approximately 19 million in additional annual revenue in december 2004 atmos pipeline — texas made a grip filing to include in rate base approximately 120 million of pipeline capital expenditures made by txu gas during calendar year 2003 which resulted in additional annual revenues of approximately 18 million 

 

atmos energy coloradokansas division in december 2005 the coloradokansas division filed its second annual ad valorem tax surcharge for 16 million the surcharge is designed to collect kansas property taxes in excess of the amount in the coloradokansas division’s most recent general rate case we began to bill this surcharge in january 2006 

 

in july 2004 the colorado public utility commission ordered us to issue a onetime credit to our colorado customers of 19 million the agreement was a result of an inquiry by the colorado office of consumer counsel related to our earnings in colorado the staff of the colorado public utility commission was also a party to the agreement 

 

in may 2003 the coloradokansas division filed a rate case with the kansas corporation commission for approximately 74 million in additional annual revenues in january 2004 the kansas corporation commission approved an agreement that allowed a 25 million increase in our rates effective march 2004 additionally the agreement allowed us to increase our monthly customer charges from 5 to 8 provided that we would not file another full rate application prior to september 2005 wna became effective in kansas in october 2003 in accordance with the kansas corporation commission’s ruling in may 2003 

 

atmos energy kentucky division in february 2006 the kpsc approved the company’s request to continue its performance based ratemaking pbr mechanism for an additional five year period the pbr establishes predetermined gas cost benchmarks and provides incentives to the company for purchasing gas supply below those benchmark costs 

 

in february 2005 the attorney general of the state of kentucky filed a complaint with the kentucky public service commission kpsc alleging that our rates were producing revenues in excess of reasonable levels we answered the complaint and filed a motion to dismiss with the kpsc in february 2006 the kpsc issued an order denying our motion to dismiss but stated that the attorney general had not met his burden of proof concerning his complaint in march 2006 the kpsc set a procedural schedule for the case the attorney general is currently conducting discovery a hearing should be scheduled for early 2007 we believe that the attorney general will not be able to demonstrate that our present rates are in excess of reasonable levels 

 

atmos energy louisiana division in september 2005 the louisiana public service commission lpsc consolidated several thenexisting dockets these dockets included a separate proceeding for the renewal of the rate stabilization clause rsc for each of the lgs and transla gas service areas resolution of the outstanding 2003 rsc filing for the lgs service area and our request for approval of a decoupling mechanism to stabilize margins in both the lgs and transla service areas 

 

on may 25 2006 the lpsc voted to approve a settlement which included a modified wna providing for partial decoupling renewal of the rsc for both the lgs and transla service areas with provisions that will reduce regulatory lag and a refund to customers of approximately 04 million for the lgs service areas that previously had been deferred the first rsc filing was in august 2006 for approximately 108 million based on a test year ended december 31 2005 for the lgs service area the increase is subject to refund pending final approval by the lpsc the first filing for the transla service area will be made by 

december 31 2006 for the test period ending september 30 2006 with an effective rate adjustment of april 1 2007 wna for both service areas will be in effect for an initial threeyear period beginning with the winter of 20062007 in the third quarter of fiscal 2006 62 million in deferred revenue associated with the 2003 rsc rate adjustment was recognized 

 

on august 29 2005 hurricane katrina struck the gulf coast inflicting significant damage to our eastern louisiana operations the hardest hit areas in our service territory were in jefferson st tammany st bernard and plaquemines parishes although service has been restored for many of our customers a significant number of customers will not require gas service for some time if ever because of sustained damages we began implementing new rates subject to refund in september 2006 that reflected the reduction of approximately 26500 customers and included a request to recover costs attributable to hurricane katrina we cannot accurately determine what regulatory actions if any may be taken by the regulators with respect to this filing or our ability to fully recover all costs incurred as a result of the storm 

 

during the second quarter of 2005 the louisiana division implemented a rate increase of 33 million in its lgs service area this increase resulted from our rsc filing in 2004 and was subject to refund pending the final resolution of that filing as the rate increase was subject to refund we did not recognize the effects of this increase in our results of operations during fiscal 2005 or the first three quarters of fiscal 2006

atmos energy midstates division in april 2006 atmos filed a rate case in its missouri service area seeking a rate increase of 34 million the company is proposing to consolidate the rates for its missouri properties into three sets of regional rates and consolidate the current purchased gas adjustment pga into one statewide pga the company is also proposing a wna mechanism an evidentiary hearing is scheduled to begin on november 27 2006 with an order expected to be issued in february 2007 

 

in march 2006 we received notification from the tennessee regulatory authority tra that it disagreed with the way we calculated amounts under its performancebased rate mechanism which resulted in a onetime 33 million income reduction during the second quarter of fiscal 2006 we believe the original calculations were correct and have appealed the tra’s decision 

 

during the third quarter of fiscal 2005 atmos filed a rate case in its georgia service area seeking a rate increase of 40 million in december 2005 the georgia public service commission gpsc approved a 04 million increase in january 2006 we filed an appeal of the gpsc’s decision in the superior court of fulton county oral arguments were held on september 7 2006 before the fulton county superior court the court affirmed the commission’s order we are considering further appeal

atmos energy midtex division the following is a discussion of our recent ratemaking activity for our midtex division 

 

rate case 

 

during fiscal 2006 we received “show cause” resolutions from approximately 80 cities served by our midtex division including the city of dallas which require us to demonstrate that existing distribution rates in the midtex division are just and reasonable in may 2006 in response to these resolutions we filed a statement of intent to increase rates on a divisionwide basis by agreement with the cities the “show cause” resolutions were consolidated and became part of the midtex division’s first rate case before the rrc since we acquired the txu gas operations in october 2004 in this rate proceeding we are seeking incremental annual revenues in the midtex division of approximately 60 million and several rate design changes including wna revenue stabilization and recovery of the gas cost component of bad debt expense 

 

in exchange for an agreement to provide the intervening parties in the proceeding additional time to prepare for the hearing we obtained agreement from the intervenors to implement wna in the rates for the midtex division for the 20062007 winter season which has been approved by the rrc and to implement wna in the final rates in this proceeding the hearing in this proceeding was concluded on november 17 2006 and a decision is due from the rrc no later than april 2007 during the hearing the principal issues raised by the cities included the midtex division’s rate of return the reduction of rate base for the accumulated deferred federal income taxes and investment tax credits associated with the txu gas operations prior to our acquisition the methodology used by us to allocate certain shared services expenses to the division and the inclusion of certain items in operation and maintenance expenses 

 

in addition under applicable statutes the rrc is reviewing the interim rate adjustments that were previously granted in response to the midtex division’s prior grip filings and our acquisition of the txu gas operations for consistency with the public interest any increase that the rrc may grant in this case would be effective prospectively from the date of the final order however any decrease that may be ordered by the rrc would be effective from may 31 2006 pursuant to the agreement with the intervenors for consolidation of the show cause resolutions and the statement of intent filing any disallowance related to the previously granted grip interim rate adjustments would be refunded to customers with interest beginning some time after the issuance of a final order in this proceeding 

 

while the decision of the rrc in this case cannot be predicted with certainty we believe that we have adequately demonstrated to the rrc that the midtex division is entitled to receive an increase in annual revenues and that the remaining rate design changes should be implemented 

 

grip filings 

 

in march 2006 the midtex division made a grip filing to include in rate base approximately 622 million of distribution capital expenditures incurred during calendar year 2005 which we estimate would result in additional annual revenues of approximately 119 million the rrc approved this filing in august 2006 and the new customer charges were implemented in september 2006 billings to customers 

 

in september 2005 the midtex division made a grip filing to include in rate base approximately 294 million of distribution capital expenditures incurred during calendar year 2004 which currently provides additional annual revenues of approximately 67 million the rrc approved this filing in january 2006 and these new charges were included in the monthly customer charge beginning in february 2006 

 

in december 2004 the midtex division made a grip filing to include in rate base approximately 320 million of distribution capital expenditures made by txu gas during calendar year 2003 which 

currently provides additional annual revenues of approximately 67 million new monthly customer charges were implemented in october 2005 

 

other regulatory matters 

 

in september 2006 the midtex division filed its annual gas cost reconciliation with the rrc the filing reflects approximately 24 million in refunds of amounts that were overcollected from customers between july 2005 and june 2006 the midtex division has requested and received approval to refund these amounts over a sixmonth period beginning in november 2006 

 

in september 2004 the midtex division filed its 36month gas contract review with the rrc this proceeding involves a review for reasonableness of gas purchases totaling 22 billion made by the midtex division from november 2000 through october 2003 a hearing on this matter was held before the rrc in june 2005 the parties negotiated a unanimous settlement agreement providing for a refund of 8 million to customers over a threeyear period and for reimbursement of parties’ expenses without recovery from customers the rrc approved the settlement on september 12 2006 refunds to customers began in the first quarter of fiscal year 2007 

 

the midtex division is also pursuing an appeal to the travis county district court of the final order in its last systemwide rate case completed in may 2004 to obtain a return of and on its investment associated with the poly i replacement pipe that was originally disallowed in its rate case completed in may 2004 the case was argued before the travis county district court in july 2006 the court ruled to uphold the commission’s final order steps are being taken to perfect an appeal to the court of appeals in travis county 

 

atmos energy mississippi division through the first quarter of fiscal 2005 the mpsc required that we file for rate adjustments every six months rate filings were made in may and november of each year and the rate adjustments typically became effective in the following july and january 

 

during the second quarter of fiscal 2005 we agreed with the mpsc to suspend our may 2005 semiannual filing to allow sufficient time for us and the mpsc to undertake a comprehensive review in an effort to improve our rate design and the ratemaking process effective october 2005 our rate design was modified to substitute the original agreedupon benchmark with a sharing mechanism to allow the sharing of cost savings above an allowed return on equity level further we moved from a semiannual filing process to an annual filing process additionally our wna period begins on november 1 instead of november 15 and ends on april 30 instead of may 15 also we now have a fixed monthly customer base charge which makes a portion of our earnings less susceptible to usage as part of the rate design restructuring we agreed to reduce our rates by approximately 06 million we made our first annual filing under this new structure in september 2006 requesting no change in rates 

 

in september 2004 the mpsc originally disallowed certain deferred costs totaling 28 million in connection with the modification of our rate design described above the mpsc decided to allow these costs and we included these costs in our rates in october 2005 

 

in june 2006 the mpsc approved a pilot program whereby trans louisiana gas pipeline tlgp will provide asset management services to the mississippi division the asset management program allows tlgp to market certain offpeak gas supply assets such as companyowned or leased storage and pipeline capacity on a recallable basis in return tlgp will share net positive benefits of the asset management program with mississippi ratepayers the pilot program runs from june 1 2006 to april 30 2007 and may be extended by the mpsc upon application by atmos 

 

in october 2003 the mpsc issued a final order that denied our may 2003 request for a rate increase of 58 million in january 2004 the mpsc authorized additional annual revenue of 59 million on our november 2003 filing which became effective in december 2003 in september 2004 the mpsc authorized additional annualized revenue of 47 million on our may 2004 filing which became effective in june 2004 

 

we filed our second semiannual filing for 2004 in november 2004 requesting rate adjustments of 60 million in annualized revenue the mpsc allowed us to include 30 million in annualized revenue in 

our rates effective january 2005 in february 2005 we entered into an agreement with the mississippi public utilities staff that provides for an additional 13 million in annualized revenue that was retroactive to january 2005 which was approved by the mpsc during the second quarter of fiscal 2005 

 

atmos energy west texas division in september 2005 the west texas division made a grip filing to include in rate base approximately 226 million of distribution capital costs incurred during calendar year 2004 which should result in additional annual revenues of approximately 38 million of this amount approximately 13 million related to our lubbock jurisdiction and the remaining 25 million related to our west texas jurisdiction new charges for the filings were included in the monthly customer charge beginning may 2006 atmos made its 2005 grip filings for the west texas division and the lubbock division in september 2006 requesting no change in rates 

 

in january 2006 the lubbock texas city council passed a resolution requiring atmos to submit copies of all documentation necessary for the city to review the rates of atmos’ west texas division to ensure they are just and reasonable the requested information was provided to the city on february 28 2006 we believe that we will be able to ultimately demonstrate to the city of lubbock that our rates are just and reasonable 

 

in may 2006 atmos began receiving “show cause” ordinances from several of the cities in the west texas division we made a filing in response to the ordinances on october 2 2006 we believe that we will be able to ultimately demonstrate to the west texas cities that our rates are just and reasonable 

 

in october 2003 our west texas division filed a rate case in lubbock requesting a 30 million increase in annual revenues and wna for our residential commercial and publicauthority customers the city of lubbock approved a 15 million increase effective march 2004 as well as the proposed wna 

 

in september 2003 our west texas division filed a rate case in its west texas system to request a 77 million increase in annual revenues and wna for its residential commercial and publicauthority customers in may 2004 the 66 cities in its west texas system approved an increase of 32 million in our annual utility revenues the cities also approved a wna rider for residential commercial publicauthority and stateinstitution customers this rider became effective in october 2004 

 

other regulation 

 

each of our utility divisions is regulated by various state or local public utility authorities we are also subject to regulation by the united states department of transportation with respect to safety requirements in the operation and maintenance of our gas distribution facilities our distribution operations are also subject to various state and federal laws regulating environmental matters from time to time we receive inquiries regarding various environmental matters we believe that our properties and operations substantially comply with and are operated in substantial conformity with applicable safety and environmental statutes and regulations there are no administrative or judicial proceedings arising under environmental quality statutes pending or known to be contemplated by governmental agencies which would have a material adverse effect on us or our operations our environmental claims have arisen primarily from former manufactured gas plant sites in tennessee iowa and missouri these claims are fully described in note 13 to the consolidated financial statements 

 

ferc allows pursuant to section 311 of the natural gas policy act gas transportation services through our atmos pipeline — texas assets “on behalf of” interstate pipelines or local distribution companies served by interstate pipelines without subjecting these assets to the jurisdiction of the ferc 

 

competition 

 

although our utility operations are not currently in significant direct competition with any other distributors of natural gas to residential and commercial customers within our service areas we do compete with other natural gas suppliers and suppliers of alternative fuels for sales to industrial and agricultural customers we compete in all aspects of our business with alternative energy sources including in particular electricity electric utilities offer electricity as a rival energy source and compete for the space heating water heating and cooking markets promotional incentives improved equipment efficiencies and promotional rates all contribute to the acceptability of electrical equipment the principal means to compete against alternative fuels is lower prices 

and natural gas historically has maintained its price advantage in the residential commercial and industrial markets however higher gas prices coupled with the electric utilities’ marketing efforts have increased competition for residential and commercial customers in addition our natural gas marketing segment competes with other natural gas brokers in obtaining natural gas supplies for our customers 

 

employees 

 

at september 30 2006 we had 4632 employees consisting of 4402 employees in our utility segment and 230 employees in our other segments see “operating statistics — utility sales and statistical data by division” for the number of employees by division

 item 1a   risk factors tableend  

our financial and operating results are subject to a number of factors many of which are not within our control although we have tried to discuss key risk factors below please be aware that other risks may prove to be important in the future these factors include the following 

 

we are subject to regulation by each state in which we operate that affect our operations and financial results 

 

our natural gas utility business is subject to various regulated returns on its rate base in each of the 12 states in which we operate we monitor the allowed rates of return and our effectiveness in earning such rates and initiate rate proceedings or operating changes as we believe are needed in addition in the normal course of the regulatory environment assets may be placed in service and historical test periods established before rate cases that could adjust our returns can be filed once rate cases are filed regulatory bodies have the authority to suspend implementation of the new rates while studying the cases because of this process we must suffer the negative financial effects of having placed assets in service without the benefit of rate relief which is commonly referred to as “regulatory lag” in addition rate cases involve a risk of rate reduction and once rates have been approved they are still subject to challenge for their reasonableness by appropriate 

regulatory authorities our debt and equity financings are also subject to approval by regulatory bodies in several states which could limit our ability to take advantage of favorable market conditions 

 

our business could also be affected by deregulation initiatives including the development of unbundling initiatives in the natural gas industry unbundling is the separation of the provision and pricing of local distribution gas services into discrete components it typically focuses on the separation of the distribution and gas supply components and the resulting opening of the regulated components of sales services to alternative unregulated suppliers of those services although we believe that our enhanced technology and distribution system infrastructures have positively positioned us we cannot provide assurance that there would be no significant adverse effect on our business should unbundling or further deregulation of the natural gas distribution service business occur 

 

our operations are weather sensitive 

 

our natural gas utility sales volumes and related revenues are correlated with heating requirements that result from cold winter weather although beginning in the 20062007 winter heating season we will have weathernormalized rates for over 90 percent of our residential and commercial meters that should substantially eliminate the adverse effects of warmerthannormal weather for meters in those service areas our utility operating results will continue to vary with the temperatures during the winter heating season in addition sustained cold weather could adversely affect our natural gas marketing operations as we may be required to purchase gas at spot rates in a rising market to obtain sufficient volumes to fulfill some customer contracts 

 

the concentration of our distribution pipeline and storage operations in the state of texas have increased the exposure of our operations and financial results to adverse weather economic conditions or regulatory decisions in texas 

 

as a result of our acquisition of the distribution pipeline and storage operations of txu gas in october 2004 over 50 percent of our natural gas distribution customers and most of our pipeline and storage assets and operations are now located in the state of texas this concentration of our business in texas means that our operations and financial results are subject to greater impact than before from changes in the texas economy in general as well as the weather in our service areas of the state during the winter heating season our financial results in fiscal 2006 were adversely affected by warm weather in texas in addition the impact of any adverse rate or other regulatory decisions by state or local regulatory authorities in texas will also be greater the hearing in the midtex division’s first rate case since the txu gas acquisition has just concluded in the proceeding we are seeking additional revenue and several rate design changes a rate reduction or other significant adverse decision by the texas railroad commission in the proceeding could materially affect our financial results 

 

we are subject to environmental regulation which could adversely affect our operations or financial results 

 

we are subject to laws regulations and other legal requirements enacted or adopted by federal state and local governmental authorities relating to protection of the environment and health and safety matters including those legal requirements that govern discharges of substances into the air and water the management and disposal of hazardous substances and waste the cleanup of contaminated sites groundwater quality and availability plant and wildlife protection as well as work practices related to employee health and safety environmental legislation also requires that our facilities sites and other properties associated with our operations be operated maintained abandoned and reclaimed to the satisfaction of applicable regulatory authorities failure to comply with these laws regulations permits and licenses may expose us to fines penalties or interruptions in our operations that could be significant to our financial results in addition existing environmental regulations may be revised or our operations may become subject to new regulations such revised or new regulations could result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

our operations are exposed to market risks that are beyond our control which could adversely affect our financial results 

 

our risk management operations are subject to market risks beyond our control including market liquidity commodity price volatility and counterparty creditworthiness 

 

although we maintain a risk management policy we may not be able to completely offset the price risk associated with volatile gas prices or the risk in our natural gas marketing and pipeline and storage segments which could lead to volatility in our earnings physical trading also introduces price risk on any net open positions at the end of each trading day as well as volatility resulting from intraday fluctuations of gas prices and the potential for daily price movements between the time natural gas is purchased or sold for future delivery and the time the related purchase or sale is hedged although we manage our business to maintain no open positions there are times when limited net open positions related to our physical storage may occur on a shortterm basis the determination of our net open position as of any day requires us to make assumptions as to future circumstances including the use of gas by our customers in relation to our anticipated storage and market positions because the price risk associated with any net open position at the end of each day may increase if the assumptions are not realized we review these assumptions as part of our daily monitoring activities net open positions may increase volatility in our financial condition or results of operations if market prices move in a significantly favorable or unfavorable manner because the timing of the recognition of profits or losses on the hedges for financial accounting purposes does not always match up with the timing of the economic profits or losses on the item being hedged this volatility may occur with a resulting increase or decrease in earnings or losses even though the expected profit margin is essentially unchanged from the date the transactions were consummated further if the local physical markets in which we trade do not move consistently with the nymex futures market we could experience increased volatility in the financial results of our natural gas marketing and pipeline and storage segments 

 

our natural gas marketing and pipeline and storage segments manage margins and limit risk exposure on the sale of natural gas inventory or the offsetting fixedprice purchase or sale commitments for physical quantities of natural gas through the use of a variety of financial derivatives however contractual limitations could adversely affect our ability to withdraw gas from storage which could cause us to purchase gas at spot prices in a rising market to obtain sufficient volumes to fulfill customer contracts we could also realize financial losses on our efforts to limit risk as a result of volatility in the market prices of the underlying commodities or if a counterparty fails to perform under a contract in addition adverse changes in the creditworthiness of our counterparties could limit the level of trading activities with these parties and increase the risk that these parties may not perform under a contract 

 

we are also subject to interest rate risk on our commercial paper borrowings and floating rate debt in the past few years we have been operating in a relatively low interestrate environment with both short and longterm interest rates being relatively low compared to past interest rates however in the past two years the federal reserve has taken actions that have resulted in increases in shortterm interest rates future increases in interest rates could adversely affect our future financial results 

 

the execution of our business plan could be affected by an inability to access financial markets 

 

we rely upon access to both shortterm and longterm capital markets to satisfy our liquidity requirements adverse changes in the economy or these markets the overall health of the industries in which we operate and changes to our credit ratings could limit access to these markets increase our cost of capital or restrict the execution of our business plan 

 

our longterm debt is currently rated as “investment grade” by standard  poor’s corporation sp moody’s investors services inc moody’s and fitch ratings ltd fitch the three credit rating agencies that rate our longterm debt securities there can be no assurance that these rating agencies will maintain investment grade ratings for our longterm debt if we were to lose our investmentgrade rating the commercial paper markets and the commodity derivatives markets could become unavailable to us this would increase our borrowing costs for working capital and reduce the borrowing capacity of our gas marketing affiliate in addition if our commercial paper ratings were lowered it would increase the cost of commercial 

paper financing and could reduce or eliminate our ability to access the commercial paper markets if we are unable to issue commercial paper we intend to borrow under our bank credit facilities to meet our working capital needs this would increase the cost of our working capital financing 

 

inflation and increased gas costs could adversely impact our customer base and customer collections and increase our level of indebtedness 

 

inflation has caused increases in some of our operating expenses and has required assets to be replaced at higher costs we have a process in place to continually review the adequacy of our utility gas rates in relation to the increasing cost of providing service and the inherent regulatory lag in adjusting those gas rates historically we have been able to budget and control operating expenses and investments within the amounts authorized to be collected in rates and intend to continue to do so however the ability to control expenses is an important factor that could influence future results 

 

rapid increases in the price of purchased gas which occurred recently and in some prior years cause us to experience a significant increase in shortterm debt because we must pay suppliers for gas when it is purchased which can be significantly in advance of when these costs may be recovered through the collection of monthly customer bills for gas delivered increases in purchased gas costs also slow our utility collection efforts as customers are more likely to delay the payment of their gas bills leading to higher than normal accounts receivable this could result in higher shortterm debt levels greater collection efforts and increased bad debt expense 

 

our operations are subject to increased competition 

 

in the residential and commercial customer markets our regulated utility operations compete with other energy products such as electricity and propane our primary product competition is with electricity for heating water heating and cooking increases in the price of natural gas could negatively impact our competitive position by decreasing the price benefits of natural gas to the consumer this could adversely impact our business if as a result our customer growth slows resulting in reduced ability to make capital expenditures or if our customers further conserve their use of gas resulting in reduced gas purchases and customer billings 

 

in the case of industrial customers such as manufacturing plants and agricultural customers adverse economic conditions including higher gas costs could cause these customers to use alternative sources of energy such as electricity or bypass our systems in favor of special competitive contracts with lower perunit costs our pipeline and storage operations currently face limited competition from other existing intrastate pipelines and gas marketers seeking to provide or arrange transportation storage and other services for customers however competition may increase if new intrastate pipelines are constructed near our existing facilities 

 

the cost of providing pension and postretirement health care benefits is subject to changes in pension fund values and changing demographics and may have a material adverse effect on our financial results 

 

we provide a cashbalance pension plan for the benefit of eligible fulltime employees as well as postretirement health care benefits to eligible fulltime employees our costs of providing such benefits is subject to changes in the market value of our pension fund assets changing demographics including longer life expectancy of beneficiaries and an expected increase in the number of eligible former employees over the next five to ten years and various actuarial calculations and assumptions the actuarial assumptions used may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions higher or lower withdrawal rates and other factors these differences may result in a significant impact on the amount of pension expense or other postretirement benefit costs recorded in future periods 

our growth in the future may be limited by the nature of our business which requires extensive capital spending 

 

we must continually build additional capacity in our natural gas distribution system to maintain the growth in the number of our customers the cost of adding this capacity may be affected by a number of factors including the general state of the economy and weather our cash flows from operations are generally not sufficient to supply funding for all our capital expenditures including the financing of the costs of this new construction along with capital expenditures necessary to maintain our existing natural gas system as a result we must fund at least a portion of these costs through borrowing funds from third party lenders the cost of which is dependent on the interest rates at the time this in turn may limit our ability to connect new customers to our system due to constraints on the amount of funds we can invest in our infrastructure 

 

distributing and storing natural gas involve risks that may result in accidents and additional operating costs 

 

our natural gas distribution business involves a number of hazards and operating risks that cannot be completely avoided such as leaks accidents and operational problems which could cause loss of human life as well as substantial financial losses resulting from property damage damage to the environment and to our operations we do have liability and property insurance coverage in place for many of these hazards and risks however because our pipeline storage and distribution facilities are near or are in populated areas any loss of human life or adverse financial results resulting from such events could be large if these events were not fully covered by insurance our financial position and results of operations could be adversely affected 

 

natural disasters and terrorist activities and other actions could adversely affect our operations or financial results 

 

natural disasters are always a threat to our assets and operations in addition the threat of terrorist activities could lead to increased economic instability and volatility in the price of natural gas that could affect our operations also companies in our industry may face a heightened risk of exposure to actual acts of terrorism which could subject our operations to increased risks as a result the availability of insurance covering such risks may be more limited which could increase the risk that an event could adversely affect future financial results

distribution transmission and related assets 

 

at september 30 2006 our utility segment owned an aggregate of 75869 miles of underground distribution and transmission mains throughout our gas distribution systems these mains are located on easements or rightsofway which generally provide for perpetual use we maintain our mains through a program of continuous inspection and repair and believe that our system of mains is in good condition at september 30 2006 our pipeline and storage segment owned 6127 miles of gas transmission and gathering lines 

 

our utility segment also holds franchises granted by the incorporated cities and towns that we serve at september 30 2006 we held 1103 franchises having terms generally ranging from five to 35 years a significant number of our franchises expire each year which require renewal prior to the end of their terms we believe that we will be able to renew our franchises as they expire

overview 

 

in fiscal 2006 we earned 1477 million in net income or 182 per diluted share compared with net income of 1358 million or 172 per diluted share in fiscal 2005 the nine percent yearoveryear increase in net income was primarily attributable strong financial results in our natural gas marketing segment as it was able to capture higher margins in a volatile natural gas market and favorable unrealized marktomarket gains additionally pipeline and storage net income increased 16 percent compared with the prior year these positive results helped overcome the adverse effects on our utility segment of weather adjusted for wna that 

was 13 percent warmer than normal the adverse effect of hurricane katrina on our louisiana division and a nonrecurring noncash charge to impair certain assets our utility operations contributed 530 million 065 per diluted share or 36 percent to fiscal 2006 results our nonutility operations comprised of our natural gas marketing pipeline and storage and other nonutility segments contributed 947 million 117 per diluted share or 64 percent to fiscal 2006 results key financial and other events for fiscal 2006 include the following 

 

  

our financial performance is discussed in greater detail below in results of operations 

 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

 

our consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and the related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities we based our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including those related to risk management and trading activities allowance for doubtful accounts legal and environmental accruals insurance accruals pension and postretirement obligations deferred income taxes and the valuation of goodwill indefinitelived intangible assets and other longlived assets our critical accounting policies are reviewed by the audit committee quarterly actual results may differ from estimates 

regulation  — our utility operations are subject to regulation with respect to rates service maintenance of accounting records and various other matters by the respective regulatory authorities in the states in which we operate our regulated utility operations are accounted for in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas 71 accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation this statement requires costbased rateregulated entities that meet certain criteria to reflect the financial effects of the ratemaking and accounting practices and policies of the various regulatory commissions in their financial statements we record regulatory assets for costs that have been deferred for which future recovery through customer rates is considered probable regulatory liabilities are recorded when it is probable that revenues will be reduced for amounts that will be credited to customers through the ratemaking process as a result certain costs that would normally be expensed under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states are permitted to be capitalized because they can be recovered through rates further regulation may impact the period in which revenues or expenses are recognized the amounts to be recovered or recognized are based upon historical experience and our understanding of the regulations the impact of regulation on our utility operations may be affected by decisions of the regulatory authorities or the issuance of new regulations 

 

revenue recognition  — sales of natural gas to our utility customers are billed on a monthly cycle basis however the billing cycle periods for certain classes of customers do not necessarily coincide with accounting periods used for financial reporting purposes we follow the revenue accrual method of accounting for utility segment revenues whereby revenues applicable to gas delivered to customers but not yet billed under the cycle billing method are estimated and accrued and the related costs are charged to expense 

 

on occasion we are permitted to implement new rates that have not been formally approved by our regulators and are subject to refund as permitted by sfas no 71 we recognize this revenue and establish a reserve for amounts that could be refunded based on our experience for the jurisdiction in which the rates were implemented 

 

rates established by regulatory authorities are adjusted for increases and decreases in our purchased gas cost through purchased gas adjustment mechanisms purchased gas adjustment mechanisms provide gas utility companies a method of recovering purchased gas costs on an ongoing basis without filing a rate case to address all of the utility’s nongas costs these mechanisms are commonly utilized when regulatory authorities recognize a particular type of expense such as purchased gas costs that i is subject to significant price fluctuations compared to the utility’s other costs ii represents a large component of the utility’s cost of service and iii is generally outside the control of the gas utility there is no gross profit generated through purchased gas adjustments but they do provide a dollarfordollar offset to increases or decreases in utility gas costs although substantially all of our utility sales to our customers fluctuate with the cost of gas that we purchase utility gross profit is generally not affected by fluctuations in the cost of gas due to the purchased gas adjustment mechanism the effects of these purchased gas adjustment mechanisms are recorded as deferred gas costs on our balance sheet 

 

energy trading contracts resulting in the delivery of a commodity where we are the principal in the transaction are recorded as natural gas marketing sales or purchases at the time of physical delivery realized gains and losses from the settlement of financial instruments that do not result in physical delivery related to our natural gas marketing energy trading contracts and unrealized gains and losses from changes in the market value of open contracts are included as a component of natural gas marketing revenues 

 

allowance for doubtful accounts  — for the majority of our receivables we establish an allowance for doubtful accounts based on our collections experience on certain other receivables where we are aware of a specific customer’s inability or reluctance to pay we record an allowance for doubtful accounts against amounts due to reduce the net receivable balance to the amount we reasonably expect to collect however if circumstances change our estimate of the recoverability of accounts receivable could be different circumstances which could affect our estimates include but are not limited to customer credit issues the level of natural gas prices and general economic conditions accounts are written off once they are deemed to be uncollectible 

 

derivatives and hedging activities  — in our utility segment we use a combination of storage and financial derivatives to partially insulate us and our natural gas utility customers against gas price volatility 

during the winter heating season the financial derivatives we use in our utility segment are accounted for under the marktomarket method pursuant to sfas 133 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities changes in the valuation of these derivatives primarily result from changes in the valuation of the portfolio of contracts the maturity and settlement of contracts and newly originated transactions however because the costs of financial derivatives used in our utility segment will ultimately be recovered through our rates current period changes in the assets and liabilities from these risk management activities are recorded as a component of deferred gas costs in accordance with sfas 71 accordingly there is no earnings impact to our utility segment as a result of the use of financial derivatives the changes in the assets and liabilities from risk management activities are recognized in purchased gas cost in the income statement when the related costs are recovered through our rates 

 

our natural gas marketing risk management activities are conducted through our natural gas marketing segment this segment is exposed to risks associated with changes in the market price of natural gas which we manage through a combination of storage and financial derivatives including futures overthecounter and exchangetraded options and swap contracts with counterparties option contracts provide the right but not the requirement to buy or sell the commodity at a fixed price swap contracts require receipt of payment for the commodity based on the difference between a fixed price and the market price on the settlement date the use of these contracts is subject to our risk management policies which are monitored for compliance daily 

 

we participate in transactions in which we combine the natural gas commodity and transportation costs to minimize our costs incurred to serve our customers additionally we engage in natural gas storage transactions in which we seek to find and profit from pricing differences that occur over time we purchase or sell physical natural gas and then sell or purchase financial contracts at a price sufficient to cover our carrying costs and provide a gross profit margin through the use of transportation and storage services and derivatives we seek to capture gross profit margin through the arbitrage of pricing differences in various locations and by recognizing pricing differences that occur over time 

 

under sfas 133 natural gas inventory is designated as the hedged item in a fairvalue hedge by aem and atmos pipeline and storage llc this inventory is marked to market at the end of each month with changes in fair value recognized as unrealized gains or losses in revenue in the period of change effective october 2005 we changed the index used to value our physical natural gas from inside ferc to gas daily to better reflect the prices of our physical commodity this change had no material impact on our financial position on the date of adoption costs to store the gas are recognized in the period the costs are incurred we recognize revenue and the carrying value of the inventory as an associated purchased gas cost in our consolidated statement of income when we sell the gas and deliver it out of the storage facility 

 

derivatives associated with our natural gas inventory are marked to market each month based upon the nymex price with changes in fair value recognized as unrealized gains or losses in the period of change the difference in the indices used to mark to market our physical inventory gas daily and the related fairvalue hedges nymex are reported as a component of revenue and can result in volatility in our reported net income over time we expect gains and losses on the sale of storage gas inventory to be offset by gains and losses on the fairvalue hedges resulting in the realization of the economic gross profit margin we anticipated at the time we structured the original transaction we continually manage our positions and seek to optimize value as market conditions and other circumstances change we elect to exclude the differential between the spot price used to value our physical inventory and the forward price used to value the financial hedges designated against our physical inventory for purposes of assessing the effectiveness of these fairvalue hedges 

 

similar to our inventory position we attempt to mitigate substantially all of the commodity price risk associated with our fixedprice contracts with minimum volume requirements through the use of various offsetting derivatives prior to april 2004 these derivatives were not designated as hedges under sfas 133 because they naturally locked in the economic gross profit margin at the time we entered into the contract the fixedprice forward and offsetting derivative contracts were marked to market each month with changes in fair value recognized as unrealized gains and losses recorded in revenue in our consolidated statement of income the unrealized gains and losses were realized as a component of revenue in the period in which we fulfilled the requirements of the fixedprice contract and the derivatives settled to the extent that the 

unrealized gains and losses of the fixedprice forward contracts and the offsetting derivatives did not offset exactly our earnings experienced some volatility at delivery the gains and losses on the fixedprice contracts were offset by gains and losses on the derivatives resulting in the realization of the economic gross profit margin we anticipated at the time we structured the original transaction 

 

effective april 2004 we elected to treat our fixedprice forward contracts as normal purchases and sales as a result we ceased marking the fixedprice forward contracts to market we designated the offsetting derivative contracts as cash flow hedges of anticipated transactions as a result of this change unrealized gains and losses on these open derivative contracts have been recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income and are recognized in earnings as a component of revenue when the hedged volumes are sold hedge ineffectiveness to the extent incurred is reported as a component of revenue 

 

additionally we utilize storage swaps and futures to capture additional storage arbitrage opportunities that arise subsequent to the execution of the original fair value hedge associated with our physical natural gas inventory basis swaps to insulate and protect the economic value of our fixed price and storage books and various overthecounter and exchangetraded options although the purpose of these instruments is to either reduce basis or other risks or lock in arbitrage opportunities these derivative instruments have not been designated as hedges accordingly these derivative instruments are recorded at fair value with all changes in fair value included in revenue in our natural gas marketing segment 

 

during fiscal 2004 we entered into four treasury lock agreements to fix the treasury yield component of the interest cost of financing associated with the anticipated issuance of 875 million of longterm debt we designated these treasury lock agreements as cash flow hedges of an anticipated transaction accordingly unrealized gains and losses associated with the treasury lock agreements were recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income these treasury lock agreements were settled in october 2004 with a net 438 million payment to the counterparties this realized loss is being recognized as a component of interest expense over the life of the related financing arrangements 

 

the fair value of our financial derivatives is determined through a combination of prices actively quoted on national exchanges prices provided by other external sources and prices based on models and other valuation methods changes in the valuation of our financial derivatives primarily result from changes in market prices the valuation of the portfolio of our contracts maturity and settlement of these contracts and newly originated transactions each of which directly affect the estimated fair value of our derivatives we believe the market prices and models used to value these derivatives represent the best information available with respect to closing exchange and overthecounter quotations time value and volatility factors underlying the contracts values are adjusted to reflect the potential impact of an orderly liquidation of our positions over a reasonable period of time under then current market conditions 

 

impairment assessments  — we perform impairment assessments of our goodwill intangible assets subject to amortization and longlived assets we currently have no indefinitelived intangible assets we annually evaluate our goodwill balances for impairment during our second fiscal quarter or as impairment indicators arise we use a present value technique based on discounted cash flows to estimate the fair value of our reporting units we have determined our reporting units to be each of our utility divisions and whollyowned subsidiaries goodwill is allocated to the reporting units responsible for the acquisition that gave rise to the goodwill 

 

the discounted cash flow calculations used to assess goodwill impairment are dependent on several subjective factors including the timing of future cash flows future growth rates and the discount rate an impairment charge is recognized if the carrying value of a reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds its fair value 

 

we periodically evaluate whether events or circumstances have occurred that indicate that our intangible assets subject to amortization and other longlived assets may not be recoverable or that the remaining useful life may warrant revision when such events or circumstances are present we assess the recoverability of these assets by determining whether the carrying value will be recovered through expected future cash flows these cash flow projections consider various factors such as the timing of the future cash flows and the discount rate and are based upon the best information available at the time the estimate is made changes in 

these factors could materially affect the cash flow projections and result in the recognition of an impairment charge an impairment charge is recognized as the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value if the sum of the undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying value of the related asset 

 

pension and other postretirement plans  — pension and other postretirement plan costs and liabilities are determined on an actuarial basis and are affected by numerous assumptions and estimates including the market value of plan assets estimates of the expected return on plan assets assumed discount rates and current demographic and actuarial mortality data we review the estimates and assumptions underlying our pension and other postretirement plan costs and liabilities annually based upon a june 30 measurement date the assumed discount rate and the expected return are the assumptions that generally have the most significant impact on our pension costs and liabilities the assumed discount rate the assumed health care cost trend rate and assumed rates of retirement generally have the most significant impact on our postretirement plan costs and liabilities 

 

the discount rate is utilized principally in calculating the actuarial present value of our pension and postretirement obligation and net pension and postretirement cost when establishing our discount rate we consider high quality corporate bond rates based on moody’s aa bond index changes in those rates from the prior year and the implied discount rate that is derived from matching our projected benefit disbursements with a high quality corporate bond spot rate curve 

 

the expected longterm rate of return on assets is utilized in calculating the expected return on plan assets component of our annual pension and postretirement plan cost we estimate the expected return on plan assets by evaluating expected bond returns equity risk premiums asset allocations the effects of active plan management the impact of periodic plan asset rebalancing and historical performance we also consider the guidance from our investment advisors in making a final determination of our expected rate of return on assets to the extent the actual rate of return on assets realized over the course of a year is greater than or less than the assumed rate that year’s annual pension or postretirement plan cost is not affected rather this gain or loss reduces or increases future pension or postretirement plan cost over a period of approximately ten to twelve years 

 

we estimate the assumed health care cost trend rate used in determining our postretirement net expense based upon our actual health care cost experience the effects of recently enacted legislation and general economic conditions our assumed rate of retirement is estimated based upon our annual review of our participant census information as of the measurement date 

 

actual changes in the fair market value of plan assets and differences between the actual return on plan assets and the expected return on plan assets could have a material effect on the amount of pension cost ultimately recognized a 025 percent change in our discount rate would impact our pension and postretirement cost by approximately 11 million a 025 percent change in our expected rate of return would impact our pension and postretirement cost by approximately 08 million

year ended september 30 2006 compared with year ended september 30 2005 

 

utility segment 

 

our utility segment has historically contributed 65 to 85 percent of our consolidated net income however during fiscal 2006 our utility segment contributed approximately 36 percent of our consolidated net income primarily due to the adverse effect of significantly warmer than normal weather the adverse effect of hurricane katrina and a nonrecurring noncash charge to recognize the impairment of our irrigation assets the primary factors that impact the results of our utility operations are seasonal weather patterns competitive factors in the energy industry and economic conditions in our service areas natural gas sales to residential commercial and publicauthority customers are affected by winter heating season requirements this generally results in higher operating revenues and net income during the period from october through march of each year and lower operating revenues and either lower net income or net losses during the period from april through september of each year accordingly our second fiscal quarter has historically been our most critical earnings quarter with an average of approximately 64 percent of our consolidated net income having been earned in the second quarter during the three most recently completed fiscal years additionally we typically experience higher levels of accounts receivable accounts payable gas stored underground and shortterm debt balances during the winter heating season due to the seasonal nature of our revenues and the need to purchase and store gas to support these operations utility sales to industrial customers are much less weather sensitive 

 

changes in the cost of gas impact revenue but do not directly affect our gross profit from utility operations because the fluctuations in gas prices are passed through to our customers accordingly we believe gross profit margin is a better indicator of our financial performance than revenues however higher gas costs may cause customers to conserve or in the case of industrial customers to use alternative energy sources higher gas costs may also adversely impact our accounts receivable collections resulting in higher bad debt 

expense and may require us to increase borrowings under our credit facilities resulting in higher interest expense 

 

the effects of weather that is above or below normal are substantially offset through weather normalization adjustments in most of our service areas wna allows us to increase the base rate portion of customers’ bills when weather is warmer than normal and decrease the base rate when weather is colder than normal accordingly in our wna service areas our gross profit margin should be based substantially on the amount of gross profit that would result from normal weather despite actual weather conditions that may be either warmer or colder than normal 

 

during fiscal 2006 we received wna in our two most weather sensitive jurisdictions the louisiana and midtex divisions with the addition of wna in these two jurisdictions we will have weather protection for over 90 percent of our residential and commercial meters for the 20062007 winter heating season prior to these decisions there was limited weather protection in these jurisdictions the louisiana division had previously benefited from a higher base customer charge however this rate structure was not as beneficial during periods where weather was significantly warmer than normal in may 2006 the lpsc approved a settlement that provided for a modified wna which provides a partial decoupling mechanism to stabilize this jurisdiction’s margins the approved wna will cover a period from december to march 

 

prior to october 1 2006 the midtex division which is our largest utility division and contains almost 50 percent of our approximately 32 million distribution customers had benefited from a rate structure that combined a monthly customer charge with a declining block rate schedule to partially mitigate the impact of warmerthannormal weather on revenue the combination of the monthly customer charge and the customer billing under the first block of the declining block rate schedule provided for the recovery of a significant portion of our fixed costs for such operations under average weather conditions however this rate structure was not as beneficial during periods where weather was significantly warmer than normal 

 

in july 2006 in connection with the midtex division rate proceeding the rrc approved an interim and a permanent wna effective october 1 2006 for the midtex division the wna covers the period from october through may the interim wna is based on 30 years of weather history and the permanent wna will be modified or adjusted to conform to the rate design that the rrc ultimately approves in the rate proceeding which proceeding is described in greater detail under recent ratemaking activity 

 

in the pending rate proceeding before the rrc we are seeking for our midtex division additional annual revenues of approximately 60 million and several rate design changes including revenue stabilization and recovery of the gas cost component of bad debt expense while the outcome of the midtex division’s pending rate proceeding before the rrc cannot be predicted with certainty we believe that we have adequately demonstrated to the rrc that the midtex division is entitled to receive an increase in annual revenues and that the remaining rate design changes should be implemented however if the rrc were to deny an increase in the midtex division’s rates or not allow new rate design changes the midtex division has requested our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected in the future 

 

operating income 

 

utility gross profit increased to 9251 million for the year ended september 30 2006 from 9074 million for the year ended september 30 2005 total throughput for our utility business was 3940 bcf during the current year compared to 4111 bcf in the prior year 

 

the increase in utility gross profit despite lower throughput primarily reflects higher franchise fees and state gross receipts taxes which are paid by utility customers and have no permanent effect on net income additionally margins increased approximately 140 million due to rate increases received from our fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004 grip filings and the recognition of 62 million that had been previously deferred in louisiana following the lpsc’s ratification of our agreement in may 2006 these increases were partially offset by approximately 229 million due to the impact of significantly warmer than normal weather particularly in our midtex and louisiana divisions for the year ended september 30 2006 weather was 

13 percent warmer than normal as adjusted for jurisdictions with weathernormalized operations and two percent warmer than the prior year in the midtex and louisiana divisions which did not have weathernormalized rates during the 20052006 winter heating season weather was 28 percent and 22 percent warmer than normal 

 

additionally utility gross profit decreased approximately 29 million compared with the prior year in the louisiana division due to the impact of hurricane katrina service has been restored in some areas affected by the storm however it is not likely that service will be restored to all of the affected service areas as more fully described under recent ratemaking activity we implemented new rates in september 2006 that reflect the impact of hurricane katrina 

 

operating expenses increased to 7232 million for the year ended september 30 2006 from 6710 million for the year ended september 30 2005 the increase reflects a 133 million increase in taxes primarily related to franchise fees and state gross receipts taxes both of which are calculated as a percentage of revenue and are paid by our customers as a component of their monthly bills although these amounts are included as a component of revenue in accordance with our tariffs timing differences between when these amounts are billed to our customers and when we recognize the associated expense may affect net income favorably or unfavorably on a temporary basis however there is no permanent effect on net income 

 

operation and maintenance expense excluding the provision for doubtful accounts increased 78 million primarily due to higher employee costs associated with increased headcount to fill positions that were previously outsourced to a third party higher medical and dental claims and increased pension and postretirement costs resulting from changes in the assumptions used to determine our fiscal 2006 costs increased line locate telecommunication and facilities costs also contributed to the overall increase these increases were partially offset by a reduction in thirdparty costs for outsourced administrative and meter reading functions that were insourced during fiscal 2006 operation and maintenance expense for the year ended september 30 2006 was also favorably impacted by the absence of 21 million of merger and integration cost amortization associated with the merger of united cities gas company in july 1997 as these costs were fully amortized by december 2004 

 

the provision for doubtful accounts increased 31 million to 206 million for the year ended september 30 2006 compared with 175 million in the prior year the increase was primarily attributable to increased collection risk associated with higher natural gas prices in the utility segment the average cost of natural gas for the year ended september 30 2006 was 1002 per mcf compared with 741 per mcf for the year ended september 30 2005 

 

additionally during the first quarter of fiscal 2006 the mpsc in connection with the modification of our rate design described in recent ratemaking activity decided to allow the recovery of 28 million in deferred costs which it had originally disallowed in its september 2004 decision this charge was originally recorded in fiscal 2004 this ruling decreased our depreciation expense during the year ended september 30 2006 this decrease was offset by increased depreciation expense associated with the placement of various capital projects into service during the fiscal year 

 

operating expenses were also impacted by 229 million noncash charge to impair our west texas division’s irrigation assets during the fiscal 2006 fourth quarter we determined that as a result of declining irrigation sales primarily associated with our agricultural customers’ shift from gaspowered pumps to electric pumps the west texas division’s irrigation assets would not be able to generate sufficient future cash flows from operations to recover the net investment in these assets therefore the entire net book value was written off we will continue to operate these assets until we determine a plan for these assets as we are obligated to provide natural gas services to certain customers served by these assets 

 

as a result of the aforementioned factors our utility segment operating income for the year ended september 30 2006 decreased to 2019 million from 2364 million for the year ended september 30 2005 

miscellaneous income 

 

miscellaneous income for the year ended september 30 2006 was 95 million compared to miscellaneous income of 68 million for the year ended september 30 2005 this increase was primarily attributable to increased interest income on intercompany borrowings to our natural gas marketing segment to fund its working capital needs this increase was partially offset by a 33 million charge recorded during the fiscal 2006 second quarter associated with an adverse ruling in tennessee related to the calculation of a performancebased rate mechanism associated with gas purchases 

 

interest charges 

 

interest charges allocated to the utility segment for the year ended september 30 2006 increased to 1265 million from 1124 million for the year ended september 30 2005 the increase was attributable to higher average outstanding shortterm debt balances to fund natural gas purchases at significantly higher prices coupled with an approximate 200 basis point increase in the interest rate on our 300 million unsecured floating rate senior notes due 2007 due to an increase in the threemonth libor rate these increases were partially offset by 48 million of interest savings arising from the early payoff of 725 million of our first mortgage bonds in june 2005 

 

natural gas marketing segment 

 

our natural gas marketing segment aggregates and purchases gas supply arranges transportation andor storage logistics and ultimately delivers gas to our customers at competitive prices to facilitate this process we utilize proprietary and customerowned transportation and storage assets to provide the various services our customers request including furnishing natural gas supplies at fixed and marketbased prices contract negotiation and administration load forecasting gas storage acquisition and management services transportation services peaking sales and balancing services capacity utilization strategies and gas price hedging through the use of derivative products as a result our revenues arise from the types of commercial transactions we have structured with our customers and include the value we extract by optimizing the storage and transportation capacity we own or control as well as revenues for services we deliver 

 

to optimize the storage and transportation capacity we own or control we participate in transactions in which we combine the natural gas commodity and transportation costs to minimize our costs incurred to serve our customers by identifying the lowest cost alternative within the natural gas supplies transportation and markets to which we have access additionally we engage in natural gas storage transactions in which we seek to find and profit from the pricing differences that occur over time we purchase physical natural gas and then sell financial contracts at favorable prices to lock in gross profit margins through the use of transportation and storage services and derivative contracts we seek to capture gross profit margin through the arbitrage of pricing differences in various locations and by recognizing pricing differences that occur over time 

 

operating income 

 

gross profit margin for our natural gas marketing segment consists primarily of marketing activities which represent the utilization of proprietary and customerowned transportation and storage assets to provide the various services our customers request and storage activities which are derived from the optimization of our managed proprietary and third party storage and transportation assets 

our natural gas marketing segment’s gross profit margin was comprised of the following for the year ended september 30 2006 and 2005 

 

 

 

our natural gas marketing segment’s gross profit margin was 1306 million for the year ended september 30 2006 compared to gross profit of 620 million for the year ended september 30 2005 gross profit margin from our natural gas marketing segment for the year ended september 30 2006 included an unrealized gain of 172 million compared with an unrealized loss of 260 million in the prior year natural gas marketing sales volumes were 3365 bcf during the year ended september 30 2006 compared with 2732 bcf for the prior year excluding intersegment sales volumes natural gas marketing sales volumes were 2840 bcf during the current year compared with 2381 bcf in the prior year the increase in consolidated natural gas marketing sales volumes was primarily due to focusing our marketing efforts on higher margin opportunities partially offset by warmerthannormal weather across our market areas 

 

our storage activities generated 249 million in gross profit margin for the year ended september 30 2006 compared to 140 million for the year ended september 30 2005 lower realized margins in our storage operations were primarily due to the realization of less favorable arbitrage spreads compared with the prior year coupled with increased storage fees these decreases were partially offset by a decrease in the unrealized loss associated with these operations due to a favorable movement during the year ended september 30 2006 in the forward natural gas prices used to value the financial hedges designated against our physical inventory and our fixedprice forward contracts these decreases were also favorably impacted by positive basis ineffectiveness resulting from natural gas market price differences between the locations of the hedged inventory and the delivery location specified in the derivative instruments designated as a fair value hedge these results were magnified by a 76 bcf increase in our net physical position at september 30 2006 compared to the prior year we continually seek opportunities to increase the amount of our storage capacity to the extent we obtain and utilize new capacity and experience price volatility the amount of our unrealized storage contribution could increase in future periods 

 

our marketing activities generated 1057 million in gross profit margin for the year ended september 30 2006 compared with 480 million for the year ended september 30 2005 this increase reflects increased realized margins coupled with a favorable unrealized margin variance compared with the prior year the increase in our realized marketing operations was primarily attributable to successfully capturing increased margins in certain market areas that experienced higher market volatility the favorable unrealized margin variance was primarily due to favorable movement during the year ended september 30 2006 in the forward natural gas prices associated with financial derivatives used in these activities and positive basis ineffectiveness on those financial derivatives 

 

operating expenses which include operation and maintenance expense provision for doubtful accounts depreciation and amortization expense and taxes other than income taxes increased to 284 million for the 

year ended september 30 2006 from 210 million for the year ended september 30 2005 the increase in operating expense primarily was attributable to an increase in personnel costs due to increased headcount and an increase in regulatory compliance costs 

 

the improved gross profit margin partially offset by higher operating expenses resulted in an increase in our natural gas marketing segment operating income to 1022 million for the year ended september 30 2006 compared with operating income of 410 million for the year ended september 30 2005 

 

interest charges 

 

interest charges allocated to the natural gas marketing segment for the year ended september 30 2006 increased to 85 million from 34 million for the year ended september 30 2005 the increase was attributable to higher average outstanding debt balances to fund natural gas purchases at significantly higher prices 

 

pipeline and storage segment 

 

our pipeline and storage segment consists of the regulated pipeline and storage operations of the atmos pipeline — texas division and the nonregulated pipeline and storage operations of atmos pipeline and storage llc aps which were previously included in our other nonutility segment the atmos pipeline — texas division transports natural gas to our midtex division and for third parties and manages five underground storage reservoirs in texas we also provide ancillary services customary in the pipeline industry including parking arrangements lending and sales of inventory on hand these operations represent one of the largest intrastate pipeline operations in texas with a heavy concentration in the established natural gasproducing areas of central northern and eastern texas extending into or near the major producing areas of the texas gulf coast and the delaware and val verde basins of west texas this pipeline system provides access to nine basins located in texas which are estimated to contain a substantial portion of the nation’s remaining onshore natural gas reserves aps owns or has an interest in underground storage fields in kentucky and louisiana we also use these storage facilities to reduce the need to contract for additional pipeline capacity to meet customer demand during peak periods 

 

similar to our utility segment our pipeline and storage segment is impacted by seasonal weather patterns competitive factors in the energy industry and economic conditions in our service areas natural gas transportation requirements are affected by the winter heating season requirements of our customers this generally results in higher operating revenues and net income during the period from october through march of each year and lower operating revenues and either lower net income or net losses during the period from april through september of each year further as the atmos pipeline — texas division operations supply all of the natural gas for our midtex division the results of this segment are highly dependent upon the natural gas requirements of the midtex division as a regulated pipeline the operations of the atmos pipeline — texas division may be impacted by the timing of when costs and expenses are incurred and when these costs and expenses are recovered through its tariffs 

operating income 

 

gross profit margin for our pipeline and storage segment primarily consists of transportation margins earned from our midtex division and from third parties other ancillary pipeline services and asset management fees earned by aps our pipeline and storage segment’s gross profit margin was comprised of the following components for the year ended september 30 2006 and 2005 

 

 

 

pipeline and storage gross profit increased to 1597 million for the year ended september 30 2006 from 1465 million for the year ended september 30 2005 total pipeline transportation volumes were 5910 bcf during the year ended september 30 2006 compared with 5639 bcf for the prior year excluding intersegment transportation volumes total pipeline transportation volumes were 4202 bcf during the current year compared with 3834 bcf in the prior year 

 

the increase in gross profit was primarily attributable to increased thirdparty throughput and ancillary services coupled with increased margins on aps’ asset management contracts increased thirdparty throughput on atmos pipeline — texas was primarily attributable to increases in the electricgeneration market due to the warmer than normal temperatures during the summer of 2006 increased demand for throughsystem transportation services due to a widening of pricing differentials between the pipeline’s hubs and the impact of atmos pipeline — texas’ north side loop and other compression projects that were placed into service in june 2006 storage and parking and lending services on atmos pipeline — texas also increased during fiscal 2006 as a result of the widening of pricing differentials between the pipeline’s hubs which increased the attractiveness of storing gas on the pipeline and our ability to obtain improved margins for these services the increases on atmos pipeline — texas’ system were partially offset by a decrease in margins earned from intercompany transportation services to our midtex division due to the significantly warmer than normal weather experienced during fiscal 2006 additionally these increases were partially offset by the absence of inventory sales of 30 million realized in the prior year 

 

increases in aps’ margins due to its ability to capture more favorable arbitrage spreads on its asset management contracts also contributed to this segment’s improved gross profit margin these improved margins reflect an unrealized component as aps hedges its risk associated with these contracts during fiscal 2006 favorable movements in the forward natural gas prices used to value the financial hedges designated against the physical inventory underlying these contracts resulted in an unrealized gain compared with an unrealized loss in the prior year 

 

operating expenses increased to 819 million for the year ended september 30 2006 from 762 million for the year ended september 30 2005 due to higher employee benefit costs associated with the increase in headcount increased pension and postretirement costs resulting from changes in the assumptions used to determine our fiscal 2006 costs higher facilities costs and higher pipeline integrity costs 

 

as a result of the aforementioned factors our pipeline and storage segment operating income for the year ended september 30 2006 increased to 779 million from 703 million for the year ended september 30 2005 

other nonutility segment 

 

our other nonutility businesses consist primarily of the operations of atmos energy services llc and atmos power systems inc through aes we provide natural gas management services to our utility operations other than the midtex division these services which began april 2004 include aggregating and purchasing gas supply arranging transportation and storage logistics and ultimately delivering the gas to our utility service areas at competitive prices the revenues of aes represent charges to our utility divisions equal to the costs incurred to provide those services through atmos power systems inc we have constructed electric peaking powergenerating plants and associated facilities and have entered into agreements to lease these plants 

 

operating income for this segment primarily reflects the leasing income associated with two salestype lease transactions completed in 2001 and 2002 and was essentially unchanged for the year ended september 30 2006 compared with the prior year 

 

year ended september 30 2005 compared with year ended september 30 2004 

 

utility segment 

 

operating income 

 

utility gross profit increased to 9074 million for the year ended september 30 2005 from 5031 million for the year ended september 30 2004 total throughput for our utility business was 4111 bcf during the current year compared to 2460 bcf in the prior year 

 

the increase in utility gross profit margin primarily reflects the impact of the acquisition of the midtex division resulting in an increase in utility gross profit margin and total throughput of 3982 million and 1743 bcf the 61 million increase in the gross profit generated from our other utility operations primarily reflects rate increases in our mississippi and west texas divisions that were absent in the prior year coupled with the recognition of a 19 million refund to our customers in our colorado service area in the prior year offsetting these increases was a 39 million reduction in gross profit in our louisiana division due to the impact of hurricane katrina gross profit margins particularly in louisiana were also adversely impacted by weather as adjusted for jurisdictions with weathernormalized operations that was five percent warmer than normal and one percent warmer than the prior year period additionally gross profit margin was adversely impacted by the lack of cold weather in patterns sufficient to encourage customers to increase their heat load consumption and lower irrigation throughput in our west texas and coloradokansas divisions 

 

operating expenses which include operation and maintenance expense provision for doubtful accounts depreciation and amortization expense and taxes other than income taxes increased to 6710 million for the year ended september 30 2005 from 3432 million for the year ended september 30 2004 primarily as a result of the addition of the midtex division excluding the impact of the midtex division operating expenses for our other utility operations increased 145 million primarily due to 23 million associated with the effects of hurricane katrina a 77 million increase in taxes other than income a 24 million increase in operation and maintenance expense including the provision for doubtful accounts and a 21 million increase in depreciation and amortization included in taxes other than income taxes are franchise and state gross receipts taxes which are paid by our customers as a component of their monthly bills although these amounts are offset in revenues through customer billings timing differences between when the expense is incurred and is recovered may impact our net income on a temporary basis however there is no permanent effect on net income 

 

as a result of the aforementioned factors our utility segment operating income for the year ended september 30 2005 increased to 2364 million from 1599 million for the year ended september 30 2004 

 

miscellaneous income 

 

miscellaneous income increased to 68 million for the year ended september 30 2005 from 58 million for the year ended september 30 2004 the increase was attributable to an increase in interest income earned 

on higher cash balances during the current year compared with the prior year partially offset by the recognition of a 08 million gain on the sale of a building during the year ended september 30 2004 

 

interest charges 

 

interest charges allocated to the utility segment for the year ended september 30 2005 increased to 1124 million from 654 million for the year ended september 30 2004 the increase was attributable to the interest expense associated with the issuance of longterm debt to finance the acquisition of the midtex division in october 2004 on june 30 2005 we repaid 725 million in principal on five series of our first mortgage bonds prior to their scheduled maturities the early repayment of these bonds resulted in savings of 13 million in interest expense in fiscal 2005 

 

natural gas marketing segment 

 

operating income 

 

our natural gas marketing segment’s gross profit margin was comprised of the following for the years ended september 30 2005 and 2004 

 

 

 

our natural gas marketing segment’s gross profit margin was 620 million for the year ended september 30 2005 compared to gross profit of 466 million for the year ended september 30 2004 gross profit margin from our natural gas marketing segment for the year ended september 30 2005 included an unrealized loss of 260 million compared with an unrealized loss of 28 million in the prior year natural gas marketing sales volumes were 2732 bcf during the year ended september 30 2005 compared with 2651 bcf for the prior year excluding intersegment sales volumes natural gas marketing sales volumes were 2381 bcf during the current year compared with 2226 bcf in the prior year the increase in consolidated natural gas marketing sales volumes primarily was attributable to successfully executed marketing strategies into new market areas 

 

the contribution to gross profit from our storage activities was a gain of 140 million for the year ended september 30 2005 compared to a loss of 15 million for the year ended september 30 2004 the 155 million improvement primarily was attributable to a 299 million increase in the realized storage contribution for the year ended september 30 2005 compared to the prior year due to more favorable arbitrage spread opportunities during the current year partially offset by increased storage fees associated with 90 bcf of newly contracted storage capacity during the third quarter of fiscal 2005 annual demand charges for this new storage approximate 76 million we may further increase the amount of our storage capacity in the future therefore the impact of price volatility on our unrealized storage contribution could become more significant in future periods 

a 144 million decrease in the unrealized storage contribution resulted from an unfavorable movement during the year ended september 30 2005 in the forward indices used to value the storage financial instruments combined with greater physical natural gas storage quantities at september 30 2005 compared to the prior year also 

 

our marketing activities contributed 480 million to our gross profit for the year ended september 30 2005 compared to 482 million for the year ended september 30 2004 the decrease in the marketing contribution primarily was attributable to 120 million of unrealized markedtomarket losses associated with basis swaps that were put in place to capture margins in certain volatile market areas the increase in unrealized markedtomarket losses was partially offset by an increase in our realized marketing margins due to focusing our marketing efforts on higher margin customers and successfully entering into new market areas 

 

operating expenses which include operation and maintenance expense provision for doubtful accounts depreciation and amortization expense and taxes other than income taxes increased to 210 million for the year ended september 30 2005 from 189 million for the year ended september 30 2004 the increase in operating expense was attributable primarily to an increase in labor costs due to increased headcount and an increase in regulatory compliance costs 

 

the increase in gross profit margin combined with higher operating expenses resulted in an increase in our natural gas marketing segment operating income to 410 million for the year ended september 30 2005 compared with operating income of 277 million for the year ended september 30 2004 

 

pipeline and storage segment 

 

operating income 

 

pipeline and storage gross profit increased to 1465 million for the year ended september 30 2005 from 104 million for the year ended september 30 2004 total pipeline transportation volumes were 5639 bcf during the year ended september 30 2005 compared with 94 bcf for the prior year excluding intersegment transportation volumes total pipeline transportation volumes were 3834 bcf during the current year 

 

the increase in pipeline and storage gross profit margin primarily reflects the impact of the acquisition of the atmos pipeline — texas division resulting in an increase in pipeline and storage gross profit margin and total transportation volumes of 1381 million and 3756 bcf also contributing to atmos pipeline — texas division’s results were higher transportation and related services margin due to significant basis differentials at its three major texas hubs the 20 million decrease in the gross profit generated by aps primarily reflects a decrease in asset management fees received during fiscal 2005 

 

operating expenses increased to 762 million for the year ended september 30 2005 from 51 million for the year ended september 30 2004 due to the addition of 722 million in operating expenses associated with the atmos pipeline — texas division as the atmos pipeline — texas division is a regulated entity franchise and state gross receipts taxes are paid by our customers thus these amounts are offset in revenues through customer billings and have no permanent effect on net income included in operating expense was 89 million associated with taxes other than income taxes of which 83 million was associated with our atmos pipeline — texas division 

 

as a result of the aforementioned factors our pipeline and storage segment operating income for the year ended september 30 2005 increased to 703 million from 53 million for the year ended september 30 2004 

 

interest charges 

 

interest charges allocated to this segment for the year ended september 30 2005 increased to 246 million from 11 million for the year ended september 30 2004 the increase was attributable to the interest expense associated with the issuance of longterm debt to finance the acquisition of the atmos pipeline — texas division in october 2004 

other nonutility segment 

 

operating income for our other nonutility segment primarily reflects the leasing income associated with two salestype lease transactions completed in fiscal 2001 and 2002 the increase in operating income during the year ended september 30 2005 reflects the absence of a onetime charge of 04 million associated with the winddown of a noncore business during fiscal 2004 

 

miscellaneous income for the year ended september 30 2005 was 26 million compared with 83 million for the year ended september 30 2004 the 57 million decrease was attributable primarily to the recognition of a 59 million pretax gain on the sale of all remaining limited partnership interests in heritage propane partners lp during fiscal 2004 

 

liquidity and capital resources 

 

our working capital and liquidity for capital expenditure and other cash needs are provided from internally generated funds borrowings under our credit facilities and commercial paper program and funds raised from the public debt and equity capital markets we believe that these sources of funds will provide the necessary working capital and liquidity for capital expenditures and other cash needs for fiscal 2007 these facilities are described in greater detail below and in note 6 to the consolidated financial statements 

 

capitalization 

 

the following presents our capitalization as of september 30 2006 and 2005 

 

 

 

total debt as a percentage of total capitalization including shortterm debt was 609 percent and 593 percent at september 30 2006 and 2005 the increase in the debt to capitalization ratio was primarily attributable to an increase in our shortterm debt borrowings to fund our working capital needs partially offset by currentyear net income our ratio of total debt to capitalization is typically greater during the winter heating season as we make additional shortterm borrowings to fund natural gas purchases and meet our working capital requirements within three to five years we intend to reduce our capitalization ratio to a target range of 50 to 55 percent through cash flow generated from operations continued issuance of new common stock under our direct stock purchase plan and retirement savings plan and access to the equity capital markets 

 

cash flows 

 

our internally generated funds may change in the future due to a number of factors some of which we cannot control these include regulatory changes the price for our services the demand for services margin requirements resulting from significant changes in commodity prices operational risks and other factors 

 

cash flows from operating activities 

 

yearoveryear changes in our operating cash flows are primarily attributable to working capital changes within our utility segment resulting from the impact of weather the price of natural gas and the timing of customer collections payments for natural gas purchases and deferred gas cost recoveries 

 

for the year ended september 30 2006 we generated operating cash flow of 3114 million compared with 3869 million in fiscal 2005 and 2707 million in fiscal 2004 the significant factors impacting our operating cash flow for the last three fiscal years are summarized below 

year ended september 30 2006 

 

fiscal 2006 operating cash flows reflect the adverse impact of significantly higher natural gas prices yearoveryear unfavorable timing of payments for accounts payable and other accrued liabilities reduced operating cash flow by 5230 million partially offsetting these outflows were higher customer collections 2451 million and reduced payments for natural gas inventories 1021 million additionally favorable movements in the market indices used to value our natural gas marketing segment risk management assets and liabilities reduced the amount that we were required to deposit in a margin account and therefore favorably affected operating cash flow by 1263 million 

 

year ended september 30 2005 

 

fiscal 2005 operating cash flows reflect the effects of a 496 million increase in net income and effective working capital management partially offset by higher natural gas prices working capital management efforts which affected the timing of payments for accounts payable and other accrued liabilities favorably affected operating cash flow by 3541 million however these efforts were partially offset by reduced cash flow generated from accounts receivable changes by 1689 million primarily attributable to higher natural gas prices and an increase in our natural gas inventories attributable to a 13 percent yearoveryear increase in natural gas prices coupled with increased natural gas inventory levels which reduced operating cash flow by 818 million operating cash flow was also adversely impacted by unfavorable movements in the indices used to value our natural gas marketing segment risk management assets and liabilities which resulted in a net liability for the segment accordingly under the terms of the associated derivative contracts we were required to deposit 810 million into a margin account 

 

year ended september 30 2004 

 

fiscal 2004 operating cash flows were favorably impacted by several items improved customer collections during fiscal 2004 compared with the prior year resulted in a 622 million increase in operating cash flow further cash used for natural gas inventories decreased by 338 million compared with the prior year the decrease was attributable to lower injections of natural gas into storage partially offset by higher prices the reduction in the lag between the time period when we purchase our natural gas and the period in which we can include this cost in our gas rates improved operating cash flow by 657 million changes in cash held on deposit in margin accounts resulted in an increase in operating cash flow of 256 million this account represents deposits recorded to collateralize certain of our financial derivatives purchased in support of our natural gas marketing activities the favorable change was attributable to the fact that the fair value of financial instruments held by aem represented a net asset position at september 30 2004 which eliminated the need to place cash in margin accounts finally other working capital and other changes improved operating cash flow by 339 million these changes primarily related to various increases in deferred credits and other liabilities other current liabilities and income taxes payable partially offset by lower deferred income tax expense as compared with the prior year 

 

cash flows from investing activities 

 

during the last three years a substantial portion of our cash resources was used to fund acquisitions and growth projects our ongoing construction program and improvements to information systems our ongoing construction program enables us to provide natural gas distribution services to our existing customer base to expand our natural gas distribution services into new markets to enhance the integrity of our pipelines and more recently to expand our intrastate pipeline network in executing our current rate strategy we are directing discretionary capital spending to jurisdictions that permit us to earn a return on our investment timely currently our midtex louisiana mississippi and west texas utility divisions and our atmos pipeline — texas division have rate designs that provide the opportunity to include in their rate base approved capital costs on a periodic basis without being required to file a rate case 

 

for the year ended september 30 2006 we incurred 4253 million for capital expenditures compared with 3332 million for the year ended september 30 2005 and 1903 million for the year ended 

september 30 2004 the increase in capital expenditures in fiscal 2006 primarily reflects increased spending associated with our dallasfort worth metroplex north side loop project and other pipeline expansion projects in our atmos pipeline — texas division which were completed during the fiscal 2006 third quarter increased capital spending in our midtex division for various projects also contributed to the increase in our capital expenditures 

 

our cash used for investing activities for the year ended september 30 2005 reflects the 19 billion cash paid for the txu gas acquisition including related transaction costs and expenses cash flow from investing activities for the year ended september 30 2004 reflects the receipt of 279 million from the sale of our limited and general partnership interests in usp and heritage propane partners lp and from the sale of a building 

 

cash flows from financing activities 

 

for the year ended september 30 2006 our financing activities provided 1553 million in cash compared with 17 billion and 804 million provided for the years ended september 30 2005 and 2004 our significant financing activities for the years ended september 30 2006 2005 and 2004 are summarized as follows 

 

  

during the year ended september 30 2006 we issued 09 million shares of common stock which generated net proceeds of 233 million in addition we granted 03 million shares of common stock under 

our 1998 longterm incentive plan to directors officers and other participants in the plan the following table shows the number of shares issued for the years ended september 30 2006 2005 and 2004 

 

 

 

shelf registration 

 

in december 2001 we filed a registration statement with the securities and exchange commission sec to issue from time to time up to 6000 million in new common stock andor debt the registration statement was declared effective by the sec in january 2002 in july 2004 we sold 99 million shares of our common stock including the underwriters’ exercise of their overallotment option which exhausted the remaining availability under this registration statement 

 

in august 2004 we filed a registration statement with the sec to issue from time to time up to 22 billion in new common stock andor debt which became effective in september 2004 in october 2004 we sold 161 million common shares including the underwriters’ exercise of their overallotment option of 21 million shares under this registration statement generating net proceeds of 3825 million before other offering costs additionally we issued 139 billion of senior unsecured debt under the registration statement after issuing the debt and equity in october 2004 we had approximately 4015 million of availability remaining under this registration statement however we are no longer allowed to issue securities under that registration statement by applicable state regulatory commissions since we are in the process of securing their approval to issue a total of 900 million in securities under a new shelf registration statement including the remaining 4015 million of capacity carried over from the currently effective registration statement we intend to file this new registration statement with the sec in the near future 

 

credit facilities 

 

as of september 30 2006 we maintained three shortterm committed credit facilities totaling 918 million we also maintain one uncommitted credit facility totaling 25 million and through aem a second uncommitted credit facility that can provide up to 580 million borrowings under our uncommitted credit facilities are made on a whenandasneeded basis at the discretion of the banks our credit capacity and the amount of unused borrowing capacity are affected by the seasonal nature of the natural gas business and our shortterm borrowing requirements which are typically highest during colder winter months our working capital needs can vary significantly due to changes in the price of natural gas charged by suppliers and the increased gas supplies required to meet customers’ needs during periods of cold weather our cash needs for working capital have increased substantially as a result of the significant increase in the price of natural gas 

 

in october 2005 our 600 million 364day committed credit facility expired and was replaced with a 600 million threeyear revolving credit facility in addition in november 2005 we entered into a new 300 million 364day revolving credit facility with substantially the same terms as our 600 million credit facility 

in november 2006 we renewed our 300 million 364day revolving credit facility and were in the process of replacing our threeyear 600 million facility with a fiveyear 600 million revolving credit facility both facilities are being renewed with substantially the same terms as their predecessor facilities 

 

in april 2006 our 18 million committed unsecured credit facility was renewed for one year with no material changes to its terms and pricing at september 30 2006 31 million was outstanding under this facility 

 

as of september 30 2006 the amount available to us under these credit facilities net of outstanding letters of credit was 6090 million we believe these credit facilities combined with our operating cash flows will be sufficient to fund our increased working capital needs these facilities are described in further detail in note 6 to the consolidated financial statements 

 

in november 2005 aem amended its uncommitted demand working capital credit facility to increase the amount of credit available from 250 million to a maximum of 580 million in march 2006 aem amended and extended this uncommitted demand working capital credit facility to march 2007 at september 30 2006 there were no borrowings outstanding under this facility 

 

credit ratings 

 

our credit ratings directly affect our ability to obtain shortterm and longterm financing in addition to the cost of such financing in determining our credit ratings the rating agencies consider a number of quantitative factors including debt to total capitalization operating cash flow relative to outstanding debt operating cash flow coverage of interest and pension liabilities and funding status in addition the rating agencies consider qualitative factors such as consistency of our earnings over time the quality of our management and business strategy the risks associated with our utility and nonutility businesses and the regulatory structures that govern our rates in the states where we operate 

 

our debt is rated by three rating agencies standard  poor’s corporation sp moody’s investors services inc moody’s and fitch ratings ltd fitch our current debt ratings are all considered investment grade and are as follows 

 

 

 

currently with respect to our unsecured senior longterm debt sp moody’s and fitch maintain their stable outlook none of our ratings is currently under review 

 

a credit rating is not a recommendation to buy sell or hold securities the highest investment grade credit rating for sp is aaa moody’s is aaa and fitch is aaa the lowest investment grade credit rating for sp is bbb− moody’s is baa3 and fitch is bbb− our credit ratings may be revised or withdrawn at any time by the rating agencies and each rating should be evaluated independent of any other rating there can be no assurance that a rating will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if in its judgment circumstances so warrant 

 

debt covenants 

 

we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants as of september 30 2006 if we do not comply with our debt covenants we may be required to repay our outstanding balances on demand provide additional collateral or take other corrective actions our two public debt indentures relating to our senior notes and debentures as well as both our revolving credit agreements each contain a default provision that is triggered if outstanding indebtedness arising out of any other credit agreements in amounts ranging from in excess of 15 million to in excess of 100 million becomes due by acceleration or is not paid at maturity in addition aem’s credit agreement contains a crossdefault provision whereby aem would be in default if it defaults on other indebtedness as defined by at least 250 thousand in the aggregate additionally this agreement 

contains a provision that would limit the amount of credit available if atmos were downgraded below an sp rating of bbb and a moody’s rating of baa2 

 

except as described above we have no triggering events in our debt instruments that are tied to changes in specified credit ratings or stock price nor have we entered into any transactions that would require us to issue equity based on our credit rating or other triggering events 

 

additional information concerning our debt covenants and how we complied with those covenants is included in note 6 to the consolidated financial statements 

 

contractual obligations and commercial commitments 

 

the following tables provide information about contractual obligations and commercial commitments at september 30 2006 

 

 

 

 

  

aem has commitments to purchase physical quantities of natural gas under contracts indexed to the forward nymex strip or fixed price contracts at september 30 2006 aem was committed to purchase 617 bcf within one year 512 bcf between one to three years and 08 bcf after three years under indexed 

contracts aem was committed to purchase 24 bcf within one year and 01 bcf within one to three years under fixed price contracts with prices ranging from 340 to 1200 per mcf 

 

with the exception of our midtex division our utility segment maintains supply contracts with several vendors that generally cover a period of up to one year commitments for estimated base gas volumes are established under these contracts on a monthly basis at contractually negotiated prices commitments for incremental daily purchases are made as necessary during the month in accordance with the terms of the individual contract our midtex division maintains longterm supply contracts to ensure a reliable source of gas for our customers in its service area which obligate it to purchase specified volumes at market prices the estimated commitments under these contract terms as of september 30 2006 are reflected in the table above 

 

in may 2006 we announced plans to form a joint venture with a local natural gas producer to construct a natural gas gathering system in eastern kentucky that will originate in floyd county kentucky and extend north approximately 60 miles to interconnect with the tennessee gas pipeline in carter county kentucky tennessee gas pipeline’s interstate system delivers natural gas to the northeastern united states including new york city and boston referred to as the straight creek project the new system is expected to relieve severe gas gathering and transportation constraints that historically have burdened natural gas producers in the area and should improve delivery reliability to natural gas customers more than a dozen other producers have signed memoranda of understanding to commit gas volumes to the new system and to enter into agreements on commercially reasonable terms 

 

as currently designed the project is expected to cost between 75 million to 80 million in october 2006 ferc issued a declaratory order finding that the straight creek project will be exempt from ferc jurisdiction upon receiving all required regulatory approvals construction is expected to begin in the first half of fiscal 2007 with operations expected to begin in fiscal 2008 final terms of the joint venture are still being negotiated however we anticipate that we will have the ability to consolidate the joint venture 

 

risk management activities 

 

we conduct risk management activities through our utility natural gas marketing and pipeline and storage segments in our utility segment we use a combination of storage fixed physical contracts and fixed financial contracts to reduce our exposure to unusually large winterperiod gas price increases in our natural gas marketing and pipeline and storage segments we manage our exposure to the risk of natural gas price changes and lock in our gross profit margin through a combination of storage and financial derivatives including futures overthecounter and exchangetraded options and swap contracts with counterparties to the extent our inventory cost and actual sales and actual purchases do not correlate with the changes in the market indices we use in our hedges we could experience ineffectiveness or the hedges may no longer meet the accounting requirements for hedge accounting resulting in the derivatives being treated as mark to market instruments through earnings 

 

in our natural gas marketing segment hedge ineffectiveness resulting from natural gas market price differences between the locations of the hedged inventory and the delivery location specified in the hedge instruments referred to as basis ineffectiveness for both fair value and cash flow hedges was an unrealized gain of approximately 355 million for the year ended september 30 2006 and an unrealized loss of approximately 54 million and 11 million for the years ended september 30 2005 and 2004 actual hedge ineffectiveness resulting from the timing of settlement of physical contracts and the settlement of the derivative instruments referred to as timing ineffectiveness resulted in an unrealized gain of approximately 44 million and 05 million for the years ended september 30 2006 and 2004 and an unrealized loss of approximately 22 million for the year ended september 30 2005 

 

in our pipeline and storage segment timing ineffectiveness resulted in an unrealized loss of approximately 47 million and less than 01 million for the years ended september 30 2006 and 2004 and an unrealized gain of approximately 52 million for the year ended september 30 2005 

 

finally during fiscal 2004 we entered into four treasury lock agreements to fix the treasury yield component of the interest cost of financing associated with the anticipated issuance of 875 million of long 

term debt these treasury lock agreements were settled in october 2004 with a net 438 million payment to the counterparties approximately 116 million of the 438 million obligation is being recognized as a component of interest expense over a five year period from the date of settlement and the remaining amount approximately 322 million is being recognized as a component of interest expense over a ten year period from the date of settlement our risk management activities and related accounting treatment are described in further detail in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements 

 

we record our derivatives as a component of risk management assets and liabilities which are classified as current or noncurrent based upon the anticipated settlement date of the underlying derivative substantially all of our derivative financial instruments are valued using external market quotes and indices the following table shows the components of the change in fair value of our utility and natural gas marketing derivative contract activities for the year ended september 30 2006 in thousands 

 

 

 

the fair value of our utility and natural gas marketing derivative contracts at september 30 2006 is segregated below by time period and fair value source 

 

 

 

storage and hedging outlook 

 

aem participates in transactions in which it seeks to find and profit from pricing differences that occur over time aem purchases physical natural gas and then sells financial contracts at favorable prices to lock in a gross profit margin aem is able to capture gross profit margin through the arbitrage of pricing differences in various locations and by recognizing pricing differences that occur over time 

 

natural gas inventory is marked to market at the end of each month with changes in fair value recognized as unrealized gains and losses in the period of change effective october 1 2005 we changed the index used to value our physical natural gas from inside ferc to gas daily to better reflect the prices of our physical commodity this change had no material impact to the company on the date of adoption derivatives associated with our natural gas inventory which are designated as fair value hedges are marked to market each month based upon the nymex price with changes in fair value recognized as unrealized gains and losses in the period of change the changes in the difference between the indices used to mark to market our physical inventory gas daily and the related fairvalue hedge nymex are reported as a component of revenue and can result in volatility in our reported net income over time gains and losses on the sale of storage gas inventory will be offset by gains and losses on the fairvalue hedges therefore the economic gross profit aem captured in the original transaction remains essentially unchanged 

aem continually manages its positions to enhance the future economic profit it captured in the original transaction therefore aem may change its scheduled injection and withdrawal plans from one time period to another based on market conditions or adjust the amount of storage capacity it holds on a discretionary basis in an effort to achieve this objective aem monitors the impacts of these profit optimization efforts by estimating the gross profit that it captured and expects to collect through the purchase and sale of physical natural gas and the associated financial derivatives which we refer to as the economic gross profit the economic gross profit combined with the effect of unrealized gains or losses recognized in the financial statements in prior periods provides a measure of the gross profit that could occur in future periods if aem’s optimization efforts are fully successful the following table presents aem’s economic gross profit and its potential gross profit for the last three fiscal years 

 

 

 

as of september 30 2006 based upon aem’s derivatives position and inventory withdrawal schedule the economic gross profit was 600 million in addition 160 million of net unrealized losses were recorded in the financial statements as of september 30 2006 therefore the potential gross profit was 760 million this potential gross profit amount will not result in an equal increase in future net income as aem will incur additional storage and other operational expenses to realize this amount 

 

the economic gross profit is based upon planned injection and withdrawal schedules and the realization of the economic gross profit is contingent upon the execution of this plan weather and other execution factors since aem actively manages and optimizes its portfolio to enhance the future profitability of its storage position it may change its scheduled injection and withdrawal plans from one time period to another based on market conditions therefore we cannot assure that the economic gross profit or the potential gross profit calculated as of september 30 2006 will be fully realized in the future or in what time period further if we experience operational or other issues which limit our ability to optimally manage our stored gas positions our earnings could be adversely impacted 

 

pension and postretirement benefits obligations 

 

net periodic pension and postretirement benefit costs 

 

for the fiscal year ended september 30 2006 our total net periodic pension and other benefits costs was 500 million compared with 364 million and 261 million for the years ended september 30 2005 and 2004 all of these costs are recoverable through our gas utility rates however a portion of these costs is capitalized into our utility rate base the remaining costs are recorded as a component of operation and maintenance expense 

 

the increase in total net periodic pension and other benefits cost during fiscal 2006 compared with the prior year primarily reflects changes in assumptions we made during our annual pension plan valuation completed june 30 2005 the discount rate used to compute the present value of a plan’s liabilities generally is based on rates of highgrade corporate bonds with maturities similar to the average period over which the benefits will be paid in the period leading up to our june 30 2005 measurement date these interest rates were declining which resulted in a 125 basis point reduction in our discount rate to 50 percent this reduction increased the present value of our plan liabilities and associated expenses additionally we reduced the expected return on our pension plan assets by 25 basis points to 85 percent which also increased our pension and postretirement benefit cost 

 

the increase in total net periodic pension and other benefits cost during fiscal 2005 compared with fiscal 2004 primarily reflects an increase in our service cost associated with the increase in the number of employees 

covered by our plans due to the txu gas acquisition although we did not assume the existing employee benefit liabilities or plans of txu gas for purposes of determining our annual pension cost we agreed to give the transitioned employees credit for years of txu gas service under our pension plan with respect to our postretirement medical plan we received a credit of 189 million against the purchase price to permit us to provide partial past service credits for retiree medical benefits under our retiree medical plan the 189 million credit approximated the actuarially determined present value of the accumulated benefits related to the past service of the transferred employees on the acquisition date 

 

in addition to the increased number of employees covered by the plans we changed the assumptions used to determine our fiscal 2005 benefit costs which resulted in an increase in our net periodic pension and postretirement costs we increased the discount rate by 25 basis points and we reduced our expected return on our pension plan assets by 25 basis points these assumption changes decreased the service cost and interest cost and reduced the expected return components of our pension and postretirement benefits costs 

 

pension and postretirement plan funding 

 

generally our funding policy is to contribute annually an amount in accordance with the requirements of the employee retirement income security act of 1974 however additional voluntary contributions are made from time to time as considered necessary contributions are intended to provide not only for benefits attributed to service to date but also for those expected to be earned in the future 

 

during fiscal 2006 we voluntarily contributed 29 million to the atmos energy corporation retirement plan for mississippi valley gas union employees the current year contribution achieved a desired level of funding by satisfying the minimum funding requirements while maximizing the tax deductible contribution for this plan for plan year 2005 during fiscal 2005 we voluntarily contributed 30 million to the master trust to maintain the level of funding we desire relative to our accumulated benefit obligation we made the contribution because declining high yield corporate bond yields in the period leading up to our june 30 2005 measurement date resulted in an increase in the present value of our plan liabilities 

 

we contributed 109 million 100 million and 138 million to our postretirement benefits plans for the years ended september 30 2006 2005 and 2004 the contributions represent the portion of the postretirement costs we are responsible for under the terms of our plan and minimum funding required by our regulators 

 

outlook for fiscal 2007 

 

high grade corporate bond yields increased in the period leading up to our june 30 2006 measurement date therefore we increased the discount rate for determining our fiscal 2007 pension and benefit costs by 130 basis points to 63 percent however we reduced the expected return on our pension plan assets by 25 basis points to 825 percent the effect of these assumption changes coupled with the effects of updating our annual valuation should not significantly affect our fiscal 2007 net pension and postretirement costs compared to fiscal 2006 

 

we are not required to make a minimum funding contribution to our pension plans during fiscal 2007 nor at this time do we intend to make voluntary contributions during 2007 however we anticipate contributing approximately 11 million to our postretirement medical plans during fiscal 2007 

 

the projected pension liability future funding requirements and the amount of pension expense or income recognized for the plan are subject to change depending upon the actuarial value of plan assets and the determination of future benefit obligations as of each subsequent actuarial calculation date these amounts are impacted by actual investment returns changes in interest rates and changes in the demographic composition of the participants in the plan

recent accounting developments and their impact on our financial position results of operations and cash flows are described in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements

 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend  

we are exposed to risks associated with commodity prices and interest rates commodity price risk is the potential loss that we may incur as a result of changes in the fair value of a particular instrument or commodity interestrate risk results from our portfolio of debt and equity instruments that we issue to provide financing and liquidity for our business activities 

 

we conduct risk management activities through both our utility and natural gas marketing segments in our utility segment we use a combination of storage fixed physical contracts and fixed financial contracts to protect us and our customers against unusually large winter period gas price increases in our natural gas marketing segment we manage our exposure to the risk of natural gas price changes and lock in our gross profit margin through a combination of storage and financial derivatives including futures overthecounter and exchangetraded options and swap contracts with counterparties our risk management activities and related accounting treatment are described in further detail in note 5 to the condensed consolidated financial statements additionally our earnings are affected by changes in shortterm interest rates as a result of our issuance of shortterm commercial paper the issuance of floating rate debt in october 2004 and our other shortterm borrowings 

 

commodity price risk 

 

utility segment 

 

we purchase natural gas for our utility operations substantially all of the cost of gas purchased for utility operations is recovered from our customers through purchased gas adjustment mechanisms however our utility operations have commodity price risk exposure to fluctuations in spot natural gas prices related to purchases for sales to our nonregulated energy services customers at fixed prices 

 

for our utility segment we use a sensitivity analysis to estimate commodity price risk for purposes of this analysis we estimate commodity price risk by applying a hypothetical 10 percent increase in the portion of our gas cost related to fixedprice nonregulated sales based on these projected nonregulated gas sales a hypothetical 10 percent increase in fixed prices based upon the september 30 2006 three month market strip would increase our purchased gas cost by approximately 23 million in fiscal 2007 

 

natural gas marketing and pipeline and storage segments 

 

our natural gas marketing segment is also exposed to risks associated with changes in the market price of natural gas for our natural gas marketing segment we use a sensitivity analysis to estimate commodity price risk for purposes of this analysis we estimate commodity price risk by applying a 050 change in the forward nymex price to our net open position including existing storage and related financial contracts at the end of each period based on aeh’s net open position including existing storage and related financial contracts at september 30 2006 of 02 bcf a 050 change in the forward nymex price would have had less than a 01 million impact on our consolidated net income 

 

changes in the difference between the indices used to mark to market our physical inventory gas daily and the related fairvalue hedge nymex can result in volatility in our reported net income but over time gains and losses on the sale of storage gas inventory will be offset by gains and losses on the fairvalue hedges based upon our net physical position at september 30 2006 and assuming our hedges would still qualify as highly effective a 050 change in the difference between the gas daily and nymex indices would impact our reported net income by approximately 50 million 

additionally these changes could cause us to recognize a risk management liability which would require us to place cash into an escrow account to collateralize this liability position this in turn would reduce the amount of cash we would have on hand to fund our working capital needs because we recognized risk management liabilities as of september 30 2006 we placed 356 million in escrow to collateralize these liabilities 

 

interest rate risk 

 

our earnings are exposed to changes in shortterm interest rates associated with our shortterm commercial paper program and other shortterm borrowings we use a sensitivity analysis to estimate our shortterm interest rate risk for purposes of this analysis we estimate our shortterm interest rate risk as the difference between our actual interest expense for the period and estimated interest expense for the period assuming a hypothetical average one percent increase in the interest rates associated with our shortterm borrowings had interest rates associated with our shortterm borrowings increased by an average of one percent our interest expense would have increased by approximately 36 million during 2006 

 

we also assess market risk for our fixed and floating rate longterm obligations we estimate market risk for our longterm obligations as the potential increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical one percent decrease in interest rates associated with these debt instruments fair value is estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis assuming this one percent hypothetical decrease the fair value of our longterm obligations would have increased by approximately 1433 million 

 

as of september 30 2006 we were not engaged in other activities that would cause exposure to the risk of material earnings or cash flow loss due to changes in interest rates or market commodity prices

atmos energy corporation 

 

we have audited management’s assessment included in the accompanying management’s report on internal control over financial reporting that atmos energy corporation maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of september 30 2006 based on criteria established in internal control — integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission the coso criteria atmos energy corporation’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting our responsibility is to express an opinion on management’s assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit 

 

we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting evaluating management’s assessment testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion 

 

a company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

 

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

 

in our opinion management’s assessment that atmos energy corporation maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of september 30 2006 is fairly stated in all material respects based on the coso criteria also in our opinion atmos energy corporation maintained in all material respects effective internal control over financial reporting as of september 30 2006 based on the coso criteria

 item 1 business tableend overview 

  atmos energy corporation aec headquartered in dallas texas is engaged primarily in the natural gas utility business as well as other natural gas nonutility businesses we are one of the country’s largest naturalgasonly distributors based on number of customers and one of the largest intrastate pipeline operators in texas based upon miles of pipe as of september 30 2005 we distributed natural gas through sales and transportation arrangements to approximately 32 million residential commercial public authority and industrial customers through our seven regulated utility divisions which covered service areas in 12 states our primary service areas are located in colorado kansas kentucky louisiana mississippi tennessee and texas we have more limited service areas in georgia illinois iowa missouri and virginia in addition we transport natural gas for others through our distribution system 

  through our nonutility businesses we primarily provide natural gas management and marketing services to municipalities other local gas distribution companies and industrial customers in 22 states and natural gas transportation and storage services to certain of our utility divisions and to third parties 

operating segments 

  our operations are divided into four segments 

 strategy 

  our overall strategy is to 

   over the last five years we have grown through several acquisitions including our acquisition in april 2001 of the remaining 55 percent interest in woodward marketing llc that we did not already own our acquisition in july 2001 of the assets of louisiana gas service company our acquisition in december 2002 of mississippi valley gas company mvg and our acquisition on october 1 2004 of the natural gas distribution and pipeline operations of txu gas company txu gas 

  the txu gas operations we acquired are regulated businesses engaged in the purchase transmission distribution and sale of natural gas in the northcentral eastern and western parts of texas through these newly acquired operations we provide gas distribution services to approximately 15 million residential and business customers in texas including the dallas fort worth metropolitan area we also now own and operate a system consisting of 6162 miles of gas transmission and gathering lines and five underground storage reservoirs all within texas 

4   the purchase price for the txu gas acquisition was approximately 19 billion after closing adjustments and before transaction costs and expenses which we paid in cash we acquired approximately 112 million of working capital and did not assume any indebtedness of txu gas in connection with the acquisition txu gas retained certain assets provided for the repayment of all of its indebtedness and redeemed all of its preferred stock prior to closing and retained and agreed to pay certain other liabilities under the terms of the acquisition agreement 

  we funded the purchase price for the txu gas acquisition with approximately 2357 million in net proceeds from our offering of approximately 99 million shares of common stock which we completed on july 19 2004 and approximately 17 billion in net proceeds from our issuance on october 1 2004 of commercial paper backstopped by a senior unsecured revolving credit agreement which we entered into on september 24 2004 for bridge financing for the txu gas acquisition in october 2004 we repaid the commercial paper used to fund the acquisition through the issuance of senior unsecured notes on october 22 2004 which generated net proceeds of approximately 139 billion and the sale of 161 million shares of common stock on october 27 2004 which generated net proceeds of approximately 3825 million before other offering costs 

  we have experienced over 20 consecutive years of increasing dividends and earnings growth after giving effect to our acquisitions we have achieved this record of growth while operating our utility operations efficiently by managing our operating and maintenance expenses leveraging our technology such as our 24hour call centers to achieve more efficient operations focusing on regulatory rate proceedings to increase revenue as our costs increase and mitigating weatherrelated risks through weathernormalized rates in many of our service areas additionally we have strengthened our nonutility business by increasing gross profit margins actively pursuing opportunities to increase the amount of storage available to us and expanding commercial opportunities on our intrastate texas pipeline 

  our core values include focusing on our employees and customers while conducting our business with honesty and integrity we continue to strengthen our culture through ongoing communications with our employees and enhanced employee training 

utility segment overview 

  we operate our utility segment through the following seven regulated natural gas utility divisions 

   our natural gas utility distribution business is seasonal and dependent on weather conditions in our service areas gas sales to residential and commercial customers are greater during the winter months than during the remainder of the year the volumes of gas sales during the winter months will vary with the temperatures during these months the seasonal nature of our sales to residential and commercial customers is partially offset by our sales in the spring and summer months to our agricultural customers in texas colorado and kansas who use natural gas to operate irrigation equipment 

  in addition to weather our financial results are affected by the cost of natural gas and economic conditions in the areas that we serve higher gas costs which we are generally able to pass through to our customers under purchased gas adjustment clauses may cause customers to conserve or in the case of 

5 industrial customers to use alternative energy sources higher gas costs may also adversely impact our accounts receivable collections resulting in higher bad debt expense and may require us to increase borrowings under our credit facilities resulting in higher interest expense 

  the effect of weather that is above or below normal is partially offset through weather normalization adjustments or wna as approved by the regulators in certain of our service areas wna allows us to increase customers’ bills to offset lower gas usage when weather is warmer than normal and decrease customers’ bills to offset higher gas usage when weather is colder than normal as of september 30 2005 we had wna in the following service areas for the following periods which covered approximately 10 million of our meters in service 

  

   our midtex division does not have wna however their operations benefit from a rate structure that combines a monthly customer charge with a declining block rate schedule to partially mitigate the impact of warmerthannormal weather on revenue the combination of the monthly customer charge and the customer billing under the first block of the declining block rate schedule provides for the recovery of most of our fixed costs for such operations under most weather conditions however this rate structure is not as beneficial during periods where weather is significantly warmer than normal 

  our natural gas supply comes from a variety of third party providers and from gas held in storage we anticipate that the natural gas supply for the upcoming winter heating season will be provided by a variety of suppliers including independent producers marketers and pipeline companies in addition to withdrawals of gas from storage additionally the natural gas supply for our midtex division includes peaking and spot purchase agreements we also contract for storage service in underground storage facilities on many of the interstate pipelines serving us we estimate the peakday availability of natural gas supply from longterm contracts shortterm contracts and withdrawals from underground storage to be approximately 42 bcf the peakday demand for our utility operations in fiscal 2005 was on december 23 2004 when sales to customers reached approximately 35 bcf 

  supply arrangements are contracted from our suppliers on a firm basis with various terms at market prices the firm supply consists of both base load and swing supply quantities base load quantities are those that flow at a constant level throughout the month and swing supply quantities provide the flexibility to change daily quantities to match increases or decreases in requirements related to weather conditions except for local production purchases we select suppliers through a competitive bidding process by requesting proposals from suppliers that have demonstrated that they can provide reliable service we select these suppliers based on their ability to deliver gas supply to our designated firm pipeline receipt points at the lowest cost major suppliers during fiscal 2005 were anadarko energy services bp energy company chevron corporation conocophillips company cross timbers energy services inc devon gas services lp enbridge marketing us lp oneok energy services company lp tenaska marketing and atmos energy marketing llc our natural gas marketing subsidiary 

6   the combination of base load peaking and spot purchase agreements coupled with the withdrawal of gas held in storage allows us the flexibility to adjust to changes in weather which minimizes our need to enter into firm commitments 

  also to maintain our deliveries to high priority customers we have the ability and have exercised our right to curtail deliveries to certain customers under the terms of interruptible contracts applicable state statutes or regulations our customers’ demand on our system is not necessarily indicative of our ability to meet current or anticipated market demands or immediate delivery requirements because of factors such as the physical limitations of gathering storage and transmission systems the duration and severity of cold weather the availability of gas reserves from our suppliers the ability to purchase additional supplies on a shortterm basis and actions by federal and state regulatory authorities curtailment rights provide us the flexibility to meet the humanneeds requirements of our customers on a firm basis priority allocations imposed by federal and state regulatory agencies as well as other factors beyond our control may affect our ability to meet the demands of our customers we anticipate no problems with obtaining additional gas supply as needed for our customers 

  we receive gas deliveries for all of our utility divisions except for our midtex division through 37 pipeline transportation companies both interstate and intrastate to satisfy our natural gas needs the pipeline transportation agreements are firm and many of them have “pipeline nonotice” storage service which provides for daily balancing between system requirements and nominated flowing supplies these agreements have been negotiated with the shortest term necessary while still maintaining our right of first refusal the natural gas supply for our midtex division is delivered by our atmos pipeline — texas division which was formed from the natural gas transmission and storage operations that we acquired in the txu gas acquisition 

  the following is a brief description of our seven natural gas utility divisions additional information for our natural gas utility divisions is presented under the caption “operating statistics” 

  atmos energy coloradokansas division our coloradokansas division operates in colorado kansas and the southwestern corner of missouri and is regulated by each respective state’s public service commission with respect to accounting rates and charges operating matters and the issuance of securities we operate under terms of nonexclusive franchises granted by the various cities rates in our kansas service area are subject to wna the principal transporters of the coloradokansas division’s gas supply requirements are colorado interstate gas company northwest pipeline public service company of colorado and southern star central pipeline additionally the coloradokansas division purchases substantial volumes from producers that are connected directly to its distribution system 

  atmos energy kentucky division our kentucky division operates in kentucky and is regulated by the kentucky public service commission which regulates utility services rates issuance of securities and other matters we operate in various incorporated cities pursuant to nonexclusive franchises granted by these cities the sale of natural gas for use as vehicle fuel in kentucky is unregulated we will operate under a performancebased rate program through march 2006 under the performancebased program we and our customers jointly share in any actual gas cost savings achieved when compared to predetermined benchmarks our rates are also subject to wna the kentucky division’s gas supply is delivered primarily by midwestern pipeline tennessee gas pipeline company texas gas transmission llc and trunkline gas company 

  atmos energy louisiana division our louisiana division operates in louisiana and includes the operations of the louisiana gas service company assets acquired in july 2001 which serves the metropolitan area of monroe and the suburban areas of new orleans and our previously existing trans la division which serves western louisiana our louisiana division is regulated by the louisiana public service commission lpsc which regulates utility services rates and other matters we operate most of our service areas pursuant to a nonexclusive franchise granted by the governing authority of each area direct sales of natural gas to industrial customers in louisiana who use gas for fuel or in manufacturing processes and sales of natural gas for vehicle fuel are exempt from regulation and are recognized in our natural gas marketing segment the principal transporters of the louisiana division’s gas supply requirements are acadian pipeline 

7 gulf south louisiana intrastate gas company texas gas transmission llc and trans louisiana gas pipeline inc a subsidiary of atmos pipeline and storage llc 

  atmos energy midstates division our midstates division operates in georgia illinois iowa missouri tennessee and virginia in each of these states our rates services and operations as a natural gas distribution company are subject to general regulation by each state’s public service commission we operate in each community where necessary under a franchise granted by the municipality for a fixed term of years in tennessee and georgia we have wna and a performancebased rate program which provides incentives for us to find ways to lower costs and share the cost savings with our customers beginning in july 2005 we have wna in virginia that will cover the entire year our midstates division is served by 13 interstate pipelines however the majority of the volumes are transported through columbia gulf east tennessee pipeline southern natural gas and tennessee gas pipeline 

  atmos energy midtex division our midtex division which represents the distribution assets and operations that we acquired from txu gas on october 1 2004 includes natural gas distribution operations that operate in the northcentral eastern and western parts of texas the midtex division purchases distributes and sells natural gas to approximately 15 million residential and business customers in approximately 550 cities and towns including the 11county dallas fort worth metropolitan area under a may 2004 rate filing this division operates under a systemwide rate structure along with the pipeline operations we acquired in the acquisition the governing body of each municipality we serve has original jurisdiction over all utility rates operations and services within its city limits except with respect to sales of natural gas for vehicle fuel and agricultural use we operate pursuant to nonexclusive franchises granted by the municipalities we serve which are subject to renewal from time to time the railroad commission of texas rrc has exclusive appellate jurisdiction over all rate and regulatory orders and ordinances of the municipalities and exclusive original jurisdiction over rates and services to customers not located within the limits of a municipality this division does not have wna however our operations benefit from a declining block rate structure that partially mitigates the impact of warmerthannormal weather on revenue this rate structure is not as beneficial during periods where weather is significantly warmer than normal the majority of this division’s residential and business customers use natural gas for heating and their needs are directly affected by the mildness or severity of the heating season 

  at closing of the acquisition txu gas and some of its affiliates entered into transitional services agreements with us to provide call center meter reading customer billing collections information reporting software accounting treasury administrative and other services to the midtex division some of these services were outsourced by txu gas to capgemini energy lp however on november 4 2004 we entered into an agreement with capgemini energy lp whereby we took over the operations of the waco texas call center on april 1 2005 and purchased from capgemini energy lp all of the related call center assets on october 1 2005 the remaining transitional services agreements expired on september 30 2005 and were not renewed as we have insourced all of these functions effective october 1 2005 

  atmos energy mississippi division our atmos energy mississippi division formerly known as mississippi valley gas company division which was acquired in december 2002 operates in mississippi and is regulated by the mississippi public service commission mpsc with respect to rates services and operations we operate under nonexclusive franchises granted by the municipalities we serve since the acquisition we have been operating under a rate structure that allows us over a fiveyear period to recover a portion of our integration costs associated with the acquisition and operations and maintenance costs in excess of an agreedupon benchmark in addition we were required to file for rate adjustments based on our expenses every six months effective october 1 2005 our rate design was modified to substitute the original agreedupon benchmark with a sharing mechanism to allow the sharing of cost savings above an allowed return on equity level further we will move from a semiannual filing process to an annual filing process we also have wna in mississippi this division’s gas supply is delivered by gulf south pipeline company tennessee gas pipeline company southern natural gas company texas eastern transmission texas gas transmission llc trunkline gas co llc and enbridge marketing lp 

8   atmos energy west texas division our west texas division operates in texas in three primary service areas the amarillo service area the lubbock service area and the west texas service area similar to our midtex division the governing body of each municipality we serve has original jurisdiction over all utility rates operations and services within its city limits except with respect to sales of natural gas for vehicle fuel and agricultural use we operate pursuant to nonexclusive franchises granted by the municipalities we serve which are subject to renewal from time to time the rrc has exclusive appellate jurisdiction over all rate and regulatory orders and ordinances of the municipalities and exclusive original jurisdiction over rates and services to customers not located within the limits of a municipality during 2004 the west texas division received approval from the city of lubbock texas and the 66 cities in our west texas system for wna in these service areas which is effective october through may of each year beginning with the 20042005 winter heating season we also have wna in our amarillo service area our west texas division receives transportation service from oneok pipeline in addition the west texas division purchases a significant portion of its natural gas supply from pioneer natural resources which is connected directly to our amarillo texas distribution system 

natural gas marketing segment overview 

  our natural gas marketing and other nonutility segments which are organized under atmos energy holdings inc aeh have operations in 22 states through september 30 2003 atmos energy marketing llc together with its whollyowned subsidiaries woodward marketing llc and trans louisiana industrial gas company inc comprised our natural gas marketing segment effective october 1 2003 our natural gas marketing segment was reorganized the operations of atmos energy marketing llc and trans louisiana industrial gas company inc were merged into woodward marketing llc which was renamed atmos energy marketing llc aem 

  we acquired a 45 percent interest in woodward marketing llc in july 1997 as a result of the merger of atmos and united cities gas company which had acquired that interest in may 1995 in april 2001 we acquired the remaining 55 percent interest that we did not own for 1423193 restricted shares of our common stock 

  aem provides a variety of natural gas management services to municipalities natural gas utility systems and industrial natural gas consumers primarily in the southeastern and midwestern states and to our kentucky louisiana and midstates divisions these services primarily consist of furnishing natural gas supplies at fixed and marketbased prices contract negotiation and administration load forecasting gas storage acquisition and management services transportation services peaking sales and balancing services capacity utilization strategies and gas price management through the use of derivative products we use proprietary and customerowned transportation and storage assets to provide the various services our customers request as a result our revenues arise from the types of commercial transactions we have structured with our customers and include the value we extract by optimizing the storage and transportation capacity we own or control as well as revenues for services we deliver 

  we participate in transactions in which we combine the natural gas commodity and transportation costs to minimize our costs incurred to serve our customers additionally we participate in natural gas storage transactions in which we seek to capture the pricing differences that occur over time we purchase or sell physical natural gas and then sell or purchase financial contracts at a price sufficient to cover our carrying costs and provide a gross profit margin through the use of transportation and storage services and derivatives we are able to capture gross profit margin through the arbitrage of pricing differences in various locations and by recognizing pricing differences that occur over time 

  aem’s management of natural gas requirements involves the sale of natural gas and the management of storage and transportation supplies under contracts with customers generally having one to two year terms aem also sells natural gas to some of its industrial customers on a delivered burner tip basis under contract terms from 30 days to two years at september 30 2005 aem had a total of 558 industrial 69 municipal and 210 other customers

  our pipeline and storage segment consists of the regulated pipeline and storage operations of the atmos pipeline — texas division and the nonregulated pipeline and storage operations of atmos pipeline and storage llc the natural gas transmission and storage operations that we acquired in the txu gas acquisition which are operated in the atmos pipeline — texas division represent one of the largest intrastate pipeline operations in texas the atmos pipeline — texas division transports natural gas to our midtex division and for third parties these operations include interconnected natural gas transmission lines five underground storage reservoirs including a salt dome facility and 24 compressor stations and related properties all within texas these operations may create additional gas marketing and other opportunities for our nonregulated subsidiaries 

  the gas distribution and transmission lines we acquired have been constructed over lands of others pursuant to easements or along public highways streets and rightsofway as permitted by law in addition to being heavily concentrated in the established natural gasproducing areas of central northern and eastern texas the intrastate pipeline system we acquired also extends into or near the major producing areas of the texas gulf coast and the delaware and val verde basins of west texas nine basins located in texas are estimated to contain a substantial portion of the nation’s remaining onshore natural gas reserves this pipeline system provides access to all of these basins we believe that we are well situated to receive large volumes into this pipeline system at the major hubs such as katy waha and carthage as well as from storage facilities where we maintain high delivery capabilities 

  aps owns or has an interest in underground storage fields in kentucky and louisiana we also use these storage facilities to reduce the need to contract for additional pipeline capacity to meet customer demand during peak periods 

other nonutility segment overview 

  our other nonutility segment consists primarily of the operations of atmos energy services llc aes and atmos power systems inc which are whollyowned by our subsidiary atmos energy holdings inc through aes we provide natural gas management services to our utility operations other than the midtex division these services which began on april 1 2004 include aggregating and purchasing gas supply arranging transportation and storage logistics and ultimately delivering the gas to our utility service areas at competitive prices in exchange for revenues that are equal to the costs incurred to provide those services through atmos power systems inc we construct gasfired electric peaking powergenerating plants and associated facilities and may enter into agreements to either lease or sell these plants 

  through january 20 2004 united cities propane gas inc a whollyowned subsidiary of atmos energy holdings inc owned an approximate 19 percent membership interest in us propane lp usp a joint venture formed in february 2000 with other utility companies to own a limited partnership interest in heritage propane partners lp heritage a publiclytraded marketer of propane through a nationwide retail distribution network during fiscal 2004 we sold our interest in usp and heritage as a result of these transactions we no longer have an interest in the propane business

 14 ratemaking activity 

   the method of determining regulated rates varies among the states in which our natural gas utility divisions operate the regulators have the responsibility of ensuring that utilities under their jurisdictions operate in the best interests of customers while providing utility companies the opportunity to earn a reasonable return on investment generally each regulatory authority reviews our rate request and establishes a rate structure intended to generate revenue sufficient to cover our costs of doing business and provide a reasonable return on invested capital 

  rates established by regulatory authorities are adjusted for increases and decreases in our purchased gas cost through purchased gas adjustment mechanisms purchased gas adjustment mechanisms provide gas utility companies a method of recovering purchased gas costs on an ongoing basis without filing a rate case to address all of the utility’s nongas costs these mechanisms are commonly utilized when regulatory authorities recognize a particular type of expense such as purchased gas costs that i is subject to significant price fluctuations compared to the utility’s other costs ii represents a large component of the utility’s cost of service and iii is generally outside the control of the gas utility there is no gross profit generated through purchased gas adjustments but they do provide a dollarfordollar offset to increases or decreases in utility gas costs although substantially all of our utility sales to our customers fluctuate with the cost of gas that we purchase utility gross profit which is defined as operating revenues less purchased gas cost is generally not affected by fluctuations in the cost of gas due to the purchased gas adjustment mechanism additionally certain jurisdictions have introduced performancebased ratemaking adjustments to provide incentives to natural gas utilities to minimize purchased gas costs through improved storage management and use of financial hedges to lock in gas costs under the performancebased ratemaking adjustment purchased gas costs savings are shared between the utility and its customers 

  the following table summarizes certain information regarding our ratemaking jurisdictions 

  see footnotes on the following page 

15   

 

   our current rate strategy focuses on addressing rate design and regulatory lag issues we are seeking rate designs that decouple the recovery of our approved margins from customer usage patterns due to weather related variability declining use per customer and energy conservation additionally we are seeking to stratify rates for low income households and to recover the gas cost portion of our bad debt expense 

  we are attempting to address regulatory lag issues by directing discretionary capital spending to jurisdictions that permit us to recover our investment in a more timely manner working with our regulators to eliminate regulatory lag in our jurisdictions and filing rate cases on a more frequent basis to minimize the regulatory lag to keep our actual returns more closely aligned with our allowed returns 

  approximately 97 percent of our utility revenues in the fiscal years ended september 30 2005 2004 and 2003 were derived from sales at rates set by or subject to approval by local or state authorities net annual 

16 revenue increases resulting from ratemaking activity totaling 63 million 162 million and 186 million became effective in fiscal 2005 2004 and 2003 as summarized below

  in september 2005 atmos pipeline — texas made a grip filing to include in rate base approximately 106 million of pipeline capital expenditures incurred during calendar year 2004 it is anticipated that 19 million in additional annual revenue will be authorized through this filing a decision on this filing must be made by the rrc before january 4 2006 

  atmos energy coloradokansas division in july 2004 the colorado public utility commission ordered us to issue a onetime credit to our colorado customers of 19 million the agreement was a result of an inquiry by the colorado office of consumer counsel related to our earnings in colorado the staff of the colorado public utility commission was also a party to the agreement 

  in may 2003 the coloradokansas division filed a rate case with the kansas corporation commission for approximately 74 million in additional annual revenues in january 2004 the kansas corporation commission approved an agreement that allowed a 25 million increase in our rates effective march 1 2004 additionally the agreement allowed us to increase our monthly customer charges from 5 to 8 provided that we would not file another full rate application prior to september 1 2005 wna became effective in kansas in october 2003 in accordance with the kansas corporation commission’s ruling in may 2003 

  atmos energy louisiana division during the second quarter of 2005 the louisiana division implemented a rate increase of 33 million in its lgs service area this increase resulted from our rate stabilization clause filing in 2004 and is subject to refund pending the final resolution of that filing as the rate increase is subject to refund we have not recognized the effects of this increase in our results of operations during fiscal 2005

  in january and february 2002 our louisiana division submitted its 2001 rate stabilization filings to the lpsc for the two gas systems we operate in louisiana the lpsc audited the filings and found our earnings to be deficient and that rate adjustments were appropriate approved tariff revisions which became effective november 1 2002 resulted in 153 million in additional revenues per year for our lgs system and 05 million for our trans la system during the first 24month period beginning in november 2002 subsequent to the first 24month period adjusted rates provided total annual revenue increases of 119 million for our lgs system and 04 million for our trans la system as a result of the actions taken by the lpsc we have decreased the overall weather impact on our revenues in louisiana primarily through increases in the fixed portion of customers’ monthly bills 

  in 2001 in connection with its review of our acquisition of louisiana gas service the lpsc approved a rate structure that requires us to share with the customers of louisiana gas service cost savings that result from the acquisition the shared cost savings are the difference between operation and maintenance expense in any future year and the 1998 normalized expense for louisiana gas service indexed for inflation annual 

18 changes in labor costs and customer growth since january 1 2002 customers have been assured they will receive annual savings which will be indexed for inflation annual changes in labor costs and customer growth the sharing mechanism will remain in place for 20 years subject to established modification procedures

  atmos energy mississippi division through the first quarter of fiscal 2005 the mpsc required that we file for rate adjustments every six months rate filings were made in may and november of each year and the rate adjustments typically became effective in the following july and january 

  during the second quarter of fiscal 2005 we agreed with the mpsc to suspend our may 2005 semiannual filing to allow sufficient time for us and the mpsc to undertake a comprehensive review in an effort to improve our rate design and the ratemaking process effective october 1 2005 our rate design was modified to substitute the original agreedupon benchmark with a sharing mechanism to allow the sharing of cost savings above an allowed return on equity level further we will move from a semiannual filing process to an annual filing process additionally our wna period will begin on november 1 instead of november 15 and will end on april 30 instead of may 15 also we now have a fixed monthly customer base charge which makes a portion of our earnings less susceptible to usage we will make our first annual filing under this new structure in september 2006 

  in october 2003 the mpsc issued a final order that denied our may 2003 request for a rate increase of 58 million in january 2004 the mpsc authorized additional annual revenue of 59 million on our november 2003 filing which became effective on december 1 2003 in september 2004 the mpsc authorized additional annualized revenue of 47 million on our may 2004 filing which became effective on june 1 2004 however the mpsc originally disallowed certain deferred costs totaling 28 million in connection with the modification of our rate design described above the mpsc reversed its decision regarding these costs and we included these costs into our rates in october 2005

  our midtex and atmos pipeline — texas operations are wholly intrastate in character and are subject to regulation by municipalities in texas and the railroad commission of texas these acquired operations do not include any certificated interstate transmission facilities subject to the jurisdiction of the federal energy regulatory commission ferc under the natural gas act any sales for resale under the rate jurisdiction of the ferc or any transportation service that is subject to ferc jurisdiction under the natural gas act since 1988 the ferc has allowed pursuant to section 311 of the natural gas policy act gas transportation services through the intrastate transmission facilities we acquired “on behalf of” interstate pipelines or local distribution companies served by interstate pipelines without subjecting the acquired operations to the jurisdiction of the ferc we did not acquire any manufactured gas plant sites in the txu gas acquisition our acquisition agreement with txu gas addresses other environmental matters which we expect to have no material adverse effect on us or our operations 

competition 

  although our utility operations are not currently in significant direct competition with any other distributors of natural gas to residential and commercial customers within our service areas we do compete with other natural gas suppliers and suppliers of alternative fuels for sales to industrial and agricultural customers we compete in all aspects of our business with alternative energy sources including in particular electricity electric utilities offer electricity as a rival energy source and compete for the space heating water heating and cooking markets promotional incentives improved equipment efficiencies and promotional rates all contribute to the acceptability of electrical equipment the principal means to compete against alternative fuels is lower prices and natural gas historically has maintained its price advantage in the residential commercial and industrial markets however higher gas prices coupled with the electric utilities’ marketing efforts have increased competition for residential and commercial customers in addition our natural gas marketing segment competes with other natural gas brokers in obtaining natural gas supplies for our customers

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend introduction 

  this section provides management’s discussion of the financial condition changes in financial condition and results of operations of atmos energy corporation with specific information on results of operations and liquidity and capital resources it includes management’s interpretation of our financial results the factors affecting these results the major factors expected to affect future operating results and future investment and financing plans this discussion should be read in conjunction with the company’s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 

   the statements contained in this annual report on form 10k may contain “forwardlooking statements” within the meaning of section 27a of the securities act of 1933 and section 21e of the securities exchange act of 1934 all statements other than statements of historical fact included in this report are forwardlooking statements made in good faith by the company and are intended to qualify for the safe harbor from liability established by the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 when used in this report or any other of the company’s documents or oral presentations the words “anticipate” “believe” “expect” “estimate” “forecast” “goal” “intend” “objective” “plan” “projection” “seek” “strategy” or similar words are intended to identify forwardlooking statements such forwardlooking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the statements relating to the company’s strategy operations markets services rates recovery of costs availability of gas supply and other factors these risks and uncertainties include the following adverse weather conditions such as warmer than normal weather in the company’s utility service territories or colder than normal weather that could adversely affect our natural gas marketing activities regulatory trends and decisions including deregulation initiatives and the impact of rate proceedings before various state regulatory commissions market risks beyond our control affecting our risk management activities including market liquidity commodity price volatility and counterparty creditworthiness national regional and local economic conditions the company’s ability to continue to access the capital markets the effects of inflation and changes in the availability and prices of natural gas including the volatility of natural gas prices increased competition from energy suppliers and alternative forms of energy risks relating to the acquisition of the txu gas operations including without limitation the company’s increased indebtedness resulting from the acquisition of the txu gas operations the impact of recent natural disasters on our operations especially hurricane katrina and other uncertainties discussed herein all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond the control of the company accordingly while the company believes these forwardlooking statements to be reasonable there can be no assurance that they will approximate actual experience or that the expectations derived from them will be realized further the company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any of its forwardlooking statements whether as a result of new information future events or otherwise 

factors that may affect our future performance 

  our performance in the future will primarily depend on the results of our utility and nonutility operations several factors exist that could influence our future financial performance some of which are described below they should be considered in connection with evaluating forwardlooking statements contained in this report or otherwise made by or on behalf of us since these factors could cause actual results and conditions to differ materially from those set out in these forwardlooking statements 

   weather is one of the most significant factors influencing our performance our natural gas utility sales volumes and related revenues are correlated with heating requirements that result from cold winter weather our agricultural sales volumes are associated with the rainfall levels during the growing season in our 

30 west texas and kansas irrigation markets although weather normalized rates in effect in several of our jurisdictions should mitigate the adverse effects of warmer than normal weather on our utility operating results approximately fifteen to twenty percent of our utility gross profit margin is sensitive to weather particularly our louisiana and midtex divisions this means we will not be able to increase customers’ bills to offset lower gas usage when the weather is warmer than normal 

  our midtex division operations benefit from a rate structure that combines a monthly customer charge with a declining block rate schedule to partially mitigate the impact of warmer than normal weather on revenue the combination of the monthly customer charge and the customer billing under the first block of the declining block rate schedule provides for the recovery of most of our fixed costs for such operations under most weather conditions however this rate structure is not as beneficial during periods where weather is significantly warmer than normal 

  finally sustained cold weather could adversely affect our natural gas marketing operations as we may be required to purchase gas at spot rates in a rising market to obtain sufficient volumes to fulfill some customer contracts 

   our natural gas utility business is subject to various regulated returns on its rate base in each of the 12 states in which we operate we monitor the allowed rates of return our effectiveness in earning such rates and initiate rate proceedings or operating changes as needed in addition in the normal course of the regulatory environment assets are placed in service and historical test periods are established before rate cases can be filed once rate cases are filed regulatory bodies have the authority to suspend implementation of the new rates while studying the cases because of this process we must temporarily suffer the negative financial effects of having placed assets in service without the benefit of rate relief which is commonly referred to as “regulatory lag” in addition once our rates have been approved they are still subject to challenge for their reasonableness by appropriate regulatory authorities also our debt and equity financings are also subject to approval by regulatory bodies in certain states which could limit our ability to take advantage of favorable shortterm market conditions 

  our business could also be affected by deregulation initiatives including the development of unbundling initiatives in the natural gas industry unbundling is the separation of the provision and pricing of local distribution gas services into discrete components it typically focuses on the separation of the distribution and gas supply components and the resulting opening of the regulated components of sales services to alternative unregulated suppliers of those services because of our enhanced technology and distribution system infrastructures we believe that we are now positively positioned should unbundling evolve consequently we expect there would be no significant adverse effect on our business should unbundling or further deregulation of the natural gas distribution service business occur 

  finally contractual limitations could adversely affect our ability to withdraw gas from storage which could cause us to purchase gas at spot prices in a rising market to obtain sufficient volumes to fulfill customer contracts we seek to minimize this risk by increasing our storage capacity and enhancing the flexibility of our natural gas marketing contracts 

   our risk management operations in our natural gas marketing segment are subject to market risks beyond our control including market liquidity commodity price volatility and counterparty creditworthiness market liquidity is affected by the number of trading partners in the market 

  although we maintain a risk management policy we may not be able to completely offset the price risk associated with volatile gas prices or the risk in our gas trading activities which could lead to financial losses physical trading also introduces price risk on any net open positions at the end of each trading day as well as a risk of loss resulting from intraday fluctuations of gas prices and the potential for daily price movements 

31 between the time natural gas is purchased or sold for future delivery and the time the related purchase or sale is hedged although we manage our business to maintain no open positions at times limited net open positions related to our physical storage may occur on a shortterm basis the determination of our net open position as of any day requires us to make assumptions as to future circumstances including the use of gas by our customers in relation to our anticipated storage and market positions because the price risk associated with any net open position at the end of each day may increase if the assumptions are not realized we review these assumptions as part of our daily monitoring activities net open positions may result in an adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations if market prices move in an unfavorable manner 

  our utility segment uses a combination of storage and financial hedges to partially insulate us against volatility in gas prices and to help moderate the effects of higher customer accounts receivable caused by higher gas prices our natural gas marketing segment manages margins and limits risk exposure on the sale of natural gas inventory or the offsetting fixedprice purchase or sale commitments for physical quantities of natural gas through the use of a variety of financial derivatives 

  we could realize financial losses on these activities as a result of volatility in the market value of the underlying commodities or if a counterparty fails to perform under a contract 

  further the use of financial instruments to conduct our hedging and market risk activities subjects us to counterparty risk adverse changes in the creditworthiness of our counterparties could limit the level of trading activities with these parties and increase the risk that these parties may not perform under a contract we believe this risk is mitigated due to the large number of counterparties used in our risk management activities 

  our net periodic pension and other postretirement costs are subject to market risk as the fluctuation in the fair value of the assets used to fund our various benefit plans could lead to significant fluctuations in these costs 

  finally we are subject to interest rate risk on our commercial paper borrowings and floating rate debt we could experience higher interest expense if interest rates increase or increased volatility if shortterm interest rates become volatile 

   our operations are affected by the conditions and overall strength of the national regional and local economies including interest rates changes in the capital markets and increases in the costs of our primary commodity natural gas these factors impact the amount of residential industrial and commercial growth in our service territories additionally these factors could adversely impact our customer collections 

  further aem’s operations are concentrated in the natural gas industry and its customers and suppliers may be subject to economic risks affecting that industry 

   we rely upon access to both shortterm and longterm capital markets as a source of liquidity to satisfy our liquidity requirements although we believe we will maintain sufficient access to these financial markets adverse changes in the economy the overall health of the industries in which we operate and changes to our credit ratings could limit access to these markets and restrict the execution of our business plan 

  our longterm debt is currently rated as “investment grade” by standard  poor’s corporation sp moody’s investors service moody’s and fitch ratings inc fitch the three credit rating agencies that rate our longterm debt securities there can be no assurance that these rating agencies will maintain investment grade ratings for our longterm debt if we were to lose our investmentgrade rating the commercial paper markets and the commodity derivatives markets could become unavailable to us this would increase our borrowing costs for working capital and reduce the borrowing capacity of our gas marketing affiliate in addition if our commercial paper ratings were lowered it would increase the cost of commercial paper financing and could reduce or eliminate our ability to access the commercial paper markets if we are 

32 unable to issue commercial paper we intend to borrow under our bank credit facilities to meet our working capital needs this would increase the cost of our working capital financing 

   inflation has caused increases in certain operating expenses and has required assets to be replaced at higher costs we have a process in place to continually review the adequacy of our utility gas rates in relation to the increasing cost of providing service and the inherent regulatory lag in adjusting those gas rates historically we have been able to budget and control operating expenses and investments within the amounts authorized to be collected in rates and intend to continue to do so the ability to control expenses is an important factor that will influence future results 

  rapid increases in the price of purchased gas which has occurred recently and in some prior years causes us to experience a significant increase in shortterm debt because we must pay suppliers for gas when it is purchased which can be significantly in advance of when these costs may be recovered through the collection of monthly customer bills for gas delivered increases in purchased gas costs also slow our utility collection efforts as customers are more likely to delay the payment of their gas bills leading to higher than normal accounts receivable this situation could result in higher shortterm debt levels and increased bad debt expense due to the significant increase in natural gas prices resulting primarily from the impact of recent natural disasters we are anticipating increases in our shortterm debt accounts receivable and bad debt expense during fiscal 2006 

  finally higher costs of natural gas in recent years have already caused many of our utility customers to conserve in the use of our gas services and could lead to even more customers utilizing such conservation methods 

   we are facing increased competition from other energy suppliers as well as electric companies and from energy marketing and trading companies in the case of industrial customers such as manufacturing plants and agricultural customers adverse economic conditions including higher gas costs could cause these customers to use alternative sources of energy such as electricity or bypass our systems in favor of special competitive contracts with lower perunit costs our pipeline and storage operations currently face limited competition from other existing intrastate pipelines and gas marketers seeking to provide or arrange transportation storage and other services for customers however competition may increase if new intrastate pipelines are constructed near our existing facilities 

   the diligence conducted in connection with the txu gas acquisition and the indemnification provided in the acquisition agreement may not be sufficient to protect us from or compensate us for all losses resulting from the acquisition or txu gas’s prior operations for example under the terms of the acquisition agreement the first 15 million of many indemnifiable losses are to be borne by us and the agreement provides for sharing of losses with respect to unknown environmental matters that may affect the assets we acquired after we have borne 10 million in costs relating to such matters in addition under the terms of the acquisition agreement the maximum aggregate amount of such losses for which txu gas will indemnify us is approximately 1925 million a material loss associated with the txu gas acquisition for which there is not adequate indemnification could negatively affect our results of operations our financial condition and our reputation in the industry thereby reducing the anticipated benefits of the acquisition 

   on august 29 2005 hurricane katrina struck the gulf coast inflicting significant damage in our eastern louisiana operations the hardest hit areas in our service area were in jefferson st tammany 

33 st bernard and plaquemines parishes in total approximately 230000 of our natural gas customers were affected in these areas a significant number of these customers will not require gas service for some time because of sustained damages we cannot predict with certainty how many of these customers will return to these service areas and over what time period additionally we cannot accurately determine what regulatory actions if any may be taken by the regulators with respect to these areas finally although we believe our insurance will cover all losses in excess of our deductibles it is possible that certain of these losses may not be fully recoverable 

overview 

  in fiscal 2005 we earned 1358 million in net income or 172 per diluted share compared with net income of 862 million or 158 per diluted share in fiscal 2004 the 58 percent yearoveryear increase in net income was primarily attributable to the incremental results we achieved from our midtex and atmos pipeline — texas divisions that we acquired on october 1 2004 strong earnings in our natural gas marketing segment primarily attributable to favorable results from the management of our storage portfolio also contributed to the increase in net income these positive factors helped overcome the adverse effects on our utility segment of weather adjusted for wna that was 11 percent warmer than normal which reduced our net income by 228 million or 029 per diluted share and the impact of hurricane katrina which reduced our net income by 38 million or 005 per diluted share 

  fiscal 2005 was highlighted by our acquisition of the natural gas distribution and pipeline operations of txu gas company the txu gas operations we acquired are regulated businesses engaged in the purchase transmission distribution and sale of natural gas in the northcentral eastern and western parts of texas through these newly acquired operations we provide gas distribution services to approximately 15 million residential and business customers in texas including the dallas fort worth metropolitan area we also now own and operate a system consisting of 6162 miles of gas transmission and gathering lines and five underground storage reservoirs in texas 

  the purchase price of the txu gas acquisition was approximately 19 billion before transaction costs and expenses which we paid in cash we funded the purchase price for the txu gas acquisition with approximately 2357 million in net proceeds from our offering of approximately 99 million shares of common stock which we completed on july 19 2004 and approximately 17 billion in net proceeds from our issuance on october 1 2004 of commercial paper backstopped by a senior unsecured revolving credit agreement which we entered into on september 24 2004 for bridge financing for the txu gas acquisition in october 2004 we repaid the outstanding commercial paper used to fund the acquisition through the issuance of senior unsecured notes on october 22 2004 which generated net proceeds of approximately 14 billion and the sale of 161 million shares of common stock on october 27 2004 which generated net proceeds of approximately 3816 million 

  as a result of the acquisition effective october 1 2004 we created the pipeline and storage segment which includes the regulated pipeline and storage operations of the atmos pipeline–texas division and the nonregulated pipeline and storage operations of atmos pipeline and storage llc which was previously included in our other nonutility segment 

34   the txu gas acquisition essentially doubled the size of the company as measured by assets revenues and customers the following table presents selected financial information for the midtex division and atmos pipeline — texas division operations for the year ended september 30 2005 

   the impact of the txu gas acquisition combined with continued strong performance in our natural gas marketing segment contributed to the following financial results during the year ended september 30 2005

   our financial performance is discussed in greater detail below in results of operations 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

  our consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and the related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities we based our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including those related to risk management and trading activities allowance for doubtful accounts legal and environmental accruals insurance accruals pension and postretirement obligations deferred income taxes and the valuation of goodwill indefinitelived intangible assets and other longlived assets our critical accounting policies are reviewed by the audit committee quarterly actual results may differ from estimates 

  regulation  — our utility operations are subject to regulation with respect to rates service maintenance of accounting records and various other matters by the respective regulatory authorities in the states in which we operate our regulated utility operations are accounted for in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas 71 accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation this statement requires costbased rateregulated entities that meet certain criteria to reflect the financial effects of the ratemaking and accounting practices and policies of the various regulatory commissions in their financial statements we record regulatory assets for costs that have been deferred for which future recovery through customer rates is considered probable regulatory liabilities are recorded when it is probable that revenues will be reduced for amounts that will be credited to customers through the ratemaking process as a result certain costs that would normally be expensed under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states are permitted to be capitalized because they can be recovered through rates further regulation may impact the period in which revenues or expenses are recognized the amounts to be recovered or recognized are based upon historical experience and our understanding of the regulations the impact of regulation on our utility operations may be affected by decisions of the regulatory authorities or the issuance of new regulations 

  revenue recognition  — sales of natural gas to our utility customers are billed on a monthly cycle basis however the billing cycle periods for certain classes of customers do not necessarily coincide with accounting periods used for financial reporting purposes we follow the revenue accrual method of accounting for utility segment revenues whereby revenues applicable to gas delivered to customers but not yet billed under the cycle billing method are estimated and accrued and the related costs are charged to expense 

  rates established by regulatory authorities are adjusted for increases and decreases in our purchased gas cost through purchased gas adjustment mechanisms purchased gas adjustment mechanisms provide gas utility companies a method of recovering purchased gas costs on an ongoing basis without filing a rate case to address all of the utility’s nongas costs these mechanisms are commonly utilized when regulatory authorities recognize a particular type of expense such as purchased gas costs that i is subject to significant price fluctuations compared to the utility’s other costs ii represents a large component of the utility’s cost of service and iii is generally outside the control of the gas utility there is no gross profit generated through purchased gas adjustments but they do provide a dollarfordollar offset to increases or decreases in utility gas costs although substantially all of our utility sales to our customers fluctuate with the cost of gas that we purchase utility gross profit is generally not affected by fluctuations in the cost of gas due to the purchased gas adjustment mechanism the effects of these purchased gas adjustment mechanisms are recorded as deferred gas costs on our balance sheet 

36   energy trading contracts resulting in the delivery of a commodity where we are the principal in the transaction are recorded as natural gas marketing sales or purchases at the time of physical delivery realized gains and losses from the settlement of financial instruments that do not result in physical delivery related to our natural gas marketing energy trading contracts and unrealized gains and losses from changes in the market value of open contracts are included as a component of natural gas marketing revenues 

  allowance for doubtful accounts  — for the majority of our receivables we establish an allowance for doubtful accounts based on our collections experience on certain other receivables where we are aware of a specific customer’s inability or reluctance to pay we record an allowance for doubtful accounts against amounts due to reduce the net receivable balance to the amount we reasonably expect to collect however if circumstances change our estimate of the recoverability of accounts receivable could be different circumstances which could affect our estimates include but are not limited to customer credit issues the level of natural gas prices and general economic conditions 

  derivatives and hedging activities  — in our utility segment we use a combination of storage and financial derivatives to partially insulate us and our natural gas utility customers against gas price volatility during the winter heating season the financial derivatives we use in our utility segment are accounted for under the marktomarket method pursuant to sfas 133 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities changes in the valuation of these derivatives primarily result from changes in the valuation of the portfolio of contracts maturity and settlement of contracts and newly originated transactions however because the costs of financial derivatives used in our utility segment will ultimately be recovered through our rates current period changes in the assets and liabilities from these risk management activities are recorded as a component of deferred gas costs in accordance with sfas 71 accordingly there is no earnings impact to our utility segment as a result of the use of financial derivatives the changes in the assets and liabilities from risk management activities are recognized in purchased gas cost in the income statement when the related costs are recovered through our rates 

  our natural gas marketing risk management activities are conducted through aem aem is exposed to risks associated with changes in the market price of natural gas which we manage through a combination of storage and financial derivatives including futures overthecounter and exchangetraded options and swap contracts with counterparties option contracts provide the right but not the requirement to buy or sell the commodity at a fixed price swap contracts require receipt of payment for the commodity based on the difference between a fixed price and the market price on the settlement date the use of these contracts is subject to our risk management policies which are monitored for compliance daily 

  we participate in transactions in which we combine the natural gas commodity and transportation costs to minimize our costs incurred to serve our customers additionally we engage in natural gas storage transactions in which we seek to find and profit from pricing differences that occur over time we purchase or sell physical natural gas and then sell or purchase financial contracts at a price sufficient to cover our carrying costs and provide a gross profit margin through the use of transportation and storage services and derivatives we are able to capture gross profit margin through the arbitrage of pricing differences in various locations and by recognizing pricing differences that occur over time 

  under sfas 133 natural gas inventory is the hedged item in a fairvalue hedge and is marked to market monthly using the inside ferc iferc price at the end of each month changes in fair value are recognized as unrealized gains and losses in the period of change costs to store the gas are recognized in the period the costs are incurred we recognize revenue and the carrying value of the inventory as an associated purchased gas cost in our consolidated statement of income when we sell the gas and deliver it out of the storage facility 

  derivatives associated with our natural gas inventory are marked to market each month based upon the nymex price with changes in fair value recognized as unrealized gains and losses in the period of change the difference in the indices used to mark to market our physical inventory iferc and the related fairvalue hedge nymex is reported as a component of revenue and can result in volatility in our reported net income over time gains and losses on the sale of storage gas inventory will be offset by gains and losses on the fairvalue hedges resulting in the realization of the economic gross profit margin we anticipated at the 

37 time we structured the original transaction in addition we continually manage our positions to optimize value as market conditions and other circumstances change 

  similar to our inventory position we attempt to mitigate substantially all of the commodity price risk associated with our fixedprice contracts with minimum volume requirements through the use of various offsetting derivatives prior to april 1 2004 these derivatives were not designated as hedges under sfas 133 because they naturally locked in the economic gross profit margin at the time we entered into the contract the fixedprice forward and offsetting derivative contracts were marked to market each month with changes in fair value recognized as unrealized gains and losses recorded in revenue in our consolidated statement of income the unrealized gains and losses were realized as a component of revenue in the period in which we fulfilled the requirements of the fixedprice contract and the derivatives settled to the extent that the unrealized gains and losses of the fixedprice forward contracts and the offsetting derivatives did not offset exactly our earnings experienced some volatility at delivery the gains and losses on the fixedprice contracts were offset by gains and losses on the derivatives resulting in the realization of the economic gross profit margin we anticipated at the time we structured the original transaction in addition we continually managed our positions to optimize value as market conditions and other circumstances changed 

  effective april 1 2004 we elected to treat our fixedprice forward contracts as normal purchases and sales as a result we ceased marking the fixedprice forward contracts to market we designated the offsetting derivative contracts as cash flow hedges of anticipated transactions as a result of this change unrealized gains and losses on these open derivative contracts are now recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income and are recognized in earnings as a component of revenue when the hedged volumes are sold hedge ineffectiveness to the extent incurred is reported as a component of revenue 

  during fiscal 2004 we entered into four treasury lock agreements to fix the treasury yield component of the interest cost of financing associated with the anticipated issuance of 875 million of longterm debt we designated these treasury lock agreements as cash flow hedges of an anticipated transaction accordingly unrealized gains and losses associated with the treasury lock agreements were recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income these treasury lock agreements were settled in october 2004 with a net 438 million payment to the counterparties this realized loss will be recognized as a component of interest expense over the life of the related financing arrangements 

  the fair value of our financial derivatives is determined through a combination of prices actively quoted on national exchanges prices provided by other external sources and prices based on models and other valuation methods changes in the valuation of our financial derivatives primarily result from changes in market prices the valuation of the portfolio of our contracts maturity and settlement of these contracts and newly originated transactions each of which directly affect the estimated fair value of our derivatives we believe the market prices and models used to value these derivatives represent the best information available with respect to closing exchange and overthecounter quotations time value and volatility factors underlying the contracts values are adjusted to reflect the potential impact of an orderly liquidation of our positions over a reasonable period of time under present market conditions 

  impairment assessments  — we perform impairment assessments of our goodwill intangible assets subject to amortization and longlived assets we currently have no indefinitelived intangible assets we annually evaluate our goodwill balances for impairment during our second fiscal quarter or as impairment indicators arise we use a present value technique based on discounted cash flows to estimate the fair value of our reporting units we have determined our reporting units to be each of our utility divisions and whollyowned subsidiaries goodwill is allocated to the reporting units responsible for the acquisition that gave rise to the goodwill 

  the discounted cash flow calculations used to assess goodwill impairment are dependent on several subjective factors including the timing of future cash flows future growth rates and the discount rate an impairment charge is recognized if the carrying value of a reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds its fair value 

  we periodically evaluate whether events or circumstances have occurred that indicate that our intangible assets subject to amortization and other longlived assets may not be recoverable or that the remaining useful 

38 life may warrant revision when such events or circumstances are present we assess the recoverability of these assets by determining whether the carrying value will be recovered through expected future cash flows these cash flow projections consider various factors such as the timing of the future cash flows and the discount rate and are based upon the best information available at the time the estimate is made changes in these factors could materially affect the cash flow projections and result in the recognition of an impairment charge an impairment charge is recognized as the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value if the sum of the undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying value of the related asset 

  pension and other postretirement plans  — pension and other postretirement plan costs and liabilities are determined on an actuarial basis and are affected by numerous assumptions and estimates including the market value of plan assets estimates of the expected return on plan assets assumed discount rates and current demographic and actuarial mortality data we review the estimates and assumptions underlying our pension and other postretirement plan costs and liabilities annually based upon a june 30 measurement date the assumed discount rate and the expected return are the assumptions that generally have the most significant impact on our pension costs and liabilities the assumed discount rate the assumed health care cost trend rate and assumed rates of retirement generally have the most significant impact on our postretirement plan costs and liabilities 

  the discount rate is utilized principally in calculating the actuarial present value of our pension and postretirement obligation and net pension and postretirement cost when establishing our discount rate we consider absolute high quality corporate bond rates based on moody’s aa bond index changes in those rates from the prior year and the implied discount rate that is derived from matching our projected benefit disbursements with a high quality corporate bond spot rate curve 

  the expected longterm rate of return on assets is utilized in calculating the expected return on plan assets component of our annual pension and postretirement plan cost we estimate the expected return on plan assets by evaluating expected bond returns equity risk premiums asset allocations the effects of active plan management the impact of periodic plan asset rebalancing and historical performance we also consider the guidance from our investment advisors in making a final determination of our expected rate of return on assets to the extent the actual rate of return on assets realized over the course of a year is greater than or less than the assumed rate that year’s annual pension or postretirement plan cost is not affected rather this gain or loss reduces or increases future pension or postretirement plan cost over a period of approximately ten to twelve years 

  we estimate the assumed health care cost trend rate used in determining our postretirement net expense based upon our actual health care cost experience the effects of recently enacted legislation and general economic conditions our assumed rate of retirement is estimated based upon our annual review of our participant census information as of the measurement date 

  actual changes in the fair market value of plan assets and differences between the actual return on plan assets and the expected return on plan assets could have a material effect on the amount of pension cost ultimately recognized a 025 percent change in our discount rate will impact our pension and postretirement cost approximately 16 million a 025 percent change in our expected rate of return will impact our pension and postretirement cost by approximately 08 million 

39 results of operations 

  the following table presents our financial highlights for the three fiscal years ended september 30 2005 

  

 40   the following table shows our operating income by utility division and by segment for the three fiscal years ended september 30 2005 the presentation of our utility operating income is included for financial reporting purposes and may not be appropriate for ratemaking purposes 

  

 year ended september 30 2005 compared with year ended september 30 2004 

   our utility segment has historically contributed 70 to 85 percent of our consolidated net income the primary factors that impact the results of our utility operations are seasonal weather patterns competitive factors in the energy industry and economic conditions in our service areas natural gas sales to residential commercial and publicauthority customers are affected by winter heating season requirements this generally results in higher operating revenues and net income during the period from october through march of each year and lower operating revenues and either lower net income or net losses during the period from april through september of each year accordingly our second fiscal quarter has historically been our most critical earnings quarter with an average of approximately 67 percent of our consolidated net income having been earned in the second quarter during the three most recently completed fiscal years additionally we typically experience higher levels of accounts receivable accounts payable gas stored underground and shortterm debt balances during the winter heating season due to the seasonal nature of our revenues and the need to purchase and store gas to support these operations utility sales to industrial customers are much less weather sensitive utility sales to agricultural customers which typically use natural gas to power irrigation pumps during the period from march through september are primarily affected by rainfall amounts and the price of natural gas 

  changes in the cost of gas impact revenue but do not directly affect our gross profit from utility operations because the fluctuations in gas prices are passed through to our customers accordingly we believe gross profit margin is a better indicator of our financial performance than revenues however higher gas costs may cause customers to conserve or in the case of industrial customers to use alternative energy sources higher gas costs may also adversely impact our accounts receivable collections resulting in higher bad debt expense and may require us to increase borrowings under our credit facilities resulting in higher interest expense 

41   the effects of weather that is above or below normal are partially offset through weather normalization adjustments in certain of our service areas wna allows us to increase the base rate portion of customers’ bills when weather is warmer than normal and decrease the base rate when weather is colder than normal 

  our midtex division does not have wna however its operations benefit from a rate structure that combines a monthly customer charge with a declining block rate schedule to partially mitigate the impact of warmerthannormal weather on revenue the combination of the monthly customer charge and the customer billing under the first block of the declining block rate schedule provides for the recovery of a significant portion of our fixed costs for such operations under average weather conditions however this rate structure is not as beneficial during periods where weather is significantly warmer than normal 

   utility gross profit increased to 9074 million for the year ended september 30 2005 from 5031 million for the year ended september 30 2004 total throughput for our utility business was 4111 bcf during the current year compared to 2460 bcf in the prior year 

  the increase in utility gross profit margin primarily reflects the impact of the acquisition of the midtex division resulting in an increase in utility gross profit margin and total throughput of 3982 million and 1743 bcf the 61 million increase in the gross profit generated from our other utility operations primarily reflects rate increases in our mississippi and west texas divisions that were absent in the prior year coupled with the recognition of a 19 million refund to our customers in our colorado service area in the prior year offsetting these increases was a 39 million reduction in gross profit in our louisiana division due to the impact of hurricane katrina gross profit margins particularly in louisiana were also adversely impacted by weather as adjusted for jurisdictions with weathernormalized operations that was five percent warmer than normal and one percent warmer than the prior year period additionally gross profit margin was adversely impacted by the lack of cold weather in patterns sufficient to encourage customers to increase their heat load consumption and lower irrigation throughput in our west texas and coloradokansas divisions 

  operating expenses which include operation and maintenance expense provision for doubtful accounts depreciation and amortization expense and taxes other than income taxes increased to 6710 million for the year ended september 30 2005 from 3432 million for the year ended september 30 2004 primarily as a result of the addition of the midtex division excluding the impact of the midtex division operating expenses for our other utility operations increased 145 million primarily due to 23 million associated with the effects of hurricane katrina a 77 million increase in taxes other than income a 24 million increase in operation and maintenance expense including the provision for doubtful accounts and a 21 million increase in depreciation and amortization included in taxes other than income taxes are franchise and state gross receipts taxes which are paid by our customers as a component of their monthly bills although these amounts are offset in revenues through customer billings timing differences between when the expense is incurred and is recovered may impact our net income on a temporary basis however there is no permanent effect on net income 

  as a result of the aforementioned factors our utility segment operating income for the year ended september 30 2005 increased to 2364 million from 1599 million for the year ended september 30 2004 

   miscellaneous income increased to 68 million for the year ended september 30 2005 from 58 million for the year ended september 30 2004 the increase was attributable to an increase in interest income earned on higher cash balances during the current year compared with the prior year partially offset by the recognition of a 08 million gain on the sale of a building during the year ended september 30 2004 

   interest charges allocated to the utility segment for the year ended september 30 2005 increased to 1124 million from 654 million for the year ended september 30 2004 the increase was attributable to the 

42 interest expense associated with the issuance of longterm debt to finance the acquisition of the midtex division in october 2004 on june 30 2005 we repaid 725 million in principal on five series of our first mortgage bonds prior to their scheduled maturities the early repayment of these bonds resulted in savings of 13 million in interest expense in fiscal 2005 

   our natural gas marketing segment aggregates and purchases gas supply arranges transportation andor storage logistics and ultimately delivers gas to our customers at competitive prices to facilitate this process we utilize proprietary and customerowned transportation and storage assets to provide the various services our customers request including furnishing natural gas supplies at fixed and marketbased prices contract negotiation and administration load forecasting gas storage acquisition and management services transportation services peaking sales and balancing services capacity utilization strategies and gas price hedging through the use of derivative products as a result our revenues arise from the types of commercial transactions we have structured with our customers and include the value we extract by optimizing the storage and transportation capacity we own or control as well as revenues for services we deliver 

  to optimize the storage and transportation capacity we own or control we participate in transactions in which we combine the natural gas commodity and transportation costs to minimize our costs incurred to serve our customers by identifying the lowest cost alternative within the natural gas supplies transportation and markets to which we have access additionally we engage in natural gas storage transactions in which we seek to find and profit from the pricing differences that occur over time we purchase physical natural gas and then sell financial contracts at favorable prices to lock in gross profit margins through the use of transportation and storage services and derivative contracts we are able to capture gross profit margin through the arbitrage of pricing differences in various locations and by recognizing pricing differences that occur over time 

   gross profit margin for our natural gas marketing segment consists primarily of marketing activities which represent the utilization of proprietary and customerowned transportation and storage assets to provide the various services our customers request and storage activities which are derived from the optimization of our managed proprietary and third party storage and transportation assets 

  our natural gas marketing segment’s gross profit margin was comprised of the following for the year ended september 30 2005 and 2004 

   our natural gas marketing segment’s gross profit margin was 620 million for the year ended september 30 2005 compared to gross profit of 466 million for the year ended september 30 2004 gross 

43 profit margin from our natural gas marketing segment for the year ended september 30 2005 included an unrealized loss of 260 million compared with an unrealized loss of 28 million in the prior year natural gas marketing sales volumes were 2732 bcf during the year ended september 30 2005 compared with 2651 bcf for the prior year excluding intersegment sales volumes natural gas marketing sales volumes were 2381 bcf during the current year compared with 2226 bcf in the prior year the increase in consolidated natural gas marketing sales volumes primarily was attributable to successfully executed marketing strategies into new market areas 

  the contribution to gross profit from our storage activities was a gain of 140 million for the year ended september 30 2005 compared to a loss of 15 million for the year ended september 30 2004 the 155 million improvement primarily was attributable to a 299 million increase in the realized storage contribution for the year ended september 30 2005 compared to the prior year due to more favorable arbitrage spread opportunities during the current year partially offset by increased storage fees associated with 90 bcf of newly contracted storage capacity during the third quarter of fiscal 2005 annual demand charges for this new storage approximate 76 million we may further increase the amount of our storage capacity in the future therefore the impact of price volatility on our unrealized storage contribution could become more significant in future periods 

  a 144 million decrease in the unrealized storage contribution resulted from an unfavorable movement during the year ended september 30 2005 in the forward indices used to value the storage financial instruments combined with greater physical natural gas storage quantities at september 30 2005 compared to the prior year also 

  our marketing activities contributed 480 million to our gross profit for the year ended september 30 2005 compared to 482 million for the year ended september 30 2004 the decrease in the marketing contribution primarily was attributable to 120 million of unrealized markedtomarket losses associated with basis swaps that were put in place to capture margins in certain volatile market areas the increase in unrealized markedtomarket losses was partially offset by an increase in our realized marketing margins due to focusing our marketing efforts on higher margin customers and successfully entering into new market areas 

  operating expenses which include operation and maintenance expense provision for doubtful accounts depreciation and amortization expense and taxes other than income taxes increased to 210 million for the year ended september 30 2005 from 189 million for the year ended september 30 2004 the increase in operating expense was attributable primarily to an increase in labor costs due to increased headcount and an increase in regulatory compliance costs 

  the increase in gross profit margin combined with higher operating expenses resulted in an increase in our natural gas marketing segment operating income to 410 million for the year ended september 30 2005 compared with operating income of 277 million for the year ended september 30 2004 

   our pipeline and storage segment consists of the regulated pipeline and storage operations of the atmos pipeline–texas division and the nonregulated pipeline and storage operations of atmos pipeline and storage llc which were previously included in our other nonutility segment the atmos pipeline–texas division transports natural gas to our midtex division and for third parties and manages five underground storage reservoirs in texas we also provide ancillary services customary in the pipeline industry including parking arrangements blending and sales of inventory on hand these operations represent one of the largest intrastate pipeline operations in texas with a heavy concentration in the established natural gasproducing areas of central northern and eastern texas extending into or near the major producing areas of the texas gulf coast and the delaware and val verde basins of west texas nine basins located in texas are estimated to contain a substantial portion of the nation’s remaining onshore natural gas reserves this pipeline system provides access to all of these basins 

44   aps owns or has an interest in underground storage fields in kentucky and louisiana we also use these storage facilities to reduce the need to contract for additional pipeline capacity to meet customer demand during peak periods 

  similar to our utility segment our pipeline and storage segment is impacted by seasonal weather patterns competitive factors in the energy industry and economic conditions in our service areas natural gas transportation requirements are affected by the winter heating season requirements of our customers this generally results in higher operating revenues and net income during the period from october through march of each year and lower operating revenues and either lower net income or net losses during the period from april through september of each year further as the atmos pipeline — texas division operations provide all of the natural gas for our midtex division the results of this segment are highly dependent upon the natural gas requirements of this division 

  as a regulated pipeline the operations of the atmos pipeline — texas division may be impacted by the timing of when costs and expenses are incurred and when these costs and expenses are recovered through its tariffs 

   pipeline and storage gross profit increased to 1579 million for the year ended september 30 2005 from 104 million for the year ended september 30 2004 total pipeline transportation volumes were 5639 bcf during the year ended september 30 2005 compared with 94 bcf for the prior year excluding intersegment transportation volumes total pipeline transportation volumes were 3756 bcf during the current year 

  the increase in pipeline and storage gross profit margin primarily reflects the impact of the acquisition of the atmos pipeline — texas division resulting in an increase in pipeline and storage gross profit margin and total transportation volumes of 1495 million and 3756 bcf also contributing to atmos pipeline — texas division’s results were higher transportation and related services margin due to significant basis differentials at its three major texas hubs the 20 million decrease in the gross profit generated by aps primarily reflects a decrease in asset management fees received during fiscal 2005 

  operating expenses increased to 876 million for the year ended september 30 2005 from 51 million for the year ended september 30 2004 due to the addition of 836 million in operating expenses associated with the atmos pipeline — texas division as the atmos pipeline — texas division is a regulated entity franchise and state gross receipts taxes are paid by our customers thus these amounts are offset in revenues through customer billings and have no permanent effect on net income included in operating expense was 89 million associated with taxes other than income taxes of which 83 million was associated with our atmos pipeline — texas division 

  as a result of the aforementioned factors our pipeline and storage segment operating income for the year ended september 30 2005 increased to 703 million from 53 million for the year ended september 30 2004 

   interest charges allocated to this segment for the year ended september 30 2005 increased to 246 million from 11 million for the year ended september 30 2004 the increase was attributable to the interest expense associated with the issuance of longterm debt to finance the acquisition of the atmos pipeline — texas division in october 2004 

   our other nonutility businesses consist primarily of the operations of atmos energy services llc and atmos power systems inc through aes we provide natural gas management services to our utility operations other than the midtex division these services which began april 1 2004 include aggregating and purchasing gas supply arranging transportation and storage logistics and ultimately delivering the gas to our utility service areas at competitive prices the revenues of aes represent charges to our utility divisions 

45 equal to the costs incurred to provide those services through atmos power systems inc we construct gasfired electric peaking powergenerating plants and associated facilities and may enter into agreements to either lease or sell these plants 

  operating income for our other nonutility segment primarily reflects the leasing income associated with two salestype lease transactions completed in fiscal 2001 and 2002 the increase in operating income during the year ended september 30 2005 reflects the absence of a onetime charge of 04 million associated with the winddown of a noncore business during fiscal 2004 

  miscellaneous income for the year ended september 30 2005 was 26 million compared with 83 million for the year ended september 30 2004 the 57 million decrease was attributable primarily to the recognition of a 59 million pretax gain on the sale of all remaining limited partnership interests in heritage propane partners lp during fiscal 2004 

year ended september 30 2004 compared with year ended september 30 2003 

 

   utility gross profit margin increased to 5031 million for the year ended september 30 2004 from 4914 million for the year ended september 30 2003 total throughput for our utility business was 2610 bcf during the year compared to 2547 bcf in the prior year excluding intercompany throughput consolidated throughput for our utility business was 2460 bcf during the year compared with 2480 bcf in the prior year 

  the increase in utility gross profit margin primarily reflects the impact of the acquisition of mississippi valley gas company whose operations are included for the entire first quarter in fiscal year 2004 compared with one month in the first quarter of the prior fiscal year resulting in an increase in utility gross profit margin and total throughput of 128 million and 50 bcf utility gross profit margin was also favorably impacted by rate increases received in kansas texas and mississippi and a 102 million yearoveryear increase in the effect of wna in our wna service areas these increases were partially offset by the impact of weather that was six percent warmer than that of the prior year and four percent warmer than normal resulting in a decrease of approximately 138 million and lower irrigation sales in our west texas division resulting in a decrease of approximately 21 million warmer than normal weather particularly impacted our service areas in our louisiana midstates and west texas divisions the decrease in throughput also reflects a decrease in consumption attributable to the impact of conservation and the continued introduction of more efficient gas appliances in our service areas finally our utility gross profit margin for the year ended september 30 2004 reflects a onetime reduction resulting from a regulatory ruling to refund 19 million to our customers in our colorado service area 

  operating expenses which include operation and maintenance expense provision for doubtful accounts depreciation and amortization expense and taxes other than income taxes increased 39 percent to 3432 million for the year ended september 30 2004 from 3303 million for the year ended september 30 2003 operation and maintenance expense increased primarily due to the addition of 61 million related to the mvg acquisition in december 2002 and higher labor and benefit costs taxes other than income taxes increased 15 million primarily due to additional franchise payroll and property taxes associated with the mvg assets acquired in december 2002 franchise and state gross receipts taxes are paid by our customers as a component of their monthly bills thus these amounts are offset in revenues through customer billings and have no effect on net income depreciation and amortization expense increased 91 million which primarily reflects mvg depreciation for the full year of fiscal 2004 compared with ten months in the prior year these increases were partially offset by a 79 million reduction in our provision for doubtful accounts attributable to continued improvement in accounts receivable collections during fiscal 2004 

  as a result of the aforementioned factors our utility segment operating income for the year ended september 30 2004 decreased to 1599 million from 1611 million for the year ended september 30 2003 

   miscellaneous income for the year ended september 30 2004 was 58 million compared with expense of 02 million for the year ended september 30 2003 the 60 million change was attributable primarily to the absence in 2004 of weather insurance amortization totaling 50 million which was recognized in the prior year due to the termination of our weather insurance policy in the third quarter of fiscal 2003 and the recognition of a 08 million gain on the sale of real property during fiscal 2004 

   interest charges increased 35 percent for the year ended september 30 2004 to 654 million from 632 million for the year ended september 30 2003 the increase was attributable primarily to a higher average outstanding debt balance resulting from the financing obtained to fund the acquisition of mvg in december 2002 

 

   our natural gas marketing segment’s gross profit margin was comprised of the following for the years ended september 30 2004 and 2003 

   our natural gas marketing segment’s gross profit was 466 million for the year ended september 30 2004 compared to gross profit margin of 242 million for the year ended september 30 2003 natural gas marketing sales volumes were 2651 bcf during the current year compared with 2948 bcf for the prior year excluding intercompany sales volumes natural gas marketing sales volumes were 2226 bcf during the current year compared with 2260 bcf in the prior year the decrease in consolidated natural gas marketing sales volumes was primarily due to overall warmer temperatures during the 20032004 heating season compared with the prior year our natural gas marketing gross profit margin for the year ended september 30 2004 included an unrealized loss on open contracts of 28 million compared with an unrealized gain on open contracts of 63 million in the prior year 

  the contribution to gross profit from our storage activities was a loss of 15 million for the year ended september 30 2004 compared to a loss of 19 million for the year ended september 30 2003 the 04 million improvement primarily was attributable to a 54 million improvement in the realized storage contribution for the year ended september 30 2004 compared to the prior year offset by a 50 million decrease in unrealized income associated with our storage portfolio compared to the prior year the improvement in the realized storage contribution for the year ended september 30 2004 primarily was due to 

47 our inability during the 20022003 heating season to withdraw planned volumes from storage to meet our customer requirements caused by operational contractual and regulatory limitations relating to our storage facilities which reduced our realized storage contributions during fiscal 2003 this situation did not recur in fiscal 2004 the decrease in unrealized income in the current year was primarily attributable to a less favorable movement during the year ended september 30 2004 in the forward indices used to value the storage financial instruments than in the prior year combined with slightly lower physical natural gas storage quantities at september 30 2004 compared to the prior year 

  our marketing activities contributed 482 million to our gross profit margin for the year ended september 30 2004 compared to 261 million for the year ended september 30 2003 the increase in the marketing contribution primarily was attributable to our continued efforts to amend contracts with third parties to transfer risk to our customers and to provide higher gross profit margins and improved position management during the current year 

  operating expenses which include operation and maintenance expense provision for doubtful accounts depreciation and amortization expense and taxes other than income taxes increased to 189 million for the year ended september 30 2004 from 106 million for the year ended september 30 2003 the increase in operating expense was attributable primarily to higher labor and benefit costs resulting from the improvement in earnings for the fiscal year and an increase in temporary and permanent personnel due to systems and process improvements in the marketing segment 

  the improved gross profit margin resulted in an increase in our natural gas marketing segment operating income to 277 million for the year ended september 30 2004 compared with operating income of 136 million for the year ended september 30 2003 

   miscellaneous income for the year ended september 30 2004 was 08 million compared with income of 19 million for the year ended september 30 2003 the 11 million decrease was attributable primarily to lower interest income earned on cash held on deposit in margin accounts due to favorable valuations on our financial derivatives which reduced the need to deposit cash into margin accounts 

 

   our pipeline and storage operating income decreased to 53 million for the year ended september 30 2004 from 118 million for the year ended september 30 2003 the decrease in our pipeline and storage operating income was primarily attributable to a decrease in demand charges recognized by atmos pipeline and storage llc for storage services provided during the year ended september 30 2004 compared to the prior year and lower transported volumes of approximately 23 bcf by aps due to overall warmer weather during the winter heating season the decrease was also attributable to a 15 million decrease in monthly facilities fees charged by trans louisiana gas pipeline inc as a result of a settlement reached with the louisiana public service commission in october 2003 our pipeline and storage operating income for the year ended september 30 2004 also included an unrealized loss on open contracts of 11 million compared with no unrealized gain our loss in the prior year as aps started to hedge its storage inventory during the fourth quarter of 2004 

 

   our other nonutility operating income decreased to 08 million for the year ended september 30 2004 from 13 million for the year ended september 30 2003 the decrease in our other nonutility operating income was attributable primarily to a onetime charge of 04 million associated with the winddown of a noncore business 

   miscellaneous income for the year ended september 30 2004 was 83 million compared with income of 65 million for the year ended september 30 2003 the 18 million increase was attributable primarily to a 59 million pretax gain associated with the sale in january 2004 of our general and limited partnership interests in usp and the sale in june 2004 of the remaining limited partnership units in heritage propane partners lp formerly owned by usp this increase was offset partially by lower equity earnings from our investment in usp resulting from the sale and the absence in 2004 of a 39 million gain recorded in 2003 associated with a salestype lease of a distributed electric generation plant 

liquidity and capital resources 

  our working capital and liquidity for capital expenditure and other cash needs are provided from internally generated funds borrowings under our credit facilities and commercial paper program and funds raised from the public debt and equity capital markets we believe that these sources of funds will provide the necessary working capital and liquidity for capital expenditures and other cash needs for fiscal 2006 however during fiscal 2006 we anticipate that higher natural gas prices primarily resulting from the recent natural disasters will increase our need to utilize our shortterm credit facilities to temporarily finance the purchase of natural gas to fulfill our contractual obligations these facilities are described in greater detail below and in note 6 to the consolidated financial statements 

capitalization 

  the following presents our capitalization as of september 30 2005 and 2004 

   total debt as a percentage of total capitalization including shortterm debt was 593 percent and 433 percent at september 30 2005 and 2004 the increase in the debt to capitalization ratio was attributable to the issuance of 139 billion in senior unsecured longterm debt partially offset by the issuance of 161 million shares of our common stock in october 2004 to partially finance the txu gas acquisition our ratio of total debt to capitalization is typically greater during the winter heating season as we make additional shortterm borrowings to fund natural gas purchases and meet our working capital requirements within three to five years from the closing of the txu gas acquisition we intend to reduce our capitalization ratio to a target range of 50 to 55 percent through cash flow generated from operations continued issuance of new common stock under our direct stock purchase plan and retirement savings plan access to the equity capital markets and reduced annual maintenance and capital expenditures 

cash flows 

  our internally generated funds may change in the future due to a number of factors some of which we cannot control these include regulatory changes the price for our products and services the demand for such products and services margin requirements resulting from significant changes in commodity prices operational risks and other factors 

   yearoveryear changes in our operating cash flows are attributable primarily to working capital changes within our utility segment resulting from the impact of weather the price of natural gas and the timing of customer collections payments for natural gas purchases and deferred gas cost recoveries 

  for the year ended september 30 2005 we generated operating cash flow of 3869 million compared with 2707 million in fiscal 2004 and 495 million in fiscal 2003 the significant factors impacting our operating cash flow for the last three fiscal years are summarized below 

   fiscal 2005 operating cash flows reflect the effects of a 496 million increase in net income and effective working capital management partially offset by higher natural gas prices working capital management efforts which affected the timing of payments for accounts payable and other accrued liabilities favorably affected operating cash flow by 3541 million however these efforts were partially offset by reduced cash flow generated from accounts receivable changes by 1689 million primarily attributable to higher natural gas prices and an increase in our natural gas inventories attributable to a 13 percent yearoveryear increase in natural gas prices coupled with increased natural gas inventory levels which reduced operating cash flow by 818 million operating cash flow was also adversely impacted by unfavorable movements in the indices used to value our natural gas marketing segment risk management assets and liabilities which resulted in a net liability for the segment accordingly under the terms of the associated derivative contracts we were required to deposit 810 million into a margin account 

   fiscal 2004 operating cash flows were favorably impacted by several items improved customer collections during fiscal 2004 compared with the prior year resulted in a 622 million increase in operating cash flow further cash used for natural gas inventories decreased by 338 million compared with the prior year the decrease was attributable to lower injections of natural gas into storage partially offset by higher prices the reduction in the lag between the time period when we purchase our natural gas and the period in which we can include this cost in our gas rates improved operating cash flow by 657 million changes in cash held on deposit in margin accounts resulted in an increase in operating cash flow of 256 million this account represents deposits recorded to collateralize certain of our financial derivatives purchased in support of our natural gas marketing activities the favorable change was attributable to the fact that the fair value of financial instruments held by aem represented a net asset position at september 30 2004 which eliminated the need to place cash in margin accounts finally other working capital and other changes improved operating cash flow by 339 million these changes primarily related to various increases in deferred credits and other liabilities other current liabilities and income taxes payable partially offset by lower deferred income tax expense as compared with the prior year 

   fiscal 2003 operating cash flow was adversely impacted by a 600 million increase in accounts receivable due to higher revenues and the timing of customer account collections the increase in revenues was attributable to a 19 percent increase in consolidated utility throughput as a result of the impact of our mvg acquisition operating cash flow was also adversely impacted by a significant increase in natural gas prices these increases resulted in a 649 million increase in gas stored underground and a 242 million increase in deferred gas costs finally operating cash flow reflects the impact of the funding of our pension plan in june 2003 which included a 486 million cash payment 

   during the last three years a substantial portion of our cash resources was used to fund acquisitions our ongoing construction program to provide natural gas services to our customer base enhance the integrity of our pipelines and improvements to information systems 

50   for the year ended september 30 2005 we incurred 3332 million for capital expenditures compared with 1903 million for the year ended september 30 2004 and 1594 million for the year ended september 30 2003 capital expenditures for the year ended september 30 2005 include approximately 1150 million for the atmos energy midtex division and 314 million for the atmos pipeline — texas division 

  our cash used for investing activities for the year ended september 30 2005 reflects the 19 billion cash paid for the txu gas acquisition including related transaction costs and expenses cash flow from investing activities for the year ended september 30 2004 reflect the receipt of 279 million from the sale of our limited and general partnership interests in usp and heritage propane partners lp and from the sale of a building 

   for the year ended september 30 2005 our financing activities provided 17 billion in cash compared with 804 million and 1516 million provided for the years ended september 30 2004 and 2003 our significant financing activities for the years ended september 30 2005 2004 and 2003 are summarized as follows 

 51   during the year ended september 30 2005 we issued 16 million shares of common stock through various plans in addition to the 161 million common shares issued in our october 2004 public offering which generated net proceeds of 372 million the following table shows the number of shares issued for the years ended september 30 2005 2004 and 2003 

 shelf registration 

  in december 2001 we filed a registration statement with the securities and exchange commission sec to issue from time to time up to 6000 million in new common stock andor debt the registration statement was declared effective by the sec on january 30 2002 on january 16 2003 we issued 2500 million of 5125 senior notes due in 2013 under the registration statement the net proceeds of 2493 million were used to repay debt under an acquisition credit facility used to finance our acquisition of mvg to repay 540 million in unsecured senior notes held by institutional lenders and shortterm debt under our commercial paper program and for general corporate purposes additionally we sold 41 million shares of our common stock in connection with our 2003 offering under the registration statement to provide additional funding for our pension account plan in july 2004 we sold 99 million shares of our common stock including the underwriters’ exercise of their overallotment option which exhausted the remaining availability under this registration statement 

  in august 2004 we filed a registration statement with the sec to issue from time to time up to 22 billion in new common stock andor debt which became effective on september 15 2004 in october 2004 we sold 161 million common shares including the underwriters’ exercise of their overallotment option of 21 million shares under the new registration statement generating net proceeds of 3825 million before other offering costs additionally we issued senior unsecured debt under the registration statement consisting of 400 million of 400 senior notes due 2009 500 million of 495 senior notes due 2014 200 million of 595 senior notes due 2034 and 300 million of floating rate senior notes due 2007 the floating rate notes bear interest at a rate equal to the threemonth libor rate plus 0375 percent per year the initial weighted average effective interest rate on these notes was 476 percent the net proceeds from the sale of these senior notes were 139 billion 

  the net proceeds from the october 2004 common stock and senior notes offerings combined with the net proceeds from our july 2004 offering were used to pay off the 17 billion in outstanding commercial paper backstopped by a senior unsecured revolving credit agreement which we entered into on september 24 2004 for bridge financing for the txu gas acquisition after issuing the debt and equity in october 2004 we have approximately 4015 million of availability remaining under this registration statement 

52 credit facilities 

  we maintain both committed and uncommitted credit facilities borrowings under our uncommitted credit facilities are made on a whenandasneeded basis at the discretion of the bank our credit capacity and the amount of unused borrowing capacity are affected by the seasonal nature of the natural gas business and our shortterm borrowing requirements which are typically highest during colder winter months our working capital needs can vary significantly due to changes in the price of natural gas charged by suppliers and the increased gas supplies required to meet customers’ needs during periods of cold weather our cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures have increased substantially as a result of the acquisition of the natural gas distribution and pipeline operations of txu gas on october 22 2004 we replaced our 3500 million credit facility with a new 6000 million committed credit facility that serves as a backup liquidity facility for our commercial paper program we believe this facility combined with our operating cash flow will be sufficient to fund these increased working capital needs on march 30 2005 aem amended and extended its uncommitted demand working capital credit facility to march 31 2006 at september 30 2005 there was 1299 million outstanding under our commercial paper program and 149 million outstanding under our bank credit facilities these facilities are described in further detail in note 6 to the consolidated financial statements 

  in anticipation of increased shortterm liquidity needs due to the recent increases in natural gas prices we worked with our regulators who approved an increase in the amounts available to our utility operations under shortterm credit facilities to 9680 million consisting of a new 6000 million 3year revolving credit facility to replace our existing 6000 million 364day credit facility that expired in october 2005 a new 3000 million 364day revolving credit facility a new 250 million uncommitted facility and our existing 250 million uncommitted and 180 million committed credit facilities additionally we are working with our lenders to obtain up to an additional 3300 million of capacity under our uncommitted demand working capital credit facility to provide additional shortterm liquidity to support our natural gas marketing operations 

credit ratings 

  our credit ratings directly affect our ability to obtain shortterm and longterm financing in addition to the cost of such financing in determining our credit ratings the rating agencies consider a number of quantitative factors including debt to total capitalization operating cash flow relative to outstanding debt operating cash flow coverage of interest and pension liabilities and funding status in addition the rating agencies consider qualitative factors such as consistency of our earnings over time the quality of our management and business strategy the risks associated with our utility and nonutility businesses and the regulatory structures that govern our rates in the states where we operate 

  our debt is rated by three rating agencies standard  poor’s corporation moody’s investors service and fitch ratings inc our current debt ratings are all considered investment grade and are as follows 

   currently sp and moody’s maintain a stable outlook and fitch maintains a negative outlook none of our ratings are currently under review 

  a credit rating is not a recommendation to buy sell or hold securities all of our current ratings for longterm debt are categorized as investment grade the highest investment grade credit rating for sp is aaa moody’s is aaa and fitch is aaa the lowest investment grade credit rating for sp is bbb moody’s is baa3 and fitch is bbb our credit ratings may be revised or withdrawn at any time by the rating agencies and each rating should be evaluated independent of any other rating there can be no assurance that a rating will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if in its judgment circumstances so warrant 

53 debt covenants 

  we are required by the financial covenants in both of our revolving credit facilities to maintain at the end of each fiscal quarter a ratio of total debt to total capitalization of no greater than 70 percent at september 30 2005 our totaldebttototalcapitalization ratio as defined in such facility was 61 percent 

  aem is required by the financial covenants in its uncommitted demand working capital facility to maintain a maximum ratio of total liabilities to tangible net worth of 5 to 1 along with minimum levels of net working capital ranging from 20 million to 50 million additionally aem must maintain a minimum tangible net worth ranging from 21 million to 51 million and its maximum cumulative loss from march 30 2005 cannot exceed 4 million to 10 million depending on the total amount of borrowing elected from time to time by aem at september 30 2005 aem’s ratio of total liabilities to tangible net worth as defined in such facility was 218 to 1 

  our series p first mortgage bonds provide for certain cash flow requirements and restrictions on additional indebtedness sale of assets and payment of dividends under the most restrictive of such covenants cumulative cash dividends paid after december 31 1985 may not exceed the sum of our accumulated net income for periods after december 31 1985 plus 90 million at september 30 2005 approximately 1579 million of retained earnings was unrestricted with respect to the payment of dividends 

  we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants as of september 30 2005 if we do not comply with our debt covenants we may be required to repay our outstanding balances on demand provide additional collateral or take other corrective actions our two public debt indentures relating to our senior notes and debentures as well as our two revolving credit agreements each contain a default provision that is triggered if outstanding indebtedness arising out of any other credit agreements in amounts ranging from in excess of 15 million to in excess of 100 million becomes due by acceleration or is not paid at maturity in addition aem’s credit agreement contains a crossdefault provision whereby aem would be in default if it defaults on other indebtedness as defined by at least 250 thousand in the aggregate additionally this agreement contains a provision that would limit the amount of credit available if atmos were downgraded below an sp rating of bbb and a moody’s rating of baa2 

  except as described above we have no triggering events in our debt instruments that are tied to changes in specified credit ratings or stock price nor have we entered into any transactions that would require us to issue equity based on our credit rating or other triggering events 

54 contractual obligations and commercial commitments 

  the following tables provide information about contractual obligations and commercial commitments at september 30 2005 

  

   aem has commitments to purchase physical quantities of natural gas under contracts indexed to the forward nymex strip or fixed price contracts at september 30 2005 aem was committed to purchase 323 bcf within one year 292 bcf between one to three years and 99 bcf after three years under indexed contracts aem was committed to purchase 13 bcf within one year and 04 bcf within one to three years under fixed price contracts with prices ranging from 524 to 1750 

  with the exception of our midtex division our utility segment maintains supply contracts with several vendors that generally cover a period of up to one year commitments for estimated base gas volumes are established under these contracts on a monthly basis at contractually negotiated prices commitments for incremental daily purchases are made as necessary during the month in accordance with the terms of the individual contract our midtex division maintains longterm supply contracts to ensure a reliable source of gas for our customers in its service area which obligate it to purchase specified volumes at market prices the estimated commitments under these contract terms as of september 30 2005 are reflected in the table above 

  in january 2005 we signed a letter of intent with a third party to jointly construct own and operate a 45mile large diameter natural gas pipeline in the northern portion of the dallas fort worth metroplex under terms of the letter of intent the third party will provide the initial capital to build the pipeline and we expect to contribute 450 million within two years of signing a definitive agreement we expect to execute 

55 this agreement during the first quarter of fiscal 2006 and the pipeline is currently expected to be placed into service in fiscal 2006 additionally during the third quarter of 2005 we entered into two agreements with third parties to transport natural gas through our texas intrastate pipeline system beginning in fiscal 2006 to handle the increased volumes for these projects we will install compression equipment and other pipeline infrastructure we expect to spend approximately 320 million in 2006 for these projects 

risk management activities 

  we conduct risk management activities through both our utility and natural gas marketing segments in our utility segment we use a combination of storage fixed physical contracts and fixed financial contracts to partially insulate us and our customers against gas price volatility during the winter heating season in our natural gas marketing segment we manage our exposure to the risk of natural gas price changes and lock in our gross profit margin through a combination of storage and financial derivatives including futures overthecounter and exchangetraded options and swap contracts with counterparties finally during fiscal 2004 we entered into four treasury lock agreements to fix the treasury yield component of the interest cost of financing associated with the anticipated issuance of 875 million of longterm debt these treasury lock agreements were settled in october 2004 with a net 438 million payment to the counterparties approximately 116 million of the 438 million obligation will be recognized as a component of interest expense over a five year period from the date of settlement and the remaining amount approximately 322 million will be recognized as a component of interest expense over a ten year period from the date of settlement our risk management activities and related accounting treatment are described in further detail in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements 

  we record our derivatives as a component of risk management assets and liabilities which are classified as current or noncurrent based upon the anticipated settlement date of the underlying derivative substantially all of our derivative financial instruments are valued using external market quotes and indices the following table shows the components of the change in fair value of our utility and natural gas marketing derivative contract activities for the year ended september 30 2005 in thousands 

   the fair value of our utility and natural gas marketing derivative contracts at september 30 2005 is segregated below by time period and fair value source

   aem participates in transactions in which it seeks to find and profit from pricing differences that occur over time aem purchases physical natural gas and then sells financial contracts at favorable prices to lock in gross profit margins aem is able to capture gross profit margin through the arbitrage of pricing differences in various locations and by recognizing pricing differences that occur over time 

  natural gas inventory is marked to market monthly using the iferc price at the end of each month with changes in fair value recognized as unrealized gains and losses in the period of change derivatives associated with our natural gas inventory which are designated as fair value hedges are marked to market each month based upon the nymex price with changes in fair value recognized as unrealized gains and losses in the period of change the changes in the difference between the indices used to mark to market our physical inventory iferc and the related fairvalue hedge nymex is reported as a component of revenue and can result in volatility in our reported net income over time gains and losses on the sale of storage gas inventory will be offset by gains and losses on the fairvalue hedges therefore the economic gross profit aem captured in the original transaction remains essentially unchanged 

  aem continually manages its positions to enhance the future economic profit it captured in the original transaction therefore aem may change its scheduled injection and withdrawal plans from one time period to another based on market conditions or adjust the amount of storage capacity it holds on a discretionary basis in an effort to achieve this objective aem monitors the impacts of these profit optimization efforts by estimating the forecasted gross profit margin that it captured through the purchase and sale of physical natural gas and the associated financial derivatives the forecasted gross profit margin less the effect of unrealized gains or losses recognized in the financial statements provides a measure of the net increase or decrease in the gross profit margin that could occur in future periods if aem’s optimization efforts are fully successful 

  as of september 30 2005 based upon aem’s derivatives position and inventory withdrawal schedule the forecasted gross profit margin was approximately 130 million approximately 148 million of net unrealized losses were recorded in the financial statements as of september 30 2005 therefore the projected increase in future gross profit margin is approximately 278 million 

  the forecasted gross profit margin calculation is based upon planned injection and withdrawal schedules and the realization of the forecasted gross profit margin is contingent upon the execution of this plan weather and other execution factors since aem actively manages and optimizes its portfolio to enhance the future profitability of its storage position it may change its scheduled injection and withdrawal plans from one time period to another based on market conditions therefore we cannot assure that the forecasted gross profit margin or the projected increase in future gross profit margin calculated as of september 30 2005 will be fully realized in the future or in what time period further if we experience operational or other issues which limit our ability to optimally manage our stored gas positions permanent impacts on earnings may result 

pension and postretirement benefits obligations 

   for the fiscal year ended september 30 2005 our total net periodic pension and other benefits costs was 364 million compared with 261 million and 280 million for the years ended september 30 2004 and 2003 a portion of these costs is capitalized into our utility rate base as these costs are recoverable through our gas utility rates costs that are not capitalized are recorded as a component of operation and maintenance expense 

  the increase in total net periodic pension and other benefits cost during fiscal 2005 compared with the prior year primarily reflects an increase in our service cost associated with the increase in the number of employees covered by our plans due to the txu gas acquisition although we did not assume the existing employee benefit liabilities or plans of txu gas for purposes of determining our annual pension cost we agreed to give the transitioned employees credit for years of txu gas service under our pension plan with respect to our postretirement medical plan we received a credit of 189 million against the purchase price to permit us to provide partial past service credits for retiree medical benefits under our retiree medical plan the 

57 189 million credit approximates the actuarially determined present value of the accumulated benefits related to the past service of the transferred employees on the acquisition date 

  in addition to the increased number of employees covered by the plans we changed the assumptions used to determine our fiscal 2005 benefit costs which resulted in an increase in our net periodic pension and postretirement costs we increased the discount rate by 25 basis points and we reduced our expected return on our pension plan assets by 25 basis points these assumption changes decreased the service cost and interest cost and reduced the expected return components of our pension and postretirement benefits costs 

  the decrease in total net periodic pension and other benefits cost during fiscal 2004 compared with fiscal 2003 primarily reflects the impact of adopting the provisions of the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of 2003 the act beginning with the second quarter of 2004 which reduced our accumulated postretirement benefit obligation by 243 million and our net postretirement benefit obligation costs by 41 million the total income statement impact was 23 million as a portion of this benefit was capitalized 

  further the expected return on plan assets which reduces our net pension and postretirement costs increased as compared with the prior year primarily due to an increase in total assets attributable to the full year effect of the contributions we made to the atmos pension account plan in fiscal 2003 and the inclusion of the mvg pension plan assets during fiscal 2003 partially offset by a 25 basis point decrease in the expected return on plan asset assumption used to determine fiscal 2004 net periodic pension cost 

  these decreases were partially offset by an increase in the service cost and the recognized actuarial loss attributable to a 125 basis point decrease in the discount rate used to determine our fiscal 2004 net periodic pension and other benefits costs compared with the discount rate used to determine our fiscal 2003 costs resulting from a decrease in interest rates in the period leading up to our june 30 measurement date 

   generally our funding policy is to contribute annually an amount in accordance with the requirements of the employee retirement income security act of 1974 however additional voluntary contributions are made from time to time as considered necessary contributions are intended to provide not only for benefits attributed to service to date but also for those expected to be earned in the future 

  during fiscal 2005 we voluntarily contributed 30 million to the atmos energy corporation master retirement trust the trust to maintain the level of funding we desire relative to our accumulated benefit obligation we elected to contribute to the trust because declining high yield corporate bond yields in the period leading up to our june 30 2005 measurement date resulted in an increase in the present value of our plan liabilities in june 2003 we contributed to the trust for the benefit of the atmos energy corporation pension account plan 486 million in cash and 1169700 shares of atmos restricted common stock with thethen market value of 288 million we did not contribute to our pension plans during fiscal 2004 

  we contributed 100 million 138 million and 186 million to our postretirement benefits plans for the years ended september 30 2005 2004 and 2003 the contributions represent the portion of the postretirement costs we are responsible for under the terms of our plan and minimum funding required by our regulators 

   as noted above high grade corporate bond yields were decreasing in the period leading up to our june 30 2005 measurement date therefore we reduced the discount rate for determining our fiscal 2006 pension and benefit costs by 125 basis points to 5 percent additionally we reduced the expected return on our pension plan assets by 25 basis points to 85 percent the effect of these assumption changes coupled with the effects of updating our annual valuation will result in an increase in our net pension and postretirement costs of approximately 15 million 

58   we are not required to make a minimum funding contribution to our pension plans during fiscal 2006 nor at this time do we intend to make voluntary contributions during 2006 however we anticipate contributing approximately 119 million to our postretirement medical plans during fiscal 2006 

  the projected pension liability future funding requirements and the amount of pension expense or income recognized for the plan are subject to change depending upon the actuarial value of plan assets and the determination of future benefit obligations as of each subsequent actuarial calculation date these amounts are impacted by actual investment returns changes in interest rates and changes in the demographic composition of the participants in the plan

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend   we are exposed to risks associated with commodity prices and interest rates commodity price risk is the potential loss that we may incur as a result of changes in the fair value of a particular instrument or commodity interestrate risk results from our portfolio of debt and equity instruments that we issue to provide financing and liquidity for our business 

  we conduct risk management activities through both our utility and natural gas marketing segments in our utility segment we use a combination of storage fixed physical contracts and fixed financial contracts to partially insulate us and our customers against gas price volatility during the winter heating season in our natural gas marketing segment we manage our exposure to the risk of natural gas price changes and lock in our gross profit margin through a combination of storage and financial derivatives including futures overthecounter and exchangetraded options and swap contracts with counterparties our risk management activities and related accounting treatment are described in further detail in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements additionally our earnings are affected by changes in shortterm interest rates as a result of our issuance of shortterm commercial paper the issuance of floating rate debt in october 2004 and our other shortterm borrowings 

commodity price risk 

   we purchase natural gas for our utility operations substantially all of the cost of gas purchased for utility operations is recovered from our customers through purchased gas adjustment mechanisms however our utility operations have commodity price risk exposure to fluctuations in spot natural gas prices related to purchases for sales to our nonregulated energy services customers at fixed prices 

  for our utility segment we use a sensitivity analysis to estimate commodity price risk for purposes of this analysis we estimate commodity price risk by applying a hypothetical 10 percent increase in the portion of our gas cost related to fixedprice nonregulated sales based on these projected nonregulated gas sales a hypothetical 10 percent increase in fixed prices based upon the september 30 2005 three month market strip would increase our purchased gas cost by approximately 59 million in fiscal 2006 

   our natural gas marketing segment is also exposed to risks associated with changes in the market price of natural gas for our natural gas marketing segment we use a sensitivity analysis to estimate commodity price risk for purposes of this analysis we estimate commodity price risk by applying a 050 change in the forward nymex price to our net open position including existing storage and related financial contracts at the end of each period because aeh did not have any net open positions including existing storage and related financial contracts at september 30 2005 there would be no impact on our consolidated net income due to fluctuations in the forward nymex price 

59   however changes in the difference between the indices used to mark to market our physical inventory iferc and the related fairvalue hedge nymex can result in volatility in our reported net income however over time gains and losses on the sale of storage gas inventory will be offset by gains and losses on the fairvalue hedges based upon our storage position at september 30 2005 of 74 bcf a 050 change in the difference between the iferc and nymex indices could impact our reported net income by approximately 23 million 

interest rate risk 

  our earnings are exposed to changes in shortterm interest rates associated with our shortterm commercial paper program other shortterm borrowings and floating rate debt we use a sensitivity analysis to estimate our shortterm interest rate risk for purposes of this analysis we estimate our shortterm interest rate risk as the difference between our actual interest expense for the period and estimated interest expense for the period assuming a hypothetical average of a one percent increase in the interest rates associated with our shortterm borrowings had interest rates associated with our shortterm borrowings outstanding during fiscal 2005 increased by an average of one percent our interest expense would have increased by approximately 04 million during 2005 

  we also assess market risk for our fixedrate longterm obligations we estimate market risk for our fixedrate longterm obligations as the potential increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical one percent decrease in interest rates associated with these debt instruments fair value is estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis assuming this one percent hypothetical decrease the fair value of our fixedrate longterm obligations outstanding as of september 30 2005 would have increased by approximately 1602 million 

  as of september 30 2005 we were not engaged in any other activities which would cause exposure to the risk of material earnings or cash flow loss due to changes in interest rates or market commodity prices

 item 1 business tableend overview   atmos energy corporation and its subsidiaries are engaged primarily in the natural gas utility business as well as other natural gas nonutility businesses as of september 30 2004 we distributed natural gas through sales and transportation arrangements to approximately 17 million residential commercial public authority and industrial customers through our six regulated utility divisions which covered service areas in 12 states our primary service areas are located in colorado kansas kentucky louisiana mississippi tennessee and texas we have more limited service areas in georgia illinois iowa missouri and virginia in addition we transport natural gas for others through our distribution system   through our nonutility businesses we provide natural gas management and marketing services to municipalities other local gas distribution companies and industrial customers in 18 states we own or hold an interest in natural gas storage fields in kentucky and louisiana that we use to supply natural gas to our customers txu gas acquisition   on october 1 2004 we completed our acquisition of the natural gas distribution and pipeline operations of txu gas company txu gas the txu gas operations we acquired are regulated businesses engaged in the purchase transmission distribution and sale of natural gas in the northcentral eastern and western parts of texas through these newly acquired operations we provide gas distribution services to approximately 15 million residential and business customers in texas including the dallas fort worth metropolitan area we also now own and operate a system consisting of 6162 miles of gas transmission and gathering lines and five underground storage reservoirs all within texas the txu gas acquisition makes us one of the largest publiclytraded companies in the united states whose primary business is the transmission and distribution of natural gas and the provision of related services it also makes us one of the largest intrastate pipeline operators in texas   the purchase price for the txu gas acquisition was approximately 1905 billion after preliminary closing adjustments which we paid in cash we acquired approximately 121 million of working capital of txu gas and did not assume any indebtedness of txu gas in connection with the acquisition txu gas provided for the repayment of all of its indebtedness and redeemed all of its preferred stock prior to closing and retained and agreed to pay certain other liabilities under the terms of the acquisition agreement the purchase price is subject to further adjustment sixty days after closing for the actual amount of working capital we acquired and other specified matters we anticipate that any postclosing purchase price adjustments will not be material   we funded the purchase price for the txu gas acquisition with approximately 2357 million in net proceeds from our offering of 9939393 shares of common stock which we completed on july 19 2004 and approximately 17 billion in net proceeds from our issuance on october 1 2004 of commercial paper backstopped by a senior unsecured revolving credit agreement which we entered into on september 24 2004 for bridge financing for the txu gas acquisition in october 2004 we paid off the commercial paper used to fund the acquisition through the issuance of senior unsecured notes on october 22 2004 which generated net proceeds of approximately 139 billion and the sale of 161 million shares of common stock on october 27 2004 which generated net proceeds of approximately 3825 million before other offering costs as a result of this refinancing we canceled the senior unsecured revolving bridge credit facility 1 operating segments   our operations are currently divided into three segments    financial information relating to our operating segments is contained in note 17 to the consolidated financial statements strategy   our overall strategy is to    over the last five years we have grown through several acquisitions including our acquisition in april 2001 of the remaining 55 percent interest in woodward marketing llc that we did not already own our acquisition in july 2001 of the assets of louisiana gas service company our acquisition in december 2002 of mississippi valley gas company and our acquisition in october 2004 of the natural gas distribution and pipeline operations of txu gas   we have experienced over 20 consecutive years of increasing dividends and earnings growth after giving effect to our acquisitions we have achieved this record of growth while operating our utility operations efficiently by managing our operating and maintenance expenses leveraging our technology such as our 24hour call center to achieve more efficient operations focusing on regulatory rate proceedings to increase revenue as our costs increase and mitigating weatherrelated risks through weathernormalized rates in many of our service areas additionally we have strengthened our nonutility business by ceasing speculative trading activities increasing gross profit margins and actively pursuing opportunities to increase the amount of storage available to us   our core values include focusing on our employees and customers while conducting our business with honesty and integrity we are strengthening our culture through ongoing communication with our employees and enhanced employee training utility segment overview   at september 30 2004 we operated our utility segment through the following six regulated natural gas utility divisions    on october 1 2004 we created the atmos energy midtex division which represents the txu gas natural gas distribution operations we acquired as well as the atmos pipeline — texas division which 2 represents the txu gas pipeline operations we acquired throughout this document we refer to the six regulated natural gas utility divisions we operated as of september 30 2004 as our historical operations 

  our natural gas utility distribution business is seasonal and dependent on weather conditions in our service areas gas sales to residential and commercial customers are greater during the winter months than during the remainder of the year the volumes of gas sales during the winter months will vary with the temperatures during these months the seasonal nature of our sales to residential and commercial customers is partially offset by our sales in the spring and summer months to our agricultural customers in texas colorado and kansas who use natural gas to operate irrigation equipment   in addition to weather our revenues are affected by the cost of natural gas and economic conditions in the areas that we serve higher gas costs which we are generally able to pass through to our customers under purchased gas adjustment clauses may cause customers to conserve or in the case of industrial customers to use alternative energy sources   the effect of weather that is above or below normal are partially offset through weather normalization adjustments or wna in certain of our service areas wna allows us to increase the base rate portion of customers’ bills when weather is warmer than normal and decrease the base rate when weather is colder than normal as of september 30 2004 we had or had received regulatory approvals for wna in the following service areas for the following periods which covered approximately 11 million of our meters in service     the txu gas operations we acquired do not have wna however their operations benefit from a rate structure that combines a monthly customer charge with a declining block rate schedule to mitigate the impact of warmerthannormal weather on revenue the combination of the monthly customer charge and the customer billing under the first block of the declining block rate schedule provides for the recovery of most of our fixed costs for such operations under most weather conditions   we receive gas deliveries for our six historical divisions through 37 pipeline transportation companies both interstate and intrastate to satisfy our natural gas needs the pipeline transportation agreements are firm and many of them have “pipeline nonotice” storage service which provides for daily balancing between system requirements and nominated flowing supplies these agreements have been negotiated with the shortest term necessary while still maintaining our right of first refusal   we purchase our gas supply for our six historical divisions from various producers and marketers supply arrangements are contracted on a firm basis with various terms at market prices the firm supply consists of both base load and swing supply quantities base load quantities are those that flow at a constant level throughout the month and swing supply quantities provide the flexibility to change daily quantities to match increases or decreases in requirements related to weather conditions except for local production purchases we select suppliers through a competitive bidding process by requesting proposals from suppliers that have demonstrated that they can provide reliable service we select these suppliers based on their ability to deliver gas supply to our designated firm pipeline receipt points at the lowest cost major suppliers for our historical operations during fiscal 2004 were anadarko energy services bp energy company chevrontexaco natural gas duke energy trading and marketing enbridge marketing us lp pioneer natural resources prior 3 energy corporation sempra energy trading corporation tenaska marketing and atmos energy marketing llc our natural gas marketing subsidiary we do not anticipate problems with obtaining additional gas supply as needed for our customers 

  the natural gas supply for our new midtex division formed from the txu gas operations we acquired is delivered by the natural gas transmission and storage operations that we also acquired in the txu gas acquisition this natural gas supply generally consists of a combination of base load peaking and spot purchase agreements as well as withdrawals of gas in storage held under gas storage capacity agreements we estimate that the gas demand for the midtex division for the upcoming winter heating season assuming normal weather conditions is approximately 1130 bcf we have existing purchase agreements to cover a total gas demand of up to approximately 1403 bcf consisting of approximately 405 bcf under base load purchase agreements up to approximately 472 bcf under peaking purchase agreements up to approximately 369 bcf under spot purchase agreements and approximately 157 bcf in storage we anticipate that by the end of november 2004 additional amounts of gas totaling up to approximately 139 bcf will be available under newly completed base load and peaking agreements and additional available gas in storage the mixture of base load peaking and spot purchase agreements coupled with the withdrawal of storage gas allows us the flexibility to adjust to changes in weather without requiring us to agree to excessive firm commitments we anticipate that the natural gas supply for the upcoming winter heating season will consist of in addition to withdrawals of gas in storage a variety of suppliers including independent producers marketers and pipeline companies   to maintain our deliveries to high priority customers we have the ability and have exercised our right to curtail deliveries to certain customers under the terms of interruptible contracts applicable state statutes or regulations our estimate of natural gas demand for our midtex division is not necessarily indicative of our ability to meet current or anticipated market demands or immediate delivery requirements because of factors such as the physical limitations of gathering storage and transmission systems the duration and severity of cold weather the availability of gas reserves from our suppliers the ability to purchase additional supplies on a shortterm basis and actions by federal and state regulatory authorities curtailment rights provide us flexibility to meet the humanneeds requirements of our customers on a firm basis priority allocations imposed by federal and state regulatory agencies as well as other factors beyond our control may affect our ability to meet the demands of our customers   we also contract for storage service in underground storage facilities on many of the interstate pipelines serving us   we estimate the peakday availability of natural gas supply from longterm contracts shortterm contracts and withdrawals from underground storage to be approximately 42 bcf including approximately 22 bcf associated with the txu gas operations we acquired the peakday demand for our historical operations in fiscal 2004 was on january 6 2004 when sales to customers reached approximately 18 bcf the peakday demand for the txu gas operations in the 12 months ended september 30 2004 was also on january 6 2004 when sales to customers reached approximately 16 bcf   the following is a brief description of our six natural gas utility divisions as well as the midtex division acquired in october 2004 additional information for our six natural gas utility divisions we operated at september 30 2004 is presented under the caption “operating statistics”   atmos energy coloradokansas division our coloradokansas division operates in colorado kansas and the southwestern corner of missouri and is regulated by each respective state’s public service commission with respect to accounting rates and charges operating matters and the issuance of securities we operate under terms of nonexclusive franchises granted by the various cities in may 2003 we

cost savings achieved when compared to predetermined benchmarks our rates are also subject to wna the kentucky division’s gas supply is delivered primarily by texas gas transmission llc tennessee gas pipeline company trunkline gas company and midwestern pipeline   atmos energy louisiana division our louisiana division operates in louisiana and includes the operations of the assets of louisiana gas service company acquired in july 2001 and our previously existing trans la division our louisiana division is regulated by the louisiana public service commission which regulates utility services rates and other matters we operate most of our service areas pursuant to a nonexclusive franchise granted by the governing authority of each area direct sales of natural gas to industrial customers in louisiana who use gas for fuel or in manufacturing processes and sales of natural gas for vehicle fuel are exempt from regulation and are recognized in our natural gas marketing segment louisiana intrastate gas company acadian pipeline trans louisiana gas pipeline inc gulf south and texas gas transmission llc pipelines provide most of the louisiana division’s natural gas requirements   atmos energy midstates division our midstates division operates in georgia illinois iowa missouri tennessee and virginia in each of these states our rates services and operations as a natural gas distribution company are subject to general regulation by each state’s public service commission we operate in each community where necessary under a franchise granted by the municipality for a fixed

original jurisdiction over all utility rates operations and services within its city limits except with respect to sales of natural gas for vehicle fuel and agricultural use we operate pursuant to nonexclusive franchises granted by the municipalities we serve which are subject to renewal from time to time the railroad commission of texas has exclusive appellate jurisdiction over all rate and regulatory orders and ordinances of the municipalities and exclusive original jurisdiction over rates and services to customers not located within the limits of a municipality during 2004 the west texas division received approval from the city of lubbock texas and the 66 cities in our west texas system for wna in these service areas which will be effective october through may of each year beginning with the 20042005 winter heating season we also have wna in our amarillo service area our west texas division receives transportation service from oneok pipeline in addition the west texas division purchases a significant portion of its natural gas supply from pioneer natural resources which is connected directly to our amarillo texas distribution system   mississippi valley gas company division our mississippi valley gas company division acquired in december 2002 operates in mississippi and is regulated by the mississippi public service commission with respect to rates services and operations we operate under nonexclusive franchises granted by the municipalities we serve since the acquisition we have been operating under a rate structure that allows us over a fiveyear period to recover a portion of our integration costs associated with the acquisition and operations and maintenance costs in excess of an agreedupon benchmark in addition we are required to file for rate adjustments based on our expenses every six months we also have wna in mississippi this division’s gas supply is delivered by gulf south pipeline company tennessee gas pipeline company southern natural gas company texas eastern transmission texas gas transmission llc trunkline gas co llc and enbridge marketing lp 5   atmos energy midtex division our midtex division which represents the assets and operations that we acquired from txu gas on october 1 2004 includes natural gas distribution operations that operate in the northcentral eastern and western parts of texas and natural gas transmission and storage operations this division purchases distributes and sells natural gas to approximately 15 million residential and business customers in approximately 550 cities and towns including the 11county dallas fort worth metropolitan area under a may 2004 rate filing this division operates under a systemwide rate jurisdiction with the pipeline operations we acquired in the acquisition similar to our west texas division the governing body of each municipality served through this division has original jurisdiction over all utility rates operations and services within its city limits except with respect to sales of natural gas for vehicle fuel and agricultural use we operate pursuant to nonexclusive franchises granted by the municipalities we serve which are subject to renewal from time to time the texas railroad commission has exclusive appellate jurisdiction over all rate and regulatory orders and ordinances of the municipalities and exclusive original jurisdiction over rates and services to customers not located within the limits of a municipality this division does not have wna however our operations benefit from a rate structure that mitigates the impact of warmerthannormal weather on revenue the majority of this division’s residential and business customers use natural gas for heating and their needs are directly affected by the mildness or severity of the heating season   the natural gas transmission and storage operations that we acquired in the txu gas acquisition which will be operated in the atmos pipeline — texas division also transport natural gas to third parties and represent one of the largest intrastate pipeline operations in texas these operations include interconnected natural gas transmission lines five underground storage reservoirs including a salt dome facility 24 compressor stations and related properties all within texas these operations may create additional gas marketing and other opportunities for our nonregulated subsidiaries   the gas distribution and transmission lines we acquired have been constructed over lands of others pursuant to easements or along public highways streets and rightsofway as permitted by law in addition to being heavily concentrated in the established natural gasproducing areas of central northern and eastern texas the intrastate pipeline system we acquired also extends into or near the major producing areas of the texas gulf coast and the delaware and val verde basins of west texas nine basins located in texas are estimated to contain a substantial portion of the nation’s remaining onshore natural gas reserves this pipeline system provides access to all of these basins we believe that we are well situated to receive large volumes into this pipeline system at the major hubs such as katy waha and carthage as well as from storage facilities where we maintain high delivery capabilities   at closing of the acquisition txu gas and some of its affiliates entered into transitional services agreements with us to provide call center meter reading customer billing collections information reporting software accounting treasury administrative and other services to the midtex division the initial term of each of these agreements will expire on october 1 2005 any particular service may be terminated during the initial term on 90 days notice except for call center customer billing collections information reporting administrative and other services provided under our agreement with txu gas which may not be terminated during the initial term after the initial term all of the service agreements continue on a monthtomonth basis until canceled by either party with at least 30 days prior written notice in addition we have an option to extend the business services provided during the initial term by txu gas for a period of six months beyond the initial term so long as we exercise our option at least 120 days before the expiration of the initial term the agreements require us to pay the service providers’ costs for the services   however on november 4 2004 we entered into an agreement with capgemini energy lp pursuant to which we will assume the operations of the waco texas call center on april 1 2005 and will close the purchase of the related assets on october 1 2005 in connection therewith all call center services provided by txu gas under the transitional services agreement will terminate on april 1 2005   also at closing we entered into a transitional access agreement with txu gas and some of its affiliates in order to allow the parties the same level of access to certain properties facilities software applications and other items that they were provided prior to the closing the initial term of this agreement also expires on 6 october 1 2005 and the agreement also continues on a monthtomonth basis thereafter until canceled by either party with at least 30 days prior written notice 

  in connection with the txu gas acquisition we acquired the franchises held by txu gas to provide natural gas utility services to cities towns and other municipalities in texas as part of the txu gas acquisition we determined on the basis of representations and warranties in the acquisition agreement and our diligence that we needed the consent of two such cities for the acquisition of their franchises and we received the necessary consents prior to closing however we have received letters from two other cities including the city of dallas raising the issue of whether under the terms of their franchises we should have also obtained their consents we are currently in discussions with the city of dallas on this issue as these discussions are at an early stage we cannot predict the outcome but one alternative suggested by the city of dallas is that we consider renewing our nonexclusive franchise with the city of dallas prior to its 2009 expiration date we do not currently know what changes if any the city of dallas might propose in the terms of the franchise were we to agree to an early renewal or whether the city of dallas will take other action with respect to the franchise were we not to do so however we believe that the costs to us associated with a renewal would not be material we have not received any similar inquiries from other cities towns or municipalities but we cannot be certain that we will not receive similar inquiries in the future natural gas marketing segment overview   our natural gas marketing and other nonutility segments which are organized under atmos energy holdings inc aeh have operations in 18 states through september 30 2003 atmos energy marketing llc together with its whollyowned subsidiaries woodward marketing llc and trans louisiana industrial gas company inc comprised our natural gas marketing segment effective october 1 2003 our natural gas marketing segment was reorganized the operations of atmos energy marketing llc and trans louisiana industrial gas company inc were merged into woodward marketing llc which was renamed atmos energy marketing llc aem   we acquired a 45 percent interest in woodward marketing llc in july 1997 as a result of the merger of atmos and united cities gas company which had acquired that interest in may 1995 in april 2001 we acquired the remaining 55 percent interest that we did not own for 1423193 restricted shares of our common stock   aem provides a variety of natural gas management services to municipalities natural gas utility systems and industrial natural gas consumers primarily in the southeastern and midwestern states and to our kentucky louisiana and midstates divisions these services primarily consist of furnishing natural gas supplies at fixed and marketbased prices contract negotiation and administration load forecasting gas storage acquisition and management services transportation services peaking sales and balancing services capacity utilization strategies and gas price management through the use of derivative products we use proprietary and customerowned transportation and storage assets to provide the various services our customers’ request as a result our revenues arise from the types of commercial transactions we have structured with our customers and include the value we extract by optimizing the storage and transportation capacity we own or control as well as revenues for services we deliver   we participate in transactions in which we combine the natural gas commodity and transportation costs to minimize our costs incurred to serve our customers additionally we participate in natural gas storage transactions in which we seek to capture the pricing differences that occur over time we purchase or sell physical natural gas and then sell or purchase financial contracts at a price sufficient to cover our carrying costs and provide a gross profit margin through the use of transportation and storage services and derivatives we are able to capture gross profit margin through the arbitrage of pricing differences in various locations and by recognizing pricing differences that occur over time   aem’s management of natural gas requirements involves the sale of natural gas and the management of storage and transportation supplies under contracts with customers generally having one to two year terms at september 30 2004 atmos energy marketing had a total of 638 industrial customers and 80 municipal customers atmos energy marketing also sells natural gas to some of its industrial customers on a delivered burner tip basis under contract terms from 30 days to two years 7 other nonutility segment overview   our other nonutility segment consists primarily of the operations of atmos pipeline and storage llc and atmos energy services llc which are whollyowned by our subsidiary atmos energy holdings inc through atmos pipeline and storage we own or have an interest in underground storage fields in kentucky and louisiana atmos pipeline and storage’s underground storage fields in kansas were transferred to our atmos energy coloradokansas utility division during fiscal 2004 atmos pipeline and storage provides storage services to our customers and captures pricing arbitrage through the use of derivatives we also use these storage facilities to reduce the need to contract for additional pipeline capacity to meet customer demand during peak periods   through atmos energy services we provide natural gas management services to our utility operations prior to the second quarter of fiscal 2004 this entity conducted limited operations however beginning april 1 2004 atmos energy services began providing natural gas supply management services to our utility operations in a limited number of states these services include aggregating and purchasing gas supply arranging transportation and storage logistics and ultimately delivering the gas to our utility service areas at competitive prices we have expanded these services to substantially all of our utility service areas as of the end of fiscal 2004   through january 20 2004 united cities propane gas

  notes to preceding tables  12 ratemaking activity 

 

   the method of determining regulated rates varies among the states in which our natural gas utility divisions operate the regulators have the responsibility of ensuring that utilities under their jurisdictions operate in the best interests of customers while providing utility companies the opportunity to earn a reasonable return on investment in a general rate case the applicable regulatory authority establishes rates which allow a utility company an opportunity to collect revenue from customers to recover the cost of providing utility service   generally the regulatory authority reviews our rate request and establishes a rate structure intended to generate revenue sufficient to cover our costs of doing business and provide a reasonable return on invested capital   rates established by regulatory authorities are adjusted for increases and decreases in our purchased gas cost through purchased gas adjustment mechanisms purchased gas adjustment mechanisms provide gas utility companies a method of recovering purchased gas costs on an ongoing basis without filing a rate case to address all of the utility’s nongas costs these mechanisms are commonly utilized when regulatory authorities recognize a particular type of expense such as purchased gas costs that i is subject to significant price fluctuations compared to the utility’s other costs ii represents a large component of the utility’s cost of service and iii is generally outside the control of the gas utility there is no gross profit generated through purchased gas adjustments but they do provide a dollarfordollar offset to increases or decreases in utility gas costs although substantially all of our utility sales to our customers fluctuate with the cost of gas that we purchase utility gross profit which is defined as operating revenues less purchased gas cost is generally not affected by fluctuations in the cost of gas due to the purchased gas adjustment mechanism additionally certain jurisdictions have introduced performancebased ratemaking adjustments to provide incentives to natural gas utilities to minimize purchased gas costs through improved storage management and use of financial hedges to lock in gas costs under the performancebased ratemaking adjustment purchased gas costs savings are shared between the utility and its customers   the following table summarizes certain information regarding our historical ratemaking jurisdictions this table does not summarize the ratemaking activities of the midtex division we acquired on october 1 2004   13

   the statements contained in this annual report on form 10k may contain “forwardlooking statements” within the meaning of section 21e of the securities exchange act of 1934 all statements other than statements of historical fact included in this report are forwardlooking statements made in good faith by the company and are intended to qualify for the safe harbor from liability established by the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 when used in this report or any other of the company’s documents or oral presentations the words “anticipate” “believe” “expect” “estimate” “forecast” “goal” “intend” “objective” “plan” “projection” “seek” “strategy” or similar words are intended to identify forwardlooking statements such forwardlooking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the statements relating to the company’s strategy operations markets services rates recovery of costs availability of gas supply and other factors these risks and uncertainties include the following adverse weather conditions such as warmer than normal weather in the company’s utility service territories or colder than normal weather that could adversely affect our natural gas marketing activities regulatory trends and decisions including deregulation initiatives and the impact of rate proceedings before various state regulatory commissions market risks beyond our control affecting our risk management activities including market liquidity commodity price volatility and counterparty creditworthiness national regional and local economic conditions the company’s ability to continue to access the capital markets the effects of inflation and changes in the availability and prices of natural gas including the volatility of natural gas prices increased competition from energy suppliers and alternative forms of energy risks relating to the acquisition of the txu gas operations including without limitation the company’s increased indebtedness resulting from the acquisition and the successful integration of the txu gas operations and other uncertainties discussed herein all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond the control of the company accordingly while the company believes these forwardlooking statements to be reasonable there can be no assurance that they will approximate actual experience or that the expectations derived from them will be realized further the company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any of its forwardlooking statements whether as a result of new information future events or otherwise factors that may affect our future performance   our performance in the future will primarily depend on the results of our utility and natural gas marketing operations several factors exist that could influence our future financial performance some of which are described below they should be considered in connection with evaluating forwardlooking statements contained in this report or otherwise made by or on behalf of us since these factors could cause actual results and conditions to differ materially from those set out in these forwardlooking statements 

 

   weather is one of the most significant factors influencing our performance our natural gas utility sales volumes and related revenues are correlated with heating requirements that result from cold winter weather our agricultural sales volumes are associated with the rainfall levels during the growing season in our west texas irrigation market however weather normalized rates in effect in several of our jurisdictions should 27 mitigate the adverse effects of warmer than normal weather on our utility operating results finally sustained cold weather could adversely affect our natural gas marketing operations as we may be required to purchase gas at spot rates in a rising market to obtain sufficient volumes to fulfill some customer contracts 

 

   our natural gas utility business is subject to various regulated returns on its rate base in each of the 12 states in which we operate we monitor the allowed rates of return our effectiveness in earning such rates and initiate rate proceedings or operating changes as needed in addition in the normal course of the regulatory environment assets are placed in service and historical test periods are established before rate cases can be filed once rate cases are filed regulatory bodies have the authority to suspend implementation of the new rates while studying the cases because of this process we must temporarily suffer the negative financial effects of having placed assets in service without the benefit of rate relief which is commonly referred to as “regulatory lag” in addition our debt and equity financing programs are also subject to approval by regulatory bodies in certain states which could limit our ability to take advantage of favorable shortterm market conditions   our business could also be affected by deregulation initiatives including the development of unbundling initiatives in the natural gas industry unbundling is the separation of the provision and pricing of local distribution gas services into discrete components it typically focuses on the separation of the distribution and gas supply components and the resulting opening of the regulated components of sales services to alternative unregulated suppliers of those services because of our enhanced technology and distribution system infrastructures we believe that we are now positively positioned as unbundling evolves consequently we expect there would be no significant adverse effect on our business should unbundling or further deregulation of the natural gas distribution service business occur   finally contractual limitations could adversely affect our ability to withdraw gas from storage which could cause us to purchase gas at spot prices in a rising market to obtain sufficient volumes to fulfill customer contracts we seek to minimize this risk by increasing our storage capacity and enhancing the flexibility of our natural gas marketing contracts 

 

   our risk management operations in our natural gas marketing segment are subject to market risks beyond our control including market liquidity commodity price volatility and counterparty creditworthiness market liquidity is affected by the number of trading partners in the market   although we maintain a risk management control policy we may not be able to completely offset the price risk associated with volatile gas prices or the risk in our gas trading activities which could lead to financial losses physical trading also introduces price risk on any net open positions at the end of each trading day as well as a risk of loss resulting from intraday fluctuations of gas prices and the potential for daily price movements between the time natural gas is purchased or sold for future delivery and the time the related purchase or sale is hedged although we manage our business to maintain no open positions at times limited net open positions related to our physical storage may occur on a shortterm basis the determination of our net open position as of any day requires us to make assumptions as to future circumstances including the use of gas by our customers in relation to our anticipated storage and market positions because the price risk associated with any net open position at the end of each day may increase if the assumptions are not realized we review these assumptions as part of our daily monitoring activities net open positions may result in an adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations if market prices move in an unfavorable manner   our utility segment uses a combination of storage and financial hedges to partially insulate us against volatility in gas prices and to help moderate the effects of higher customer accounts receivable caused by higher gas prices our natural gas marketing segment manages margins and limits risk exposure on the sale of 28 natural gas inventory or the offsetting fixedprice purchase or sale commitments for physical quantities of natural gas through the use of a variety of financial derivatives 

  we could realize financial losses on these activities as a result of volatility in the market value of the underlying commodities or if a counterparty fails to perform under a contract   further the use of financial instruments to conduct our hedging and market risk activities subjects us to counterparty risk adverse changes in the creditworthiness of our counterparties could limit the level of trading activities with these parties and increase the risk that these parties may not perform under a contract we believe this risk is mitigated due to the large number of counterparties used in our risk management activities   our net periodic pension and other postretirement costs are subject to market risk as the fluctuation in the fair value of the assets used to fund our various benefit plans could lead to significant fluctuations in these costs   finally we are subject to interest rate risk on our commercial paper borrowings and the floating rate debt we issued in october 2004 to fund the txu gas acquisition we could experience higher interest expense if interest rates increase or increased volatility if shortterm interest rates become volatile 

 

   our operations are affected by the conditions and overall strength of the national regional and local economies including interest rates changes in the capital markets and increases in the costs of our primary commodity natural gas these factors impact the amount of residential industrial and commercial growth in our service territories additionally these factors could adversely impact our customer collections   further aem’s operations are concentrated in the natural gas industry and its customers and suppliers may be subject to economic risks affecting that industry 

 

   we rely upon access to both shortterm and longterm capital markets as a source of liquidity to satisfy our liquidity requirements although we believe we will maintain sufficient access to these financial markets adverse changes in the economy the overall health of the industries in which we operate the increase in our indebtedness after the txu gas acquisition and changes to our credit ratings could limit access to these markets and restrict the execution of our business plan 

 

   inflation has caused increases in certain operating expenses and has required assets to be replaced at higher costs we have a process in place to continually review the adequacy of our utility gas rates in relation to the increasing cost of providing service and the inherent regulatory lag in adjusting those gas rates historically we have been able to budget and control operating expenses and investments within the amounts authorized to be collected in rates and intend to continue to do so the ability to control expenses is an important factor that will influence future results   the rapid increases in the price of purchased gas which has occurred in some prior years causes us to experience a significant increase in shortterm debt because we must pay suppliers for gas when it is purchased which can be significantly in advance of when these costs may be recovered through the collection of monthly customer bills for gas delivered increases in purchased gas costs also slow our utility collection efforts as customers are more likely to delay the payment of their gas bills leading to higher than normal accounts receivable this situation also results in higher shortterm debt levels and increased bad debt expense should the price of purchased gas increase significantly in the upcoming heating season we would expect increases in our shortterm debt accounts receivable and bad debt expense during fiscal 2005 29   finally higher costs of natural gas in recent years have already caused many of our utility customers to conserve in the use of our gas services and could lead to even more customers utilizing such conservation methods 

 

   we are facing increased competition from other energy suppliers as well as electric companies and from energy marketing and trading companies in the case of industrial customers such as manufacturing plants and agricultural customers adverse economic conditions including higher gas costs could cause these customers to use alternative sources of energy such as electricity or bypass our systems in favor of special competitive contracts with lower perunit costs risks relating to the acquisition of the txu gas operations   in addition to the factors affecting our company and our industry the risks outlined below relating to the txu gas acquisition could also adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

 

   on october 22 2004 we issued senior unsecured notes which generated net proceeds of approximately 139 billion on october 27 2004 we sold 161 million shares of common stock which generated net proceeds of approximately 3825 million before other offering costs these financings were used to pay off the commercial paper that was issued to fund the txu gas acquisition assuming these financings had occurred on september 30 2004 our total debt as of september 30 2004 would have increased from 8672 million to 23 billion and our ratio of total debt to capitalization including shortterm debt and current maturities of longterm debt as of september 30 2004 would have increased from 433 percent to 598 percent our ratio of total debt to capitalization is expected to be greater during the current winter heating season as we make additional shortterm borrowings to fund natural gas purchases and meet our working capital requirements we also increased our working capital facility from 3500 million to 6000 million on october 22 2004 to meet our increased working capital requirements as a result of the txu gas acquisition this increase in our indebtedness could limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business or economic conditions   our longterm debt is currently rated as “investment grade” by standard  poor’s corporation moody’s investors service and fitch ratings inc the three credit rating agencies that rate our longterm debt securities there can be no assurance that these rating agencies will maintain investment grade ratings for our longterm debt if we were to lose our investmentgrade rating the commercial paper markets and the commodity derivatives markets could become unavailable to us this would increase our borrowing costs for working capital and reduce the borrowing capacity of our gas marketing affiliate in addition if our commercial paper ratings were lowered it would increase the cost of commercial paper financing and could reduce or eliminate our ability to access the commercial paper markets if we are unable to issue commercial paper we intend to borrow under our bank credit facilities to meet our working capital needs this would increase the cost of our working capital financing 

 

   the txu gas acquisition is larger than any of the nine other acquisitions we have made since 1986 in addition to operating the natural gas distribution system we acquired in the txu gas acquisition we will manage pipeline operations on a scale greater than in the past as a consequence we may experience the need for additional management attention and resources we may be required to develop relationships with additional regulatory authorities in the service areas of the txu gas operations we acquired or we may face unanticipated challenges or delays in integrating the txu gas operations we acquired into our business in addition employees important to the txu gas operations we acquired may decide not to continue employment with us if these events occur the acquired operations may not achieve the results or otherwise perform as expected 30 

 

   the financial results of the txu gas operations we acquired are subject to many of the same factors that have historically affected our financial condition and results of operations including weather sensitivity extensive federal state and local regulation increasing gas costs competition market risks and national regional and local economic conditions   in addition the txu gas distribution operations we acquired do not have weathernormalized rates this means we will not be able to increase customers’ bills to offset lower gas usage when the weather is warmer than normal however their operations benefit from a rate structure that combines a monthly customer charge with a declining block rate schedule to mitigate the impact of warmerthannormal weather on revenue the combination of the monthly customer charge and the customer billing under the first block of the declining block rate schedule provides for the recovery of most of our fixed costs for such operations under most weather conditions as a result the financial results for the txu gas operations we acquired may be adversely affected in the event of a warmerthannormal heating season   the txu gas transmission operations we acquired include interconnected natural gas transmission lines underground storage reservoirs compressor stations and related properties within texas the operation of these transmission facilities also involves risks these include the possibility of breakdown or failure of equipment or pipelines the impact of unusual or adverse weather conditions or other natural events and the risk of performance below expected levels of throughput or efficiency breakdown or reduced performance of a transmission facility may prevent the facility from performing under applicable sales agreements which in certain situations could result in termination of those agreements or incurring a liability for liquidated damages insurance warranties indemnities or performance guarantees may not cover any or all of the liquidated damages lost revenues or increased expenses associated with a breakdown or reduction in performance of a transmission facility if we are unsuccessful in managing these risks our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 

 

   the diligence conducted in connection with the txu gas acquisition and the indemnification provided in the acquisition agreement may not be sufficient to protect us from or compensate us for all losses resulting from the acquisition or txu gas’s prior operations for example under the terms of the acquisition agreement the first 15 million of many indemnifiable losses are to be borne by us and the agreement provides for sharing of losses with respect to unknown environmental matters that may affect the assets we acquired after we have borne 10 million in costs relating to such matters in addition under the terms of the acquisition agreement the maximum aggregate amount of such losses for which txu gas will indemnify us is approximately 1925 million a material loss associated with the txu gas acquisition for which there is not adequate indemnification could negatively affect our results of operations our financial condition and our reputation in the industry and reduce the anticipated benefits of the acquisition 

 

   we may not be aware of all of the risks associated with the txu gas acquisition any discovery of adverse information concerning the assets or operations we acquired could be material and in many cases would be subject to only limited rights of recovery in addition we will likely have to make capital expenditures which may be significant but which amount has not been fixed to enhance or integrate the assets and operations we acquired overview  31  critical accounting policies and estimates   our consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and the related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities we based our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates including those related to risk management and trading activities allowance for doubtful accounts legal and environmental accruals insurance accruals pension and postretirement obligations deferred income taxes and the valuation of goodwill indefinitelived intangible assets and other longlived assets our critical accounting policies are reviewed by the audit committee on a quarterly basis actual results may differ from estimates   regulation  — our utility operations are subject to regulation with respect to rates service maintenance of accounting records and various other matters by the respective regulatory authorities in the states in which we operate our regulated utility operations are accounted for in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas 71 accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation this 32 statement requires costbased rateregulated entities that meet certain criteria to reflect the financial effects of the ratemaking and accounting practices and policies of the various regulatory commissions in their financial statements we record regulatory assets for costs that have been deferred for which future recovery through customer rates is considered probable regulatory liabilities are recorded when it is probable that revenues will be reduced for amounts that will be credited to customers through the ratemaking process as a result certain costs that would normally be expensed under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states are permitted to be capitalized because they can be recovered through rates further regulation may impact the period in which revenues or expenses are recognized the amounts to be recovered or recognized are based upon historical experience and our understanding of the regulations the impact of regulation on our utility operations may be affected by decisions of the regulatory authorities or the issuance of new regulations 

  revenue recognition  — sales of natural gas to our utility customers are billed on a monthly cycle basis however the billing cycle periods for certain classes of customers do not necessarily coincide with accounting periods used for financial reporting purposes we follow the revenue accrual method of accounting for utility segment revenues whereby revenues applicable to gas delivered to customers but not yet billed under the cycle billing method are estimated and accrued and the related costs are charged to expense   rates established by regulatory authorities are adjusted for increases and decreases in our purchased gas cost through purchased gas adjustment mechanisms purchased gas adjustment mechanisms provide gas utility companies a method of recovering purchased gas costs on an ongoing basis without filing a rate case to address all of the utility’s nongas costs these mechanisms are commonly utilized when regulatory authorities recognize a particular type of expense such as purchased gas costs that i is subject to significant price fluctuations compared to the utility’s other costs ii represents a large component of the utility’s cost of service and iii is generally outside the control of the gas utility there is no gross profit generated through purchased gas adjustments but they do provide a dollarfordollar offset to increases or decreases in utility gas costs although substantially all of our utility sales to our customers fluctuate with the cost of gas that we purchase utility gross profit is generally not affected by fluctuations in the cost of gas due to the purchased gas adjustment mechanism the effects of these purchased gas adjustment mechanisms are recorded as deferred gas costs on our balance sheet   energy trading contracts resulting in the delivery of a commodity where we are the principal in the transaction are recorded as natural gas marketing sales or purchases at the time of physical delivery realized gains and losses from the settlement of financial instruments that do not result in physical delivery related to our natural gas marketing energy trading contracts and unrealized gains and losses from changes in the market value of open contracts are included as a component of natural gas marketing revenues   allowance for doubtful accounts  — for the majority of our receivables we establish an allowance for doubtful accounts based on our collections experience on certain other receivables where we are aware of a specific customer’s inability or reluctance to pay we record an allowance for doubtful accounts against amounts due to reduce the net receivable balance to the amount we reasonably expect to collect however if circumstances change our estimate of the recoverability of accounts receivable could be different circumstances which could affect our estimates include but are not limited to customer credit issues the level of natural gas prices and general economic conditions   derivatives and hedging activities  — in our utility segment we use a combination of storage and financial derivatives to partially insulate us and our natural gas utility customers against gas price volatility during the winter heating season the financial derivatives we use in our utility segment are accounted for under the marktomarket method pursuant to sfas 133 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities changes in the valuation of these derivatives primarily result from changes in the valuation of the portfolio of contracts maturity and settlement of contracts and newly originated transactions however because the costs of financial derivatives used in our utility segment will ultimately be recovered through our rates current period changes in the assets and liabilities from these risk management activities are recorded as a component of deferred gas costs in accordance with sfas 71 accordingly there is no earnings impact to our utility segment as a result of the use of financial derivatives the changes in the assets and liabilities from 33 risk management activities are recognized in purchased gas cost in the income statement when the related costs are recovered through our rates 

  our natural gas marketing risk management activities are conducted through aem aem is exposed to risks associated with changes in the market price of natural gas which we manage through a combination of storage and financial derivatives including futures overthecounter and exchangetraded options and swap contracts with counterparties option contracts provide the right but not the requirement to buy or sell the commodity at a fixed price swap contracts require receipt of payment for the commodity based on the difference between a fixed price and the market price on the settlement date the use of these contracts is subject to our risk management policies which are monitored for compliance on a daily basis   we participate in transactions in which we combine the natural gas commodity and transportation costs to minimize our costs incurred to serve our customers additionally we engage in natural gas storage transactions in which we seek to find and profit from pricing differences that occur over time we purchase or sell physical natural gas and then sell or purchase financial contracts at a price sufficient to cover our carrying costs and provide a gross profit margin through the use of transportation and storage services and derivatives we are able to capture gross profit margin through the arbitrage of pricing differences in various locations and by recognizing pricing differences that occur over time   under sfas 133 natural gas inventory is the hedged item in a fairvalue hedge and is marked to market on a monthly basis using the inside ferc iferc price at the end of each month changes in fair value are recognized as unrealized gains and losses in the period of change costs to store the gas are recognized in the period the costs are incurred we recognize revenue and the carrying value of the inventory as an associated purchased gas cost in our consolidated statement of income when we sell the gas and deliver it out of the storage facility   derivatives associated with our natural gas inventory are marked to market each month based upon the nymex price with changes in fair value recognized as unrealized gains and losses in the period of change the difference in the indices used to mark to market our physical inventory iferc and the related fairvalue hedge nymex is reported as a component of revenue and can result in volatility in our reported net income over time gains and losses on the sale of storage gas inventory will be offset by gains and losses on the fairvalue hedges resulting in the realization of the economic gross profit margin we anticipated at the time we structured the original transaction in addition we continually manage our positions to optimize value as market conditions and other circumstances change   similar to our inventory position we attempt to mitigate substantially all of the commodity price risk associated with our fixedprice contracts with minimum volume requirements through the use of various offsetting derivatives prior to april 1 2004 these derivatives were not designated as hedges under sfas 133 because they naturally locked in the economic gross profit margin at the time we entered into the contract the fixedprice forward and offsetting derivative contracts were marked to market each month with changes in fair value recognized as unrealized gains and losses recorded in revenue in our consolidated statement of income the unrealized gains and losses were realized as a component of revenue in the period in which we fulfilled the requirements of the fixedprice contract and the derivatives settled to the extent that the unrealized gains and losses of the fixedprice forward contracts and the offsetting derivatives did not offset exactly our earnings experienced some volatility at delivery the gains and losses on the fixedprice contracts were offset by gains and losses on the derivatives resulting in the realization of the economic gross profit margin we anticipated at the time we structured the original transaction in addition we continually manage our positions to optimize value as market conditions and other circumstances change   effective april 1 2004 we elected to treat our fixedprice forward contracts as normal purchases and sales as a result we ceased marking the fixedprice forward contracts to market we designated the offsetting derivative contracts as cash flow hedges of anticipated transactions as a result of this change unrealized gains and losses on these open derivative contracts are now recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income and are recognized in earnings as a component of revenue when the hedged volumes are sold this designation is expected to partially reduce the amount of volatility in our consolidated income 34 statement and better reflect the economics of this type of transaction hedge ineffectiveness to the extent incurred is reported as a component of revenue 

  during fiscal 2004 we entered into four treasury lock agreements to fix the treasury yield component of the interest cost of financing associated with the anticipated issuance of 875 million of longterm debt we designated these treasury lock agreements as cash flow hedges of an anticipated transaction accordingly to the extent effective unrealized gains and losses associated with the treasury lock agreements are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income unrealized gains are recorded when interest rates increase and unrealized losses are recorded when interest rates decline these treasury lock agreements were terminated in october 2004 and the 438 million unrealized loss will be recognized as a component of interest expense over the life of the related financing arrangement   the fair value of our financial derivatives is determined through a combination of prices actively quoted on national exchanges prices provided by other external sources and prices based on models and other valuation methods changes in the valuation of our financial derivatives primarily result from changes in market prices the valuation of the portfolio of our contracts maturity and settlement of these contracts and newly originated transactions each of which directly affect the estimated fair value of our derivatives we believe the market prices and models used to value these derivatives represent the best information available with respect to closing exchange and overthecounter quotations time value and volatility factors underlying the contracts values are adjusted to reflect the potential impact of an orderly liquidation of our positions over a reasonable period of time under present market conditions   impairment assessments  — we perform impairment assessments of our goodwill intangible assets subject to amortization and longlived assets we currently have no indefinitelived intangible assets we annually evaluate our goodwill balances for impairment during our second fiscal quarter or as impairment indicators arise we use a present value technique based on discounted cash flows to estimate the fair value of our reporting units our reporting units and our operating segments are the same as each operating unit represents a component of our business goodwill is allocated to the reporting units responsible for the acquisition that gave rise to the goodwill   the discounted cash flow calculations used to assess goodwill impairment are dependent on several subjective factors including the timing of future cash flows future growth rates and the discount rate an impairment charge is recognized if the carrying value of a reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds its fair value   we periodically evaluate whether events or circumstances have occurred that indicate that our intangible assets subject to amortization and other longlived assets may not be recoverable or that the remaining useful life may warrant revision when such events or circumstances are present we assess the recoverability of these assets by determining whether the carrying value will be recovered through expected future cash flows these cash flow projections consider various factors such as the timing of the future cash flows and the discount rate and are based upon the best information available at the time the estimate is made changes in these factors could materially affect the cash flow projections and result in the recognition of an impairment charge an impairment charge is recognized as the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value if the sum of the undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying value of the related asset   pension and other postretirement plans  — pension and other postretirement plan expenses and liabilities are determined on an actuarial basis and are affected by the market value of plan assets estimates of the expected return on plan assets and assumed discount rates and demographic data the assumed return on plan assets is based on management’s expectation of the longterm return on the portfolio of plan assets the discount rate used to compute the present value of plan liabilities generally is based on rates of high grade corporate bonds with maturities similar to the average period over which benefits will be paid actual changes in the fair market value of plan assets and differences between the actual return on plan assets and the expected return on plan assets could have a material effect on the amount of pension expense ultimately recognized 35 results of operations   the following table presents our financial highlights for the three fiscal years ended september 30 2004   36   the following table shows our operating income by utility division and by segment for the three fiscal years ended september 30 2004 the presentation of our utility operating income is included for financial reporting purposes and may not reflect operating income for ratemaking purposes   year ended september 30 2004 compared with year ended september 30 2003 

 

   our utility segment has historically contributed 70 to 85 percent of our consolidated net income the primary factors that impact the results of our utility operations are seasonal weather patterns competitive factors in the energy industry and economic conditions in our service areas natural gas sales to residential commercial and publicauthority customers are affected by winter heating season requirements this generally results in higher operating revenues and net income during the period from october through march of each year and lower operating revenues and either lower net income or net losses during the period from april through september of each year accordingly our second fiscal quarter has historically been our most critical earnings quarter with an average of approximately 68 percent of our consolidated net income having been earned in the second quarter during the three most recently completed fiscal years utility sales to industrial customers are much less weather sensitive utility sales to agricultural customers which typically use natural gas to power irrigation pumps during the period from march through september are primarily affected by rainfall amounts and the price of natural gas   changes in the cost of gas impact revenue but do not directly affect our gross profit from utility operations because the fluctuations in gas prices are passed through to our customers accordingly we believe gross profit margin is a better indicator of our financial performance than revenues however higher gas costs may cause customers to conserve or in the case of industrial customers to use alternative energy sources higher gas costs may also adversely impact our accounts receivable collections resulting in higher bad debt expense   the effects of weather that is above or below normal are partially offset through weather normalization adjustments or wna in certain of our service areas wna allows us to increase the base rate portion of customers’ bills when weather is warmer than normal and decrease the base rate when weather is colder than normal 37 

 

   utility gross profit margin increased to 5031 million for the year ended september 30 2004 from 4914 million for the year ended september 30 2003 total throughput for our utility business was 2610 bcf during the year compared to 2547 bcf in the prior year excluding intercompany throughput consolidated throughput for our utility business was 2460 bcf during the year compared with 2480 bcf in the prior year   the increase in utility gross profit margin primarily reflects the impact of the acquisition of mississippi valley gas company mvg whose operations are included for the entire first quarter in fiscal year 2004 compared with one month in the first quarter of the prior fiscal year resulting in an increase in utility gross profit margin and total throughput of 128 million and 50 bcf utility gross profit margin was also favorably impacted by rate increases received in kansas texas and mississippi and a 102 million yearoveryear increase in the effect of wna in our wna service areas these increases were offset partially by the impact of weather that was 6 percent warmer than that of the prior year and 4 percent warmer than normal resulting in a decrease of approximately 138 million and lower irrigation sales in our west texas division resulting in a decrease of approximately 21 million warmer than normal weather particularly impacted our service areas in our louisiana midstates and west texas divisions the decrease in throughput also reflects a decrease in consumption attributable to the impact of conservation and the continued introduction of more efficient gas appliances in our service areas finally our utility gross profit margin for the year ended september 30 2004 reflects a onetime reduction resulting from a regulatory ruling to refund 19 million to our customers in our colorado service area   operating expenses which include operation and maintenance expense provision for doubtful accounts depreciation and amortization expense and taxes other than income taxes increased 39 percent to 3432 million for the year ended september 30 2004 from 3303 million for the year ended september 30 2003 operation and maintenance expense increased primarily due to the addition of 61 million related to the mvg acquisition in december 2002 and higher labor and benefit costs taxes other than income taxes increased 15 million primarily due to additional franchise payroll and property taxes associated with the mvg assets acquired in december 2002 franchise and state gross receipts taxes are paid by our customers as a component of their monthly bills thus these amounts are offset in revenues through customer billings and have no effect on net income depreciation and amortization expense increased 91 million which primarily reflects mvg depreciation for the full year of fiscal 2004 compared with ten months in the prior year these increases were partially offset by a 79 million reduction in our provision for doubtful accounts attributable to continued improvement in accounts receivable collections during fiscal 2004   as a result of the aforementioned factors our utility segment operating income for the year ended september 30 2004 decreased to 1599 million from 1611 million for the year ended september 30 2003 

 

   miscellaneous income for the year ended september 30 2004 was 58 million compared with expense of 02 million for the year ended september 30 2003 the 60 million change was attributable primarily to the absence in 2004 of weather insurance amortization totaling 50 million which was recognized in the prior year due to the termination of our weather insurance policy in the third quarter of fiscal 2003 and the recognition of a 08 million gain on the sale of real property during fiscal 2004 

 

   interest charges increased 35 percent for the year ended september 30 2004 to 654 million from 632 million for the year ended september 30 2003 the increase was attributable primarily to a higher average outstanding debt balance resulting from the financing obtained to fund the acquisition of mvg in december 2002 38 

 

   our natural gas marketing segment aggregates and purchases gas supply arranges transportation andor storage logistics and ultimately delivers the gas to our customers at competitive prices to facilitate this process we utilize proprietary and customerowned transportation and storage assets to provide the various services our customers request including furnishing natural gas supplies at fixed and marketbased prices contract negotiation and administration load forecasting gas storage acquisition and management services transportation services peaking sales and balancing services capacity utilization strategies and gas price hedging through the use of derivative products as a result our revenues arise from the types of commercial transactions we have structured with our customers and include the value we extract by optimizing the storage and transportation capacity we own or control as well as revenues for services we deliver   we participate in transactions in which we combine the natural gas commodity and transportation costs to minimize our costs incurred to serve our customers additionally we engage in natural gas storage transactions in which we seek to find and profit from the pricing differences that occur over time we purchase or sell physical natural gas and then sell or purchase financial contracts at a price sufficient to cover our carrying costs and provide a gross profit margin through the use of transportation and storage services and derivatives we are able to capture gross profit margin through the arbitrage of pricing differences in various locations and by recognizing pricing differences that occur over time 

 

   gross profit margin for our natural gas marketing segment consists primarily of marketing activities which represent the utilization of proprietary and customerowned transportation and storage assets to provide the various services our customers request and storage activities which are derived from the optimization of our managed proprietary and third party storage and transportation assets   our natural gas marketing segment’s gross profit margin was comprised of the following for the years ended september 30 2004 and 2003    our natural gas marketing segment’s gross profit was 466 million for the year ended september 30 2004 compared to gross profit margin of 242 million for the year ended september 30 2003 natural gas marketing sales volumes were 2651 bcf during the current year compared with 2948 bcf for the prior year excluding intercompany sales volumes natural gas marketing sales volumes were 2226 bcf during the current year compared with 2260 bcf in the prior year the decrease in consolidated natural gas marketing sales volumes was primarily due to overall warmer temperatures during the 20032004 heating season compared with the prioryear period our natural gas marketing gross profit margin for the year ended september 30 39 2004 included an unrealized loss on open contracts of 28 million compared with an unrealized gain on open contracts of 63 million in the prioryear period 

  the contribution to gross profit from our storage activities was a loss of 15 million for the year ended september 30 2004 compared to a loss of 19 million for the year ended september 30 2003 the 04 million improvement primarily was attributable to a 54 million improvement in the realized storage contribution for the year ended september 30 2004 compared to the prior year offset by a 50 million decrease in unrealized income associated with our storage portfolio compared to the prioryear period the improvement in the realized storage contribution for the year ended september 30 2004 primarily was due to our inability during the 20022003 heating season to withdraw planned volumes from storage to meet our customer requirements caused by operational contractual and regulatory limitations relating to our storage facilities which reduced our realized storage contributions during fiscal 2003 this situation did not recur in fiscal 2004 the decrease in unrealized income in the current period was primarily attributable to a less favorable movement during the year ended september 30 2004 in the forward indices used to value the storage financial instruments than in the prior year combined with slightly lower physical natural gas storage quantities at september 30 2004 compared to the prior year   our marketing activities contributed 482 million to our gross profit margin for the year ended september 30 2004 compared to 261 million for the year ended september 30 2003 the increase in the marketing contribution primarily was attributable to our continued efforts to amend contracts with third parties to transfer risk to our customers and to provide higher gross profit margins and improved position management during the current year   operating expenses which include operation and maintenance expense provision for doubtful accounts depreciation and amortization expense and taxes other than income taxes increased to 189 million for the year ended september 30 2004 from 106 million for the year ended september 30 2003 the increase in operating expense was attributable primarily to higher labor and benefit costs resulting from the improvement in earnings for the fiscal year and an increase in temporary and permanent personnel due to systems and process improvements in the marketing segment   the improved gross profit margin resulted in an increase in our natural gas marketing segment operating income to 277 million for the year ended september 30 2004 compared with operating income of 136 million for the year ended september 30 2003 

 

   miscellaneous income for the year ended september 30 2004 was 08 million compared with income of 19 million for the year ended september 30 2003 the 11 million decrease was attributable primarily to lower interest income earned on cash held on deposit in margin accounts due to favorable valuations on our financial derivatives which reduced the need to deposit cash into margin accounts 

 

 

 

   our other nonutility operating income decreased to 60 million for the year ended september 30 2004 from 131 million for the year ended september 30 2003 the decrease in our other nonutility operating income was attributable primarily to a decrease in demand charges recognized by atmos pipeline and storage for storage services provided during the year ended september 30 2004 compared to the prioryear period and lower transported volumes of approximately 23 bcf by atmos pipeline and storage due to overall warmer weather during the winter heating season the decrease was also attributable to a 15 million decrease in a monthly facilities fees charged by trans louisiana gas pipeline inc as a result of a settlement reached with the louisiana public service commission in october 2003 our other nonutility operating income for the year ended september 30 2004 also included an unrealized loss on open contracts of 11 million compared with no unrealized gain our loss in the prior year as atmos pipeline and storage started to hedge its storage inventory during the fourth quarter of 2004 40 

 

   miscellaneous income for the year ended september 30 2004 was 86 million compared with income of 50 million for the year ended september 30 2003 the 36 million increase was attributable primarily to a 59 million pretax gain associated with the sale in january 2004 of our general and limited partnership interests in usp and the sale in june 2004 of the remaining limited partnership units in heritage propane partners lp formerly owned by usp this increase was offset partially by lower equity earnings from our investment in usp resulting from the sale and the absence in 2004 of a 39 million gain recorded in 2003 associated with a salestype lease of a distributed electric generation plant 

 

   interest charges increased to 31 million for the year ended september 30 2004 from 20 million for the year ended september 30 2003 the increase was attributable to a higher average outstanding debt balance resulting from increased thirdparty borrowings of 50 million used to reduce aeh’s intercompany borrowings with atmos energy corporation year ended september 30 2003 compared with year ended september 30 2002 

 

 

 

   utility gross profit increased to 4914 million for the year ended september 30 2003 from 3776 million for the year ended september 30 2002 total throughput for our utility business was 2547 billion cubic feet bcf during the year ended september 30 2003 compared to 2141 bcf in the prior year excluding intercompany throughput total consolidated throughput for our utility business was 2480 bcf during fiscal 2003 compared with 2085 bcf in the prior year   the increase in utility gross profit and total throughput was primarily attributable to the impact of the mvg acquisition in december 2002 which increased utility gross profit and total throughput by 732 million and 326 bcf the increase in utility gross profit was also attributable to a 133 million increase in our base charges primarily in louisiana as a result of our annual rate stabilization clause filing which became effective in november 2002 these increases were partially offset by a 39 million decrease in revenues from the impact of wna as a result of weather in our wna service areas being 1 percent colder than normal for the year ended september 30 2003   operating expenses increased 31 percent to 3303 million for the year ended september 30 2003 from 2521 million for the year ended september 30 2002 operation and maintenance expense increased primarily due to the addition of 360 million related to the mvg acquisition in december 2002 a 142 million increase in the provision for doubtful accounts as a result of higher revenues and gas prices and higher employee costs taxes other than income taxes increased 188 million primarily due to additional franchise payroll and property taxes associated with the mvg assets acquired in december 2002 note that franchise and state gross receipts taxes are paid by our customers thus these amounts are offset in revenues through customer billings and have no effect on net income   as a result of the aforementioned factors our utility segment operating income for the year ended september 30 2003 increased to 1611 million from 1255 million for the year ended september 30 2002 

 

   miscellaneous expense for the year ended september 30 2003 was 02 million compared with income of 14 million for the year ended september 30 2002 the 16 million change was attributable primarily to a 06 million charge associated with the cancellation of our weather insurance policy during the third quarter of fiscal 2003 which increased our total insurance policy amortization to 50 million for fiscal 2003 compared with 44 million for fiscal 2002 41 

 

   interest charges increased seven percent for the year ended september 30 2003 to 632 million from 588 million for the year ended september 30 2002 the increase was attributable primarily to a higher average outstanding debt balance resulting from the financing obtained to fund the acquisition of mvg in december 2002 

 

 

 

   our natural gas marketing segment’s gross profit margin was comprised of the following for the years ended september 30 2003 and 2002    our total natural gas marketing segment’s gross profit margin was 242 million for the year ended september 30 2003 compared to gross profit margin of 376 million for the year ended september 30 2002 natural gas marketing sales volumes were 2948 bcf during the year ended september 30 2003 compared to 2737 bcf for the prior year excluding intercompany sales volumes natural gas marketing sales volumes were 2260 bcf during the year ended september 30 2003 compared with 2040 bcf in the prior year the increase in natural gas marketing sales volumes was primarily due to overall colder temperatures during the 20022003 heating season compared with the prior year our natural gas marketing gross profit included an unrealized gain on open contracts of 63 million in fiscal 2003 compared with an unrealized loss on open contracts of 105 million in fiscal 2002   our storage activities within the natural gas marketing segment contributed a loss of 19 million to gross profit margin for the year ended september 30 2003 compared to a 48 million loss for the year ended september 30 2002 the 29 million improvement in the contribution from our storage activities was primarily attributable to a 153 million greater realized loss in the current year due to our inability during the 20022003 heating season to withdraw planned volumes from storage to meet our customer requirements caused by operational contractual and regulatory limitations relating to our storage facilities offset by an 181 million increase in the unrealized storage contributions in the current year compared to the prior year the greater unrealized contribution in the current year was primarily attributable to a favorable movement during the year ended september 30 2003 in the forward indices used to value the storage financial instruments than in the prior year combined with higher physical natural gas storage quantities at september 30 2004 compared to the prior year   our marketing activities contributed 261 million to our gross profit margin for the year ended september 30 2003 compared to 423 million for the year ended september 30 2002 the decrease in the marketing contribution primarily was attributable to a 149 million decrease in realized margin combined 42 with a 13 million decrease in our unrealized margin the decrease in realized margin was primarily attributable to price risk associated with certain full requirements contracts which reduced marketing margins during the winter of 2003 we have subsequently restructured these contracts to mitigate the price risk associated with these contracts the decrease in unrealized margin was primarily attributable to accounting changes related to the rescission of eitf 9810 and the impact on certain contracts which had previously been marked under eitf 9810 which were not considered derivatives under sfas 133 

  operating expenses decreased to 106 million for the year ended september 30 2003 from 169 million for the year ended september 30 2002 the decrease in operating expenses primarily was attributable to lower employee incentive compensation costs during the current year   as a result of the above our natural gas marketing segment generated operating income of 136 million for the year ended september 30 2003 compared with operating income of 206 million for the year ended september 30 2002 

 

   on january 1 2003 we recorded a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle to reflect a change in the way we account for our storage and transportation contracts we previously accounted for those contracts under eitf 9810 accounting for energy trading and risk management activities which required us to record estimated future gains on our storage and transportation contracts at the time we entered into the contracts and to mark those contracts to market value each month effective january 1 2003 we no longer mark those contracts to market as a result we expensed 78 million net of applicable income tax benefit as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 

 

 

 

   our other nonutility segment operating income increased to 131 million during the year ended september 30 2003 compared with 92 million for the prior year the increase in our nonutility segment operating income was primarily attributable to increased asset management activities in the current year and an increase in leasing income attributable to the commencement in 2003 of a new lease for a distributed electric generation plant 

 

   miscellaneous income for the year ended september 30 2003 was 50 million compared with income of 06 million for the year ended september 30 2002 the 44 million change was primarily attributable to a 39 million gain associated with a salestype lease of a distributed electric generation plant which was recognized in the first quarter of 2003 and improved earnings from our indirect investment in heritage propane partners lp liquidity and capital resources   our working capital and liquidity for capital expenditures and other cash needs are provided from internally generated funds borrowings under our credit facilities and commercial paper program and funds raised from the public debt and equity capital markets we believe that these sources of funds will provide the necessary working capital and liquidity for capital expenditures and other cash needs for fiscal 2005 we believe that these needs can be provided from the same sources of capital 43 capitalization   the following presents our capitalization as of september 30 2004 and 2003    total debt as a percentage of total capitalization including shortterm debt was 433 percent and 536 percent at september 30 2004 and 2003 the improvement in the debt to capitalization ratio was primarily attributable to the issuance of 99 million shares of our common stock in july 2004 and reduced shortterm debt due to strong operating cash flow generated during fiscal 2004 assuming the txu gas acquisition and related debt and equity financings had occurred on september 30 2004 our debttocapitalization ratio would have increased to 598 percent our ratio of total debt to capitalization is expected to be greater during the current winter heating season as we make additional shortterm borrowings to fund natural gas purchases and meet our working capital requirements within three to five years from the closing of the acquisition we intend to reduce our capitalization ratio to a target range of 53 to 55 percent through cash flow generated from operations continued issuance of new common stock under our direct stock purchase plan and retirement savings plan access to the equity capital markets and reduced annual maintenance and capital expenditures cash flows   our internally generated funds may change in the future due to a number of factors some of which we cannot control these include regulatory changes the price for our products and services the demand for such products and services margin requirements resulting from significant changes in commodity prices operational risks the successful integration of the natural gas distribution and pipeline operations of txu gas we acquired and other factors 

 

   yearoveryear changes in our operating cash flows are attributable primarily to working capital changes within our utility segment resulting from the impact of weather the price of natural gas and the timing of customer collections payments for natural gas purchases and deferred gas cost recoveries   for the year ended september 30 2004 we generated operating cash flow of 2707 million compared with 495 million in fiscal 2003 and 2974 million in fiscal 2002 the significant factors impacting our operating cash flow for the last three fiscal years are summarized below 

 

   fiscal 2004 operating cash flows were favorably impacted by several items improved customer collections during fiscal 2004 compared with the prior year resulted in a 622 million increase in operating cash flow further cash used for natural gas inventories decreased by 338 million compared with the prior year the decrease was attributable to lower injections of natural gas into storage partially offset by higher prices the reduction in the lag between the time period when we purchase our natural gas and the period in which we can include this cost in our gas rates improved operating cash flow by 657 million changes in cash held on deposit in margin accounts resulted in an increase in operating cash flow of 256 million this account represents deposits recorded to collateralize certain of our financial derivatives purchased in support of our natural gas marketing activities the favorable change was attributable to the fact that the fair value of financial instruments held by aem represented a net asset position at september 30 2004 which eliminated 44 the need to place cash in margin accounts finally other working capital and other changes improved operating cash flow by 339 million these changes primarily related to various increases in deferred credits and other liabilities other current liabilities and income taxes payable partially offset by lower deferred income tax expense as compared with the prior year 

 

   fiscal 2003 operating cash flow was adversely impacted by a 600 million increase in accounts receivable due to higher revenues and the timing of customer account collections the increase in revenues was attributable to a 19 percent increase in consolidated utility throughput as a result of the impact of our mvg acquisition operating cash flow was also adversely impacted by a significant increase in natural gas prices these increases resulted in a 649 million increase in gas stored underground and a 242 million increase in deferred gas costs finally operating cash flow reflects the impact of the funding of our pension plan in june 2003 which included a 486 million cash payment this funding is discussed under the caption pension and postretirement benefits obligations below 

 

   in fiscal 2002 operating cash flow was impacted favorably by a 565 million reduction in cash held on deposit in margin accounts during the winter and spring of 2001 our cash deposit requirements increased as a result of higher unrealized losses on our financial derivatives operating cash flow was also favorably impacted by a 523 million increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities and a 342 million increase in other current liabilities primarily attributable to the timing of payments as compared with the prior year finally operating cash flow was favorably impacted by a 329 million decrease in deferred gas costs reflecting the favorable timing between the billing of gas costs to our customers and the purchase of natural gas   these favorable impacts were partially offset by a 122 million increase in accounts receivable this increase was attributable to revenue increases resulting from the inclusion of the lgs and woodward marketing operations for a full year and the timing of customer account collections 

 

   during the last three years a substantial portion of our cash resources was used to fund acquisitions our ongoing construction program to provide natural gas services to our customer base and technology improvements   for the year ended september 30 2004 we invested 1649 million compared with 2334 million for the year ended september 30 2003 and 1582 million for the year ended september 30 2002 capital expenditures were 1903 million during the year ended september 30 2004 compared to 1594 million for the year ended september 30 2003 and 1323 million for the year ended september 30 2002 capital projects for fiscal years 2004 2003 and 2002 include expenditures for additional mains services meters and equipment to grow our customer base additionally capital expenditures for 2004 include approximately 215 million for mississippi valley gas company division capital expenditures fiscal 2002 cash flows from investing activities also included 85 million for the acquisition of assets to be leased to third parties   cash used for investing activities for the current year includes the receipt of 279 million generated from the sale of our limited and general partnership interests in usp in january 2004 247 million the sale of the remaining limited partnership units in heritage propane partners lp formerly owned by usp 19 million and the sale of real property 13 million   capital expenditures for fiscal 2005 are expected to range from 250 million to 260 million these expenditures include additional mains services meters and equipment of this amount approximately 80 million is expected to be incurred by the midtex division 45 

 

   our cash used for investing activities for fiscal 2004 included approximately 20 million for the comfurt gas inc acquisition in february 2004 cash used for investing activities for fiscal 2003 included 747 million for the cash portion of the mississippi valley gas company acquisition completed in december 2002 cash used for investing activities for fiscal 2002 included 157 million for the acquisition of kentuckybased market area storage and associated pipeline facility assets certain natural gas purchase and sales contracts and the outstanding common stock of southern resources inc a natural gas marketing company 

 

   for the year ended september 30 2004 our financing activities provided 804 million in cash fiscal 2003 cash from financing activities provided cash of 1516 million and in fiscal 2002 our financing activities represented a use of 1064 million our significant financing activities for the three years ended september 30 2004 are summarized as follows  46   during the year ended september 30 2004 we issued 11323925 shares of common stock of these shares 9939393 shares were issued in july 2004 to provide cash to partially fund the acquisition of the txu gas operations the following table shows the number of shares issued for the years ended september 30 2004 2003 and 2002  shelf registration   in december 2001 we filed a shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission sec to issue from time to time up to 6000 million in new common stock andor debt the registration statement was declared effective by the sec on january 30 2002 on january 16 2003 we issued 2500 million of 5125 senior notes due in 2013 under the registration statement the net proceeds of 2493 million were used to repay debt under an acquisition credit facility used to finance our acquisition of mvg to repay 540 million in unsecured senior notes held by institutional lenders and shortterm debt under our commercial paper program and for general corporate purposes additionally we sold 4100000 shares of our common stock in connection with our 2003 offering under the registration statement to provide additional funding for our pension account plan in july 2004 we sold 9939393 shares of our common stock including the underwriters’ exercise of their overallotment option which exhausted the remaining availability under this shelf registration statement   in august 2004 we filed a shelf registration statement with the sec to issue from time to time up to 22 billion in new common stock andor debt which became effective on september 15 2004 in october 2004 we sold 161 million common shares including the underwriters’ exercise of their overallotment option of 21 million shares under the new shelf registration statement generating net proceeds of 3825 million before other offering costs additionally we issued senior unsecured debt under the shelf registration statement consisting of 400 million of 400 senior notes due 2009 500 million of 495 senior notes due 2014 200 million of 595 senior notes due 2034 and 300 million of floating rate senior notes due 2007 the floating rate notes will bear interest at a rate equal to the threemonth libor rate plus 0375 percent per year the initial weighted average effective interest rate on these notes is 476 percent the net proceeds from the sale of these senior notes was 139 billion   the net proceeds from the october 2004 common stock and senior notes offerings combined with the net proceeds from our july 2004 offering were used to pay off the 17 billion in outstanding commercial paper backstopped by a senior unsecured revolving credit agreement which we entered into on september 24 2004 for bridge financing for the txu gas acquisition after issuing the debt and equity in october 2004 we have approximately 4051 million of availability remaining under the shelf registration statement 47 credit facilities   we maintain both committed and uncommitted credit facilities borrowings under our uncommitted credit facilities are made on a whenandasneeded basis at the discretion of the bank our credit capacity and the amount of unused borrowing capacity are affected by the seasonal nature of the natural gas business and our shortterm borrowing requirements which are typically highest during colder winter months our working capital needs can vary significantly due to changes in the price of natural gas charged by suppliers and the increased gas supplies required to meet customers’ needs during periods of cold weather our cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures will increase substantially as a result of the acquisition of the natural gas distribution and pipeline operations of txu gas on october 22 2004 we replaced our 3500 million credit facility with a new 6000 million committed credit facility that will serve as a backup liquidity facility for our commercial paper program we believe this facility combined with our operating cash flow will be sufficient to fund these increased working capital needs these facilities are described in further detail in note 6 to the consolidated financial statements credit rating   our credit ratings directly affect our ability to obtain shortterm and longterm financing in addition to the cost of such financing in determining our credit ratings the rating agencies consider a number of quantitative factors including debt to total capitalization operating cash flow relative to outstanding debt operating cash flow coverage of interest and pension liabilities and funding status in addition the rating agencies consider qualitative factors such as consistency of our earnings over time the quality of our management and business strategy the risk associated with our utility and nonutility businesses and the regulatory structures that govern our rates in the states where we operate   our debt is rated by three rating agencies standard  poor’s corporation sp moody’s investors service moody’s and fitch ratings inc fitch our current debt ratings are all considered investment grade and are as follows    these ratings reflect downgrades that each of the three rating agencies issued us as a result of the txu gas acquisition currently sp and moody’s maintains a stable outlook and fitch maintains a negative outlook none of our ratings are currently under review   a credit rating is not a recommendation to buy sell or hold securities all of our current ratings for longterm debt are categorized as investment grade the highest investment grade credit rating for sp is aaa moody’s is aaa and fitch is aaa the lowest investment grade credit rating for sp is bbb moody’s is baa3 and fitch is bbb our credit ratings may be revised or withdrawn at any time by the rating agencies and each rating should be evaluated independent of any other rating there can be no assurance that a rating will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if in its judgment circumstances so warrant debt covenants   in addition to the 70 percent limit on our total debttocapitalization ratio imposed by our committed credit facilities our first mortgage bonds provide for certain cash flow requirements and restrictions on additional indebtedness sale of assets and payment of dividends under the most restrictive of such covenants cumulative cash dividends paid after december 31 1988 may not exceed the sum of our accumulated net income for periods after december 31 1988 plus 150 million at september 30 2004 approximately 1036 million of retained earnings was unrestricted with respect to the payment of dividends   we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants as of september 30 2004 if we do not comply with our debt covenants we may be required to repay our outstanding balances on demand provide additional 48 collateral or take other corrective actions our two public debt indentures relating to our senior notes and debentures as well as our new 6000 million revolving credit agreement each contain a default provision that is triggered if outstanding indebtedness arising out of any other credit agreements in amounts ranging from in excess of 15 million to in excess of 100 million becomes due by acceleration or is not paid at maturity in addition aem’s credit agreement contains a crossdefault provision whereby aem would be in default if it defaults on any other financial obligation as defined by at least 250 thousand additionally this agreement contains a provision that would limit the amount of credit available if atmos is downgraded below an sp rating of bbb and a moody’s rating of baa2 

  except as described above we have no trigger events in our debt instruments that are tied to changes in specified credit ratings or stock price nor have we entered into any transactions that would require us to issue equity based on our credit rating or other trigger events contractual obligations and commercial commitments   the following tables provide information about contractual obligations and commercial commitments at september 30 2004   49   aem has commitments to purchase physical quantities of natural gas under contracts indexed to the forward nymex strip or fixed price contracts at september 30 2004 aem was committed to purchase 557 bcf within one year and 111 bcf between one to three years under indexed contracts aem was committed to purchase 05 bcf within one year and 01 bcf within one to three years under fixed price contracts with prices ranging from 408 to 625   our utility segment maintains supply contracts with several vendors that generally cover a period of up to one year commitments for estimated base gas volumes are established under these contracts on a monthly basis at contractually negotiated prices commitments for incremental daily purchases are made as necessary during the month in accordance with the terms of the individual contract   on september 22 2004 we entered into a senior unsecured revolving credit agreement with a third party financing institution for bridge financing for the txu gas acquisition there were no amounts outstanding under the facility at september 30 2004 on october 1 2004 we issued 17 billion in commercial paper that was backstopped by this facility in october 2004 we repaid the 17 billion in commercial paper with proceeds received from our october 2004 debt and equity offerings and canceled the facility risk management activities   we conduct risk management activities through both our utility and natural gas marketing segments in our utility segment we use a combination of storage fixed physical contracts and fixed financial contracts to partially insulate us and our customers against gas price volatility during the winter heating season in our natural gas marketing segment we manage our exposure to the risk of natural gas price changes and lock in our gross profit margin through a combination of storage and financial derivatives including futures overthecounter and exchangetraded options and swap contracts with counterparties finally during fiscal 2004 we entered into four treasury lock agreements to fix the treasury yield component of the interest cost of financing associated with the anticipated issuance of 875 million of longterm debt these treasury lock agreements were settled in october 2004 with a net 438 million payment to the counterparties approximately 116 million of the 438 million obligation will be recognized as a component of interest expense over the next five years and the remaining amount approximately 322 million will be recognized as a component of interest expense over the next ten years our risk management activities and related accounting treatment are described in further detail in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements   we record our derivatives as a component of risk management assets and liabilities which are classified as current or noncurrent based upon the anticipated settlement date of the underlying derivative substantially all of our derivative financial instruments are valued using external market quotes and indices the following table shows the components of the change in fair value of our utility and natural gas marketing derivative contract activities for the year ended september 30 2004 in thousands  50   the fair value of our utility and natural gas marketing derivative contracts at september 30 2004 is segregated below by time period and fair value source    as of september 30 2004 a significant portion of aem’s stored gas inventory was scheduled to be sold within six months since aem actively manages and optimizes its portfolio it may change its scheduled injection and withdrawal plans based on market conditions therefore we cannot predict that our actual inventory withdrawals will match the planned schedule as of september 30 2004 generally differences between injection and withdrawal prices are lockedin through the use of derivatives therefore there is generally no significant permanent earnings impact associated with changes in monthly prices in the interim between injections and withdrawals however there may be significant quarterly earnings volatility further permanent earnings impacts may arise if we experience operational or other issues which limit our ability to optimally manage our stored gas positions any change in the timing of planned injections or withdrawals from one time period to another generally is conducted to enhance the future profitability of the storage position additionally aem monitors and adjusts the amount of storage capacity it holds on a discretionary basis pension and postretirement benefits obligations   for the fiscal year ended september 30 2004 our total net periodic pension and other benefits costs was 261 million compared with 280 million and 135 million for the period ended september 30 2003 and 2002 a portion of these costs is capitalized into our utility rate base as these costs are recoverable through our gas utility rates costs that are not capitalized are recorded as a component of operation and maintenance expense   the decrease in total net periodic pension and other benefits cost during fiscal 2004 compared with fiscal 2003 primarily reflects the impact of adopting the provisions of the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of 2003 the act beginning with the second quarter of 2004 which reduced our accumulated postretirement benefit obligation by 243 million and our net postretirement benefit obligation costs by 41 million the total income statement impact was 23 million as a portion of this benefit was capitalized further the expected return on plan assets which reduces the net periodic pension cost and other benefits cost increased as compared with the prior year primarily due to an increase in total assets attributable to the full year effect of the contributions we made to the atmos pension account plan in fiscal 2003 and the inclusion of the mvg pension plan assets during fiscal 2003 partially offset by a 25 basis point decrease in the expected return on plan asset assumption used to determine fiscal 2004 net periodic pension cost these decreases were partially offset by an increase in the service cost and the recognized actuarial loss attributable to a 125 basis point decrease in the discount rate used to determine the net periodic pension and other benefits costs resulting from a decrease in interest rates at the time the assumptions were established   the increase in total net periodic pension and other benefits costs during fiscal 2003 compared with fiscal 2002 was primarily attributable to an increase in the service cost and interest cost attributable to an increase in our projected benefit obligations the increase in the projected benefit obligations reflected the increase in the number of plan participants due to the mvg acquisition and an increase attributable to a 125 basis point decrease in the discount rate used to determine the projected benefit obligation reflecting a decline in market interest rates 51   we did not contribute to our pension plans during fiscal 2004 in june 2003 we contributed to the atmos energy corporation master retirement trust for the benefit of the atmos energy corporation pension account plan 486 million in cash and 1169700 shares of atmos restricted common stock with a value of 288 million as a result of this contribution and improved investment returns during fiscal 2003 the underfunded status of the plan improved by approximately 86 million and the 394 million reduction to equity recorded as of september 30 2002 was eliminated as of september 30 2003 we are not required to make a minimum funding contribution to our pension plans during fiscal 2005 nor do we intend to make voluntary contributions during 2005 we contributed 138 million 186 million and 59 million to our postretirement benefits plans for the years ended september 30 2004 2003 and 2002 we anticipate contributing 117 million to our postretirement benefit plans during fiscal 2005   the projected pension liability future funding requirements and the amount of pension expense or income recognized for the plan are subject to change depending upon the actuarial value of plan assets and the determination of future benefit obligations as of each subsequent actuarial calculation date these amounts are impacted by actual investment returns changes in interest rates and changes in the demographic composition of the participants in the plan the discount rate used generally is based on rates of high grade corporate bonds with maturities similar to the average period over which benefits will be paid the expected return on plan assets is based on management’s expectation of the longterm return on the portfolio of plan assets these rates have generally declined since fiscal 2002 due to a decline in interest rates and relatively weak market performance of the underlying plan assets the rate of compensation increase is established based upon our internal budgets the actuarial assumptions used to determine the pension liability and net periodic pension and other benefits costs are included in note 9 to our consolidated financial statements   we did not assume the existing employee benefit liabilities or plans of txu gas however for purposes of determining our annual pension cost we have agreed to give the transitioned employees credit for years of txu gas service under our pension plan for purposes of our postretirement medical plan we received a credit of 20 million subject to postclosing adjustment against the purchase price to permit us to provide partial past service credits for retiree medical benefits under our retiree medical plan the 20 million credit approximates the actuarially determined present value of the accumulated benefits related to the past service of the transferred employees as a result of the txu gas acquisition on october 1 2004 our pension and other postretirement benefits costs should increase substantially during fiscal 2005 recent accounting developments   recent accounting developments and their impact on our financial position results of operations and cash flows are described in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend   we are exposed to risks associated with commodity prices and interest rates commodity price risk is the potential loss that we may incur as a result of changes in the fair value of a particular instrument or commodity interestrate risk results from our portfolio of debt and equity instruments that we issue to provide financing and liquidity for our business   we conduct risk management activities through both our utility and natural gas marketing segments in our utility segment we use a combination of storage fixed physical contracts and fixed financial contracts to partially insulate us and our customers against gas price volatility during the winter heating season in our natural gas marketing segment we manage our exposure to the risk of natural gas price changes and lock in our gross profit margin through a combination of storage and financial derivatives including futures overthecounter and exchangetraded options and swap contracts with counterparties our risk management activities and related accounting treatment are described in further detail in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements additionally our earnings are affected by changes in shortterm interest rates as a result of our issuance of shortterm commercial paper our other shortterm borrowings and beginning in fiscal 2005 our new floating rate borrowings 52 commodity price risk 

 

   we purchase natural gas for our utility operations substantially all of the cost of gas purchased for utility operations is recovered from our customers through purchased gas adjustment mechanisms however our utility operations have commodity price risk exposure to fluctuations in spot natural gas prices related to purchases for sales to our nonregulated energy services customers at fixed prices   for our utility segment we use a sensitivity analysis to estimate commodity price risk for purposes of this analysis we estimate commodity price risk by applying a hypothetical 10 percent increase in the portion of our gas cost related to fixedprice nonregulated sales based on these projected nonregulated gas sales a hypothetical 10 percent increase in fixed prices based upon the september 30 2004 three month market strip would increase our purchased gas cost by approximately 49 million in fiscal 2005 

 

   our natural gas marketing segment is also exposed to risks associated with changes in the market price of natural gas for our natural gas marketing segment we use a sensitivity analysis to estimate commodity price risk for purposes of this analysis we estimate commodity price risk by applying a 050 change in the forward nymex price to our net open position including existing storage at the end of each period based on aeh’s net open position including existing storage at september 30 2004 of 02 bcf a 050 change in the forward nymex price would have had less than a 01 million impact on our consolidated net income interest rate risk   our earnings are exposed to changes in shortterm interest rates associated with our shortterm commercial paper program other shortterm borrowings and beginning in fiscal 2005 our new floating rate debt we use a sensitivity analysis to estimate our shortterm interest rate risk for purposes of this analysis we estimate our shortterm interest rate risk as the difference between our actual interest expense for the period and estimated interest expense for the period assuming a hypothetical average of a one percent increase in the interest rates associated with our shortterm borrowings had interest rates associated with our shortterm borrowings outstanding during fiscal 2004 increased by an average of one percent our interest expense would have increased by approximately 17 million during 2004 as a result of the txu gas acquisition on october 1 2004 our interest expense should increase substantially during fiscal 2005   we also assess market risk for our fixedrate longterm obligations we estimate market risk for our fixedrate longterm obligations as the potential increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical one percent decrease in interest rates associated with these debt instruments fair value is estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis assuming this one percent hypothetical decrease the fair value of our fixedrate longterm obligations outstanding as of september 30 2004 would have increased by approximately 796 million   as of september 30 2004 we were not engaged in any other activities which would cause exposure to the risk of material earnings or cash flow loss due to changes in interest rates or market commodity prices 53

item 1  business

overview

     atmos energy corporation and its subsidiaries are engaged primarily in the
natural gas utility business as well as certain natural gas nonutility
businesses we distribute natural gas through sales and transportation
arrangements to approximately 17 million residential commercial public
authority and industrial customers through our six regulated utility divisions
which cover service areas located in the following 12 states colorado georgia
illinois iowa kansas kentucky louisiana mississippi missouri tennessee
texas and virginia in addition we transport natural gas for others through our
distribution system

     through our nonutility businesses we provide natural gas management and
marketing services to industrial customers municipalities and other local gas
distribution companies in 18 states we also supplement natural gas used by our
customers through natural gas storage fields that we own or hold an interest in
and which are located in kansas kentucky louisiana and mississippi we market
natural gas to industrial and agricultural customers primarily in west texas and
to industrial customers in louisiana finally we construct electric power
generating plants and associated facilities to meet peak load demands and lease
or sell them to municipalities and industrial customers

     our operations are divided into three segments

      the utility segment which includes our related natural gas distribution
       and sales operations

      the natural gas marketing segment which includes a variety of natural
       gas management services and

      the other nonutility segment which includes our storage services and
       our electric power plant construction and leasing services

     financial information relating to our operating segments is contained in
note 17 to the consolidated financial statements

strategy

     our overall strategy is to

      accelerate growth through profitable acquisitions

      improve the quality and consistency of earnings growth while operating
       the natural gas utility and nonutility businesses exceptionally well and

      enhance and strengthen a culture built on our core values

     over the last five years we have accelerated our growth through several
acquisitions including our acquisition of the remaining 55 percent interest in
woodward marketing llc that we did not already own in april 2001 the assets
of louisiana gas service company lgs in july 2001 and mississippi valley gas
company mvg in december 2002

     we have experienced 20 consecutive years of increasing dividends and
consistent earnings growth after giving effect to our mergers we have achieved
this record of growth while operating our utility operations efficiently by
managing our operating and maintenance expense leveraging our technology such
as our 24 hour call center to achieve more efficient operations focusing on
regulatory rate proceedings to increase revenue as our costs increased
mitigating weatherrelated risks through weathernormalized rates in some
jurisdictions and disposing of nongrowth assets additionally we have
strengthened our nonutility business

                                        1
page

by essentially eliminating speculative trading activities and actively pursing
opportunities to increase the amount of storage available to us to help mitigate
the effects of weather on our trading activities

     our core values include focusing on our employees and customers while
conducting our business with honesty and integrity we are strengthening our
culture through continuous communication with our employees and enhanced
training

utility segment

     we operate our utility segment through six regulated natural gas utility
divisions effective october 1 2002 we united our gas distribution utility
operations under the atmos energy brand the following presents our six natural
gas utility divisions and their former operating names

      atmos energy coloradokansas division formerly greeley gas company

      atmos energy kentucky division formerly western kentucky gas company

      atmos energy louisiana division formerly atmos energy louisiana gas
       company

      atmos energy midstates division formerly united cities gas company

      atmos energy texas division formerly energas company and

      mississippi valley gas company division acquired in december 2002

     our natural gas utility distribution business is seasonal and dependent on
weather conditions in our service areas gas sales to residential and commercial
customers are greater during the winter months than during the remainder of the
year the volumes of gas sales during the winter months will vary with the
temperatures during these months the seasonal nature of our sales to
residential and commercial customers is partially offset by our sales in the
spring and summer months to our agricultural customers in texas colorado and
kansas who use natural gas to operate irrigation equipment

     in addition to weather our revenues are affected by the cost of natural
gas and economic conditions in the areas that we serve higher gas costs which
we are generally able to pass through to our customers under purchased gas
adjustment clauses may cause customers to conserve or in the case of
industrial customers to use alternative energy sources

     the effects of weather that is above or below normal are partially offset
through weather normalization adjustments wna in certain service areas wna
allows us to increase the base rate portion of customers bills when weather is
warmer than normal and decrease the base rate when weather is colder than
normal as of september 30 2003 we have wna in the following service areas for
the following periods which cover approximately 658000 or 39 percent of our
meters in service

1 effective for the 20032004 winter heating season

     we receive gas deliveries in our utility operations through 36 pipeline
transportation companies both interstate and intrastate to satisfy our sales
market requirements the pipeline transportation agreements are firm and many of
them have pipeline nonotice storage service which provides for daily
balancing between system requirements and nominated flowing supplies these
agreements have been negotiated with the shortest term necessary while still
maintaining our right of first refusal

                                        2
page

     we purchase our gas supply from various producers and marketers supply
arrangements are contracted on a firm basis with various terms at market prices
the firm supply consists of both base load and swing supply quantities base
load quantities are those that flow at a constant level throughout the month and
swing supply quantities provide the flexibility to change daily quantities to
match increases or decreases in requirements related to weather conditions
except for local production purchases we select suppliers through a competitive
bidding process by requesting proposals from suppliers that have demonstrated
that they can provide reliable service we select these suppliers based on their
ability to deliver gas supply to our designated firm pipeline receipt points at
the lowest cost our major suppliers during fiscal 2003 were anadarko energy
services bp energy company cinergy marketing and trading duke energy trading
and marketing oneok energy marketing pioneer natural resources prior energy
corporation tenaska marketing and woodward marketing llc one of our
natural gas marketing subsidiaries we do not anticipate problems with obtaining
additional gas supply as needed for our customers

     we also contract for storage service in underground storage facilities on
many of the interstate pipelines serving us

     our distribution systems have experienced aggregate peak day deliveries of
approximately 20 bcf per day to maintain our deliveries to high priority
customers we have the ability and have exercised our right to curtail
deliveries to certain customers under the terms of interruptible contracts

regulation

     each of our utility divisions is regulated by various state or local public
utility authorities we are also subject to regulation by the united states
department of transportation with respect to safety requirements in the
operation and maintenance of our gas distribution facilities our distribution
operations are also subject to various state and federal laws regulating
environmental matters from time to time we receive inquiries regarding various
environmental matters we believe that our properties and operations
substantially comply with and are operated in substantial conformity with
applicable safety and environmental statutes and regulations there are no
administrative or judicial proceedings arising under environmental quality
statutes pending or known to be contemplated by governmental agencies which
would have a material adverse effect on us or our operations all of our
environmental claims have arisen out of manufactured gas plant sites in
tennessee iowa and missouri and mercury contamination sites in kansas these
claims are more fully described in note 13 to the consolidated financial

ratemaking activity

  overview

     the method of determining regulated rates varies among the states in which
our natural gas utility divisions operate the regulators have the
responsibility of ensuring that utilities under their jurisdiction operate in
the best interests of customers while providing utility companies the
opportunity to earn a reasonable return on investment in a general rate case
the applicable regulatory authority which is typically the state public utility
commission establishes rates which allow a utility company an opportunity to
collect revenue from customers to recover the cost of providing utility service

     rates established by regulatory authorities are adjusted for increases and
decreases in our purchased gas cost through purchased gas adjustment mechanisms
purchased gas adjustment mechanisms provide gas utility companies a method of
recovering purchased gas costs on an ongoing basis without filing a rate case to
address all of the utilitys nongas costs these mechanisms are commonly
utilized when regulatory authorities recognize a particular type of expense
such as purchased gas costs that i is subject to significant price
fluctuations compared to the utilitys other costs ii represents a large
component of the utilitys cost of service and iii is generally outside the
control of the gas utility there is no margin generated through purchased gas
adjustments but they do provide a dollarfordollar offset to increases or
decreases in utility gas costs although substantially all of our utility sales
to our customers fluctuate with the cost of gas that we purchase utility gross
profit which is defined as operating revenues less purchased gas cost is
generally not affected by fluctuations in the cost of gas due to the purchased
gas adjustment mechanism additionally certain jurisdictions have introduced
performancebased ratemaking adjustments to provide incentives to natural gas
utilities to minimize purchased gas costs through improved storage management
and use of financial hedges to lock in gas costs under the performancebased
ratemaking adjustment purchased gas costs savings are shared between the
utility and the customer

competition

     our utility operations are not currently in significant direct competition
with any other distributors of natural gas to residential and commercial
customers within our service areas however we do compete with other natural
gas suppliers and suppliers of alternative fuels for sales to industrial and
agricultural customers we compete in all aspects of our business with
alternative energy sources including in particular electricity competition
for residential and commercial customers is increasing promotional incentives
improved equipment efficiencies and promotional rates all contribute to the
acceptability of electrical equipment electric utilities offer electricity as a
rival energy source and compete for the space heating water heating and cooking
markets the principal means to compete against alternative fuels is lower
prices and natural gas historically has maintained its price advantage in the
residential commercial and industrial markets in addition our natural gas
marketing segment competes with other natural gas brokers in obtaining natural
gas supplies for customers

item 7  managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results
         of operations

introduction

     this section provides managements discussion of the financial condition
cash flows and results of operations of atmos energy corporation with specific
information on results of operations and liquidity and capital resources it
includes managements interpretation of our financial results the factors
affecting these results the major factors expected to affect future operating
results and future investment and financing plans this discussion should be
read in conjunction with the companys consolidated financial statements and
notes thereto

  cautionary statement for the purposes of the safe harbor under the private
  securities litigation reform act of 1995

     the statements contained in this annual report on form 10k may contain
forwardlooking statements within the meaning of section 21e of the securities
exchange act of 1934 all statements other than statements of historical fact
included in this report are forwardlooking statements made in good faith by the
company and are intended to qualify for the safe harbor from liability
established by the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 when used
in this report or any other of the companys documents or oral presentations
the words anticipate expect estimate plans believes objective
forecast goal or similar words are intended to identify forwardlooking
statements such forwardlooking statements are subject to risks and
uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those
expressed or implied in the statements relating to the companys strategy
operations markets services rates recovery of costs availability of gas
supply and other factors these risks and uncertainties include the following
adverse weather conditions such as warmer than normal weather in the companys
utility service territories or colder than normal weather which could adversely
affect our natural gas marketing activities regulatory trends and decisions
including deregulation initiatives and the impact of rate proceedings before
various state regulatory commissions market risks beyond our control affecting
our risk management activities including market liquidity commodity price
volatility and counterparty creditworthiness national regional and local
economic conditions limited access to financial markets inflation and
increased gas costs including their effect on commodity prices for natural gas
increased competition and other uncertainties all of which are difficult to
predict and many of which are beyond the control of the company accordingly
while the company believes these forwardlooking statements to be reasonable
there can be no assurance that they will approximate actual experience or that
the expectations derived from them will be realized further the company
undertakes no obligation to update or revise any of its forwardlooking
statements whether as a result of new information future events or otherwise

factors that may affect our future performance

     our performance in the future will primarily depend on the results of our
utility and natural gas marketing operations several factors exist that could
influence atmos future financial performance some of which are described
below they should be considered in connection with evaluating forwardlooking
statements contained in this report or otherwise made by or on behalf of us
since these factors could cause actual results and conditions to differ
materially from those projected in these forwardlooking statements

  our operations are weather sensitive

     weather is one of the most significant factors influencing our performance
our natural gas utility sales volumes and related revenues are correlated with
heating requirements that result from cold winter weather our agricultural
sales volumes are associated with the rainfall levels during the growing season
in our west texas irrigation market however weather normalized rates in effect
in several of our jurisdictions should mitigate the adverse effects of warmer
than normal weather on our utility operating results finally sustained cold
weather could adversely affect our natural gas marketing operations as we may be
required to purchase gas at spot rates in a rising market to obtain sufficient
volumes to fulfill some customer contracts

                                        24

  our operations are subject to regulation which can directly impact our
  operations

     our natural gas utility business is subject to various regulated returns on
its rate base in each of the 12 states in which we operate we monitor the
allowed rates of return our effectiveness in earning such rates and initiate
rate proceedings or operating changes as needed in addition in the normal
course of the regulatory environment assets are placed in service and
historical test periods are established before rate cases can be filed once
rate cases are filed regulatory bodies have the authority to suspend
implementation of the new rates while studying the cases because of this
process we must temporarily suffer the negative financial effects of having
placed assets in service without the benefit of rate relief which is commonly
referred to as regulatory lag in addition our debt and equity financing
programs are also subject to approval by regulatory bodies in certain states
which could limit our ability to take advantage of favorable shortterm market
conditions

     our business could also be affected by deregulation initiatives including
the development of unbundling initiatives in the natural gas industry
unbundling is the separation of the provision and pricing of local distribution
gas services into discrete components it typically focuses on the separation of
the distribution and gas supply components and the resulting opening of the
regulated components of sales services to alternative unregulated suppliers of
those services because of our enhanced technology and distribution system
infrastructures we believe that we are now positively positioned as unbundling
evolves consequently we expect there would be no significant adverse effect on
our business should unbundling or further deregulation of the natural gas
distribution service business occur

     finally contractual limitations could adversely affect our ability to
withdraw gas from storage which could cause us to purchase gas at spot prices
in a rising market to obtain sufficient volumes to fulfill customer contracts
we seek to minimize this risk by increasing our storage capacity and enhancing
the flexibility of our natural gas marketing contracts

  our operations are exposed to market risks that are beyond our control which
  could result in financial losses

     our risk management operations are subject to market risks beyond our
control including market liquidity commodity price volatility and counterparty
creditworthiness market liquidity is affected by the number of trading partners
in the market as a result of the recent severe downturn in the natural gas
marketing industry the number of trading partners has been reduced which could
adversely impact the market liquidity for this industry and adversely affect our
natural gas marketing operations

     further although we maintain a risk management control policy we may not
be able to completely offset the price risk associated with volatile gas prices
or the risk in our gas trading activities which could lead to financial losses
physical trading also introduces price risk on any net open positions at the end
of each trading day as well as a risk of loss resulting from intraday
fluctuations of gas prices and the potential for daily price movements between
the time natural gas is purchased or sold for future delivery and the time the
related purchase or sale is hedged although we manage our business to maintain
no open positions at times limited net open positions related to our physical
storage may occur on a short term basis net open positions may result in an
adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations if market
prices react in an unfavorable manner

     our utility segment uses a combination of storage and financial hedges to
protect against volatility in gas prices and to help moderate the effects of
higher customer accounts receivable caused by potentially higher gas prices our
natural gas marketing segment manages margins and limits risk exposure on the
sale of natural gas inventory or the offsetting fixedprice purchase or sale
commitments for physical quantities of natural gas through the use of a variety
of financial derivatives

     we could realize financial losses on these activities as a result of
volatility in the market value of the underlying commodities or if a
counterparty fails to perform under a contract

     finally the use of financial instruments to conduct our hedging and market
risk activities subjects us to counterparty risk adverse changes in the
creditworthiness of our counterparties could limit the level of
                                        25
page

trading activities with these parties and increase the risk that these parties
may not perform under a contract we believe this risk is mitigated due to the
large number of counterparties used in our risk management activities

  national regional and local economic conditions have a direct impact on our
  operations

     our operations will always be affected by the conditions and overall
strength of the national regional and local economies including interest
rates changes in the capital markets and increases in the costs of our primary
commodity natural gas these factors impact the amount of residential
industrial and commercial growth in our service territories additionally these
factors could adversely impact our customer collections

     further aems operations are concentrated in the natural gas industry and
its customers and suppliers may be subject to economic risks affecting that
industry during 2003 aems credit risk increased due to higher natural gas
prices as compared with the prior year however we believe this risk is
mitigated because a larger percentage of our natural gas marketing business in
the current year is with municipal customers who typically are more
creditworthy as compared with the prior year

  the execution of our business plan could be affected by an inability to access
  financial markets

     we rely upon access to both short term and longer term capital markets as a
source of liquidity to satisfy our liquidity requirements although we believe
we will maintain sufficient access to these financial markets adverse changes
in the economy the overall health of the industries in which we operate and
changes to our credit ratings could limit access to these markets and restrict
the execution of our business plan

  inflation and increased gas costs could adversely impact our customer base and
  customer collections and increase our level of indebtedness

     inflation has caused increases in certain operating expenses and has
required assets to be replaced at higher costs we have a process in place to
continually review the adequacy of our utility gas rates in relation to the
increasing cost of providing service and the inherent regulatory lag in
adjusting those gas rates historically we have been able to budget and control
operating expenses and investments within the amounts authorized to be collected
in rates and intend to continue to do so the ability to control expenses is an
important factor that will influence future results

     the rapid increases in the price of purchased gas which has occurred in
some prior years causes us to experience a significant increase in shortterm
debt because we must pay suppliers for gas when it is purchased which can be
significantly in advance of when these costs may be recovered through the
collection of monthly customer bills for gas delivered increases in purchased
gas costs also slow our utility collection efforts as customers are more likely
to delay the payment of their gas bills leading to higher than normal accounts
receivable this situation also results in higher shortterm debt levels and
increased bad debt expense should the price of purchased gas increase
significantly in the upcoming heating season we would expect increases in our
shortterm debt accounts receivable and bad debt expense during fiscal 2004

     finally higher costs of natural gas in recent years have already caused
many of our utility customers to conserve in the use of our gas services and
could lead to even more customers utilizing such conservation methods

  our operations are subject to increased competition

     we are facing increased competition from other energy suppliers as well as
electric companies and from energy marketing and trading companies in the case
of industrial customers such as manufacturing plants and agricultural
customers adverse economic conditions including higher gas costs could cause
these customers to use alternative sources of energy such as electricity or to
bypass our systems in favor of special competitive contracts with lower perunit
costs

highlights

      on december 3 2002 we completed the acquisition of mississippi valley
       gas company mvg a privately held utility for approximately 1500
       million which consisted of approximately 747 million in cash and
       3386287 unregistered shares of our common stock in addition we paid
       approximately 709 million to repay outstanding debt of mvg our
       mississippi valley gas company division provides natural gas distribution
       service to approximately 261500 residential industrial and other
       customers located primarily in the northern and central regions of
       mississippi

      in january 2003 as a result of the adoption of eitf 0203 which
       precludes marktomarket accounting for our natural gas marketing segment
       inventory and energy trading contracts that are not derivatives we
       recorded a onetime noncash charge for a cumulative effect adjustment of
       129 million 78 million net of income tax benefit on the
       consolidated statements of income

      on january 16 2003 we issued 2500 million of 5 18 senior notes due
       2013 the net proceeds were used to repay debt under a shortterm
       acquisition credit facility used to partially finance the mvg
       acquisition to repay 540 million in unsecured senior notes held by
       institutional lenders shortterm debt under our commercial paper program
       and to provide funds for general corporate purposes

      on june 23 2003 we completed a public offering of 4000000 shares of
       our common stock and we sold an additional 100000 shares of our common
       stock in july 2003 when our underwriters exercised their overallotment
       option collectively referred to as the 2003 offering the 2003 offering
       was priced at 2531 per share and generated net proceeds of
       approximately 992 million the proceeds were used to partially fund our
       pension plan to repay shortterm debt and to fund general corporate
       purposes including the purchase of natural gas for storage

      in june 2003 we contributed to the atmos energy corporation master
       retirement trust for the benefit of the atmos energy corporation pension
       account plan 486 million in cash and 1169700 shares of atmos
       restricted common stock with a value of 288 million the cash
       contribution was financed through a combination of cash on hand and a
       portion of the net proceeds received from the 2003 offering as a result
       of this contribution and improved investment returns on the assets used
       to fund the pension plan the 394 million minimum pension liability
       recognized during fiscal 2002 was eliminated in fiscal 2003

critical accounting policies and estimates

     our consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the united states preparation of
these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that
affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and
the related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities we based our
estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe
to be reasonable under the circumstances on an ongoing basis we evaluate our
estimates including those related to risk management and trading activities
allowance for doubtful accounts legal and environmental accruals insurance
accruals pension and postretirement obligations deferred income taxes and the
valuation of goodwill indefinitelived intangible assets and other longlived
assets our critical accounting policies are reviewed by the audit committee on
a quarterly basis actual results may differ from estimates

     regulation  our utility operations are subject to regulation with respect
to rates service maintenance of accounting records and various other matters
by the respective regulatory authorities in the states in which we operate our
regulated utility operations are accounted for in accordance with statement of
financial accounting standards sfas 71 accounting for the effects of certain
types of regulation this statement requires costbased rateregulated entities
that meet certain criteria to reflect the financial effects of the ratemaking
and accounting practices and policies of the various regulatory commissions in
their financial statements we record regulatory assets for costs that have been
deferred for which future recovery through customer rates is considered
probable regulatory liabilities are recorded when it is probable that revenues
will be reduced for amounts that will be credited to customers through the
ratemaking process as a result certain

                                        27
page

costs that would normally be expensed under accounting principles generally
accepted in the united states are permitted to be capitalized because they can
be recovered through rates further regulation may impact the period in which
revenues or expenses are recognized the amounts to be recovered or recognized
are based upon historical experience and our understanding of the regulations
the impact of regulation on our utility operations may be affected by decisions
of the regulatory authorities or the issuance of new regulations

     revenue recognition  sales of natural gas to our utility customers are
billed on a monthly cycle basis however the billing cycle periods for certain
classes of customers do not necessarily coincide with accounting periods used
for financial reporting purposes we follow the revenue accrual method of
accounting for utility segment revenues whereby revenues applicable to gas
delivered to customers but not yet billed under the cycle billing method are
estimated and accrued and the related costs are charged to expense

     energy trading contracts resulting in the delivery of a commodity where we
are the principal in the transaction are recorded as natural gas marketing sales
or purchases at the time of physical delivery realized gains and losses from
the settlement of financial instruments that do not result in physical delivery
related to our natural gas marketing energy trading contracts and unrealized
gains and losses from changes in the market value of open contracts are included
as a component of natural gas marketing revenues

     allowance for doubtful accounts  for the majority of our receivables we
establish an allowance for doubtful accounts based on an aging of those
receivable balances we apply percentages to each aging category based on our
collections experience on certain other receivables where we are aware of a
specific customers inability or reluctance to pay we record an allowance for
doubtful accounts against amounts due to reduce the net receivable balance to
the amount we reasonably expect to collect however if circumstances change
our estimate of the recoverability of accounts receivable could be different
circumstances which could affect our estimates include but are not limited to
customer credit issues the level of natural gas prices and general economic
conditions

     derivatives and hedging activities  we use a combination of storage and
financial hedges to protect us and our natural gas utility customers against
unusually large winter period gas price increases further aem manages margins
and limits risk exposure on the sale of natural gas inventory or the offsetting
fixedprice purchase or sale commitments for physical quantities of natural gas
through the use of gas futures including forwards overthecounter and
exchangetraded options and swap contracts with counterparties

     our financial hedges are accounted for under the marktomarket method
pursuant to sfas 133 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging
activities changes in the valuation of assets and liabilities arising from risk
management activities primarily result from changes in the valuation of the
portfolio of contracts maturity and settlement of contracts and newly
originated transactions market prices and models used to value these
transactions reflect our best estimates considering various factors including
closing exchange and overthecounter quotations time value and volatility
factors underlying the contracts values are adjusted to reflect the potential
impact of an orderly liquidation of our positions over a reasonable period of
time under present market conditions changes in market prices and other
assumptions used in these models directly affect our estimate of the fair value
of these transactions

     however because the costs of financial instruments used in our utility
segment will ultimately be recovered through our rates current period changes
in the assets and liabilities from these risk management activities are recorded
as a component of deferred gas costs in accordance with sfas 71 accordingly
there is no earnings impact to our utility segment as a result of the use of
financial instruments the changes in the assets and liabilities from risk
management activities are recognized in purchased gas cost in the income
statement when the related costs are recovered through our rates

     in the management of natural gas requirements for municipalities and other
local utilities aem sells physical natural gas to customers for future
delivery overthecounter swap agreements require aem to receive or make
payments based on the difference between a fixed price and the market price of
natural gas on the settlement date options held to manage price risk provide
the right but not the obligation to buy or sell energy commodities at a fixed
price aem links these financial derivatives to physical delivery of natural gas

                                        28
page

and typically balances its derivative positions at the end of each trading day
however at any point in time aem may not have completely offset its risk on
these activities

     aems physical trading activities involve utilizing physical assets
storage and transportation to sell and deliver gas to customers or to take a
position in the market based on anticipated price movement in addition to the
price risk of any net open position at the end of each trading day the
financial exposure that results from intraday fluctuations of gas prices and
the potential for daily price movements constitutes a risk of loss since the
price of natural gas purchased or sold for future delivery at the beginning of
the day may not be hedged until later in the day

     impairment assessments  we perform impairment assessments of our
goodwill intangible assets subject to amortization and longlived assets we
currently have no indefinitelived intangible assets we annually evaluate our
goodwill balances for impairment during our second fiscal quarter or as
impairment indicators arise we use a present value technique based on
discounted cash flows to estimate the fair value of our reporting units our
reporting units and our operating segments are the same as each operating unit
represents a component of our business goodwill is allocated to the reporting
units responsible for the acquisition that gave rise to the goodwill

     the discounted cash flow calculations used to assess goodwill impairment
are dependent on several subjective factors including the timing of future cash
flows future growth rates and the discount rate an impairment charge is
recognized if the carrying value of a reporting units goodwill exceeds its fair
value

     we periodically evaluate whether events or circumstances have occurred that
indicate that our intangible assets subject to amortization and other longlived
assets may not be recoverable or that the remaining useful life may warrant
revision when such events or circumstances are present we assess the
recoverability of these assets by determining whether the carrying value will be
recovered through expected future cash flows these cash flow projections
consider various factors such as the timing of the future cash flows and the
discount rate and are based upon the best information available at the time the
estimate is made changes in these factors could materially affect the cash flow
projections and result in the recognition of an impairment charge an impairment
charge is recognized as the difference between the carrying amount and the fair
value if the sum of the undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying value
of the related asset

     pension and other postretirement plans  pension and other postretirement
plan expenses and liabilities are determined on an actuarial basis and are
affected by the market value of plan assets estimates of the expected return on
plan assets and assumed discount rates and demographic data the assumed return
on plan assets is based on managements expectation of the longterm return on
the portfolio of plan assets the discount rate used to compute the present
value of plan liabilities generally is based on rates of high grade corporate
bonds with maturities similar to the average period over which benefits will be
paid actual changes in the fair market value of plan assets and differences
between the actual return on plan assets and the expected return on plan assets
could have a material effect on the amount of pension expense ultimately
recognized

results of operations

     the primary factors that impact our results of utility operations are
seasonal weather patterns competitive factors in the energy industry and
economic conditions in our service areas natural gas sales to residential
commercial and public authority customers are affected by winter heating season
requirements this generally results in higher operating revenues and net income
during the period from october through march of each year and lower operating
revenues and either lower net income or net losses during the period from april
through september of each year accordingly our second fiscal quarter
historically has been our most critical earnings quarter with an average of 68
percent of our net income having been earned in the second quarter during the
three most recently completed fiscal years utility sales to industrial
customers are much less weather sensitive utility sales to agricultural
customers who typically use natural gas to power irrigation pumps during the
period from march through september are primarily affected by rainfall amounts
and the price of natural gas changes in the cost of gas impact revenue but do

     our natural gas marketing segment generates income from its industrial
utility and municipal customers through negotiated prices based on the volume of
gas supplied to the customer it also generates income by utilizing storage and
transportation capacity that it controls to take advantage of the difference
between nearterm gas prices and prices for future delivery as well as the daily
movement of gas prices

year ended september 30 2003 compared with year ended september 30 2002

  gross profit

  utility segment

     gross profit for our utility segment primarily consists of gas service
margins generated by our six utility operating divisions from the sale of
natural gas to approximately 17 million residential commercial industrial
agricultural and other customers in the 12 states that comprise our utility
service areas

     utility gross profit increased to 4991 million for the year ended
september 30 2003 from 3864 million for the year ended september 30 2002
total throughput for our utility business was 2480 billion cubic feet bcf
during the current year compared to 2085 bcf in the prior year the increase in
utility gross profit and total throughput was primarily attributable to the
impact of the mvg acquisition in december 2002 which increased utility gross
profit and total throughput by 732 million and 326 bcf the increase in
utility gross profit was also attributable to a 133 million increase in our
base charges primarily in louisiana as a result of our annual rate stabilization
clause filing which became effective in november 2002 these increases were
partially offset by a 39 million decrease in revenues from the impact of wna
as a result of weather in our wna service areas being 1 percent colder than
normal for the year ended september 30 2003

     the average cost of gas per mcf sold increased 51 percent to 571 for 2003
from 378 for 2002 resulting in a 33 percent increase in average sales price
however changes in the cost of gas do not directly affect utility gross profit
because the fluctuations in gas prices are passed through to the customer

                                        31
page

  natural gas marketing segment

     gross profit for our natural gas marketing segment consists primarily of
the difference between revenue arising from the sale of physical natural gas to
our natural gas marketing customers less the cost to purchase natural gas and
unrealized gains and losses from changes in the market value of open contracts

     our natural gas marketing gross profit was 248 million for the year ended
september 30 2003 compared to gross profit of 384 million for the year ended
september 30 2002 natural gas marketing sales volumes were 2260 bcf during
the current year compared to 2040 bcf for the prior year our natural gas
marketing gross profit included an unrealized gain on open contracts of 63
million compared with an unrealized loss on open contracts of 105 million last
year

     natural gas marketing gross profit for the year ended september 30 2003
decreased as we purchased gas during a period of rising prices to meet our
contractual requirements with our customers due to several factors we
anticipated a decline in natural gas prices during the period december 2002
through march 2003 therefore we elected to keep gas in storage and to buy
flowing gas to meet our customer needs during that period we were also unable
to withdraw planned volumes from storage to meet our nonutility customer needs
due to contractual and regulatory limitations relating to our storage
facilities additionally we experienced situations of open short positions and
were not sufficiently hedged on other transactions which contributed to the
decrease in our natural gas marketing gross profit finally we recognized
smaller gains from inventory sales in the current year as compared with the
prior year

     since the 20022003 winter heating season we have taken steps to minimize
any future negative impact of the events that caused the lowerthanexpected
earnings from our natural gas marketing segment during the year in july 2003
we entered into a contract for one bcf of capacity in a salt dome storage
facility that will help us to manage our price risk related to customer demand
volatility this facility provides increased flexibility to satisfy changing
customer demands because it allows us to inject and withdraw gas on a daily and
monthly basis the contract commenced in november 2003 and will remain in effect
for the next five heating seasons annual lease payments will be approximately
20 million additionally we are amending our contracts with third parties
where possible to transfer usage risk to our customers and to provide higher
margins finally we are reviewing our internal processes to improve the
effectiveness of our overall risk management and financial reporting processes

  other nonutility segment

     our other nonutility segment gross profit primarily consists of margins
generated by our third party storage services and our leasing operations our
other nonutility segment contributed 111 million in gross profit during the
current year compared with 64 million for the prior year the increase in our
nonutility gross profit was primarily attributable to increased asset
management activities in the current year and an increase in leasing income
attributable to the commencement in 2003 of a new lease for a distributed
electric generation plant

  other consolidated activity

     operating expenses  operating expenses which include operation and
maintenance expense provision for doubtful accounts depreciation and
amortization expense and taxes other than income taxes increased 26 percent to
3471 million for the year ended september 30 2003 from 2758 million for the
year ended september 30 2002 operation and maintenance expense increased
primarily due to the addition of 360 million related to the mvg acquisition in
december 2002 and a 133 million increase in the provision for doubtful
accounts as a result of higher revenues and gas prices this increase was
partially offset by a 32 million reduction in labor costs attributable to
lower incentive payment accruals as compared with the prior year taxes other
than income taxes increased 188 million primarily due to additional franchise
payroll and property taxes associated with the mvg assets acquired in december
2002 note that franchise and state gross receipts taxes are paid by our
customers thus these amounts are offset in revenues through customer billings
and have no effect on net income

                                        32
page

     other income expense  other income for the year ended september 30
2003 was 22 million compared with an expense of 13 million for the year
ended september 30 2002 the 35 million change was primarily attributable to
a 39 million gain associated with a salestype lease of a distributed electric
generation plant which was recognized in the first quarter of 2003 and improved
earnings from our indirect investment in heritage propane lp partially offset
by a 06 million charge associated with the cancellation of our weather
insurance policy during the third quarter of fiscal 2003

     interest charges  interest charges increased eight percent for the year
ended september 30 2003 to 637 million from 592 million for the year ended
september 30 2002 the increase was primarily attributable to a higher average
outstanding debt balance resulting from the financing obtained to fund the
acquisition of mvg

     cumulative effect of change in accounting principle  on january 1 2003
we recorded a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle to reflect a
change in the way we account for our storage and transportation contracts
previously we accounted for those contracts under eitf 9810 accounting for
energy trading and risk management activities which required us to record
estimated future gains on our storage and transportation contracts at the time
we entered into the contracts and to mark those contracts to market value each
month effective january 1 2003 we no longer mark those contracts to market
as a result we expensed 78 million net of applicable income tax benefit as
a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle

year ended september 30 2002 compared with year ended september 30 2001

  gross profit

  utility segment

     gross profit for our utility segment increased six percent to 3864
million for the year ended september 30 2002 from 3655 million for the year
ended september 30 2001 total throughput for 2002 excluding louisiana gas
service companys throughput was 1914 bcf compared with 2178 bcf for 2001
the increase in utility gross profit was due primarily to the gross profit
earned from additional throughput of 171 bcf from the louisiana gas service
operations acquired in july 2001 this increase was offset by the effect of
warmer weather which resulted in a 12 percent decrease in gas sales volumes
excluding louisiana gas services gas sales volumes during 2002 temperatures
were 18 percent warmer than the prior year and were six percent warmer than the
30year normal adjusted for service areas with weather normalized operations

     the average cost of gas per mcf sold decreased 42 percent to 378 for 2002
from 647 for 2001 resulting in a 29 percent decrease in average sales price
however changes in the cost of gas do not directly affect gross profit because
the fluctuations in gas prices are passed through to the customer

  natural gas marketing segment

     gross profit for our natural gas marketing segment was 384 million for
the year ended september 30 2002 compared to gross profit of 22 million for
the year ended september 30 2001 natural gas marketing sales volumes were
2040 bcf during the current year compared to 555 bcf for the prior year the
increase for 2002 compared to 2001 was primarily due to gains on inventory sales
and favorable pricing under natural gas sales contracts as well as our full
consolidation of woodward marketing llc beginning april 2001 when we
completed our acquisition of the remaining 55 percent interest in woodward
marketing llc that we did not already own since the acquisition the
revenues and expenses of woodward marketing llc have been shown on a
consolidated basis

  other nonutility segment

     our other nonutility segment contributed 64 million in gross profit
during the current year compared with 76 million for the prior year

  other consolidated activity

     operating expenses  operating expenses increased to 2758 million for
the year ended september 30 2002 from 2449 million for the year ended
september 30 2001 operation and maintenance expense increased primarily due to
the addition of 215 million relating to the louisiana gas service acquisition
in july 2001 and an increase of 107 million in pension costs in addition
operation and maintenance expense increased 92 million due to the full
consolidation of woodward marketings operations beginning april 1 2001 a
decrease in the provision for doubtful accounts of 262 million partially
offset this increase the decrease in the provision for doubtful accounts was
attributable to the lower gas commodity prices during 2002 as well as our
effective recovery of customer receivable balances depreciation and
amortization increased 138 million due to the addition of the assets from the
louisiana gas service acquisition in july 2001 taxes other than income
decreased as a result of decreased city franchise taxes and state gross receipts
taxes which are revenue based however these taxes are paid by our customers
thus these amounts are offset in revenues through customer billings and have no
effect on net income the decrease in taxes other than income was partially
offset by increases in property and payroll taxes related to the louisiana gas
service acquisition in july 2001

     miscellaneous expense  miscellaneous expense decreased 06 million to
13 million in 2002 compared to 19 million in 2001 this decrease was
primarily due to an increase in net recoveries related to our performance
basedratemaking mechanisms the recognition of 05 million related to a large
industrial contract we received during 2002 and a reduction in the amortization
expense recognized related to weather insurance purchased for the 20012002
heating season in addition we had an increase of 30 million in interest
income in may 2001 due primarily to interest income earned on the proceeds from
our 3500 million debt offering in 2001 we invested these proceeds in
shortterm investments until the completion of the louisiana gas service
acquisition in july 2001 no such interest income was recognized in 2002

     interest expense  interest expense increased 122 million to 592
million for 2002 compared to 470 million for 2001 this increase was due
primarily to the interest expense on the 3500 million debt offering in may
2001

liquidity and capital resources

     our working capital and liquidity for capital expenditures and other cash
needs are provided from internally generated funds borrowings under our credit
facilities and commercial paper program and funds raised from the public debt
and equity capital markets we believe that these sources of funds will provide
the necessary working capital and liquidity for capital expenditures and other
cash needs for fiscal 2004

     total debt as a percentage of total capitalization including shortterm
debt was 536 percent and 594 percent at september 30 2003 and 2002 the
improvement in the debt to capitalization ratio was primarily attributable to
the issuance of common stock in connection with our 2003 offering and the mvg
acquisition as well as the elimination of the minimum pension liability as of
september 30 2003 due to increased funding of our pension plan and improved
investment returns on the assets used to fund the pension plan our longterm
plan is to maintain the debt to capitalization ratio within a target range of
5052 percent through cash flow generated from operations continued issuance of
new common stock under our direct stock purchase plan and retirement savings
plan access to the debt and equity capital markets and limiting annual
maintenance and capital expenditures

cash flows

     our internally generated funds may change in the future due to a number of
factors some of which we cannot control these include regulatory changes the
price for our products and services the demand for such products and services
margin requirements resulting from significant changes in commodity prices
operational risks and other factors

  cash flows from operating activities

     for the year ended september 30 2003 we generated operating cash flow of
495 million compared with 2974 million in fiscal 2002 and 830 million in
fiscal 2001 the significant factors impacting our operating cash flow for the
last three fiscal years are summarized below

  year ended september 30 2003

     fiscal 2003 operating cash flow was adversely impacted by a 600 million
increase in accounts receivable due to higher revenues and the timing of
customer account collections the increase in revenues is attributable to a 19
percent increase in consolidated utility throughput as a result of the impact of
our mvg acquisition and a 33 percent increase in average utility sales price per
mcf primarily due to an increase in natural gas costs operating cash flow was
also adversely impacted by a significant increase in natural gas prices these
increases resulted in a 649 million increase in gas stored underground and a
242 million increase in deferred gas costs finally operating cash flow
reflects the impact of the funding of our pension plan in june 2003 which
included a 486 million cash payment this funding is discussed under the
caption pension and postretirement benefits obligations below

  year ended september 30 2002

     in fiscal 2002 operating cash flow was favorably impacted by a 565
million reduction in cash held on deposit in margin accounts this account
represents deposits recorded to collateralize certain of our financial
derivatives purchased in support of our natural gas marketing activities and
will fluctuate based upon the timing of our derivative activities operating
cash flow was also favorably impacted by a 523 million increase in accounts
payable and accrued liabilities and a 342 million increase in other current
liabilities primarily attributable to the timing of payments as compared with
the prior year finally operating cash flow was favorably impacted by a 329
million decrease in deferred gas costs reflecting the favorable timing between
the billing of gas costs to our customers and the purchase of natural gas

     these favorable impacts were partially offset by a 122 million increase
in accounts receivable this increase was attributable to revenue increases
resulting from the inclusion of the lgs and woodward marketing operations for a
full year and the timing of customer account collections

  year ended september 30 2001

     in fiscal 2001 operating cash flow was favorably impacted by a 650
million decrease in accounts receivable attributable to improved customer
collections during fiscal 2001 and a 154 million decrease in deferred gas
costs reflecting the favorable timing between the billing of gas costs to our
customers and the purchase of natural gas

     these favorable impacts were partially offset by the 622 million deposit
of cash into margin accounts to collateralize certain of our financial
derivatives and a 948 million decrease in accounts payable and accrued
liabilities attributable to the timing of payments as compared with the prior
year

credit facilities

     we maintain both committed and uncommitted credit facilities our credit
capacity and the amount of unused borrowing capacity are affected by the
seasonal nature of the natural gas business and our shortterm borrowing
requirements which are typically highest during colder months our working
capital needs can vary significantly due to changes in the price of natural gas
charged by suppliers and the increased gas supplies required to meet customers
needs during periods of cold weather

credit rating

     our credit ratings directly affect our ability to obtain shortterm and
longterm financing in addition to the cost of such financing in determining
our credit ratings the rating agencies consider a number of quantitative
factors including debt to total capitalization operating cash flow relative to
outstanding debt operating cash flow coverage of interest and pension
liabilities and funding status in addition the rating agencies consider
qualitative factors such as consistency of our earnings over time the quality
of our management and business strategy the risk associated with our utility
and nonutility businesses and the regulatory structures that govern our rates
in the states where we operate

     our credit ratings may be revised or withdrawn at any time by the rating
agencies and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating
there can be no assurance that a rating will remain in effect for any given
period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a
rating agency if in its judgment circumstances so warrant

     on january 10 2003 sp changed the outlook on our longterm debt rating
from stable to negative in its press release explaining this action sp
cited among other factors their concern that we have not made significant
progress in reducing our debt to total capitalization ratio since sp changed
its outlook we have issued equity and substantially reduced our leverage

in specified credit ratings or stock price nor have we entered into any
transactions that would require us to issue equity based on our credit rating or
other trigger events

pension and postretirement benefits obligations

     in june 2003 we contributed to the atmos energy corporation master
retirement trust for the benefit of the atmos energy corporation pension account
plan 486 million in cash and 1169700 shares of atmos restricted common stock
with a value of 288 million of the total cash contributed 261 million
represented a 2002 contribution which was deducted on our 2002 tax return the
cash contribution was financed through a combination of cash on hand and a
portion of the net proceeds received from the sale of 4100000 shares of our
common stock in our 2003 offering as a result of this contribution and improved
investment returns during fiscal 2003 the underfunded status of the plan
improved by approximately 86 million and the 394 million reduction to
equity recorded in the prior year was eliminated as of september 30 2003 we
recorded the 394 million reduction in equity at september 30 2002 as a result
of negative investment returns from plan assets during fiscal 2002 lump sum
distributions to participants and a decrease in interest rates refer to note 9
to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our
pension plans

     for the fiscal year ended september 30 2003 our pension cost was 27
million compared with pension income of 35 million and 83 million for the
fiscal years ended september 30 2002 and 2001 pension income and expense is
recorded as a component of operation and maintenance expense

     we incurred pension cost during fiscal 2003 compared with income in fiscal
2002 due to an increase in the service cost and interest cost attributable to an
increase in the projected benefit obligation the increase in the projected
benefit obligation resulted primarily from an increase in the number of plan
participants due to the mvg acquisition and an increase attributable to a 125
basis point decrease in the discount rate used in the fiscal 2003 actuarial
calculations reflecting the decline in market interest rates the decrease in
pension income between fiscal 2001 and 2002 was attributable to increases in
service cost and interest costs due to increases in the projected benefit
obligations coupled with a decrease in the expected return on assets due to poor
investment performance

     the projected pension liability future funding requirements and the amount
of pension expense or income recognized for the plan are subject to change
depending upon the actuarial value of plan assets and the determination of
future benefit obligations as of each subsequent actuarial calculation date
these amounts are impacted by actual investment returns changes in interest
rates and changes in the demographic composition of the participants in the
plan the actuarial assumptions used to determine the pension liability for our
pension plan are as follows



                                                              2003   2002   2001
                                                                    
                                                                   
discount rate  600  725   750
rate of compensation increase  400  400   400
expected return on plan assets  900  925  1000


     the assumed return on plan assets is based on managements expectation of
the longterm return on the portfolio of plan assets the discount rate used to
compute the present value of plan liabilities generally is based on rates of
high grade corporate bonds with maturities similar to the average period over
which benefits will be paid these rates have declined since fiscal 2001 due to
a decline in interest rates and poor market performance of the underlying plan
assets the rate of compensation increase is established based upon our internal
budgets at this time we anticipate that additional voluntary contributions
ranging from 0  15 million during fiscal 2004 may be necessary to keep the
plan 100 funded on an accumulated benefit obligation basis

heating season we covered approximately 51 percent of our anticipated flowing
gas requirements through a combination of storage financial hedges and fixed
forward contracts at a weighted average cost of less than 400 per mcf this
provided a measure of protection to us and our customers against the natural gas
price volatility experienced during the 20022003 heating season for the
20032004 heating season we expect to hedge between 50 percent and 55 percent
of our anticipated flowing gas requirements through a combination of storage and
financial hedges at a weighted average cost of approximately 525 per mcf

     in june 2001 we purchased a three year weather insurance policy with an
option to cancel the third year of coverage the insurance was designed for our
texas and louisiana operations to protect against weather that was at least
seven percent warmer than normal for the entire heating season of october
through march beginning with the 20012002 heating season the cost of the three
year policy was 132 million which was prepaid and amortized over the
appropriate heating seasons based on degree days because weather was not at
least seven percent warmer than normal no income was recognized under this
insurance policy during the years ended september 30 2003 and 2002
amortization expense of 50 million and 44 million was recognized during the
fiscal years ended september 30 2003 and 2002 included in the amortization
expense for the fiscal year ended september 30 2003 was a third quarter charge
of 06 million net of cash received related to the cancellation of the third
year of coverage on our weather insurance policy primarily as a result of rate
relief in louisiana wna in certain areas of texas and prospects for wna in
other areas of texas

  nonutility hedging activities

     our natural gas marketing segment hedging activities are conducted through
aem and are designed to manage margins on the sale of natural gas inventory or
the offsetting fixedprice purchase or sale commitments for physical quantities
of natural gas through the use of gas futures including forwards over
thecounter and exchangetraded options and swap contracts with counterparties

     on october 25 2002 the emerging issues task force eitf issued eitf
0203 accounting for contracts involved in energy trading and risk management
which rescinded eitf 9810 accounting for energy trading and risk management
activities and required that all energy trading contracts entered into after
october 25 2002 be accounted for pursuant to the provisions of sfas 133
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities prior to the
issuance of eitf 0203 we accounted for all energy trading contracts under the

daily price movements constitutes a risk of loss since the price of natural gas
purchased or sold for future delivery at the beginning of the day may not be
hedged until later in the day

     these trading activities are subject to a risk management policy which
limits the level of trading loss to a maximum of 25 percent of the budgeted
annual operating income of atmos energy holdings compliance with this risk
management policy is monitored on a daily basis in addition the risk
management policy limits woodward marketings gas daily daily and nymex
positions with price risk including inventory open positions to a total
volume of 50 bcf we manage our business to maintain no open positions

liabilities and equity under sfas 150 mandatorily redeemable financial
instruments obligations to repurchase the issuers shares by transferring
assets and certain obligations to issue a variable number of shares to settle
that obligation must be classified as liabilities on the balance sheet and
initially recorded at fair value sfas 150 is effective for the company for
financial instruments entered into or modified after may 31 2003 and on july
1 2003 for most previously existing financial instruments in november 2003
the fasb voted to defer indefinitely the effective date for certain mandatorily
redeemable noncontrolling interests mrni associated with finitelived
subsidiaries for all other mrnis the effective date was deferred to november
5 2003 the adoption of sfas 150 did not impact our financial position results
of operations or net cash flows as we currently do not use any of the financial
instruments subject to this statement

     in april 2003 the fasb issued sfas 149 amendment of statement 133 on
derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas 149 amends and clarifies the
accounting and reporting for derivative instruments including hedges this
statement amends sfas 133 for decisions made by the derivatives implementation
group and by the fasb in connection with other projects dealing with financial
instruments and clarifies other implementation issues sfas 149 is effective
for the company on a prospective basis for contracts entered into or modified
after june 30 2003 the adoption of this statement did not have a material
impact on our financial position results of operations or net cash flows

     in january 2003 the fasb issued fasb interpretation fin 46
consolidation of variable interest entities an interpretation of accounting
research bulletin no 51 the primary objectives of fin 46 are to provide
guidance on how to identify entities for which control is achieved through means
other than through voting rights variable interest entities vie and how to
determine when and which business enterprises should consolidate the vie this
new model for consolidation applies to an entity in which either 1 the equity
investors do not have a controlling financial interest or 2 the equity
investment at risk is insufficient to finance that entitys activities without
receiving additional subordinated financial support from other parties fin 46
applies immediately to vies created after january 31 2003 or to vies obtained
after that date for variable interests held in vies acquired prior to february
1 2003 fin 46 was originally effective july 1 2003 however in october 2003
the fasb deferred the effective date of fin 46 for vies created prior to
february 1 2003 to the first reporting period after december 15 2003 the
adoption of this interpretation will not have a material impact on our financial
position results of operations or net cash flows because atmos currently is not
a primary beneficiary of a vie

     in december 2002 the fasb issued sfas 148 accounting for stockbased
compensation sfas 148 provides three transition options for companies that
account for stockbased compensation under the intrinsic method to convert to
the fair value method sfas 148 also modified the disclosure requirements for
stockbased compensation to increase the prominence and character of the pro
forma disclosures for entities using the intrinsic value method although we
have elected to continue using the intrinsic value method we adopted the
disclosure requirements prescribed by sfas 148

     in november 2002 the fasb issued fin 45 guarantors accounting and
disclosure requirements for guarantees including indirect guarantees of
indebtedness of others fin 45 clarifies the requirements of sfas 5 accounting
for obligations relating to a guarantors accounting for and disclosure of the
issuance of certain types of guarantees the adoption of fin 45 did not impact
our financial position results of operations or net cash flows as we currently
do not have any guarantees that meet the recognition and disclosure criteria
outlined in this pronouncement

     in june 2001 the fasb issued sfas 143 accounting for asset retirement
obligations this statement addresses financial accounting and reporting for
obligations associated with the retirement of tangible longlived assets and the
associated asset retirement costs effective october 1 2002 we adopted sfas
143 which had no material impact on our financial position or results of
operations based on the perpetual nature of our franchise agreements and on our
experience in the businesses in which we operate



item 7a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

     the risk inherent in our market risksensitive instruments is the potential
loss arising from adverse changes in natural gas commodity prices and interest
rates as discussed below the sensitivity analysis does

not however consider the effects that such adverse changes may have on overall
economic activity nor do they consider additional actions we may take to
mitigate exposure to such changes actual results may differ

gas prices

  utility segment

     we purchase natural gas for our utility operations substantially all of
the cost of gas purchased for utility operations is recovered from our customers
through purchased gas adjustment mechanisms the utility segment has limited
market risk in gas prices related to gas purchases in the open market at spot
prices for sale to nonregulated energy services customers at fixed prices as a
result our earnings could be affected by changes in the price and availability
of such gas to protect against volatility in gas prices we hedge our gas costs
by purchasing futures contracts and by purchasing gas in advance of the winter
heating season and placing it in storage our utility segment does not use such
financial instruments for trading purposes and we are not a party to any
leveraged derivatives market risk is estimated as a hypothetical 10 percent
increase in the portion of our gas cost related to fixedprice nonregulated
sales based on projected fiscal 2004 nonregulated gas sales at fixed prices
based upon the september 30 2003 three month market strip such an increase
would result in an increase to cost of gas of approximately 57 million in
fiscal 2004

  natural gas marketing segment

     the principal business of aem including the activities of woodward
marketing llc and trans louisiana industrial gas company inc is the
overall management of natural gas requirements for municipalities local gas
utility companies and industrial customers located primarily in the southeastern
and midwestern united states aem also supplies our regulated operations with a
portion of our natural gas requirements on a competitive bid basis

     in the management of natural gas requirements for municipalities and other
local utilities aem sells physical natural gas to customers for future
delivery aem manages margins and limits risk exposure on the sale of natural
gas inventory or the offsetting fixedprice purchase or sale commitments for
physical quantities of natural gas through the use of gas futures including
forwards overthecounter and exchangetraded options and swap contracts with
counterparties overthecounter swap agreements require aem to receive or make
payments based on the difference between a fixed price and the market price of
natural gas on the settlement date options held to manage price risk provide
the right but not the requirement to buy or sell energy commodities at a fixed
price aem links these gas futures to physical delivery of natural gas and
typically balances its futures positions at the end of each trading day
however at any point in time aem may not have completely offset its risk on
these activities

     physical trading involves utilizing physical assets storage and
transportation to sell and deliver gas to customers or to take a position in
the market based on anticipated price movement in addition to the price risk of
any net open position at the end of each trading day the financial exposure
that results from intraday fluctuations of gas prices and the potential for
daily price movements constitutes a risk of loss since the price of natural gas
purchased or sold for future delivery at the beginning of the day may not be
hedged until later in the day

     these trading activities are subject to a risk management policy which
limits the level of trading loss to a maximum of 25 percent of the budgeted
annual operating income of atmos energy holdings compliance with this risk
management policy is monitored on a daily basis in addition the risk
management policy limits woodward marketings gas daily daily and nymex
positions with price risk including inventory open positions to a total
volume of 50 bcf we manage our business to maintain no open positions
however at times limited net open positions related to our physical storage
may occur on a short term basis woodward marketing monitors its open trading
positions daily to ensure they are within the limits set by the risk management
policy at september 30 2003 woodwards net open positions in its trading
operations totaled 01 bcf

     counterparty risk is the risk of loss from nonperformance by financial
counterparties to a contract financial instruments which subject aem to
counterparty risk consist primarily of financial instruments arising from
trading and risk management activities and overnight repurchase agreements that
are not insured exchange traded future and option contracts are generally
guaranteed by the exchanges

     because aems operations are concentrated in the natural gas industry its
customers and suppliers may be subject to economic risks affecting that
industry therefore an economic downturn in the industry could have an adverse
affect on the creditworthiness of aems customers aem manages credit risk to
attempt to minimize its exposure to uncollectible receivables in compliance
with aems existing credit policy prospective and existing customers are
reviewed for creditworthiness and customers not meeting minimum standards at
the discretion of management provide security deposits and are subject to
various requisite secured payment terms during 2003 aems credit risk has
increased due to higher natural gas prices as compared with the prior year
however this risk is somewhat mitigated because a larger percentage of our
business in the current year is with municipal customers who are typically
rated investment grade as compared with the prior year

interest rates

     our earnings are affected by changes in shortterm interest rates as a
result of our issuance of shortterm commercial paper and our other shortterm
borrowings if market interest rates for shortterm borrowings in fiscal 2003
had averaged one percent more our interest expense would have increased by
approximately 13 million

     market risk for fixedrate longterm obligations is estimated as the
potential increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical one percent
decrease in interest rates and amounts to approximately 723 million based on
discounted cash flow analyses

     as of september 30 2003 we were not engaged in other activities which
would cause exposure to the risk of material earnings or cash flow loss due to
changes in interest rates or market commodity prices

changes in labor costs and customer growth beginning january 1 2002 the
customers are assured annual savings which will be indexed for inflation

communications past activities with respect to purchased gas costs on april
10 2002 the louisiana public service commission issued a report of proceedings
in which it approved a stipulation and agreement between citizens
communications atmos and the commission staff this stipulation and agreement
resulted in no refunds being due to customers

     in october 2002 atmos received written notification from the executive
secretary of the louisiana public service commission that he was asserting that
a monthly facilities fee of approximately 06 million charged since july 2001
to atmos by trans louisiana gas pipeline inc a whollyowned subsidiary of
atmos pursuant to a contract between the parties was excessive the executive
secretary asserted that all monthly facilities fees in excess of approximately
01 million from july 2001 should be refunded to ratepayers with interest

     atmos has responded to the secretary and noted that it has previously made
all required filings with the commission fully disclosing the amount of the
facilities fee atmos intends to file another petition seeking commission
approval of the facilities fee by the end of calendar year 2003 similar to that
filed in 2001 but containing updated data in the interim atmos is continuing
to charge a facilities fee of approximately 06 million per month as the
executive secretarys correspondence does not constitute action of the
commission

rate stabilization filings to the louisiana public service commission for the
two gas systems we operate in louisiana recently completed audits by the
louisiana public service commission of these filings found our earnings to be

  atmos energy marketing activities

     we acquired a 45 percent interest in woodward marketing in july 1997 as a
result of the merger of atmos and united cities gas company which had acquired
that interest in may 1995 in april 2001 we acquired the 55 percent interest
that we did not own from jd woodward and others for 1423193 restricted shares
of our common stock immediately following the acquisition mr woodward was
elected as a senior vice president of atmos in charge of all nonutility
business activities a position he has held since april 2001 prior to that
time mr woodward had not been an officer or employee of atmos

     the principal business of atmos energy marketing including the activities
of woodward marketing and trans louisiana industrial gas is the overall
management of natural gas requirements for municipalities local gas utility
companies and industrial customers located primarily in the southeastern and
midwestern united states this business involves the sale of natural gas by
atmos energy marketing to its customers and the management of storage and
transportation contracts for its customers under contracts generally having one
to twoyear terms at september 30 2002 atmos energy marketing had a total of
101 municipal customers and 641 industrial customers atmos energy marketing
also sells natural gas to certain of its industrial customers on a delivered
burner tip basis under contract terms from 30 days to two years in addition
atmos energy marketing supplies our regulated operations with a portion of our
natural gas requirements on a competitive bid basis any marktomarket gains or
losses on these affiliate contracts are eliminated

     in the management of natural gas requirements for municipal and other local
utilities atmos energy marketing sells physical natural gas to those customers
for future delivery and manages the associated price risk through the use of gas
futures forwards overthecounter and exchangetraded options and swap
contracts with counterparties these financial contracts are markedtomarket at
the daily close of business atmos energy marketing links gas derivatives to
physical delivery of natural gas and typically balances its derivatives
positions at the end of each trading day overthecounter swap agreements
require atmos energy marketing to receive or make payments based on the
difference between a fixed price and the market price of natural gas on the
settlement date atmos energy marketing uses these futures and swaps to manage
margins on offsetting fixedprice purchase or sale commitments for physical
quantities of natural gas which are also carried on a marktomarket basis
marktomarket accounting refers to the measurement of contracts at fair value
determined at the balance sheet date with any gains and losses included in
earnings options held to manage price risk provide the right but not the
requirement to buy or sell energy commodities at a fixed price atmos energy
marketing uses options to manage margins and to limit overall price risk
exposure at any point in time atmos energy marketing may not have completely
hedged its price risk on these activities

     energy related services provided by atmos energy marketing include the sale
of natural gas to its various customer classes and management of transportation
and storage assets and inventories more specifically
                                        5

energy services include contract negotiation and administration load
forecasting storage acquisition natural gas purchase and delivery and capacity
utilization strategies in providing these services atmos energy marketing
generates income from its utility municipal and industrial customers through
negotiated prices based on the volume of gas supplied to the customer atmos
energy marketing also generates income by taking advantage of the difference
between nearterm gas prices and prices for future delivery as well as the daily
movement of gas prices by utilizing storage and transportation capacity that it
controls

     prior to may 2002 atmos energy marketing engaged in limited financial
trading for speculative purposes financial trading involves utilizing financial
instruments futures options swaps etc to hedge natural gas prices or to
take a position in the market based on anticipated price movement in some prior
years atmos energy marketing experienced losses in its financial speculative
trading business effective in may 2002 atmos energy marketings financial
trading for speculative purposes was discontinued atmos energy marketing will
continue its financial trading for hedging risk management purposes related to
its physical trading positions with regard to its physical trading business
atmos energy marketing does engage in limited speculative natural gas trading
for its own account primarily related to its storage activity subject to a risk
management policy established by atmos management which limits the level of
trading loss to a maximum of 25 percent of the budgeted annual operating income
of atmos energy holdings physical trading involves utilizing physical assets
storage and transportation to sell and deliver gas to customers or to take a
position in the market based on anticipated price movement compliance with such
risk management policy is monitored on a daily basis in addition woodward
marketings bank credit facility limits trading positions that are not closed at
the end of the day open positions to 50 bcf of natural gas at september 30
2002 atmos energy marketings net open positions in its trading operations
totaled 19 bcf atmos energy marketings open trading positions are monitored
on a daily basis but are not required to be closed if they remain within the
limits set by the bank loan agreement in addition to the price risk of any net
open position at the end of each trading day the financial exposure that
results from intraday fluctuations of gas prices constitutes a risk of loss
since the price of natural gas purchased or sold for future delivery at the
beginning of the day may not be hedged until later in the day

     financial instruments which subject atmos energy marketing to counterparty
risk consist primarily of financial instruments arising from trading and risk
management activities and overnight repurchase agreements that are not insured
counterparty risk is the risk of loss from nonperformance by financial
counterparties to a contract exchangetraded future and option contracts are
generally guaranteed by the exchanges

     atmos energy marketings operations are concentrated in the natural gas
industry and its customers and suppliers may be subject to economic risks
affecting that industry

     from time to time woodward marketing borrows money to fund its natural gas
purchases and to fulfill its obligations to maintain deposit accounts with its
counterparties see note 3 of notes to consolidated financial statements

2 a heating degree day is equivalent to each degree that the average of the
    high and the low temperatures for a day is below 65 degrees the colder the
    climate the greater the number of heating degree days heating degree days
    are used in the natural gas industry to measure the relative coldness of
    weather and to compare relative temperatures between one geographic area and
    another normal degree days are based on 30year average national weather
    service data for selected locations degree day information for 2002 and
    2001 is adjusted for service areas included in the midstates division and
    the kentucky division which have weather normalized operations degree day
    information for 2000 1999 and 1998 has not been adjusted for service areas
    with weather normalized operations as that information was not available

gas sales

     our natural gas utility distribution business is seasonal and highly
dependent on weather conditions in our service areas gas sales to residential
and commercial customers are greater during the winter months than during the
remainder of the year the volumes of gas sales during the winter months will
vary with the temperatures during these months the seasonal nature of our sales
to residential and commercial customers is partially offset by our sales in the
spring and summer months to our agricultural customers in texas colorado and
kansas who use natural gas to operate irrigation equipment

     in addition to weather our revenues are affected by the cost of natural
gas and economic conditions in the areas that we serve higher gas costs which
we are generally able to pass through to our customers under purchased gas
adjustment clauses may cause customers to conserve or in the case of
industrial customers to use alternative energy sources

     to protect against volatility in gas prices we are hedging gas costs for
the 20022003 heating season by using a combination of storage financial hedges
and fixed forward contracts to stabilize gas prices for the 20022003 heating
season we have covered between 45 and 50 percent of our anticipated flowing gas
requirements through storage and financial instruments the gas hedges should
help to moderate the effects of higher customer accounts receivable caused by
potentially higher gas prices

     we also have weather normalization adjustments in our rate jurisdictions in
tennessee georgia and kentucky which protect against earnings volatility we
purchased a threeyear weather insurance policy for our texas and louisiana
operations commencing with the 20012002 heating season with an option to
cancel in the third year if we obtain weather protection in our rate structures
the policy covers the entire heating

discussion and analysis of operations

     our distribution systems have experienced aggregate peak day deliveries of
approximately 20 bcf per day we have the ability to curtail deliveries to
certain customers under the terms of interruptible contracts and applicable
state statutes or regulations which enable us to maintain our deliveries to high
priority customers we have not imposed curtailment in our texas division since
we began independent operations in 1983 or in our louisiana division since we
acquired trans louisiana gas company in 1986 and louisiana gas service in 2001
the kentucky division curtailed deliveries to certain interruptible customers
during exceptionally cold periods in december 1989 january 1994 and during the
winter of 1996 neither the coloradokansas division nor its predecessor
greeley gas company has curtailed deliveries to its sales customers since prior
to 1980 the midstates division curtails interruptible service customers from
time to time each year in accordance with the interruptible contracts and
tariffs

gas supply

     we receive gas deliveries in our utility operations through 35 pipeline
transportation companies both interstate and intrastate to satisfy our sales
market requirements the pipeline transportation agreements are firm and many of
them have pipeline nonotice storage service which provides for daily balancing
between system requirements and nominated flowing supplies these agreements
have been negotiated with the shortest term necessary while still maintaining
our right of first refusal

     the kentucky divisions gas supply is delivered primarily by the following
pipelines williams pipelinetexas gas tennessee gas trunkline midwestern
pipeline and anr during 2002 the kentucky division sought and was granted
approval by the kentucky public service commission for a four year extension of
its performancebased rate program which commenced in july 1998 under the
performancebased program we and our customers jointly share in any actual gas
cost savings achieved when compared to predetermined benchmarks we also have
similar gas cost performancebased rate mechanisms in georgia and tennessee

     our midstates division is served by 13 interstate pipelines the majority
of the volumes are transported through east tennessee pipeline southern natural
gas tennessee gas pipeline and columbia gulf

     colorado interstate gas company williams pipelinecentral public service
company of colorado and northwest pipeline are the principal transporters of the
coloradokansas divisions requirements additionally the coloradokansas
division purchases substantial volumes from producers that are connected
directly to its distribution system

     our texas division receives transportation service from oneok pipeline in
addition the texas division purchases a significant portion of its supply from
pioneer natural resources which is connected directly to our amarillo texas
distribution system

     louisiana intrastate gas company acadian pipeline gulf south and williams
pipelinetexas gas pipelines deliver most of the louisiana divisions
requirements

     we also own or hold an interest in and operate numerous natural gas storage
facilities in kentucky kansas and louisiana which are used to help meet
customer requirements during peak demand periods and to reduce the need to
contract for additional pipeline capacity to meet such peak demand periods
additionally we operate one propane plant and a liquefied natural gas plant for
peak shaving purposes we also contract for storage service in underground
storage facilities on many of the interstate pipelines serving us see item 2
properties below for further information regarding the peak shaving facilities

     we normally inject gas into pipeline storage systems and company owned
storage facilities during the summer months and withdraw it in the winter
months our underground storage facilities in kansas kentucky and louisiana
have a combined maximum daily output capability of approximately 266000 mcf

     we purchase our gas supply from various producers and marketers supply
arrangements are contracted on a firm basis with various terms at market prices
the firm supply consists of both base load and swing supply quantities base
load quantities are those that flow at a constant level throughout the month and
swing

                                        13
page

supply quantities provide the flexibility to change daily quantities to match
increases or decreases in requirements related to weather conditions except for
local production purchases we select suppliers through a competitive bidding
process by requesting proposals from suppliers that have demonstrated that they
can provide reliable service we select these suppliers based on their ability
to deliver gas supply to our designated firm pipeline receipt points at the best
cost major suppliers during fiscal 2002 were reliant energy pioneer natural
resources duke energy our nonutility subsidiary woodward marketing oneok gas
marketing bp energy anadarko and tenaska marketing we do not anticipate
problems with obtaining additional gas supply as needed for our customers

regulation

     each of our utility divisions is regulated by various state or local public
utility authorities we are also subject to regulation by the united states
department of transportation with respect to safety requirements in the
operation and maintenance of our gas distribution facilities our distribution
operations are also subject to various state and federal laws regulating
environmental matters from time to time we receive inquiries regarding various
environmental matters we believe that our properties and operations
substantially comply with and are operated in substantial conformity with
applicable safety and environmental statutes and regulations there are no
administrative or judicial proceedings arising under environmental quality
statutes pending or known to be contemplated by governmental agencies which
would have a material adverse effect on us or our operations our environmental
claims have arisen out of manufactured gas plant sites in tennessee and missouri
and mercury contamination sites in kansas see note 5 of notes to consolidated
financial statements

rates

     the method of determining regulated rates varies among the states in which
our utility divisions operate the regulators have the responsibility of
ensuring that utilities under their jurisdiction operate in the best interests
of customers while providing the utilities the opportunity to earn a reasonable
return on investment in a general rate case the applicable regulatory
authority which is typically the state public utility commission establishes a
base margin which is the amount of revenue authorized to be collected from
customers to recover authorized operating expense other than the cost of gas
depreciation interest taxes and return on rate base the divisions in our
utility operations segment perform annual deficiency studies for each rate
jurisdiction to determine when to file rate cases

     substantially all of our sales to our customers fluctuate with the cost of
gas that we purchase rates established by regulatory authorities are adjusted
for increases and decreases in our purchased gas cost through purchased gas
adjustment mechanisms purchased gas adjustment mechanisms provide gas utilities
a method of recovering purchased gas costs on an ongoing basis without the
necessity of a rate case addressing all of the utilities nongas costs these
mechanisms are commonly utilized when regulatory authorities recognize a
particular type of expense such as purchased gas costs that i is subject to
significant price fluctuations compared to the utilitys other costs ii
represents a large component of the utilitys cost of service and iii is
generally outside the control of the gas utility such purchased gas adjustment
mechanisms are not designed to allow the utility to earn a profit but are
designed to allow a dollarfordollar recovery of fuel costs therefore while
our operating revenues may fluctuate gross profit which is defined as
operating revenues less purchased gas cost is generally not eroded or enhanced
because of gas cost increases or decreases

     approximately 98 percent of our revenues in the fiscal year ended september
30 2002 and approximately 96 percent of our revenues in fiscal 2001 were
derived from sales at rates set by or subject to approval by local or state
authorities generally the regulatory authority reviews our rate request and
establishes a rate structure intended to generate revenue sufficient to cover
our costs of doing business and provide a reasonable return on invested capital

     tariff revisions which resulted in an increase in annual revenues of 05
     million during the first 24month period subsequent to the first 24month
     period adjusted rates will provide an increase in annual revenues of 04
     million

competition

     our utility operations are not currently in significant direct competition
with any other distributors of natural gas to residential and commercial
customers within our service areas however we do compete with other natural
gas suppliers and suppliers of alternative fuels for sales to industrial and
agricultural customers we compete in all aspects of our business with
alternative energy sources including in particular electricity competition
for residential and commercial customers is increasing promotional incentives
improved equipment efficiencies and promotional rates all contribute to the
acceptability of electrical equipment electric utilities offer electricity as a
rival energy source and compete for the space heating water heating and cooking
markets the principal means to compete against alternative fuels is lower
prices and natural gas historically has maintained its price advantage in the
residential commercial and industrial markets in
                                        15

addition our natural gas marketing segment competes with other natural gas
brokers in obtaining natural gas supplies for customers

ratemaking activity

     the following is a discussion of our ratemaking activity for rate cases
that are currently pending as of september 30 2002 or rate proceedings
completed during the three years ended september 30 2002

     results of our rate activity for the three years ended september 30 2002
can be summarized as follows no rate increases implemented in 2002 net annual
rate increases totaling 64 million implemented in 2001 and net annual rate
increase totaling 121 million in 2000

     in august 1999 the texas division filed rate cases in its west texas
system cities and amarillo texas requesting rate increases of approximately
98 million and 44 million the texas division received an increase in annual
revenues of approximately 21 million in base rates plus an increase of 01
million in service charges in amarillo texas effective for bills rendered on
or after january 1 2000 the agreement with amarillo also provided for changes
in the rate structure to reduce the impact of warmer than normal weather and to
improve the recovery of the actual cost of service calls the texas divisions
request for an annual increase of approximately 98 million from the 67 cities
served by its west texas system was denied in march 2000 this decision was
appealed to the railroad commission of texas subsequently 59 cities
representing approximately 58 percent of the texas divisions customers ratified
a nonbinding settlement agreement the settlement agreement capped the rate
increase at 30 million and entitled the ratifying cities to accept a rate
increase below 30 million in the event the railroad commission adopted a
lesser

                                        19
page

increase for the nonratifying cities eight cities declined to participate in
the settlement and a hearing with the railroad commission was held in august
2000 in december 2000 the railroad commission approved an increase in annual
revenues of approximately 30 million that covered all 67 cities served by the
west texas system effective december 1 2000 in addition the railroad
commission approved a new rate design providing more protection from warmer than
normal weather for our west texas system

     in june 1999 the trans la operations of the louisiana division were
involved in a rate investigation before the louisiana public service commission
including the redesign of rates to mitigate the effects of warm winter weather
a decision was rendered by the louisiana commission in october 1999 that
increased service charges associated with customer service calls and increased
the monthly customer charges from 6 to 9 both effective november 1 1999
while these changes are revenue neutral they have mitigated the impact of
warmer than normal winter weather on earnings the decision also included a
threeyear rate stabilization clause which will allow the trans la operations of
our louisiana divisions rates to be adjusted annually to allow us to earn a
return on equity within certain ranges that will be monitored on an annual
basis

     in connection with its review of our acquisition of louisiana gas service
the louisiana public service commission approved a rate structure that requires
us to share cost savings that resulted from the acquisition with the customers
of louisiana gas service the shared cost savings will be the difference between
operation and maintenance expense in any future year and the 1998 normalized
expense for louisiana gas service indexed for inflation annual changes in
labor costs and customer growth beginning january 1 2002 the customers are
assured annual savings which will be indexed for inflation annual changes in
labor costs and customer growth the sharing mechanism will remain in place for
20 years subject to established modification procedures

     in january and february 2002 our louisiana division submitted its 2001
rate stabilization filings to the louisiana public service commission for the
two gas systems we operate in louisiana recently completed audits by the
louisiana public service commission of these filings found our earnings to be
deficient and that rate adjustments were appropriate approved tariff revisions
which became effective november 1 2002 will result in 158 million in
additional revenue per year during the first 24month period subsequent to the
first 24month period adjusted rates will provide 122 million in total annual
revenue increases as a result of the actions taken by the louisiana public
service commission atmos energy has decreased its overall weather sensitivity
in louisiana

     in october 2002 atmos received written notification from the executive
secretary of the louisiana public service commission that he was asserting that
a monthly facilities fee of approximately 06 million charged since july 2001
to atmos by trans louisiana gas pipeline inc a whollyowned subsidiary of
atmos pursuant to a contract between the parties was excessive the executive
secretary asserted that all monthly facilities fees in excess of approximately
01 million from july 2001 should be refunded to ratepayers with interest

     atmos has responded to the secretary and noted that it has previously made
all required filings with the commission fully disclosing the amount of the
facilities fee atmos intends to file another petition seeking commission
approval of the facilities fee by the end of calendar year 2003 similar to that
filed in 2001 but containing updated data in the interim atmos is continuing
to charge a facilities fee of approximately 06 million per month as the
executive secretarys correspondence does not constitute action of the
commission

     in may 1999 the kentucky division requested from the kentucky public
service commission an increase in revenues a weather normalization adjustment
and changes in rate design to shift a portion of revenues from commodity charges
to fixed rates in december 1999 the kentucky commission granted an increase in
annual revenues of approximately 99 million the new rates were effective for
services rendered on or after december 21 1999 in addition the kentucky
commission approved a fiveyear pilot program for weather normalization
beginning in november 2000

     on march 25 2002 the kentucky commission issued an order approving a four
year extension effective april 1 2002 of the performancebased ratemaking
mechanism related to gas procurement and gas

                                        20

transportation activities filed by the kentucky division the performancebased
ratemaking mechanism is incorporated into the kentucky divisions gas cost
adjustment clause as discussed above it provides for sharing of purchased gas
cost savings between our customers and us we recognized other income of 11
million 02 million and 21 million under the kentucky performancebased
ratemaking mechanism in fiscal years 2002 2001 and 2000

     in november 2000 the coloradokansas division filed a rate case with the
colorado public utilities commission for approximately 42 million in
additional annual revenues in may 2001 we received an increase in annual
revenues of approximately 28 million from the colorado public utilities
commission the new rates went into effect on may 4 2001

     effective april 1 1999 the tennessee regulatory authority approved the
midstates divisions request to continue its performancebased ratemaking
mechanism related to gas procurement and gas transportation activities the
tennessee regulatory authority revised the mechanism from the original twoyear
experimental period by increasing the cap for incentive gains andor losses to
125 million per year under this agreement the mechanism has no expiration
date and can be amended or cancelled by either the midstates division or the
tennessee regulatory authority according to the provisions of the agreement
similar to tennessee the georgia public service commission renewed our
performancebased ratemaking program for an additional three years effective may
1 2002 the gas purchase and capacity release mechanisms of the
performancebased ratemaking mechanism are designed to provide us incentives to
find innovative methods to lower gas costs to our customers we recognized other
income of 04 million 10 million and 02 million in fiscal years 2002 2001
and 2000 attributable to the georgia and tennessee performancebased ratemaking
mechanisms

     in february 2000 the midstates division filed a rate case in illinois
with the illinois commerce commission requesting an increase in annual revenues
of approximately 31 million after review by the illinois commerce commission
the amount requested was revised to approximately 21 million the midstates
division received an increase in annual revenues of approximately 14 million
the new rates went into effect on october 23 2000 and are collected primarily
through an increase in monthly customer charges

     in march 2000 the midstates division filed a rate case in virginia with
the state corporation commission of the commonwealth of virginia requesting an
increase in annual revenues of approximately 23 million the state corporation
commission of virginia reviewed the filing to determine if it met the
appropriate rules and regulations in july 2000 we refiled the case requesting
an increase in revenues of approximately 21 million the commission accepted
the revised filing in april 2001 the midstates division agreed to an annual
rate reduction of 05 million effective beginning with the april 2001 billing
cycle

     in march 2001 the midstates division and the iowa consumer advocate
division of the department of justice reached an agreement for an annual rate
reduction of 03 million relating to our iowa operations the rate reduction
was effective in march 2001

     in 2001 the midstates division filed requests for accounting orders
related to uncollectable delinquencies in three states as a result we were
able to defer 15 million as a regulatory asset

     we continue to monitor rates in all of our service areas to ensure that
they are adequate for the recovery of service costs and return on investment

weather and seasonality

     our natural gas utility distribution business and irrigation sales business
is seasonal and dependent upon weather conditions in our service areas natural
gas sales to residential commercial and public authority customers are affected
by winter heating season requirements this generally results in higher

     the effects of temperatures that are above or below normal are partially
offset in the tennessee and georgia jurisdictions served by the midstates
division and in the kentucky jurisdiction served by the kentucky division
through weather normalization adjustments the georgia public service
commission the tennessee regulatory authority and the kentucky public service
commission have approved weather normalization adjustments the weather
normalization adjustments effective october through may each year in georgia
and november through april each year in tennessee and kentucky allow the
midstates division and the kentucky division to increase the base rate portion
of customers bills when weather is warmer than normal and decrease the base
rate when weather is colder than normal the net effect of the weather
normalization adjustments was an increase in revenue of 60 million in 2002 a
decrease in revenues of 33 million for 2001 and an increase in revenues of
41 million in 2000 approximately 374000 or 27 percent of our meters in
service are located in georgia tennessee and kentucky we did not have weather
normalization adjustments in our other service areas during the year ended
september 30 2002 we also received approval to change our rate structure in
our west texas system of the texas division beginning in december 2000 to help
offset some of the negative effects of weather

     in july 2000 we entered into an agreement to purchase weather hedges for
our texas and louisiana operations effective for the 20002001 heating season
the hedges were designed to help mitigate the effects of weather that was at
least seven percent warmer than normal in both texas and louisiana while
preserving any upside the cost of the weather hedges was approximately 49
million which was amortized over the 20002001 heating season no income was
recognized for the 20002001 heating season for these weather hedges due to the
colder than normal weather the cost of the weather hedges was more than offset
by the positive effects of colder weather on our gross profit

     in june 2001 we purchased a three year weather insurance policy with an
option to cancel in the third year we will receive a refund of a portion of the
cost of the policy if we cancel in the third year the policy is for our texas
and louisiana operations and covers the entire heating season of october to
march beginning with the 20012002 heating season the cost of the threeyear
policy was 132 million which was prepaid and is being amortized over the
appropriate heating seasons based on degree days the insurance is designed to
protect against weather that is at least seven percent warmer than normal for
the entire heating season during the 20012002 heating season weather was not
at least seven percent warmer than normal resulting in no claim having been
filed under the insurance policy only the amortization of 44 million of
premiums was recognized during the heating season

     we have historically hedged approximately 20 to 25 percent of our gas
supply through the use of our underground storage assets for the 20012002
heating season we covered approximately 64 percent of our flowing gas
requirements through storage financial hedges and fixed forward contracts at a
weighted average cost of slightly less than 400 per mcf for the 20022003
heating season we have covered between 45 and 50 percent of our anticipated
flowing gas requirements through storage financial hedges and fixed forward

                                        22
page

contracts at a weighted average cost of less than 400 per mcf this should
provide protection to us and our customers against potential sharp increases in
the price of natural gas during the 20022003 heating season

status of pending acquisition

     in september 2001 we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire
mississippi valley gas company a privately held natural gas utility for 1500
million consisting of 750 million cash and 750 million of atmos common
stock in addition we will repay outstanding longterm debt of mississippi
valley gas of approximately 450 million mississippi valley gas provides
natural gas distribution service to approximately 261500 residential
commercial industrial and other customers located primarily in the northern and
central regions of mississippi on october 31 2002 we announced that we had
received approval from the mississippi public service commission to acquire
mississippi valley gas the transaction had previously received federal
regulatory approval and approvals from the six other state utility commissions
that require approval we expect to close the acquisition in december 2002

critical accounting policies and estimates

     general  our consolidated financial statements were prepared in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states
preparation of these financial statements required us to make estimates and
judgments that affected the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues
and expenses and the related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities
we based our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions
that we believed to be reasonable under the circumstances on an ongoing basis
we evaluate our estimates including those related to risk management and
trading activities allowance for doubtful accounts goodwill and pension and
other post retirement plans actual results may differ from estimates

     regulation  our utility operations are subject to regulation with respect
to rates service maintenance of accounting records and various other matters
by the respective regulatory authorities in the states in which we operate our
accounting policies recognize the financial effects of the ratemaking and
accounting practices and policies of the various regulatory commissions
regulated utility operations are accounted for in accordance with statement of
financial accounting standards no 71 accounting for the effects of certain
types of regulation this statement requires costbased rate regulated entities
that meet certain criteria to reflect the authorized recovery of costs due to
regulatory decisions in their financial statements as a result certain costs
are permitted to be capitalized rather than expensed because they can be
recovered through rates

     risk management and trading activities  we use storage transportation
and requirements contracts forwards overthecounter and exchangetraded
options futures and swap contracts to conduct our risk management and trading
activities changes in the assets and liabilities from risk management activity
result primarily from changes in the valuation of the portfolio of contracts
maturity and settlement of contracts and newly originated transactions the
market prices and models used to value these transactions reflect managements
best estimates considering various factors including closing exchange and
overthecounter quotations the time value of money and volatility factors
underlying the contracts we adjust the values to reflect the potential impact
of liquidating our positions in an orderly manner over a reasonable period of
time under present market conditions changes in market prices directly affect
managements estimate of the fair value of these transactions assumptions
different from those used would impact these carrying values

     allowance for doubtful accounts  for the majority of our receivables we
establish an allowance for doubtful accounts based on an aging of those
receivable balances we apply percentages to each aging category based on our
collections experience on certain other receivables where we are aware of a
specific customers inability or reluctance to pay we record an allowance for
doubtful accounts against amounts due to reduce the net receivable balance to
the amount we reasonably expect to collect we believe our allowance for
doubtful accounts is adequate however if circumstances change our estimate of
the recoverability of accounts receivable could be different

     goodwill  at september 30 2002 we had 1850 million of goodwill
1503 million of which was attributable to our utility segment 213 million
was attributable to our natural gas marketing segment and
                                        23
page

134 million was attributable to our other nonutility segment we evaluate our
goodwill balances for impairment each year during our second fiscal quarter our
evaluation during the quarter ended march 31 2002 resulted in no impairment if
our projections of estimated future cash flows change those changes could
result in a reduction in the carrying value of our goodwill

     pension and other postretirement plans  pension and other postretirement
plan expenses and liabilities are determined on an actuarial basis and are
affected by the market value of plan assets estimates of the expected return on
plan assets and assumed discount rates actual changes in the fair market value
of plan assets and differences between the actual return on plan assets and the
expected return on plan assets could have a material effect on the amount of
pension expense ultimately recognized the assumed return on plan assets is
based on managements expectation of the longterm return on plan assets
portfolio the discount rate used to compute the present value of plan
liabilities is based generally on rates of high grade corporate bonds with
maturities similar to the average period over which benefits will be paid

                        capital resources and liquidity
                 see consolidated statements of cash flows

     fiscal 2002 was a year in which total cash inflows exceeded total cash
outflows this was generally the result of increased cash flows from operating
activities as a result of the louisiana gas service assets acquired in july
2001 the acquisition of the remaining 55 percent of woodward marketing that we
did not already own in april 2001 and a decrease in cash held in margin accounts
partially offset by increased capital expenditures common stock issued
primarily through our retirement savings plan and our direct stock purchase plan
was also used to finance operations

cash flows from operating activities

     items on the consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended
september 30 2001 reflect changes in balances for the year net of assets
acquired and liabilities assumed in the acquisition of the additional interest
in woodward marketing llc and the assets of louisiana gas service company
and lgs natural gas company see note 10 of notes to consolidated financial
statements

     cash flows from operating activities as reported in the consolidated
statements of cash flows totaled 2962 million for 2002 compared to 830
million for 2001 and 542 million for 2000 the increase in net cash provided
by operating activities from 2001 to 2002 was primarily the result of increases
in net income accounts payable and other current liabilities and decreases in
cash held on deposit in margin accounts and deferred gas costs the increase in
net cash provided by operating activities was partially offset by increases in
accounts receivable the increase in net income was due primarily to higher
gross profit and income from our gas marketing activities partially offset by
higher operating expenses and interest expense

cash flows from investing activities

     during the last three years a substantial portion of our cash resources
was used to fund acquisitions our ongoing construction program to provide
natural gas services to our customer base and technology improvements net cash
used in investing activities totaled 1582 million in 2002 compared with 4681
million in 2001 and 1001 million in 2000 capital expenditures in fiscal 2002
amounted to 1323 million compared with 1131 million in 2001 and 756
million in 2000 the increase in capital expenditures from 2001 to 2002 was
primarily the result of additional capital requirements needed due to our
growing customer base included in investing activities for 2002 is 157
million in our natural gas marketing and other nonutility operations for the
acquisition of kentuckybased market area storage and associated pipeline
facility assets certain gas marketing assets and the common stock of southern
resources inc included in investing activities for 2001 is 3634 million used
to acquire the assets of louisiana gas service company and lgs natural gas
company as discussed in note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial
statements included in investing activities in 2000 was 320 million used to
acquire the missouri natural gas distribution assets of associated natural gas
currently budgeted capital expenditures for fiscal 2003 total approximately
1602 million and include funds for additional mains services meters and
equipment in 2003 we also plan to complete the
                                        24

mississippi valley gas company acquisition for 1500 million plus the repayment
of approximately 450 million of outstanding longterm debt as discussed in
note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements capital expenditures
and acquisitions for fiscal 2003 are planned to be financed from internally
generated funds and financing activities as discussed below in 2002 we had
85 million in expenditures for assets to be used in leasing activities in
2001 we had 54 million in expenditures for assets to be used in leasing
activities in connection with our acquisition of woodward marketing in 2001 we
received 86 million in cash in 2001 we received net proceeds of 66 million
in connection with the sale of certain utility assets in 2000 we received net
proceeds of 65 million in connection with the sale of certain propane assets
to heritage propane partners lp

cash flows from financing activities

     net cash used by financing activities totaled 1064 million for 2002
compared with net cash provided by financing activities of 3930 million for
2001 and 447 million for 2000 financing activities during these periods
included issuance of common stock dividend payments shortterm borrowings from
banks under our credit facilities and issuance and repayment of longterm debt
the change in cash used by financing activities in 2002 as compared to cash
provided by financing activities in 2001 was due primarily to the issuance of
longterm debt and the issuance of common stock during 2001 in 2001 we
received 3471 million in net proceeds from our 3500 million debt offering in
may 2001 the net proceeds were used to help finance the completion of the
louisiana gas service company and lgs natural gas company acquisition in july
2001 longterm debt repayments totaled 207 million 177 million and 146
million for 2002 2001 and 2000 repayments of longterm debt in 2002 2001 and
2000 consisted of annual installments under the various loan documents during
2002 shortterm debt decreased by 555 million due primarily to more effective
collection experience of customer accounts receivable balances which increased
the amount of cash available to reduce shortterm debt during 2001 shortterm
debt decreased 488 million due primarily to the use of the net proceeds from
our equity offering in december 2000 to reduce commercial paper debt during
2000 shortterm debt increased 817 million due to the effect of warmer
weather on net income for 2000 the acquisition of the missouri natural gas
distribution assets of associated natural gas for 320 million and increases in
accounts receivable cost of gas stored underground and deferred charges

     issuance of common stock  we issued 884431 674468 and 704540 shares of
common stock in 2002 2001 and 2000 under our various plans see the
consolidated statements of shareholders equity and note 6 of notes to
consolidated financial statements for the number of shares issued and available
for issuance under each of our plans in addition to the shares issued under our
various plans we also issued 6741500 shares through our equity offering in
december 2000 and 1423193 shares of restricted common stock for the
acquisition of the remaining 55 percent of woodward marketing in april 2001 the
net proceeds from the equity offering were used to reduce commercial paper debt
as discussed above

     cash dividends paid  we paid 486 million in cash dividends during 2002
compared with 441 million in 2001 and 360 million in 2000 we increased the
dividend per share by 02 in both 2002 and 2001 and 04 in 2000 the increase
in cash dividends in 2002 over 2001 was also due to the increase in the number
of shares outstanding as discussed above

liquidity

     the excess of cash inflows over outflows has resulted in a slight decrease
in debt as a percentage of total capitalization including shortterm debt as
shown in the table below

     total debt as a percentage of total capitalization including shortterm
debt was 594 percent and 610 percent at september 30 2002 and 2001 our
longterm plans are to decrease the debt to capitalization ratio to nearer its
target range of 5052 percent through cash flow generated from operations
continued issuance of new common stock under our direct stock purchase plan and
retirement savings plan access to the debt and equity capital markets and
limiting annual maintenance and capital expenditures it is likely that the debt
to capitalization ratio will remain in its current range in the near term

atmos energy holdings for its nonutility business at september 30 2002 200
million was outstanding any outstanding amounts under the atmos energy holdings
facility are subordinated to woodward marketings 2100 million uncommitted

     in accordance with financial accounting standards no 71 accounting for
the effects of certain types of regulation current period changes in the
assets and liabilities from risk management activities related to our utility
segment are recorded as deferred gas cost on the consolidated balance sheet as
these costs will ultimately be recovered from ratepayers accordingly there is
no earnings impact as a result of the use of these financial instruments upon

management activities on the consolidated balance sheet current period changes
in the assets and liabilities from risk management activities are recognized as
net gains or losses on the consolidated statement of income as gas trading
margin changes in assets and liabilities from risk management activities result
primarily from changes in valuation of the portfolio of contracts maturity and
settlement of contracts and newly originated transactions

     market prices are primarily used to value these transactions in addition
a market price based model is used for valuing certain storage and
transportation contracts these values reflect managements best estimate
considering various factors including closing exchange and overthecounter
quotations time value and volatility factors underlying the contracts the
values are adjusted to reflect the potential impact of liquidating our position
in an orderly manner over a reasonable time frame under present market
conditions changes in market prices directly affect managements estimate of
the fair value of these transactions

     at its october 2002 meeting the emerging issues task force rescinded eitf
issue nos 9810 and 0017 the impact on atmos will be to discontinue
marktomarket accounting of our sales storage and transportation contracts and
our natural gas storage inventory any cumulative effect of this change in
accounting will depend on the number and valuation of our sales storage and
transportation contracts and our natural gas storage inventory level and
valuation at the time we adopt the new rules

results of operations

  year ended september 30 2002 compared with year ended september 30 2001

     operating revenues decreased by 34 percent to 9508 million for 2002 from
14 billion for 2001 the most significant factors contributing to the decrease
in operating revenues were a 31 percent decrease in average sales price due to
the decreased cost of gas and a 17 percent decrease in sales volumes due to
warmer weather excluding the additional sales volumes attributable to the
louisiana gas service operations acquired
                                        28
page

in july 2001 during 2002 temperatures were 18 percent warmer than in the
corresponding period of the prior year and were six percent warmer than the
30year normal adjusted for service areas with weather normalized operations
the total volume of gas sold excluding the louisiana gas service volumes for
2002 was 1306 bcf compared with 1565 bcf for 2001 however the decrease in
sales volumes was partially offset by the additional sales volumes of 149 bcf
attributable to the louisiana gas service operations acquired in july 2001 the
average cost of gas per mcf sold decreased 44 percent to 381 for 2002 from
683 for 2001 however the decrease in operating revenues was partially offset
by increased revenues resulting from the louisiana gas service acquisition in
july 2001

     gross profit increased by five percent to 3926 million for 2002 from
3747 million for 2001 the increase in gross profit was due primarily to the
additional gross profit resulting from the louisiana gas service acquisition in
july 2001 partially offset by the effect of warmer weather changes in the cost
of gas do not directly affect gross profit because the fluctuations in gas
prices are passed through to the customer

     in april 2001 we completed our acquisition of the remaining 55 percent
interest in woodward marketing llc that we did not already own as a result
of this acquisition the revenues and expenses of woodward marketing are now
shown on a consolidated basis for 2002 atmos energy marketing which includes
the operations of woodward marketing and trans louisiana industrial gas company
had income of 385 million in gas trading margin for 2001 atmos energy
marketing had income of 05 million in gas trading margin and an equity in
earnings of woodward marketing of 81 million the increase for 2002 compared
to 2001 was primarily due to gains on inventory sales and favorable pricing
under natural gas sales contracts as well as our full consolidation of woodward
marketing beginning april 2001

     operating expenses increased to 2758 million for 2002 from 2449 million
for 2001 operation and maintenance expense increased due primarily to the
addition of 215 million relating to the louisiana gas service acquisition in
july 2001 and an increase of 107 million in pension costs in addition
operation and maintenance expense increased 92 million due to the full
consolidation of woodward marketings operations beginning april 1 2001 a
decrease in the provision for doubtful accounts of 262 million partially
offset this increase the decrease in the provision for doubtful accounts was
attributable to the lower gas commodity prices during 2002 as well as our
effective recovery of customer receivable balances depreciation and
amortization increased 138 million due to the addition of the assets from the
louisiana gas service acquisition in july 2001 taxes other than income
decreased as a result of decreased city franchise taxes and state gross receipts
taxes which are revenue based however these taxes are paid by our customers
thus these amounts are offset in revenues through customer billings and have no
effect on net income the decrease in taxes other than income was partially
offset by increases in property and payroll taxes related to the louisiana gas
service acquisition in july 2001

     operating income increased 19 percent for 2002 to 1553 million from
1303 million for 2001 the increase in operating income resulted primarily
from the increase in gross profit and the income from our gas trading margin
described above partially offset by an increase in operating expenses

     miscellaneous expense decreased 06 million to 13 million in 2002
compared to 19 million in 2001 this decrease was due primarily to an increase
in net recoveries related to our performance basedratemaking mechanisms the
recognition of 05 million related to a large industrial contract we received
during 2002 and a reduction in the amortization expense recognized related to
weather insurance purchased for the 20012002 heating season in addition we
had an increase of 30 million in interest income in may 2001 due primarily to
interest income earned on the proceeds from our 3500 million debt offering in
2001 we invested these proceeds in shortterm investments until the completion
of the louisiana gas service acquisition in july 2001 no such interest income
was recognized in 2002

     interest expense increased 122 million to 592 million for 2002 compared
to 470 million for 2001 this increase was due primarily to the interest
expense on the 3500 million debt offering in may 2001

     net income increased for 2002 by 36 million to 597 million from 561
million for 2001 this increase in net income resulted primarily from the
increase in operating income partially offset by the increase in interest
expense discussed above

  year ended september 30 2001 compared with year ended september 30 2000

     operating revenues increased by 70 percent to 14 billion for 2001 from
8502 million for 2000 the most significant factors contributing to the
increase in operating revenues were a 58 percent increase in average sales price
due to the increased cost of gas and a 10 percent increase in sales and
transportation volumes due to colder weather during 2001 excluding service
areas with weather normalized operations temperatures were 31 percent colder
than in the corresponding period of the prior year and were seven percent colder
than the 30year normal the total volume of gas sold and transported for 2001
was 2178 bcf compared with 1976 bcf for 2000 during the early part of our
2001 fiscal year natural gas prices throughout the country began to increase
significantly the average cost of gas per mcf sold increased to 683 for 2001
from 379 for 2000 although we expect to recover our purchased gas costs from
customers through purchased gas adjustment mechanisms generally there is a lag
between the time we pay for gas purchases and the time when regulators allow us
to place higher rates in service and recover those gas costs as a result we
have from time to time used shortterm borrowings to temporarily finance
unrecovered purchased gas costs where permitted we have increased our
purchased gas adjustments to help mitigate the increased cost of gas in
addition as a result of the increased gas costs our accounts receivable
balances during fiscal 2001 increased significantly and consequently we also
increased our allowance for doubtful accounts which we considered to be
adequate we do not however expect this rise in natural gas prices to have a
material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations or net
cash flows

     in addition operating revenues increased due to the impact of rate
increases in kentucky illinois colorado amarillo texas and west texas also
contributing to the increase in operating revenues was the addition of
approximately 48000 customers in missouri due to the associated natural gas
acquisition completed in fiscal 2000 and the addition of approximately 279000
residential and commercial meters in louisiana due to the completion of the
louisiana gas service company acquisition in july 2001 however operating
revenues were partially offset by a reduction related to our former propane
assets which were placed into a joint venture partnership in august 2000

     gross profit increased by 15 percent to 3747 million for 2001 from 3257
million for 2000 the increase in gross profit was due primarily to the increase
in volumes sold to weather sensitive customers an increase of 51 million in
transportation revenues due to higher average transportation revenue per mcf and
increased volumes and a 67 million nonrecurring adjustment to purchased gas
cost to reflect state filings in addition gross profit increased due to the
impact of rate increases and additional customers partially offset by a
reduction related to our former propane operations changes in the cost of gas
do not directly affect gross profit because the fluctuations in gas prices are
passed through to our customers

     on april 1 2001 we completed our acquisition of the remaining 55 percent
interest in woodward marketing llc as a result of this acquisition the
revenues and expenses of woodward marketing are now shown on a consolidated
basis

     operating expenses increased to 2449 million for 2001 from 2404 million
for 2000 operation and maintenance expense decreased due to savings resulting
from the continued cost control initiatives started during fiscal 2000 and
reduced operation and maintenance expenses associated with our former propane
operations which were placed into a joint venture partnership in fiscal 2000 an
increase in the provision for doubtful accounts of 85 million and pension
costs of 45 million partially offset this decrease depreciation and
amortization expense increased due to the completion of the louisiana gas
service company and lgs natural gas company acquisition in july 2001 taxes
other than income increased as a result of increased city franchise taxes and
state gross receipts taxes which are revenue based however these taxes are
paid by our customers thus these amounts are offset in revenues through
customer billings and have no effect on net income

     operating income increased 53 percent for 2001 to 1303 million from 853
million for 2000 the increase in operating income resulted primarily from
increased gross profit described above

                                        30
page

     equity in earnings of woodward marketing llc was 81 million for the
six months ended march 31 2001 compared with 73 million for the year 2000

     miscellaneous income expense decreased 93 million to 19 million for
2001 compared to 74 million for 2000 this decrease was due primarily to
charges incurred related to our performancebased ratemaking mechanisms and the
amortization of 49 million related to weather hedges purchased for our
louisiana and texas operations in addition we recognized a gain of 58
million in 2000 resulting from the sale of certain nonutility assets no such
gain occurred in 2001 partially offsetting the decrease in miscellaneous income
expense during 2001 was an increase of 30 million in interest income due
primarily to interest income earned on the proceeds from our 3500 million debt
offering in may 2001 we invested these proceeds in shortterm investments until
the completion of the louisiana gas service company and lgs natural gas company
acquisition in july 2001

     interest expense increased 32 million to 470 million for 2001 compared
to 438 million for 2000 this increase was due primarily to interest expense
on the 3500 million debt offering in may 2001

     net income increased for 2001 by 202 million to 561 million from 359
million for 2000 this increase in net income resulted primarily from the
increase in sales volumes due to the colder than normal weather and the impact
of rate increases discussed above

factors that may affect future performance of the company

     our performance in the future will primarily depend on the results of our
utility and natural gas marketing operations several factors exist that could
influence atmos future financial performance some of which are described
below they should be considered in connection with evaluating forwardlooking
statements contained in this report or otherwise made by or on behalf of us
since these factors could cause actual results and conditions to differ
materially from those projected in these forwardlooking statements

  adverse weather conditions

     our natural gas sales volumes and related revenues are correlated with
heating requirements that result from cold winter weather our agricultural
sales volumes are associated with the rainfall levels during the growing season
in our west texas irrigation market weather is one of the most significant
factors influencing our performance however as was more fully discussed above
we have purchased weather insurance to mitigate the effect of warmer than
historically normal weather in our texas and louisiana service areas in
addition weather normalized rates are in effect in several of our
jurisdictions which should mitigate the adverse effects of warmer than normal
weather on our operating results

  national regional and local economic conditions

     our operations will always be affected by the conditions and overall
strength of the national regional and local economies including interest
rates changes in the capital markets and increases in the costs of our primary
commodity natural gas these factors impact the amount of residential
industrial and commercial growth in our service territories higher costs of
natural gas in recent years have already caused many of our customers to
conserve in the use of our gas services and could lead to even more customers
utilizing such conservation methods

  regulatory approvals

     our utility business is subject to various regulated returns on its rate
base in each of the 11 states in which we operate we monitor the allowed rates
of return our effectiveness in earning such rates and initiate rate proceedings
or operating changes as needed in addition in the normal course of the
regulatory environment assets are placed in service and historical test periods
are established before rate cases can be filed once rate cases are filed
regulatory bodies have the authority to suspend implementation of the new rates
while studying the cases because of this process we must temporarily suffer
the negative financial effects of having placed assets in service without the
benefit of rate relief which is commonly referred to as regulatory lag in

                                        31
page

addition our debt and equity financing programs are also subject to approval by
regulatory bodies in five states which could limit our ability to take
advantage of favorable shortterm market conditions

  successful completion and integration of pending acquisition

     our acquisition strategy depends on our ability to successfully acquire and
integrate the operations of companies such as mississippi valley gas company
which acquisition is currently expected to close in december 2002 acquisitions
such as mississippi valley gas should help us achieve greater economies of scale
by spreading the fixed costs of the utility business over a larger customer
base in addition the integration of this acquisition into our operations
during the next fiscal year will require a substantial commitment of financial
resources and management time

  inflation and increased gas costs

     we believe that inflation has caused and will continue to cause increases
in certain operating expenses and has required and will continue to require
assets to be replaced at higher costs we have a process in place to continually
review the adequacy of our gas rates in relation to the increasing cost of
providing service and the inherent regulatory lag in adjusting those gas rates
historically we have been able to budget and control operating expenses and
investments within the amounts authorized to be collected in rates and intend to
continue to do so the ability to control expenses is an important factor that
will influence future results

     in addition the rapid increases in the price of purchased gas as has
occurred in some prior years causes us to experience a significant increase in
shortterm debt because we must pay suppliers for such gas when it is purchased
long before such costs may be recovered through the collection of monthly
customer bills for gas delivered also increases in purchased gas costs cause
more customers to be slow to pay their gas bills leading to higher than normal
accounts receivable which in turn lead to higher shortterm debt levels and
increased bad debts should the price of purchased gas increase significantly in
the upcoming heating season we would expect increases in our shortterm debt
and accounts receivable during fiscal 2003

  increased competition

     we are facing increased competition from other energy suppliers as well as
electric companies and from energy marketing and trading companies in the case
of industrial customers such as manufacturing plants and agricultural
customers adverse economic conditions including higher gas costs could cause
such customers to use alternative sources of energy such as electricity or to
bypass our systems in favor of special competitive contracts with lower perunit
costs

  deregulation or unbundling

     we are closely monitoring the development of unbundling initiatives in the
natural gas industry unbundling is the separation of the provision and pricing
of local distribution gas services into discrete components it typically
focuses on the separation of the distribution and gas supply components and the
resulting opening of the regulated components of sales services to alternative
unregulated suppliers of those services because of our enhanced technology and
distribution system infrastructures we believe that we are now positively
positioned as unbundling evolves consequently we expect there would be no
significant adverse effect on our business should unbundling or further
deregulation of the natural gas distribution service business occur

                                        32

  hedging and market risk activities

  utility hedging activities

     to protect against volatility in gas prices we are hedging gas costs for
the 20022003 heating season by utilizing a combination of storage financial
hedges and fixed forward contracts to stabilize gas prices for the 20022003
heating season we have covered approximately 45 to 50 percent of our
anticipated flowing gas requirements through storage and financial instruments
the gas hedges should help to moderate the effects of higher customer accounts
receivable caused by potentially higher gas prices

  atmos energy marketing activities

     we acquired a 45 percent interest in woodward marketing llc in july
1997 as a result of the merger of atmos and united cities gas company which had
acquired that interest in may 1995 in april 2001 we acquired the 55 percent
interest that we did not own from jd woodward and others for 1423193
restricted shares of our common stock immediately following the acquisition
mr woodward was elected as a senior vice president of atmos in charge of all
nonutility business activities a position he has held since april 2001 prior
to that time mr woodward had not been an officer or employee of atmos

     the principal business of atmos energy marketing including the activities
of woodward marketing and trans louisiana industrial gas company inc is the
overall management of natural gas requirements for municipalities local gas
utility companies and industrial customers located primarily in the southeastern
and midwestern united states this business involves the sale of natural gas by
atmos energy marketing to its customers and the management of storage and
transportation contracts for its customers under contracts generally having one
to twoyear terms at september 30 2002 atmos energy marketing had 101
municipal customers and 641 industrial customers atmos energy marketing also
sells natural gas to certain of its industrial customers on a delivered burner
tip basis under contract terms from 30 days to two years in addition atmos
energy marketing supplies our regulated operations with a portion of our natural
gas requirements on a competitive bid basis any marktomarket gains or losses
on these affiliate contacts are eliminated

     in the management of natural gas requirements for municipal and other local
utilities atmos energy marketing sells physical natural gas for future delivery
and manages the associated price risk through the use of gas futures forwards
overthecounter and exchangetraded options and swap contracts with
counterparties these financial contracts are markedtomarket at the daily
close of business atmos energy marketing links gas derivatives to physical
delivery of natural gas and typically balances its derivatives positions at the
end of each trading day overthecounter swap agreements require atmos energy
marketing to receive or make payments based on the difference between a fixed
price and the market price of natural gas on the settlement date atmos energy
marketing uses these futures and swaps to manage margins on offsetting fixed
price purchase or sale commitments for physical quantities of natural gas which
are also carried on a marktomarket basis marktomarket accounting refers to
the measurement of contracts at fair value determined at the balance sheet date
with any gains and losses included in earnings options held to manage price
risk provide the right but not the requirement to buy or sell energy
commodities at a fixed price atmos energy marketing uses options to manage
margins and to limit overall price risk exposure at any point in time atmos
energy marketing may not have completely offset its price risk on these
activities

     energy related services provided by atmos energy marketing include the sale
of natural gas to its various customer classes and management of transportation
and storage assets and inventories more specifically energy services include
contract negotiation and administration load forecasting storage acquisition
natural gas purchase and delivery and capacity utilization strategies in
providing these services atmos energy marketing generates income from its
utility municipal and industrial customers through negotiated prices based on
the volume of gas supplied to the customer atmos energy marketing also
generates income by taking advantage of the difference between nearterm gas
prices and prices for future delivery as well as the daily movement of gas
prices by utilizing storage and transportation capacity that it controls

     prior to may 2002 atmos energy marketing engaged in limited financial
trading for speculative purposes financial trading involves utilizing financial
instruments futures options swaps etc to hedge natural gas prices or to
take a position in the market based on anticipated price movement in some prior
years atmos energy marketing experienced losses in its financial speculative
trading business effective in may 2002 atmos energy marketings financial
trading for speculative purposes was discontinued atmos energy marketing will
continue its financial trading for hedging risk management purposes related to
its physical trading positions with regard to its physical trading business
atmos energy marketing does engage in limited speculative natural gas trading
for its own account primarily related to its storage activity subject to a risk
management policy established by us which limits the level of trading loss to a
maximum of 25 percent of the budgeted annual operating income of atmos energy
holdings physical trading involves utilizing physical assets storage and
transportation to sell and deliver gas to customers or to take a position in
the market based on anticipated price movement compliance with such risk
management policy is monitored on a daily basis in addition woodward
marketings bank credit facility limits trading positions that are not closed at
the end of the day open positions to 50 bcf of natural gas at september 30
2002 atmos energy marketings net open positions in its trading operations
totaled 19 bcf atmos energy marketings open trading positions are monitored
on a daily basis but are not required to be closed if they remain within the
limits set by the bank loan agreement in addition to the price risk of any net
open position at the end of each trading day the financial exposure that
results from intraday fluctuations of gas prices and the potential for daily
price movements constitutes a risk of loss since the price of natural gas
purchased or sold for future delivery at the beginning of the day may not be
hedged until later in the day

     financial instruments which subject atmos energy marketing to counterparty
risk consist primarily of financial instruments arising from trading and risk
management activities and overnight repurchase agreements that are not insured
counterparty risk is the risk of loss from nonperformance by financial
counterparties to a contract exchangetraded future and option contracts are
generally guaranteed by the exchanges

     atmos energy marketings operations are concentrated in the natural gas
industry and its customers and suppliers may be subject to economic risks
affecting that industry

     from time to time woodward marketing borrows money to fund its natural gas
purchases and to fulfill its obligations to maintain deposit accounts with its
counterparties see note 3 of notes to consolidated financial statements



item 7a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

     the risk inherent in our market risk sensitive instruments is the potential
loss arising from adverse changes in natural gas commodity prices and interest
rates as discussed below the sensitivity analysis does not however consider
the effects that such adverse changes may have on overall economic activity nor
do they consider additional actions we may take to mitigate exposure to such
changes actual results may differ

gas prices

  utility segment

     we purchase natural gas for our operations substantially all of the cost
of gas purchased for utility operations is recovered through purchased gas
adjustment mechanisms the utility segment has a limited market risk in gas
prices related to gas purchases in the open market at spot prices for sale to
nonregulated energy services customers at fixed prices as a result our
earnings could be affected by changes in the price and availability of such gas
to protect against volatility in gas prices we from time to time hedge our gas
costs by purchasing futures contracts our utility segment does not use such
financial instruments for trading purposes and we are not a party to any
leveraged derivatives market risk is estimated as a hypothetical 10 percent
increase in the portion of our gas cost related to fixedprice nonregulated
sales based on projected fiscal 2003 nonregulated gas sales at fixed prices
such an increase would result in an increase to cost of gas of approximately
41 million in fiscal 2003

  natural gas marketing segment

     in april 2001 we acquired the 55 percent interest in woodward marketing
llc that we did not already own atmos energy marketings principal business
is the management of natural gas requirements for municipalities local gas
utility companies and industrial customers located primarily in the southeastern
and midwestern united states this business involves the sale of natural gas and
the management of storage and transportation contracts for customers under
contracts generally having one to twoyear terms atmos energy marketing also
sells natural gas to industrial customers on a delivered burner tip basis under
contract terms from 30 days to two years in the management of natural gas
requirements for municipal and other local utilities atmos energy marketing
sells natural gas for future delivery and manages price risk through the use of
gas futures including forwards overthecounter and exchangetraded options
futures and swap contracts financial contracts are markedtomarket at the
daily close of business

     prior to may 2002 atmos energy marketing engaged in limited financial
trading for speculative purposes for its own account subject to a risk
management policy established by us which limits the level of trading loss to a
maximum of 25 percent of the budgeted annual operating income of atmos energy
holdings compliance with such risk management policy is monitored on a daily
basis in addition woodward marketings bank credit facility limits open
trading positions to 50 bcf of natural gas atmos energy marketing will
continue its financial trading for hedging risk management purposes related to
its physical trading positions at september 30 2002 atmos energy marketings
open positions in its trading operations totaled 19 bcf in its trading atmos
energy marketings open trading positions are monitored on a daily basis but are
not required to be closed if within the limits set by the bank credit facility
the financial exposure that results from intraday fluctuations of gas prices
and the potential for daily price movements has an impact on the net open
position based on its open positions at september 30 2002 a 50 increase in
market strip would result in a 10 million decrease in the trading gain a 50
decrease in market strip would result in a 10 million increase in the trading
gain

     atmos energy marketing uses gas futures contracts overthecounter and
exchangetraded options and swap agreements in the conduct of its business
atmos energy marketing links gas derivatives to physical delivery of natural gas
and typically balances its derivatives positions at the end of each trading day
overthecounter swap agreements require atmos energy marketing to receive or
make payments based on the difference between a fixed price and the market price
of natural gas on the settlement date atmos energy marketing uses futures and
swaps to manage margins on offsetting fixedprice purchase or sale commitments
for physical quantities of natural gas options held to hedge price risk provide
the right but not the requirement to buy or sell energy commodities at a fixed
price atmos energy marketing uses options to manage margins and to limit
overall price risk exposure

     counterparty risk is the risk of loss from nonperformance by financial
counterparties to a contract financial instruments which subject atmos energy
marketing to counterparty risk consist primarily of financial instruments
arising from trading and risk management activities and overnight repurchase
agreements that are not insured exchange traded future and option contracts are
generally guaranteed by the exchanges

     atmos energy marketings operations are concentrated in the natural gas
industry and its customers and suppliers may be subject to economic risks
affecting that industry therefore an economic downturn in the industry could
have an adverse affect on the creditworthiness of atmos energy marketings
customers atmos energy marketing manages credit risk to attempt to minimize its
exposure to uncollectible receivables in compliance with atmos energy
marketings existing credit policy prospective and existing customers are
reviewed for creditworthiness and customers not meeting minimum standards at
the discretion of management provide security deposits and are subject to
various requisite secured payment terms

interest rates

result of our issuance of shortterm commercial paper and our other shortterm
borrowings if market interest rates for shortterm borrowings in

fiscal 2002 had averaged two percent more our interest expense would have
increased by approximately 27 million

     market risk for fixedrate longterm obligations is estimated as the
potential increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical one percent
decrease in interest rates and amounts to approximately 635 million based on
discounted cash flow analyses

     as of september 30 2002 we were not engaged in other activities which
would cause exposure to the risk of material earnings or cash flow loss due to
changes in interest rates foreign currency exchange rates or market commodity
prices
