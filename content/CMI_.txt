covid19 

the outbreak of covid19 in early 2020 became a global pandemic with the resultant economic impacts evolving into a worldwide recession the pandemic triggered a significant downturn in our markets globally which negatively impacted our sales and results of operations during 2020 while the majority of the negative impacts to demand largely subsided in 2021 we are still experiencing supply chain disruptions and related financial impacts reflected as increased cost of sales our industry continues to be unfavorably impacted by supply chain constraints leading to shortages across multiple components categories and limiting our collective ability to meet enduser demand our customers are also experiencing other supply chain issues and slowing production 

operating segments 

we have five complementary operating segments engine distribution components power systems and new power these segments share technology customers strategic partners brand recognition and our distribution network in order to compete more efficiently and effectively in their respective markets in each of our operating segments we compete worldwide with a number of other manufacturers and distributors that produce and sell similar products our products primarily compete on the basis of performance price total cost of ownership fuel economy emissions compliance speed of delivery quality and customer support 

we use segment earnings or losses before interest expense income taxes depreciation and amortization and noncontrolling interests ebitda as the primary basis for the chief operating decision maker to evaluate the performance of each of our reportable operating segments we believe ebitda is a useful measure of our operating performance as it assists investors and debt holders in comparing our performance on a consistent basis without regard to financing methods capital structure income taxes or depreciation and amortization methods which can vary significantly depending upon many factors see note 22 operating segments to the consolidated financial statements for additional information and a reconciliation of our segment information to the corresponding amounts in our consolidated statements of net income

supply 

the performance of the endtoend supply chain extending through to our suppliers is foundational to our ability to meet customers expectations and support longterm growth we are committed to having a robust strategy for how we select and manage our suppliers to enable a market focused supply chain this requires us to continuously evaluate and upgrade our supply base as necessary as we strive to ensure we are meeting the needs of our customers 

we use a combination of proactive and reactive methodologies to enhance our understanding of supply base risks which guide the development of risk monitoring and sourcing strategies our category strategy process a process designed to create the most value for the company supports the review of our longterm needs and guides decisions on what we make internally and what we purchase externally for the items we decide to purchase externally the strategies also identify the suppliers we should partner with longterm to provide the best technology the lowest total cost and highest supply chain performance we design andor manufacture our strategic components used in or with our engines and power generation units and new power products key suppliers are managed through longterm supply agreements that secure capacity delivery quality and cost requirements are met over an extended period 

other important elements of our sourcing strategy include 

• selecting and managing suppliers to comply with our supplier code of conduct and 

• assuring our suppliers comply with our prohibited and restricted materials policy 

as we adjust to the recovery from the covid19 pandemic and the rapid return of demand in many manufacturing industries we are experiencing supply chain disruptions incremental costs and related challenges throughout the supply chain we continue to monitor the supply chain disruptions utilizing early detection technology complemented by structured supplier risk and resiliency assessments we increased frequency of formal and informal supplier engagement to address potentially impactful supply base constraints and enhanced collaboration to develop specific countermeasures to mitigate risks our global team located in different regions of the world uses various approaches to identify and resolve threats to supply continuity 

patents and trademarks 

we own or control a significant number of patents and trademarks relating to the products we manufacture these patents and trademarks were granted and registered over a period of years although these patents and trademarks are generally considered beneficial to our operations we do not believe any patent group of patents or trademark other than our leading brand house trademarks is significant to our business 

seasonality 

while individual product lines may experience modest seasonal variation in production there is no material effect on the demand for the majority of our products on a quarterly basis with the exception that our power systems segment normally experiences seasonal declines in the first quarter due to general declines in construction spending during this period 

largest customers 

we have thousands of customers around the world and have developed longstanding business relationships with many of them paccar is our largest customer accounting for 15 percent of our consolidated net sales in 2021 15 percent in 2020 and 17 percent in 2019 we have longterm supply agreements with paccar for our heavyduty and mediumduty engines and aftertreatment systems while a significant number of our sales to paccar are under longterm supply agreements these agreements provide for particular engine requirements for specific vehicle models and not a specific volume of engines or aftertreatment systems paccar is our only customer accounting for more than 10 percent of our net sales in 2021 the loss of this customer or a significant decline in the production level of paccar vehicles that use our engines would have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition we have supplied engines to paccar for 77 years a summary of principal customers for each operating segment is included in our segment discussion 

in addition to our agreement with paccar we have longterm heavyduty and mediumduty engine and aftertreatment system supply agreements with navistar and daimler we also have an agreement with stellantis to supply engines for its ram trucks collectively our net sales to these four customers including paccar were 33 percent of our consolidated net sales in 2021 32 percent in 2020 and 37 percent in 2019 excluding paccar net sales to any single customer were less than 8 percent of our consolidated net sales in 2021 less than 7 percent in 2020 and less than 9 percent in 2019 these agreements contain standard purchase and sale agreement terms covering engine aftertreatment and engine parts pricing quality and delivery commitments as well as engineering product support obligations the basic nature of our agreements with oem customers is that they are longterm price and operations agreements that help prove for the availability of our products to each customer through the duration of the respective agreements agreements with most oems contain bilateral termination provisions giving either party the right to terminate in the event of a material breach change of control or insolvency or bankruptcy of the other party 

backlog 

as we adjust to the recovery from the covid19 pandemic and the rapid return of demand in many manufacturing industries we are experiencing supply chain disruptions incremental costs and related challenges throughout the supply chain the supply chain disruptions are impacting our business as well as our suppliers and customers resulting in longer lead times in some of our businesses we have supply agreements with some truck and offhighway equipment oems however most of our business is transacted through open purchase orders these open orders are historically subject to monthtomonth releases and are subject to cancellation on reasonable notice without cancellation charges and therefore are not considered firm we are working closely with our suppliers as discussed in the supply section above as well as with customers to meet the demand and work through backlogs as efficiently as possible 

research and development 

in 2021 we continued to invest in future critical technologies and products we will continue to make investments to develop new products and improve our current technologies to meet future emission requirements around the world and improve fuel economy performance of diesel and natural gaspowered engines and related components as well as development activities around fully electric hybrid and hydrogen power solutions and hydrogen production 

our research and development programs are focused on product improvements product extensions innovations and cost reductions for our customers research and development expenditures include salaries contractor fees building costs utilities testing technical information technology expenses administrative expenses and allocation of corporate costs and are expensed net of contract reimbursements when incurred from time to time we enter into agreements with customers and government agencies to fund a portion of the research and development costs of a particular project when not associated with a sales contract we generally account for these reimbursements as an offset to the related research and development expenditure research and development expenses net of contract reimbursements were 11 billion in 2021 903 million in 2020 and 998 million in 2019 contract reimbursements were 104 million 86 million and 90 million in 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively

we were named to investor business dailys best esg companies list for performance on environmental social and governance matters ranking number 37 we were also ranked number 84 among barrons top 100 most sustainable companies 

environmental compliance 

product certification and compliance 

our engines are subject to extensive statutory and regulatory requirements that directly or indirectly impose standards governing emissions and noise over the past several years we have increased our global environmental compliance presence and expertise to understand and meet emerging product environmental regulations around the world our ability to comply with these and future 

emission standards is an essential element in maintaining our leadership position in regulated markets we made and will continue to make significant capital and research expenditures to comply with these standards 

we strive to be a leader in developing and implementing technologies that provide customers with the highest performing products while minimizing the impact on the environment and we have a long history of working with governments and regulators to achieve these goals we remain committed to ensuring our products meet all current and future emission standards and delivering value to our customers 

formed in 2019 the product compliance and regulatory affairs team leads both engine emissions certification and compliance and regulatory affairs initiatives and is overseen and reports directly to the set committee of the board at least annually this organization is led by the vice president  product compliance and regulatory affairs who reports directly to the chief executive officer the vice president is a member of both the cummins executive team and cummins leadership team the focus of this organization is to strengthen our ability to design great products that help our customers win while complying with increasingly challenging global emission regulations the organization also works to enhance our collaboration with the agencies setting the direction and regulations of emissions as we strive to meet every expectation today while planning for future changes 

following conversations with the us environmental protection agency epa and california air resources board carb regarding certification for the engines in the 2019 ram 2500 and 3500 trucks we made the decision to review our certification process and compliance with emission standards this review is being conducted with external advisers as we strive to ensure the certification and all of our processes for our pickup truck applications are consistent with our internal policies engineering standards and applicable laws we are working closely with the regulators to enhance our emissions systems to improve the effectiveness of all of our pickup truck applications and to fully address the regulators’ requirements based on discussions with the regulators we have developed a new calibration for the engines in model year 2019 ram 2500 and 3500 trucks that has been included in all engines shipped since september 2019 during our discussions the regulators turned their attention to other model years and other engines most notably our pickup truck applications for ram 2500 and 3500 trucks for model years 2013 through 2018 we will continue to work together closely with the relevant regulators to develop and implement recommendations for improvement as part of our ongoing commitment to compliance see note 14 commitments and contingencies to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

engine certifications 

our engines are certified globally through various categories within onhighway and offhighway applications regulations in these categories typically control nitrogen oxides nox particulate matter pm and ghg the current onhighway nox and pm emission standards came into effect in india on april 1 2020 bharat stage vi china on july 1 2019 national standard ns vi the european union eu on january 1 2013 euro vi and on january 1 2010 for the epa to meet these regulations midrange and heavyduty engines for india china eu and epa require nox aftertreatment nox reduction is achieved by an integrated technology solution comprised of the xpi high pressure common rail fuel system scr technology in some cases nextgeneration cooled egr advanced electronic controls proven air handling and the cummins diesel particulate filter dpf the ministry of road transport and highways ministry of ecology and environment eu epa and carb certified that our engines meet the current emission requirements emission standards in international markets including japan mexico australia brazil and russia are becoming more stringent we believe that our experience in meeting the eu and epa emission standards leaves us well positioned to take advantage of opportunities in these markets as the need for emission control capability grows 

in 2013 we certified to epas first ever ghg regulations for onhighway medium and heavyduty engines additionally the epas 2013 regulations added the requirement of onboard diagnostics which were introduced on the isx 15 in 2010 across the full onhighway product line while maintaining the same nearzero emission levels of nox and pm required in 2010 onboard diagnostics provide enhanced service capability with standardized diagnostic trouble codes service tool interface incab warning lamp and service information availability the new ghg and fuelefficiency regulations were required for all heavyduty diesel and natural gas engines beginning in january 2014 our ghg certification was the first engine certificate issued by the epa and uses the same proven base engine with the xpi fuel system variable geometry turbocharger vgt tm  and cummins aftertreatment system with dpf and scr technology application of these engines and aftertreatment technologies continues in our products that comply with the 2021 ghg regulations 

our offhighway engines designed for tier 4  stage v standards were based on our extensive onhighway experience developing scr high pressure fuel systems dpf and vgt tm  our products offer low fuel consumption high torque rise and power output extended maintenance intervals reliable and durable operation and a long life to overhaul period all while meeting the most stringent emission standards in the industrial market our offhighway products power multiple applications including construction mining marine agriculture rail defense and oil and gas and serve a global customer base the current epa tier 4 offhighway emission standards came into effect between 20132015 for all engine power categories the current eu stage v offhighway emission standards became effective in 2019 for certain engine power categories and were completely effective january 2021 for all remaining categories 

other environmental statutes and regulations 

expenditures for environmental control activities and environmental remediation projects at our facilities in the us were not a substantial portion of our annual expenses and are not expected to be material in 2022 we believe we are in compliance in all material respects with laws and regulations applicable to our plants and operations 

in the us pursuant to notices received from federal and state agencies andor defendant parties in site environmental contribution actions we were identified as a potentially responsible party under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of 1980 as amended or similar state laws at fewer than 20 waste disposal sites 

based upon our experiences at similar sites we believe that our aggregate future remediation costs will not be material we have established accruals that we believe are adequate for our expected future liability with respect to these sites in addition we have several other sites where we are working with governmental authorities on remediation projects the costs for these remediation projects are not expected to be material

 item 1a risk factors 

set forth below and elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k are some of the principal risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual business results to differ materially from any forwardlooking statements contained in this report and could individually or in combination have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows these risk factors should be considered in addition to our cautionary comments concerning forwardlooking statements in this report including statements related to markets for our products and trends in our business that involve a number of risks and uncertainties our separate section above cautionary statements regarding forwardlooking information should be considered in addition to the following statements 

government regulation 

we are conducting a formal internal review of our emission certification process and compliance with emission standards with respect to our pickup truck applications and are working with the epa and carb to address their questions about these applications due to the continuing nature of our formal internal review and ongoing discussions with the epa and carb we cannot predict the final results of this formal review and these regulatory processes nor whether or the extent to which they could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and cash flows 

we previously announced that we are conducting a formal internal review of our emissions certification process and compliance with emission standards with respect to all of our pickup truck applications following conversations with the epa and carb regarding certification of our engines for model year 2019 ram 2500 and 3500 trucks during conversations with the epa and carb about the effectiveness of our pickup truck applications the regulators raised concerns that certain aspects of our emissions systems may reduce the effectiveness of our emissions control systems and thereby act as defeat devices as a result our internal review focuses in part on the regulators’ concerns we are working closely with the regulators to enhance our emissions systems to improve the effectiveness of all of our pickup truck applications and to fully address the regulators’ requirements based on discussions with the regulators we have developed a new calibration for the engines in model year 2019 ram 2500 and 3500 trucks that has been included in all engines shipped since september 2019 during our discussions the regulators turned their attention to other model years and other engines most notably our pickup truck applications for ram 2500 and 3500 trucks for model years 2013 through 2018 we will continue to work together closely with the relevant regulators to develop and implement recommendations for improvement as part of our ongoing commitment to compliance due to the continuing nature of the formal review our ongoing cooperation with the regulators and the presence of many unknown facts and circumstances we are not yet able to estimate the financial impact of these matters it is possible that the consequences of any remediation plans resulting from our formal review and these regulatory processes could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and cash flows 

our products are subject to extensive statutory and regulatory requirements that can significantly increase our costs and along with increased scrutiny from regulatory agencies and unpredictability in the adoption implementation and enforcement of increasingly stringent and fragmented emission standards by multiple jurisdictions around the world could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

our engines are subject to extensive statutory and regulatory requirements governing emissions and noise including standards imposed by the epa the eu state regulatory agencies such as the carb and other regulatory agencies around the world regulatory agencies are making certification and compliance with emissions and noise standards more stringent and subjecting diesel engine products to an increasing level of scrutiny the discovery of noncompliance issues could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

developing engines and components to meet more stringent and changing regulatory requirements with different implementation timelines and emission requirements makes developing engines efficiently for multiple markets complicated and could result in substantial additional costs that may be difficult to recover in certain markets while we have met previous deadlines our ability to comply with existing and future regulatory standards will be essential for us to maintain our competitive position in the engine applications and industries we serve the successful development and introduction of new and enhanced products in order to comply with new regulatory requirements are subject to other risks such as delays in product development cost overruns and unanticipated technical and manufacturing difficulties 

in addition to these risks the nature and timing of government implementation and enforcement of increasingly stringent emission standards in our worldwide markets are unpredictable and subject to change any delays in implementation or enforcement could result in a loss of our competitive advantage and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

we operate our business on a global basis and changes in international national and regional trade laws regulations and policies affecting andor restricting international trade could adversely impact the demand for our products and our competitive position 

we manufacture sell and service products globally and rely upon a global supply chain to deliver the raw materials components systems and parts that we need to manufacture and service our products changes in laws regulations and government policies on foreign trade and investment can affect the demand for our products and services cause nonus customers to shift preferences toward domestically manufactured or branded products and impact the competitive position of our products or prevent us from being able to sell products in certain countries our business benefits from free trade agreements such as the united statesmexicocanada agreement and the us trade relationship with china brazil and france and efforts to withdraw from or substantially modify such agreements or arrangements in addition to the implementation of more restrictive trade policies such as more detailed inspections higher tariffs including but not limited to additional tariffs on the import of steel or aluminum and imposition of new or retaliatory tariffs against certain countries including based on developments in us china and russia relations import or export licensing requirements and exchange controls or new barriers to entry could limit our ability to capitalize on current and future growth opportunities in international markets impair our ability to expand the business by offering new technologies products and services and could adversely impact our production costs customer demand and our relationships with customers and suppliers any of these consequences could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

embargoes sanctions and export controls imposed by the us and other governments restricting or prohibiting transactions with certain persons or entities including financial institutions to certain countries or regions or involving certain products limit the sales of our products embargoes sanctions and export control laws are changing rapidly for certain geographies including with respect to china and russia in particular changing us export controls and sanctions on china as well as other restrictions affecting transactions involving china and chinese parties and russian and russian parties could affect our ability to collect receivables provide aftermarket and warranty support for our products sell products and otherwise impact our reputation and business any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

the us government’s pending rules and regulations concerning mandatory covid19 vaccination of usbased employees of companies that work on or in support of federal contracts could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

on september 9 2021 president biden issued an executive order requiring all employers with us government contracts to ensure that their usbased employees contractors and subcontractors that work on or in support of us government contracts are fully vaccinated against covid19 as required by the executive order the executive order includes onsite and remote usbased employees contractors and subcontractors and provides for limited medical and religious exceptions as of december 2021 the executive order has been put on hold by numerous federal courts pending a final outcome by one or more federal appellate courts and possibly the us supreme court in the meantime we continue to track the status of our federal contracts and otherwise prepare for the possible implementation of the order it is currently not possible to predict with certainty the impact the executive order will have on our workforce if it survives the legal challenges additional vaccine mandates may be announced in jurisdictions in which our businesses operate our implementation of these requirements may result in attrition including attrition of critically skilled labor and difficulty securing future labor needs which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

unanticipated changes in our effective tax rate the adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could adversely affect our profitability 

we are subject to income taxes in the us and numerous international jurisdictions our income tax provision and cash tax liability in the future could be adversely affected by the adoption of new tax legislation changes in earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and the discovery of new information in the course of our tax return preparation process the carrying value of deferred tax assets which are predominantly in the us is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income in the us we are also subject to ongoing tax audits these audits can involve complex issues which may require an extended period of time to resolve and can be highly judgmental tax authorities may disagree with certain tax reporting positions taken by us and as a result assess additional taxes against us we regularly assess the likely outcomes of these audits in order to determine the appropriateness of our tax provision the amounts ultimately paid upon resolution of these or subsequent tax audits could be materially different from the amounts previously included in our income tax provision and therefore could have a material impact on our tax provision 

our global operations are subject to laws and regulations that impose significant compliance costs and create reputational and legal risk 

due to the international scope of our operations we are subject to a complex system of commercial and trade regulations around the world recent years have seen an increase in the development and enforcement of laws regarding trade compliance and anti 

corruption such as the us foreign corrupt practices act and similar laws from other countries as well as new regulatory requirements regarding data privacy such as the european union general data protection regulation our numerous foreign subsidiaries affiliates and joint venture partners are governed by laws rules and business practices that differ from those of the us the activities of these entities may not comply with us laws or business practices or our code of business conduct violations of these laws may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions could disrupt our business and result in an adverse effect on our reputation business and results of operations financial condition and cash flows we cannot predict the nature scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our operations might be subject or the manner in which existing laws might be administered or interpreted 

our operations are subject to increasingly stringent environmental laws and regulations 

our plants and operations are subject to increasingly stringent environmental laws and regulations in all of the countries in which we operate including laws and regulations governing air emission discharges to water and the generation handling storage transportation treatment and disposal of waste materials while we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with these environmental laws and regulations there can be no assurance that we will not be adversely impacted by costs liabilities or claims with respect to existing or subsequently acquired operations under either present laws and regulations or those that may be adopted or imposed in the future we are also subject to laws requiring the cleanup of contaminated property if a release of hazardous substances occurs at or from any of our current or former properties or at a landfill or another location where we have disposed of hazardous materials we may be held liable for the contamination and the amount of such liability could be material 

future bans or limitations on the use of dieselpowered vehicles or other applications could have a material adverse impact on our business over the long term 

in an effort to limit greenhouse gas emissions and combat climate change multiple countries and cities have announced that they plan to implement a ban on the use in their countries or cities of dieselpowered products in the near or distant future these countries include china india and germany in addition california government officials have called for the state to phase out sales of certain dieselpowered vehicles by 2035 to the extent that these types of bans are actually implemented in the future on a broad basis or in one or more of our key markets our diesel business over the longterm could experience material adverse impacts 

business conditions  disruptions 

we are vulnerable to raw material transportation and labor price fluctuations and supply shortages which impacted and could continue to impact our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

we are experiencing supply chain disruptions and related challenges throughout the supply chain we single source a significant number of parts and raw materials critical to our business operations any delay in our suppliers deliveries may adversely affect our operations at multiple manufacturing locations forcing us to seek alternative supply sources to avoid serious disruptions delays may be caused by factors affecting our suppliers including the covid19 pandemic capacity constraints port congestion labor disputes economic downturns availability of credit or impaired financial condition suppliers allocations to other purchasers weather emergencies natural disasters acts of government or acts of war or terrorism in particular if the covid19 pandemic continues and results in extended periods of travel commercial and other restrictions we could continue to incur global supply disruptions any extended delay in receiving critical supplies could impair our ability to deliver products to our customers and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

in addition the current economic environment has resulted and may continue to result in price volatility and inflation of many of our raw material transportation and other costs further the labor market for skilled manufacturing remains tight as the us economy recovers after the covid19 pandemic shutdowns and our labor costs have increased as a result material transportation labor and other cost inflation has impacted and could continue to impact our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

we face the challenge of accurately aligning our capacity with our demand 

our markets are cyclical in nature and we face periods when demand fluctuates significantly higher or lower than our normal operating levels including variability driven by supply chain inconsistency accurately forecasting our expected volumes and appropriately adjusting our capacity are important factors in determining our results of operations and cash flows we manage our capacity by adjusting our manufacturing workforce capital expenditures and purchases from suppliers in periods of weak demand we may face underutilized capacity and unrecovered overhead costs while in periods of strong demand we may experience unplanned costs and could fail to meet customer demand we cannot guarantee that we will be able to adequately adjust our manufacturing capacity in response to significant changes in customer demand which could harm our business if we do not accurately align our manufacturing capabilities with demand it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

we derive significant earnings from investees that we do not directly control with more than 50 percent of these earnings from our chinabased investees 

for 2021 we recognized 506 million of equity royalty and interest income from investees compared to 452 million in 2020 approximately half of our equity royalty and interest income from investees is from three of our 50 percent owned joint ventures in china  beijing foton cummins engine co ltd dongfeng cummins engine company ltd and chongqing cummins engine company ltd although a significant percentage of our net income is derived from these unconsolidated entities we do not unilaterally control their management or their operations which puts a substantial portion of our net income at risk from the actions or inactions of these entities a significant reduction in the level of contribution by these entities to our net income would likely have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows 

our truck manufacturers and oem customers discontinuing outsourcing their engine supply needs financial distress particularly related to bankruptcy or a changeincontrol of one of our large truck oem customers could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

we recognize significant sales of engines and components to a few large onhighway truck oem customers which have been an integral part of our positive business results for several years many are truck manufacturers or oems that manufacture engines for some of their own vehicles despite their own engine manufacturing abilities these customers have historically chosen to outsource certain types of engine production to us due to the quality of our engine products our emission compliance capabilities our systems integration their customers preferences their desire for cost reductions their desire for eliminating production risks and their desire to maintain company focus however there can be no assurance that these customers will continue to outsource or outsource as much of their engine production in the future in addition increased levels of oem vertical integration could result from a number of factors such as shifts in our customers business strategies acquisition by a customer of another engine manufacturer the inability of thirdparty suppliers to meet product specifications and the emergence of lowcost production opportunities in foreign countries any significant reduction in the level of engine production outsourcing from our truck manufacturer or oem customers financial distress of one of our large truck oem customers due to bankruptcy or a changeincontrol could likely lead to significant reductions in our sales volumes commercial disputes receivable collection issues and other negative consequences that could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

products and technology 

our products are subject to recall for performance or safetyrelated issues 

our products are subject to recall for performance or safetyrelated issues product recalls subject us to reputational risk loss of current and future customers reduced revenue and product recall costs product recall costs are incurred when we decide either voluntarily or involuntarily to recall a product through a formal campaign to solicit the return of specific products due to known or suspected performance or safety issues any significant product recalls could have material adverse effects on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows see note 13 product warranty liability to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

our products are exposed to variability in material and commodity costs 

our businesses establish prices with our customers in accordance with contractual time frames however the timing of material and commodity market price increases may prevent us from passing these additional costs on to our customers through timely pricing actions additionally higher material and commodity costs around the world may offset our efforts to reduce our cost structure while we customarily enter into financial transactions and contractual pricing adjustment provisions with our customers that attempt to address some of these risks notably with respect to copper platinum and palladium there can be no assurance that commodity price fluctuations will not adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows in addition while the use of commodity price hedging instruments and contractual pricing adjustments may provide us with some protection from adverse fluctuations in commodity prices by utilizing these instruments we potentially forego the benefits that might result from favorable fluctuations in price as a result higher material and commodity costs as well as hedging these commodity costs during periods of decreasing prices could result in declining margins 

the development of new technologies may materially reduce the demand for our current products and services 

we are investing in new products and technologies including electrified powertrains hydrogen production and fuel cells for planned introduction into certain new and existing markets given the early stages of development of some of these new products and technologies there can be no guarantee of the future market acceptance and investment returns with respect to our planned products which will face competition from an array of other technologies and manufacturers the increased adoption of electrified powertrains in some market segments could result in lower demand for current diesel or natural gas engines and components and over time reduce the demand for related parts and service revenues from diesel or natural gas powertrains furthermore it is possible that we may not be successful in developing segmentleading electrified or alternate fuel powertrains and some of our existing customers 

could choose to develop their own or source from other manufacturers and any of these factors could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

lowerthananticipated market acceptance of our new or existing products or services could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

although we conduct market research before launching new or refreshed engines and introducing new services many factors both within and outside our control affect the success of new or existing products and services in the marketplace offering engines and services that customers desire and value can mitigate the risks of increasing competition and declining demand but products and services that are perceived to be less than desirable whether in terms of price quality overall value fuel efficiency or other attributes can exacerbate these risks with increased consumer interconnectedness through the internet social media and other media mere allegations relating to poor quality safety fuel efficiency corporate responsibility or other key attributes can negatively impact our reputation or market acceptance of our products or services even if such allegations prove to be inaccurate or unfounded 

our business is exposed to potential product liability claims 

we face an inherent business risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that our products failure to perform to specification results or is alleged to result in property damage bodily injury andor death at any given time we are subject to various and multiple product liability claims any one of which if decided adversely to us may have a material adverse effect on our reported results of operation in the period in which our liability with respect to any such claim is recognized while we maintain insurance coverage with respect to certain product liability claims we may not be able to obtain such insurance on acceptable terms in the future if at all and any such insurance may not provide adequate coverage against product liability claims in addition product liability claims can be expensive to defend and can divert the attention of management and other personnel for significant periods of time regardless of the ultimate outcome furthermore even if we are successful in defending against a claim relating to our products claims of this nature could cause our customers to lose confidence in our products and us 

general 

we may not complete the separation of our filtration business within the time frame we anticipate or at all the separation may present difficulties that could have an adverse effect on us andor the independent business resulting from the separation andor costs associated with the separation may be higher than anticipated additionally if we complete the separation we may not realize some or all of the expected benefits of the separation 

in august 2021 we announced our exploration of strategic alternatives for our filtration business unit including the potential separation of the business into a standalone company the “separation” any separation would be complex in nature and unanticipated developments or changes including changes in law the macroeconomic environment and market conditions or regulatory or political conditions may affect our ability to complete the separation within the anticipated time frame or at all 

whether or not the separation is completed our businesses may face material challenges in connection with this transaction including without limitation 

• the diversion of management’s attention from ongoing business concerns and impact on our businesses as a result of the devotion of management’s attention to strategic alternatives for the filtration business including the separation 

• maintaining employee morale and retaining key management and other employees 

• retaining existing business and operational relationships including with customers suppliers employees and other counterparties and attracting new business and operational relationships 

• execution and related risks in connection with financing transactions undertaken in connection with the separation 

• foreseen and unforeseen dissynergy costs costs of restructuring transactions including taxes and other significant costs and expenses and 

• any potential negative reactions from the financial markets resulting from the separation 

any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows in addition if the separation is completed the new independent company will incur ongoing costs including costs of operating as an independent company that the separated business will no longer be able to share those costs may exceed our estimates or could diminish the benefits we expect to realize from the separation 

our plan to reposition our portfolio of product offerings through exploration of strategic acquisitions and divestitures may expose us to additional costs and risks 

part of our strategic plan is to improve our revenue growth gross margins and earnings by exploring the repositioning of our portfolio of product line offerings through the pursuit of potential strategic acquisitions andor divestitures to provide future strategic financial and operational benefits and improve shareholder value there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify suitable candidates or consummate these transactions on favorable terms the successful identification and completion of any strategic transaction depends on a number of factors that are not entirely within our control including the availability of suitable candidates and our ability to negotiate terms acceptable to all parties involved conclude satisfactory agreements and obtain all necessary regulatory approvals accordingly we may not be able to successfully negotiate and complete specific transactions the exploration negotiation and consummation of strategic transactions may involve significant expenditures by us which may adversely affect our results of operations at the time such expenses are incurred and may divert management’s attention from our existing business strategic transactions also may have adverse effects on our existing business relationships with suppliers and customers if required the financing for strategic acquisitions could result in an increase in our indebtedness dilute the interests of our shareholders or both any acquisition may not be accretive to us for a significant period of time following the completion of such acquisition also our ability to effectively integrate any potential acquisition into our existing business and culture may not be successful which could jeopardize future financial and operational performance for the combined businesses in addition if an acquisition results in any additional goodwill or increase in other intangible assets on our balance sheet and subsequently becomes impaired we would be required to record a noncash impairment charge which could result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition similarly any strategic divestiture of a product line or business may reduce our revenue and earnings reduce the diversity of our business result in substantial costs and expenses and cause disruption to our employees customers vendors and communities in which we operate 

we operate in challenging markets for talent and may fail to attract develop and retain key personnel 

we depend on the skills institutional knowledge working relationships and continued services and contributions of key personnel including our leadership team and others at all levels of the company as a critical part of our human capital resources in addition our ability to achieve our operating and strategic goals depends on our ability to identify hire train and retain qualified individuals we compete with other companies both within and outside of our industry for talented personnel and we may lose key personnel or fail to attract other talented personnel any such loss or failure could have material adverse effects on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

we may be adversely impacted by the effects of climate change and may incur increased costs and experience other impacts due to new or more stringent greenhouse gas regulations designed to address climate change 

the scientific consensus indicates that emissions of greenhouse gases ghg continue to alter the composition of earth’s atmosphere in ways that are affecting and are expected to continue to affect the global climate the potential impacts of climate change on our customers product offerings operations facilities and suppliers are accelerating and uncertain as they will be particular to local and customerspecific circumstances these potential impacts may include among other items physical longterm changes in freshwater availability and the frequency and severity of weather events as well as customer product changes either through preference or regulation 

concerns regarding climate change may lead to additional international national regional and local legislative and regulatory responses various stakeholders including legislators and regulators shareholders and nongovernmental organizations are continuing to look for ways to reduce ghg emissions we could face risks to our brand reputation investor confidence and market share due to an inability to innovate and develop new products that decrease ghg emissions increased input costs such as fuel utility transportation and compliancerelated costs could increase our operating costs and negatively impact customer operations and demand for our products as the impact of any future ghg legislative or regulatory requirements on our global businesses and products is dependent on the timing scope and design of the mandates or standards we are currently unable to predict its potential impact which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

our information technology environment and our products are exposed to potential security breaches or other disruptions which may adversely impact our competitive position reputation results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

we rely on the capacity reliability and security of our information technology environment and data security infrastructure in connection with various aspects of our business activities we also rely on our ability to expand and continually update these technologies and related infrastructure in response to the changing needs of our business as we implement new technologies they may not perform as expected we face the challenge of supporting our older technologies and implementing necessary upgrades in 

addition some of these technologies are managed by thirdparty service providers and are not under our direct control if we experience a problem with an important technology including during upgrades andor new implementations of technologies the resulting disruptions could have an adverse effect on our business and reputation as customers adopt and rely on cloudbased digital technologies and services we offer any disruption of the confidentiality integrity or availability of those services could have an adverse effect on our business and reputation 

the data handled by our technologies is vulnerable to security threats our operations routinely involve receiving storing processing and transmitting sensitive information pertaining to our business customers dealers suppliers employees and other sensitive matters while we continually work to safeguard our information technology environment and mitigate potential risks there is no assurance that these actions will be sufficient to prevent information technology security threats such as security breaches computer malware ransomware attacks and other cyber attacks which are increasing in both frequency and sophistication along with power outages or hardware failures these threats could result in unauthorized public disclosures of information create financial liability subject us to legal or regulatory sanctions disrupt our ability to conduct our business result in the loss of intellectual property or damage our reputation with customers dealers suppliers and other stakeholders as a result of the covid19 pandemic a large percentage of our salaried employees continue to work remotely full or parttime this remote working environment may pose a heightened risk for security breaches or other disruptions of our information technology environment 

in addition our products including our engines contain interconnected and increasingly complex technologies that control various processes and these technologies are potentially subject to cyber attacks and disruption the impact of a significant information technology event on either our information technology environment or our products could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position reputation results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

we are exposed to political economic and other risks that arise from operating a multinational business greater political economic and social uncertainty and the evolving globalization of businesses could significantly change the dynamics of our competition customer base and product offerings and impact our growth globally 

our business is subject to the political economic and other risks that are inherent in operating in numerous countries these risks include 

• public health crises including the spread of a contagious disease such as covid19 and other catastrophic events 

• the difficulty of enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through foreign legal systems 

• trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements 

• the imposition of taxes on foreign income and tax rates in certain foreign countries that exceed those in the us 

• the imposition of tariffs exchange controls or other restrictions 

• difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations and the application of foreign labor regulations 

• required compliance with a variety of foreign laws and regulations and 

• changes in general economic and political conditions including changes in relationship with the us in countries where we operate particularly in china russia and emerging markets 

as we continue to operate and grow our business globally our success will depend in part on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these and other related risks there can be no assurance that the consequences of these and other factors relating to our multinational operations will not have a material adverse effect upon us 

in addition there continues to be significant uncertainty about the future relationships between the us and china and the us and russia including with respect to trade policies treaties government regulations and tariffs any increased trade barriers or restrictions on global trade especially trade with china or russia could adversely impact our competitive position results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

we face significant competition in the regions we serve 

the markets in which we operate are highly competitive we compete worldwide with a number of other manufacturers and distributors that produce and sell similar products we primarily compete with diesel engines and related diesel products however new technologies continue to be developed for gasoline natural gas hydrogen electrification and other technologies and we will continue to face new competition from these expanding technologies our products primarily compete on the basis of performance price total cost of ownership fuel economy emissions compliance speed of delivery quality and customer support we also face competitors in some emerging regions who have established local practices and long standing relationships with participants in these 

markets there can be no assurance that our products will be able to compete successfully with the products of other companies and in other markets 

increasing global competition among our customers may affect our existing customer relationships and restrict our ability to benefit from some of our customers growth 

as our customers in emerging markets continue to grow in size and scope they are increasingly seeking to export their products to other countries this has meant greater demand for our advanced engine technologies to help these customers meet the more stringent emissions requirements of developed markets as well as greater demand for access to our distribution systems for purposes of equipment servicing as these emerging market customers enter into and begin to compete in more developed markets they may increasingly begin to compete with our existing customers in these markets our further aid to emerging market customers could adversely affect our relationships with developed market customers in addition to the extent the competition does not correspond to overall growth in demand we may see little or no benefit from this type of expansion by our emerging market customers 

we may be adversely impacted by work stoppages and other labor matters 

at december 31 2021 we employed approximately 59900 persons worldwide approximately 21200 of our employees worldwide were represented by various unions under collective bargaining agreements that expire between 2022 and 2026 while we have no reason to believe that we will be materially impacted by work stoppages or other labor matters there can be no assurance that future issues with our labor unions will be resolved favorably or that we will not encounter future strikes work stoppages or other types of conflicts with labor unions or our employees any of these consequences may have an adverse effect on us or may limit our flexibility in dealing with our workforce in addition many of our customers and suppliers have unionized work forces work stoppages or slowdowns experienced by us our customers or suppliers could result in slowdowns or closures that would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flow 

we are subject to foreign currency exchange rate and other related risks 

we conduct operations in many areas of the world involving transactions denominated in a variety of currencies we are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk to the extent that our costs are denominated in currencies other than those in which we earn revenues in addition since our financial statements are denominated in us dollars changes in foreign currency exchange rates between the us dollar and other currencies have had and will continue to have an impact on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows we also face risks arising from the imposition of foreign exchange controls and currency devaluations foreign exchange controls may limit our ability to convert foreign currencies into us dollars or to remit dividends and other payments by our foreign subsidiaries or businesses located in or conducted within a country imposing controls currency devaluations result in a diminished value of funds denominated in the currency of the country instituting the devaluation see managements discussion and analysis for additional information 

significant declines in future financial and stock market conditions could diminish our pension plan asset performance and adversely impact our results of operations financial condition and cash flow 

we sponsor both funded and unfunded domestic and foreign defined benefit pension and other retirement plans our pension cost and the required contributions to our pension plans are directly affected by the value of plan assets the projected and actual rates of return on plan assets and the actuarial assumptions we use to measure our defined benefit pension plan obligations including the discount rate at which future projected and accumulated pension obligations are discounted to a present value we could experience increased pension cost due to a combination of factors including the decreased investment performance of pension plan assets decreases in the discount rate and changes in our assumptions relating to the expected return on plan assets significant declines in current and future financial and stock market conditions could cause material losses in our pension plan assets which could result in increased pension cost in future years and adversely impact our results of operations financial condition and cash flow depending upon the severity and length of market declines and government regulatory changes we may be legally obligated to make pension payments in the us and perhaps other countries and these contributions could be material 

we are exposed to risks arising from the price and availability of energy 

the level of demand for our products and services is influenced in multiple ways by the price and availability of energy high energy costs generally drive greater demand for better fuel economy in almost all countries in which we operate some of our engine products have been developed with a primary purpose of offering fuel economy improvements and if energy costs decrease or increase less than expected demand for these products may likewise decrease the relative unavailability of electricity in some emerging market countries also influences demand for our electricity generating products such as our diesel generators if these countries add energy 

capacity by expanding their power grids at a rate equal to or faster than the growth in demand for energy the demand for our generating products could also decrease or increase less than would otherwise be the case

executive summary and financial highlights 

overview 

we are a global power leader that designs manufactures distributes and services diesel natural gas electric and hybrid powertrains and powertrainrelated components including filtration aftertreatment turbochargers fuel systems controls systems air handling systems automated transmissions electric power generation systems batteries electrified power systems hydrogen production and fuel cell products we sell our products to original equipment manufacturers oems distributors dealers and other customers worldwide we have longstanding relationships with many of the leading manufacturers in the markets we serve including paccar inc navistar international corporation daimler trucks north america and stellantis nv we serve our customers through a service network of approximately 500 whollyowned joint venture and independent distributor locations and more than 10000 cummins certified dealer locations in approximately 190 countries and territories 

our reportable operating segments consist of engine distribution components power systems and new power this reporting structure is organized according to the products and markets each segment serves the engine segment produces engines 15 liters and smaller and associated parts for sale to customers in onhighway and various offhighway markets our engines are used in trucks of all sizes buses and recreational vehicles as well as in various industrial applications including construction agriculture power generation systems and other offhighway applications the distribution segment includes whollyowned and partiallyowned distributorships engaged in wholesaling engines generator sets and service parts as well as performing service and repair activities on our products and maintaining relationships with various oems throughout the world the components segment sells filtration products aftertreatment systems turbochargers electronics fuel systems and automated transmissions the power systems segment is an integrated power provider which designs manufactures and sells engines 16 liters and larger for industrial applications including mining oil and gas marine and rail standby and prime power generator sets alternators and other power components the new power segment designs manufactures sells and supports hydrogen production solutions as well as electrified power systems ranging from fully electric to hybrid along with innovative components and subsystems including battery and fuel cell technologies the new power segment is currently in the development phase with a primary focus on research and development activities for our power systems components and subsystems we continue to serve all our markets as they adopt electrification and alternative power technologies meeting the needs of our oem partners and end customers 

our financial performance depends in large part on varying conditions in the markets we serve particularly the onhighway construction and general industrial markets demand in these markets tends to fluctuate in response to overall economic conditions our sales may also be impacted by oem inventory levels production schedules stoppages and supply chain challenges economic downturns in markets we serve generally result in reduced sales of our products and can result in price reductions in certain products andor markets as a worldwide business our operations are also affected by currency political economic public health crises epidemics or pandemics and regulatory matters including adoption and enforcement of environmental and emission standards in the countries we serve as part of our growth strategy we invest in businesses in certain countries that carry high levels of these risks such as china brazil india mexico russia and countries in the middle east and africa at the same time our geographic diversity and broad product and service offerings have helped limit the impact from a drop in demand in any one industry or customer or the economy of any single country on our consolidated results 

covid19 update 

the outbreak of covid19 in early 2020 became a global pandemic with the resultant economic impacts evolving into a worldwide recession the pandemic triggered a significant downturn in our markets globally which negatively impacted our sales and results of operations during 2020 while the majority of the negative impacts to demand largely subsided in 2021 we are still experiencing supply chain disruptions and related financial impacts reflected as increased cost of sales our industry continues to be unfavorably impacted by supply chain constraints leading to shortages across multiple components categories and limiting our collective ability to meet enduser demand our customers are also experiencing other supply chain issues and slowing production should the supply chain issues continue for an extended period of time or worsen the impact on our production and supply chain could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows our board of directors the board continues to monitor and evaluate all of these factors and the related impacts on our business and operations and we are diligently working to minimize the supply chain impacts to our business and to our customers

business outlook 

our outlook reflects the following positive trends and challenges to our business that could impact our revenue and earnings potential in 2022 

positive trends 

• we expect demand for pickup trucks in north america to remain strong 

• we estimate north american mediumduty and heavyduty truck demand will continue to improve 

• we believe market demand for trucks in india will continue the improvement trend from the second half of 2021 

• we anticipate our aftermarket business will continue to improve driven primarily by increased truck utilization in north america 

• our liquidity of 64 billion in cash marketable securities and available credit facilities puts us in a strong position to deal with any uncertainties that may arise in 2022 

challenges 

• supply constraints driven by strong demand in multiple end markets and regions may lead to increased costs including higher freight and conversion costs 

• continued increases in material and commodity costs could negatively impact earnings 

• our industrys sales continue to be unfavorably impacted by supply chain constraints leading to shortages across multiple components categories and limiting our collective ability to meet enduser demand our customers are also experiencing other supply chain issues slowing production 

• we expect market demand in truck and construction markets in china to decline from 2021 full year levels 

separation of filtration business 

on august 3 2021 we announced our exploration of strategic alternatives for our filtration business potential strategic alternatives to be explored include the separation of our filtration business into a standalone company the execution of this exploration process is dependent upon business and market conditions along with a number of other factors and considerations

cash flows 

cash and cash equivalents were impacted as follows 



2021 vs 2020

net cash used in investing activities increased 154 million principally due to higher capital expenditures of 206 million partially offset by favorable changes in cash flows from derivatives not designated as hedges of 45 million and increased proceeds from sale of land of 20 million 

net cash used in financing activities increased 2507 million primarily due to lower proceeds from borrowings of 1935 million mainly resulting from our 2 billion bond issuance in 2020 and higher repurchases of common stock of 761 million partially offset by lower net payments of commercial paper of 327 million 

the effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents increased 46 million primarily due to favorable fluctuations in the british pound of 55 million partially offset by unfavorable fluctuations in the south korean won chinese renminbi and australian dollar

a significant portion of our cash flows are generated outside the us we manage our worldwide cash requirements considering available funds among the many subsidiaries through which we conduct our business and the cost effectiveness with which those funds can be accessed as a result we do not anticipate any local liquidity restrictions to preclude us from funding our operating needs with local resources 

if we distribute our foreign cash balances to the us or to other foreign subsidiaries we could be required to accrue and pay withholding taxes for example if we repatriated cash from certain foreign subsidiaries whose earnings we asserted are completely or partially permanently reinvested foreign earnings for which we assert permanent reinvestment outside the us consist primarily of earnings of our china india and netherlands domiciled subsidiaries at present we do not foresee a need to repatriate any earnings for which we asserted permanent reinvestment however to help fund cash needs of the us or other international subsidiaries as they arise we repatriate available cash from certain foreign subsidiaries whose earnings are not permanently reinvested when it is cost effective to do so 

debt facilities and other sources of liquidity 

on august 18 2021 we entered into an amended and restated fiveyear revolving credit agreement which allows us to borrow up to 2 billion of unsecured funds at any time prior to august 18 2026 on august 18 2021 we also entered into an amended and restated 364day credit agreement which allows us to borrow up to 15 billion of unsecured funds at any time prior to august 17 2022 this credit agreement amended and restated the prior 15 billion 364day credit facility that matured on august 18 2021 see note 12 debt to our consolidated financial statements for additional information 

we have access to committed credit facilities that total 35 billion including the 15 billion 364day facility that expires august 17 2022 and our 20 billion fiveyear facility that expires on august 18 2026 we intend to maintain credit facilities at the current or higher aggregate amounts by renewing or replacing these facilities at or before expiration these revolving credit facilities are maintained primarily to provide backup liquidity for our commercial paper borrowings and for general corporate purposes both credit agreements include various financial covenants including among others maintaining a net debt to capital ratio of no more than 065 to 10 at december 31 2021 our leverage ratio was 012 to 10 there were no outstanding borrowings under these facilities at december 31 2021 

we can issue up to 35 billion of unsecured shortterm promissory notes commercial paper pursuant to the board authorized commercial paper programs the programs facilitate the private placement of unsecured shortterm debt through thirdparty brokers we intend to use the net proceeds from the commercial paper borrowings for general corporate purposes the total combined borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facilities and commercial paper programs should not exceed 35 billion see note 12 debt to our consolidated financial statements for additional information 

at december 31 2021 we had 313 million of commercial paper outstanding which effectively reduced the available capacity under our revolving credit facilities to 32 billion 

in the second half of 2021 we entered into a series of interest rate swaps to effectively convert our 500 million senior notes due in 2025 from a fixed rate of 075 percent to a floating rate equal to the threemonth libor plus a spread we also entered into a series of interest rate swaps to effectively convert 765 million of our 850 million senior notes due in 2030 from a fixed rate of 150 percent to a floating rate equal to the threemonth libor plus a spread the swaps were designated and will be accounted for as fair value hedges 

as a wellknown seasoned issuer we filed an automatic shelf registration for an undetermined amount of debt and equity securities with the sec on february 13 2019 under this shelf registration we may offer from time to time debt securities common stock preferred and preference stock depositary shares warrants stock purchase contracts and stock purchase units we plan to file a new shelf registration statement in the first quarter of 2022 prior to the expiration of the shelf registration statement currently in effect 

in july 2017 the uks financial conduct authority which regulates the london interbank offered rate libor announced it intends to phase out libor by the end of 2021 the cessation date for submission and publication of rates for certain tenors of libor has since been extended until mid2023 various central bank committees and working groups continue to discuss replacement of benchmark rates the process for amending existing liborbased contracts and the potential economic impacts of different alternatives the alternative reference rates committee has identified the secured overnight financing rate sofr as its preferred alternative rate for us dollar libor sofr is a measure of the cost of borrowing cash overnight collateralized by us treasury securities and is based on directly observable us treasurybacked repurchase transactions we have evaluated the potential impact of the replacement of the libor benchmark interest rate including risk management internal operational readiness and monitoring the financial accounting standards board standardsetting process to address financial reporting issues that might arise in connection with transition from libor to a new benchmark rate while we do not believe the change will materially impact us due to our operational and system readiness coupled with relevant contractual fallback language we continue to evaluate all eventual transition risks in anticipation of libors phase out our most recent revolving credit agreements include a welldocumented transition mechanism for selecting a benchmark replacement rate for libor subject to our agreement additionally with respect to our 13 billion in liborbased fixed to variable rate swaps maturing in 2025 and 2030 we reviewed and believe our adherence to the 2020 libor fallback protocol will allow for a smooth transition to the designated replacement rate when that transition occurs 

supply chain financing 

we currently have supply chain financing programs with financial intermediaries which provide certain vendors the option to be paid by financial intermediaries earlier than the due date on the applicable invoice when a vendor utilizes the program and receives an early payment from a financial intermediary they take a discount on the invoice we then pay the financial intermediary the face amount of the invoice on the regularly scheduled due date the maximum amount that we may have outstanding under the program is 361 million we do not reimburse vendors for any costs they incur for participation in the program and their participation is completely voluntary as a result all amounts owed to the financial intermediaries are presented as accounts payable in our consolidated balance sheets  amounts due to the financial intermediaries reflected in accounts payable at december 31 2021 were 147 million 

uses of cash 

stock repurchases 

in december 2021 the board authorized the acquisition of up to 20 billion of additional common stock upon completion of the 2019 repurchase plan in december 2019 the board authorized the acquisition of up to 20 billion of additional common stock upon completion of the 2018 repurchase plan for the year ended december 31 2021 we made the following purchases under our stock repurchase program 



we intend to repurchase outstanding shares from time to time during 2022 to enhance shareholder value 

dividends 

total dividends paid to common shareholders in 2021 2020 and 2019 were 809 million 782 million and 761 million respectively declaration and payment of dividends in the future depends upon our income and liquidity position among other factors and is subject to declaration by the board who meets quarterly to consider our dividend payment we expect to fund dividend payments with cash from operations 

in july 2021 the board authorized an increase to our quarterly dividend of 74 percent from 135 per share to 145 per share cash dividends per share paid to common shareholders and the board authorized increases for the last three years were as follows 



capital expenditures 

capital expenditures including spending on internal use software were 786 million 575 million and 775 million in 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively we continue to invest in new product lines and targeted capacity expansions we plan to spend an estimated 850 million to 900 million in 2022 on capital expenditures excluding internal use software with over 60 percent of these expenditures expected to be invested in north america in addition we plan to spend an estimated 70 million to 80 million on internal use software in 2022 

current maturities of short and longterm debt 

we had 313 million of commercial paper outstanding at december 31 2021 that matures in less than one year the maturity schedule of our existing longterm debt does not require significant cash outflows until 2023 when our 365 percent senior notes and 2025 when our 075 percent senior notes are due required annual longterm debt principal payments range from 24 million to 536 million over the next five years see note 12 debt to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

pensions 

our global pension plans including our unfunded and nonqualified plans were 121 percent funded at december 31 2021 our us defined benefit plan which represented approximately 52 percent of the worldwide pension obligation was 138 percent funded and our uk defined benefit plan was 127 percent funded at december 31 2021 the funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon a variety of variables and assumptions including return on invested assets market interest rates and levels of voluntary contributions to the plans in 2021 the investment gain on our us pension trust was 81 percent while our uk pension trust gain was 51 percent approximately 69 percent of our pension plan assets are held in highly liquid investments such as fixed income and equity securities the remaining 31 percent of our plan assets are held in less liquid but market valued investments including real estate private equity venture capital opportunistic credit and insurance contracts 

we sponsor funded and unfunded domestic and foreign defined benefit pension plans contributions to the us and uk plans were as follows 

  

we anticipate making total contributions of approximately 47 million to our global defined benefit pension plans in 2022 expected contributions to our defined benefit pension plans in 2022 will meet or exceed the current funding requirements 

future uses of cash 

a summary of our contractual obligations and other commercial commitments at december 31 2021 are as follows 



the contractual obligations reported above exclude our unrecognized tax benefits of 89 million as of december 31 2021 we are not able to reasonably estimate the period in which cash outflows relating to uncertain tax contingencies could occur see note 4 income taxes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

credit ratings 

our rating and outlook from each of the credit rating agencies as of the date of filing are shown in the table below 



managements assessment of liquidity 

our financial condition and liquidity remain strong our solid balance sheet and credit ratings enable us to have ready access to credit and the capital markets we assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate adequate cash to fund our operating investing and financing activities we believe our existing cash and marketable securities operating cash flow and revolving credit facilities provide us with the financial flexibility needed to fund common stock repurchases dividend payments targeted capital expenditures projected pension obligations acquisitions working capital and debt service obligations through 2022 and beyond we continue to generate significant cash from operations and maintain access to our revolving credit facilities and commercial paper programs as noted above 

application of critical accounting estimates 

a summary of our significant accounting policies is included in note 1 summary of significant accounting policies of our consolidated financial statements which discusses accounting policies that we selected from acceptable alternatives 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the us which often requires management to make judgments estimates and assumptions regarding uncertainties that affect the reported amounts presented and disclosed in the financial statements management reviews these estimates and assumptions based on historical experience changes in business conditions and other relevant factors they believe to be reasonable under the circumstances in any given reporting period our actual results may differ from the estimates and assumptions used in preparing our consolidated financial statements 

critical accounting estimates are defined as follows the estimate requires management to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the estimate was made different estimates reasonably could have been used or if changes in the estimate are reasonably likely to occur from period to period and the change would have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations our senior management has discussed the development and selection of our accounting policies related accounting estimates and the disclosures set forth below with the audit committee of the board we believe our critical accounting estimates include estimating liabilities for warranty programs assessing goodwill impairments accounting for income taxes and pension benefits 

warranty programs 

we estimate and record a liability for base warranty programs at the time our products are sold our estimates are based on historical experience and reflect managements best estimates of expected costs at the time products are sold and subsequent adjustment to those expected costs when actual costs differ as a result of the uncertainty surrounding the nature and frequency of product recall programs the liability for such programs is recorded when we commit to a recall action or when a recall becomes probable and estimable which generally occurs when management internally approves or commits to the action our warranty liability is generally affected by component failure rates repair costs and the point of failure within the product life cycle future events and circumstances related to these factors could materially change our estimates and require adjustments to our liability new product launches require a greater use of judgment in developing estimates until historical experience becomes available product specific experience is typically available four or five quarters after product launch with a clear experience trend evident eight quarters after launch we generally record warranty expense for new products upon shipment using a preceding products warranty history and a multiplicative factor based upon preceding similar product experience and new product assessment until sufficient new product data is available for warranty estimation we then use a blend of actual new product experience and preceding product historical experience for several subsequent quarters and new product specific experience thereafter note 13 product warranty liability to our consolidated financial statements contains a summary of the activity in our warranty liability account for 2021 2020 and 2019 including adjustments to preexisting warranties 

goodwill impairment 

we are required to make certain subjective and complex judgments in assessing whether a goodwill impairment event has occurred including assumptions and estimates used to determine the fair value of our reporting units we test for goodwill impairment at the reporting unit level and our reporting units are the operating segments or the components of operating segments that constitute businesses for which discrete financial information is available and is regularly reviewed by management 

we have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform an annual quantitative goodwill impairment test we elected this option on certain reporting units the following events and circumstances are considered when evaluating whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 

• macroeconomic conditions such as a deterioration in general economic conditions fluctuations in foreign exchange rates andor other developments in equity and credit markets 

• industry and market considerations such as a deterioration in the environment in which an entity operates material loss in market share and significant declines in product pricing 

• cost factors such as an increase in raw materials labor or other costs 

• overall financial performance such as negative or declining cash flows or a decline in actual or forecasted revenue 

• other relevant entityspecific events such as material changes in management or key personnel and 

• events affecting a reporting unit such as a change in the composition or carrying amount of its net assets including acquisitions and dispositions 

the examples noted above are not allinclusive and we consider other relevant events and circumstances that affect the fair value of a reporting unit in determining whether to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test 

our goodwill recoverability assessment is based on our annual strategic planning process this process includes an extensive review of expectations for the longterm growth of our businesses and forecasted future cash flows in order to determine the valuation of our reporting units we use either the market approach or the income approach using a discounted cash flow model our income approach method uses a discounted cash flow model in which cash flows anticipated over several periods plus a terminal value at the end of that time horizon are discounted to their present value using an appropriate rate of return our estimates are based upon our historical experience our current knowledge from our commercial relationships and available external information about future trends 

the discounted cash flow model requires us to make projections of revenue gross margin operating expenses working capital investment and fixed asset additions for the reporting units over a multiyear period additionally management must estimate a weightedaverage cost of capital which reflects a market rate for each reporting unit for use as a discount rate the discounted cash flows are compared to the carrying value of the reporting unit and if less than the carrying value the difference is recorded as a goodwill impairment loss in addition we also perform a sensitivity analysis to determine how much our forecasts can fluctuate before the fair value of a reporting unit would be lower than its carrying amount we perform the required procedures as of the end of our fiscal third quarter 

accounting for income taxes 

we determine our income tax expense using the asset and liability method under this method deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax effects of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis future tax benefits of net operating loss and credit carryforwards are also recognized as deferred tax assets we evaluate the recoverability of our deferred tax assets each quarter by assessing the likelihood of future profitability and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize our net deferred tax assets at december 31 2021 we recorded net deferred tax assets of 25 million the assets included 395 million for the value of net operating loss and credit carryforwards a valuation allowance of 360 million was recorded to reduce the tax assets to the net value management believed was more likely than not to be realized in the event our operating performance deteriorates future assessments could conclude that a larger valuation allowance will be needed to further reduce the deferred tax assets 

in addition we operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and are subject to tax audits in these jurisdictions these audits can involve complex issues which may require an extended period of time to resolve we accrue for the estimated additional tax and interest that may result from tax authorities disputing uncertain tax positions we believe we made adequate provisions for income taxes for all years that are subject to audit based upon the latest information available a more complete description of our income taxes and the future benefits of our net operating loss and credit carryforwards is disclosed in note 4 income taxes to our consolidated financial statements  

pension benefits 

we sponsor a number of pension plans globally with the majority of assets in the us and the uk in the us and the uk we have major defined benefit plans that are separately funded we account for our pension programs in accordance with employers accounting for defined benefit pension plans which requires that amounts recognized in financial statements be determined using an actuarial basis as a result our pension benefit programs are based on a number of statistical and judgmental assumptions that attempt to anticipate future events and are used in calculating the expense and liability related to our plans each year at december 31 these assumptions include discount rates used to value liabilities assumed rates of return on plan assets future compensation increases employee turnover rates actuarial assumptions relating to retirement age mortality rates and participant withdrawals the actuarial assumptions we use may differ significantly from actual results due to changing economic conditions participant life span and withdrawal rates these differences may result in a material impact to the amount of net periodic pension cost to be recorded in our consolidated financial statements in the future 

the expected longterm return on plan assets is used in calculating the net periodic pension cost we considered several factors in developing our expected rate of return on plan assets the longterm rate of return considers historical returns and expected returns on current and projected asset allocations projected returns are based primarily on broad publicly traded passive fixed income and equity indices and forwardlooking estimates of the value added by active investment management at december 31 2021 based upon our target asset allocations it is anticipated that our us investment policy will generate an average annual return over the 30year projection period equal to or in excess of 625 percent including the additional positive returns expected from active investment management 

the oneyear return for our us plans was 81 percent for 2021 our us plan assets averaged annualized returns of 861 percent over the prior ten years and resulted in approximately 431 million of actuarial gains in accumulated other comprehensive loss aocl in the same period based on the historical returns and forwardlooking return expectations for capital markets as plan assets continue to be derisked consistent with our investment policy we believe our investment return assumption of 625 percent in 2022 for us pension assets is reasonable and attainable 

the methodology used to determine the rate of return on pension plan assets in the uk was based on establishing an equityrisk premium over current longterm bond yields adjusted based on target asset allocations at december 31 2021 based upon our target asset allocations it is anticipated that our uk investment policy will generate an average annual return over the 20year projection period equal to or in excess of 4 percent the oneyear return for our uk plans was 51 percent for 2021 we generated average annualized returns of 914 percent over ten years resulting in approximately 767 million of actuarial gains in aocl our strategy with respect to our investments in pension plan assets is to be invested with a longterm outlook based on the historical returns and forwardlooking return expectations as the plan assets continue to be derisked we believe that an investment return assumption of 

375 percent in 2022 for uk pension assets is reasonable and attainable our target allocation for 2022 and pension plan asset allocations at december 31 2021 and 2020 are as follows 



the differences between the actual return on plan assets and expected longterm return on plan assets are recognized in the asset value used to calculate net periodic cost over five years the table below sets forth our expected rate of return for 2022 and the expected return assumptions used to develop our pension cost for the period 20192021 



pension accounting offers various acceptable alternatives to account for the differences that eventually arise between the estimates used in the actuarial valuations and the actual results it is acceptable to delay or immediately recognize these differences under the delayed recognition alternative changes in pension obligations including those resulting from plan amendments and changes in the value of assets set aside to meet those obligations are not recognized in net periodic pension cost as they occur but are recognized initially in aocl and subsequently amortized as components of net periodic pension cost systematically and gradually over future periods in addition to this approach we may also adopt immediate recognition of actuarial gains or losses immediate recognition introduces volatility in financial results we have chosen to delay recognition and amortize actuarial differences over future periods if we adopted the immediate recognition approach we would record a loss of 545 million 418 million aftertax from cumulative actuarial net losses for our us and uk pension plans 

the difference between the expected return and the actual return on plan assets is deferred from recognition in our results of operations and under certain circumstances such as when the difference exceeds 10 percent of the greater of the market value of plan assets or the projected benefit obligation the difference is amortized over future years of service this is also true of changes to actuarial assumptions under the delayed recognition alternative the actuarial gains and losses are recognized and recorded in aocl as our losses related to the us and uk pension plans exceed 10 percent of their respective plan assets the excess is amortized over the average remaining service lives of participating employees net actuarial gains increased our shareholders equity by 280 million aftertax in 2021 the gain is primarily due to strong asset returns and higher discount rates in the us and uk 

the table below sets forth the net periodic pension cost for the years ended december 31 and our expected cost for 2022 



we expect 2022 net periodic pension cost to decrease compared to 2021 primarily due to higher discount rates in the us and uk and favorable actuarial experience in the us partially offset by a lower expected rate of return in the uk the decrease in net periodic pension cost in 2021 compared to 2020 was primarily due to favorable actuarial experience and investment returns partially offset by lower discount rates in the us and uk the increase in net periodic pension cost in 2020 compared to 2019 was due to lower discount rates in the us and uk 

the weightedaverage discount rates used to develop our net periodic pension cost are set forth in the table below 



the discount rate enables us to state expected future cash payments for benefits as a present value on the measurement date the guidelines for setting this rate suggest the use of a highquality corporate bond rate we used bond information provided by moodys investor services inc and standard  poors rating services all bonds used to develop our hypothetical portfolio in the us and uk were deemed highquality noncallable bonds aa or better at december 31 2021 by at least one of the bond rating agencies 

our model called for projected payments until near extinction for the us and the uk for both countries our model matches the present value of the plans projected benefit payments to the market value of the theoretical settlement bond portfolio a single equivalent discount rate is determined to align the present value of the required cash flow with the value of the bond portfolio the resulting discount rate is reflective of both the current interest rate environment and the plans distinct liability characteristics 

the table below sets forth the estimated impact on our 2022 net periodic pension cost relative to a change in the discount rate and a change in the expected rate of return on plan assets 



the above sensitivities reflect the impact of changing one assumption at a time a higher discount rate decreases the plan obligations and decreases our net periodic pension cost a lower discount rate increases the plan obligations and increases our net periodic pension cost it should be noted that economic factors and conditions often affect multiple assumptions simultaneously and the effects of changes in key assumptions are not necessarily linear note 10 pensions and other postretirement benefits to our consolidated financial statements provides a summary of our pension benefit plan activity the funded status of our plans and the amounts recognized in our consolidated financial statements  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to financial risk resulting from volatility in foreign exchange rates interest rates and commodity prices this risk is closely monitored and managed through the use of physical forward contracts which are not considered derivatives and financial derivative instruments including foreign currency forward contracts commodity swap contracts and interest rate swaps financial derivatives are used expressly for hedging purposes and under no circumstances are they used for speculative purposes when material we adjust the estimated fair value of our derivative contracts for counterparty or our credit risk none of our derivative instruments are subject to collateral requirements substantially all of our derivative contracts are subject to master netting arrangements which provide us with the option to settle certain contracts on a net basis when they settle on the same day with the same currency in addition these arrangements provide for a net settlement of all contracts with a given counterparty in the event that the arrangement is terminated due to the occurrence of default or a termination event 

we also enter into physical forward contracts with certain suppliers to purchase minimum volumes of commodities at contractually stated prices for various periods these arrangements as further described below enable us to fix the prices of portions of our normal purchases of these commodities which otherwise are subject to market volatility 

the following describes our risk exposures and provides the results of a sensitivity analysis performed at december 31 2021 the sensitivity analysis assumes instantaneous parallel shifts in foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices 

foreign currency exchange rate risk 

as a result of our international business presence we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risks we transact business in foreign currencies and as a result our income experiences some volatility related to movements in foreign currency exchange rates to help manage our exposure to exchange rate volatility we use foreign currency forward contracts on a regular basis to hedge forecasted intercompany and thirdparty sales and purchases denominated in nonfunctional currencies our foreign currency cash flow hedges generally mature within two years these foreign currency forward contracts are designated and qualify as foreign currency cash flow hedges for the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 there were no circumstances that resulted in the discontinuance of a foreign currency cash flow hedge 

to minimize the income volatility resulting from the remeasurement of net monetary assets and payables denominated in a currency other than the functional currency we enter into foreign currency forward contracts which are considered economic hedges the 

objective is to offset the gain or loss from remeasurement with the gain or loss from the fair market valuation of the forward contract these derivative instruments are not designated as hedges 

at december 31 2021 the potential gain or loss in the fair value of our outstanding foreign currency contracts assuming a hypothetical 10 percent fluctuation in the currencies of such contracts would be approximately 103 million the sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates assumes the notional value to remain constant for the next 12 months the analysis ignores the impact of foreign exchange movements on our competitive position and potential changes in sales levels any change in the value of the contracts real or hypothetical would be significantly offset by an inverse change in the value of the underlying hedged items 

interest rate risk 

we are exposed to market risk from fluctuations in interest rates we manage our exposure to interest rate fluctuations through the use of interest rate swaps and interest rate locks the objective of the swaps is to more effectively balance our borrowing costs and interest rate risk see interest rate risk section in note 12 debt to our consolidated financial statements for additional information 

at any time a change in interest rates could have an adverse impact on the fair value of our portfolios assuming a hypothetical adverse movement in interest rates of one percentage point the combined value of our interest rate derivatives portfolios would be reduced by 64 million as calculated as of december 31 2021 however this does not take into consideration an offset in the underlying hedged items while these are our best estimates of the impact of the specified interest rate scenario actual results could differ from those projected the sensitivity analysis presented assumes interest rate changes are instantaneous parallel shifts in the yield curve 

commodity price risk 

we are exposed to fluctuations in commodity prices due to contractual agreements with component suppliers in order to protect ourselves against future price volatility and consequently fluctuations in gross margins we periodically enter into commodity swap and forward contracts with designated banks and other counterparties to fix the cost of certain raw material purchases with the objective of minimizing changes in inventory cost due to market price fluctuations these commodity swaps are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges at december 31 2021 realized and unrealized gains and losses related to these hedges were not material to our financial statements we also enter into physical forward contracts which qualify for the normal purchases scope exceptions and are treated as purchase commitments 

we also limit our exposure to commodity price risk by entering into purchasing arrangements to fix the price of certain volumes of platinum and palladium expected to be used in our products we enter into physical forward contracts with suppliers of platinum and palladium to purchase some volumes of the commodities at contractually stated prices for various periods generally less than two years these arrangements enable us to fix the prices of a portion of our purchases of these commodities which otherwise are subject to market volatility

 item 1 business 

overview 

we were founded in 1919 as cummins engine company a corporation in columbus indiana and one of the first diesel engine manufacturers in 2001 we changed our name to cummins inc we are a global power leader that designs manufactures distributes and services diesel natural gas electric and hybrid powertrains and powertrainrelated components including filtration aftertreatment turbochargers fuel systems controls systems air handling systems automated transmissions electric power generation systems batteries electrified power systems hydrogen production and fuel cell products we sell our products to original equipment manufacturers oems distributors dealers and other customers worldwide we serve our customers through a network of over 500 whollyowned joint venture and independent distributor locations and over 9000 cummins certified dealer locations with service to approximately 190 countries and territories 

covid19 

the outbreak of the coronavirus disease of 2019 covid19 spread throughout the world and became a global pandemic with the resultant economic impacts evolving into a worldwide recession the pandemic triggered a significant downturn in our markets globally which continued to unfavorably impact market conditions throughout 2020 and these challenging market conditions could continue for an extended period of time in an effort to contain the spread of covid19 maintain the wellbeing of our employees and stakeholders match the reduced demand from our customers and in accordance with governmental requirements we closed or partially shut down certain office manufacturing distribution and technical center facilities around the world in march 2020 although most of our manufacturing distribution and technical center facilities reopened early in the second quarter of 2020 some operated at reduced capacities most of our global office buildings remained closed through the remainder of 2020 despite many of our markets recovering in the second half of 2020 the ongoing spread of the virus prior to widespread vaccination presents several risks to our business especially in the first half of 2021 

covid19 vaccines are currently being administered around the world with the hope that the majority of the population will have access to the vaccine by the middle of 2021 if the distribution and the effectiveness of the vaccine are consistent with current government and health organization estimates we anticipate the vaccine will mitigate the spread of the virus by the end of 2021 and allow a return to more normal operations in the second half of the year 

operating segments 

we have five complementary operating segments engine distribution components power systems and new power these segments share technology customers strategic partners brand recognition and our distribution network in order to compete more efficiently and effectively in their respective markets in each of our operating segments we compete worldwide with a number of other manufacturers and distributors that produce and sell similar products our products primarily compete on the basis of performance price total cost of ownership fuel economy emissions compliance speed of delivery quality and customer support 

we use segment earnings or losses before interest expense income taxes depreciation and amortization and noncontrolling interests ebitda as the primary basis for the chief operating decision maker to evaluate the performance of each of our reportable operating segments we believe ebitda is a useful measure of our operating performance as it assists investors and debt holders in comparing our performance on a consistent basis without regard to financing methods capital structure income taxes or depreciation and amortization methods which can vary significantly depending upon many factors see note 22 operating segments to the consolidated financial statements for additional information and a reconciliation of our segment information to the corresponding amounts in our consolidated statements of net income

supply 

the performance of the endtoend supply chain extending through to our suppliers is foundational to our ability to meet customers expectations and support longterm growth we are committed to having a robust strategy for how we select and manage our suppliers to enable a market focused supply chain this requires us to continuously evaluate and upgrade our supply base as necessary to ensure we are meeting the needs of our customers 

we use a combination of proactive and reactive methodologies to enhance our understanding of supply base risks which guide the development of risk monitoring and sourcing strategies our category strategy process a process designed to create the most value for the company supports the review of our longterm needs and guides decisions on what we make internally and what we purchase externally for the items we decide to purchase externally the strategies also identify the suppliers we should partner with longterm to provide the best technology the lowest total cost and highest supply chain performance we design andor manufacture our strategic components used in or with our engines and power generation units and new power products key suppliers are managed through longterm supply and cost sharing agreements that assure capacity delivery quality and cost requirements are met over an extended period 

other important elements of our sourcing strategy include 

• working with suppliers to measure and improve their environmental footprint 

• selecting and managing suppliers to comply with our supplier code of conduct and 

• assuring our suppliers comply with our prohibited and restricted materials policy 

patents and trademarks 

we own or control a significant number of patents and trademarks relating to the products we manufacture these patents and trademarks were granted and registered over a period of years although these patents and trademarks are generally considered beneficial to our operations we do not believe any patent group of patents or trademark other than our leading brand house trademarks is significant to our business 

seasonality 

while individual product lines may experience modest seasonal variation in production there is no material effect on the demand for the majority of our products on a quarterly basis with the exception that our power systems segment normally experiences seasonal declines in the first quarter due to general declines in construction spending during this period 

largest customers 

we have thousands of customers around the world and have developed longstanding business relationships with many of them paccar is our largest customer accounting for 15 percent of our consolidated net sales in 2020 17 percent in 2019 and 15 percent in 2018 we have longterm supply agreements with paccar for our heavyduty and mediumduty engines and aftertreatment systems while a significant number of our sales to paccar are under longterm supply agreements these agreements provide for particular engine requirements for specific vehicle models and not a specific volume of engines or aftertreatment systems paccar is our only customer accounting for more than 10 percent of our net sales in 2020 the loss of this customer or a significant decline in the production level of paccar vehicles that use our engines would have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition we have been an engine supplier to paccar for 76 years a summary of principal customers for each operating segment is included in our segment discussion 

in addition to our agreement with paccar we have longterm heavyduty and mediumduty engine and aftertreatment system supply agreements with navistar and daimler we also have an agreement with chrysler to supply engines for its ram trucks collectively our net sales to these four customers including paccar were 32 percent of our consolidated net sales in 2020 37 percent in 2019 and 35 percent in 2018 excluding paccar net sales to any single customer were less than 7 percent of our consolidated net sales in 2020 less than 9 percent in 2019 and less than 9 percent in 2018 these agreements contain standard purchase and sale agreement terms covering engine aftertreatment and engine parts pricing quality and delivery commitments as well as engineering product support obligations the basic nature of our agreements with oem customers is that they are longterm price and operations agreements that help assure the availability of our products to each customer through the duration of the respective agreements agreements with most oems contain bilateral termination provisions giving either party the right to terminate in the event of a material breach change of control or insolvency or bankruptcy of the other party 

backlog 

we have supply agreements with some truck and offhighway equipment oems however most of our business is transacted through open purchase orders these open orders are historically subject to monthtomonth releases and are subject to cancellation on reasonable notice without cancellation charges and therefore are not considered firm at december 31 2020 we did not have any significant backlogs 

research and development 

in 2020 we continued to invest in future critical technologies and products we will continue to make investments to develop new products and improve our current technologies to meet future emission requirements around the world and improve fuel economy performance of diesel and natural gaspowered engines and related components as well as development activities around fully electric hybrid and hydrogen power solutions and hydrogen production 

our research and development programs are focused on product improvements product extensions innovations and cost reductions for our customers research and development expenditures include salaries contractor fees building costs utilities testing technical it administrative expenses and allocation of corporate costs and are expensed net of contract reimbursements when incurred from time to time we enter into agreements with customers and government agencies to fund a portion of the research and development costs of a particular project when not associated with a sales contract we generally account for these reimbursements as an offset to the related research and development expenditure research and development expenses net of contract reimbursements were 903 million in 2020 998 million in 2019 and 894 million in 2018 contract reimbursements were 86 million 90 million and 120 million in 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively 

environmental sustainability 

we are committed to making peoples lives better by powering a more prosperous world that prosperity includes strong communities robust business and environmental sustainability 

the highest level of accountability for our climaterelated risks and opportunities is with the safety environment and technology set committee of the board of directors the board the action committee for environmental sustainability meets monthly and reports to the chairman and to the set committee at least annually 

in late 2019 we introduced planet 2050 a sustainability strategy focused on three priority areas addressing climate change and air emissions using natural resources in the most sustainable way and improving communities the strategy includes eight specific goals to achieve by 2030 including sciencebased carbon dioxide reduction targets for newly sold products and facilities as well as aspirational targets for 2050 we are currently evaluating how the new goals will be integrated into business planning and will report on progress beginning in 2022 

our sustainability progress report for 20192020 reports on environmental sustainability goals and commitments from our 2014 plan as well as other key environmental and climate metrics and targets the 2014 plan goals were as follows 

• partnering with customers to improve the fuel efficiency of our products in use targeting an annual runrate reduction of 35 million metric tons of carbon dioxide 

• achieving a 32 percent energy intensity reduction from company facilities by the end of 2020 using a baseline year of 2010 and increasing the portion of electricity we use derived from renewable sources

environmental compliance 

product certification and compliance 

our engines are subject to extensive statutory and regulatory requirements that directly or indirectly impose standards governing emissions and noise over the past several years we have increased our global environmental compliance presence and expertise to understand and meet emerging product environmental regulations around the world our ability to comply with these and future emission standards is an essential element in maintaining our leadership position in regulated markets we have made and will continue to make significant capital and research expenditures to comply with these standards 

we strive to be a leader in developing and implementing technologies that provide customers with the highest performing products while minimizing the impact on the environment and we have a long history of working with governments and regulators to achieve these goals we remain committed to ensuring our products meet all current and future emission standards and delivering value to our customers 

formed in 2019 the product compliance and regulatory affairs team leads both engine emissions certification and compliance and regulatory affairs initiatives this organization is led by the vice president  product compliance and regulatory affairs who reports directly to the chief executive officer and the new vice president joins the cummins executive team and cummins leadership team the focus of this organization is to strengthen our ability to design great products that help our customers win while ensuring compliance with increasingly challenging global emission regulations the organization also works to enhance our collaboration with 

the agencies setting the direction and regulations of emissions to best ensure we are meeting every expectation today while planning for future changes 

following conversations with the us environmental protection agency epa and california air resources board carb regarding certification for the engines in the 2019 ram 2500 and 3500 trucks we made the decision to review our certification process and compliance with emission standards this review is being conducted with external advisers to ensure the certification and all of our processes for our pickup truck applications are consistent with our internal policies engineering standards and applicable laws in addition we voluntarily disclosed our formal internal review to the regulators and to other government agencies the department of justice doj and the securities and exchange commission sec and worked cooperatively with them to ensure a complete and thorough review we fully cooperated with the dojs and the secs information requests and inquiries and based on recent communications with these agencies we do not expect further inquiries see note 14 commitments and contingencies to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

engine certifications 

our engines are certified globally through various categories within onhighway and offhighway applications regulations in these categories typically control nitrous oxides nox particulate matter pm and ghg the current onhighway nox and pm emission standards came into effect in india on april 1 2020 bs vi china on july 1 2019 ns vi the eu on january 1 2013 euro vi and on january 1 2010 for the epa to meet these regulations midrange and heavyduty engines for india china eu and epa require nox aftertreatment nox reduction is achieved by an integrated technology solution comprised of the xpi high pressure common rail fuel system scr technology in some cases nextgeneration cooled egr advanced electronic controls proven air handling and the cummins diesel particulate filter dpf the ministry of road transport and highways ministry of ecology and environment eu epa and carb have certified that our engines meet the current emission requirements emission standards in international markets including japan mexico australia brazil and russia are becoming more stringent we believe that our experience in meeting the eu and epa emission standards leaves us well positioned to take advantage of opportunities in these markets as the need for emission control capability grows 

in 2013 we certified to epas first ever ghg regulations for onhighway medium and heavyduty engines additionally the epa 2013 regulations added the requirement of onboard diagnostics which were introduced on the isx 15 in 2010 across the full onhighway product line while maintaining the same nearzero emission levels of nox and pm required in 2010 onboard diagnostics provide enhanced service capability with standardized diagnostic trouble codes service tool interface incab warning lamp and service information availability the new ghg and fuelefficiency regulations were required for all heavyduty diesel and natural gas engines beginning in january 2014 our ghg certification was the first engine certificate issued by the epa and uses the same proven base engine with the xpi fuel system variable geometry turbocharger vgt tm  and cummins aftertreatment system with dpf and scr technology application of these engines and aftertreatment technologies continues in our products that comply with the 2021 ghg regulations 

our offhighway engines designed for tier 4  stage v standards were based on our extensive onhighway experience developing scr high pressure fuel systems dpf and vgt tm  our products offer low fuel consumption high torque rise and power output extended maintenance intervals reliable and durable operation and a long life to overhaul period all while meeting the most stringent emission standards in the industrial market our offhighway products power multiple applications including construction mining marine agriculture rail defense and oil and gas and serve a global customer base the current epa tier 4 offhighway emission standards came into effect between 20132015 for all engine power categories the current eu stage v offhighway emission standards became effective in 2019 for certain engine power categories and were completely effective january 2021 for all remaining categories 

other environmental statutes and regulations 

expenditures for environmental control activities and environmental remediation projects at our facilities in the us have not been a substantial portion of our annual expenses and are not expected to be material in 2021 we believe we are in compliance in all material respects with laws and regulations applicable to our plants and operations 

in the us pursuant to notices received from federal and state agencies andor defendant parties in site environmental contribution actions we have been identified as a potentially responsible party under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of 1980 as amended or similar state laws at fewer than 20 waste disposal sites 

based upon our experiences at similar sites we believe that our aggregate future remediation costs will not be material we have established accruals that we believe are adequate for our expected future liability with respect to these sites in addition we have several other sites where we are working with governmental authorities on remediation projects the costs for these remediation projects are not expected to be material

 item 1a risk factors 

set forth below and elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k are some of the principal risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual business results to differ materially from any forwardlooking statements contained in this report and could individually or in combination have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows these risk factors should be considered in addition to our cautionary comments concerning forwardlooking statements in this report including statements related to markets for our products and trends in our business that involve a number of risks and uncertainties our separate section above cautionary statements regarding forwardlooking information should be considered in addition to the following statements 

government regulation 

we are conducting a formal internal review of our emission certification process and compliance with emission standards with respect to our pickup truck applications and are working with the epa and carb to address their questions about these applications the results of this formal review and regulatory processes or the discovery of any noncompliance issues could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and cash flows 

we previously announced that we are conducting a formal internal review of our emissions certification process and compliance with emission standards with respect to all of our pickup truck applications following conversations with the epa and carb regarding certification of our engines for model year 2019 ram 2500 and 3500 trucks during conversations with the epa and carb about the effectiveness of our pickup truck applications the regulators raised concerns that certain aspects of our emissions systems may reduce the effectiveness of our emissions control systems and thereby act as defeat devices as a result our internal review focuses in part on the regulators’ concerns we are working closely with the regulators to enhance our emissions systems to improve the effectiveness of all of our pickup truck applications and to fully address the regulators’ requirements based on discussions with the regulators we have developed a new calibration for the engines in model year 2019 ram 2500 and 3500 trucks that has been included in all engines shipped since september 2019 during our discussions the regulators have asked us to look at other model years and other engines we will continue to work together closely with the relevant regulators to develop and implement recommendations for improvement as part of our ongoing commitment to compliance due to the continuing nature of the formal review our ongoing cooperation with the regulators and the presence of many unknown facts and circumstances we are not yet able to estimate the financial impact of these matters it is possible that the consequences of any remediation plans resulting from our formal review and these regulatory processes could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and cash flows in the periods in which these emissions certification issues are addressed 

our products are subject to extensive statutory and regulatory requirements that can significantly increase our costs and along with increased scrutiny from regulatory agencies and unpredictability in the adoption implementation and enforcement of increasingly stringent and fragmented emission standards by multiple jurisdictions around the world could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

our engines are subject to extensive statutory and regulatory requirements governing emissions and noise including standards imposed by the epa the eu state regulatory agencies such as the carb and other regulatory agencies around the world regulatory agencies are making certification and compliance with emissions and noise standards more stringent and subjecting diesel engine products to an increasing level of scrutiny the discovery of noncompliance issues could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

developing engines and components to meet more stringent and changing regulatory requirements with different implementation timelines and emission requirements makes developing engines efficiently for multiple markets complicated and could result in substantial additional costs that may be difficult to recover in certain markets while we have met previous deadlines our ability to comply with existing and future regulatory standards will be essential for us to maintain our competitive position in the engine applications and industries we serve the successful development and introduction of new and enhanced products in order to comply with new regulatory requirements are subject to other risks such as delays in product development cost overruns and unanticipated technical and manufacturing difficulties 

in addition to these risks the nature and timing of government implementation and enforcement of increasingly stringent emission standards in our worldwide markets are unpredictable and subject to change any delays in implementation or enforcement could result in a loss of our competitive advantage and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

we operate our business on a global basis and policy changes affecting international trade could adversely impact the demand for our products and our competitive position 

we manufacture sell and service products globally and rely upon a global supply chain to deliver the raw materials components systems and parts that we need to manufacture and service our products changes in government policies on foreign trade and investment can affect the demand for our products and services cause nonus customers to shift preferences toward domestically manufactured or branded products and impact the competitive position of our products or prevent us from being able to sell products in certain countries our business benefits from free trade agreements such as the new united statesmexicocanada agreement and the us trade relationship with china brazil and france and efforts to withdraw from or substantially modify such agreements or arrangements in addition to the implementation of more restrictive trade policies such as more detailed inspections higher tariffs including but not limited to additional tariffs on the import of steel or aluminum import or export licensing requirements exchange controls or new barriers to entry could adversely impact our production costs customer demand and our relationships with customers and suppliers any of these consequences could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

the uk’s exit from the european union eu could materially and adversely impact our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

on january 31 2020 the uk exited from the eu brexit additionally the results of the uk’s brexit caused and may continue to cause volatility in global stock markets currency exchange rate fluctuations and global economic uncertainty although it is unknown what the terms of the uk’s future relationship with the eu will be it is possible that there will be higher tariffs or greater restrictions on imports and exports between the uk and the eu and increased regulatory complexities the effects of brexit will depend on any agreements the uk makes to retain access to eu markets either during a transitional period or on a permanent basis these measures could potentially disrupt our supply chain including delays of imports and exports limited access to human capital within some of the target markets and jurisdictions in which we operate and adverse changes to tax benefits or liabilities in these or other jurisdictions in addition brexit could lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations including with respect to emissions and similar certifications granted to us by the eu as the uk determines which eu laws to replace or replicate any of these effects of brexit among others could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

unanticipated changes in our effective tax rate the adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could adversely affect our profitability 

we are subject to income taxes in the us and numerous international jurisdictions our income tax provision and cash tax liability in the future could be adversely affected by changes in earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities changes in tax laws and the discovery of new information in the course of our tax return preparation process the carrying value of deferred tax assets which are predominantly in the us is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income in the us we are also subject to ongoing tax audits these audits can involve complex issues which may require an extended period of time to resolve and can be highly judgmental tax authorities may disagree with certain tax reporting positions taken by us and as a result assess additional taxes against us we regularly assess the likely outcomes of these audits in order to determine the appropriateness of our tax provision the amounts ultimately paid upon resolution of these or subsequent tax audits could be materially different from the amounts previously included in our income tax provision and therefore could have a material impact on our tax provision 

our global operations are subject to laws and regulations that impose significant compliance costs and create reputational and legal risk 

due to the international scope of our operations we are subject to a complex system of commercial and trade regulations around the world recent years have seen an increase in the development and enforcement of laws regarding trade compliance and anticorruption such as the us foreign corrupt practices act and similar laws from other countries as well as new regulatory requirements regarding data privacy such as the european union general data protection regulation our numerous foreign subsidiaries affiliates and joint venture partners are governed by laws rules and business practices that differ from those of the us the activities of these entities may not comply with us laws or business practices or our code of business conduct violations of these laws may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions could disrupt our business and result in an adverse effect on our reputation business and results of operations financial condition and cash flows we cannot predict the nature scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our operations might be subject or the manner in which existing laws might be administered or interpreted 

our operations are subject to increasingly stringent environmental laws and regulations 

our plants and operations are subject to increasingly stringent environmental laws and regulations in all of the countries in which we operate including laws and regulations governing air emission discharges to water and the generation handling storage 

transportation treatment and disposal of waste materials while we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with these environmental laws and regulations there can be no assurance that we will not be adversely impacted by costs liabilities or claims with respect to existing or subsequently acquired operations under either present laws and regulations or those that may be adopted or imposed in the future we are also subject to laws requiring the cleanup of contaminated property if a release of hazardous substances occurs at or from any of our current or former properties or at a landfill or another location where we have disposed of hazardous materials we may be held liable for the contamination and the amount of such liability could be material 

future bans or limitations on the use of dieselpowered vehicles or other applications could have a material adverse impact on our business over the long term 

in an effort to limit greenhouse gas emissions and combat climate change multiple countries and cities have announced that they plan to implement a ban on the use in their countries or cities of dieselpowered products in the near or distant future these countries include china india and germany in addition california government officials have called for the state to phase out sales of dieselpowered certain vehicles by 2035 to the extent that these types of bans are actually implemented in the future on a broad basis or in one or more of our key markets our diesel business over the longterm could experience material adverse impacts 

business conditions  disruptions 

we are vulnerable to supply shortages from singlesourced suppliers including suppliers that may be impacted by the covid19 pandemic and any delay in receiving critical supplies could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

we single source a significant number of parts and raw materials critical to our business operations any delay in our suppliers deliveries may adversely affect our operations at multiple manufacturing locations forcing us to seek alternative supply sources to avoid serious disruptions delays may be caused by factors affecting our suppliers including the covid19 pandemic capacity constraints port congestion labor disputes economic downturns availability of credit or impaired financial condition suppliers allocations to other purchasers weather emergencies natural disasters acts of government or acts of war or terrorism in particular if the covid19 pandemic continues and results in extended periods of travel commercial and other restrictions we could continue to incur global supply disruptions any extended delay in receiving critical supplies could impair our ability to deliver products to our customers and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

a sustained market slowdown due to the impacts from the covid19 pandemic other public health crises epidemics or pandemics or otherwise could have a material and adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

the covid19 pandemic triggered a significant downturn in our markets globally and these challenging market conditions could continue for an extended period of time most global economies slowed and there is still much uncertainty as to when these global markets will fully recover if any or all of these major markets were to endure a sustained slowdown or recession due to the impacts of the covid19 pandemic other public health crises epidemics or pandemics or otherwise decline it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

our manufacturing and supply chain abilities may be materially and adversely impacted by an extended shutdown or disruption of our operations due to the covid19 pandemic which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

the outbreak of covid19 spread throughout the world and became a global pandemic with the resultant economic impacts evolving into a worldwide recession the pandemic triggered a significant downturn in our markets globally which continued to unfavorably impact market conditions throughout 2020 and these challenging market conditions could continue for an extended period of time in an effort to contain the spread of covid19 maintain the wellbeing of our employees and stakeholders match the reduced demand from our customers and in accordance with governmental requirements we closed or partially shut down certain office manufacturing distribution and technical center facilities around the world in march 2020 although most of our manufacturing distribution and technical center facilities reopened early in the second quarter of 2020 some operated at reduced capacities most of our global office buildings remained closed through the remainder of 2020 despite many of our markets recovering in the second half of 2020 the ongoing spread of the virus prior to widespread vaccination presents several risks to our business especially in the first half of 2021 while the impacts of the pandemic and the resulting global recession are expected to be temporary the duration of the production and supply chain disruptions and related financial impacts cannot be estimated at this time should the reduced manufacturing and distribution capacities continue for an extended period of time or worsen the impact on our production and supply chain could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

we face the challenge of accurately aligning our capacity with our demand 

our markets are cyclical in nature and we face periods when demand fluctuates significantly higher or lower than our normal operating levels including covid19 related shutdowns accurately forecasting our expected volumes and appropriately adjusting 

our capacity are important factors in determining our results of operations and cash flows we manage our capacity by adjusting our manufacturing workforce capital expenditures and purchases from suppliers in periods of weak demand we may face underutilized capacity and unrecovered overhead costs while in periods of strong demand we may experience unplanned costs and could fail to meet customer demand we cannot guarantee that we will be able to adequately adjust our manufacturing capacity in response to significant changes in customer demand which could harm our business in addition the covid19 pandemic and related reductions in demand forced certain of our customer’s facilities around the world to close or partially shut down operations inhibiting our ability to forecast demand and caused related closures and partial shutdowns of certain of our manufacturing facilities if we do not accurately align our manufacturing capabilities with demand it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

our truck manufacturers and oem customers discontinuing outsourcing their engine supply needs financial distress particularly related to the covid19 pandemic or bankruptcy or a changeincontrol of one of our large truck oem customers could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

we recognize significant sales of engines and components to a few large onhighway truck oem customers which have been an integral part of our positive business results for several years many are truck manufacturers or oems that manufacture engines for some of their own vehicles despite their own engine manufacturing abilities these customers have historically chosen to outsource certain types of engine production to us due to the quality of our engine products our emission compliance capabilities our systems integration their customers preferences their desire for cost reductions their desire for eliminating production risks and their desire to maintain company focus however there can be no assurance that these customers will continue to outsource or outsource as much of their engine production in the future in addition increased levels of oem vertical integration could result from a number of factors such as shifts in our customers business strategies acquisition by a customer of another engine manufacturer the inability of thirdparty suppliers to meet product specifications and the emergence of lowcost production opportunities in foreign countries any significant reduction in the level of engine production outsourcing from our truck manufacturer or oem customers financial distress of one of our large truck oem customers due to the covid19 pandemic or bankruptcy or a changeincontrol could likely lead to significant reductions in our sales volumes commercial disputes receivable collection issues and other negative consequences that could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

a slowdown in infrastructure development andor depressed commodity prices could adversely affect our business 

infrastructure development and strong commodity prices have been significant drivers of our historical growth but as the pace of investment in infrastructure slowed in recent years especially in china and brazil commodity prices were significantly lower and demand for our products in offhighway markets was weak weakness in commodity prices including any negative impacts on commodity prices such as oil gas and coal adversely impacted mining industry participants’ demand for vehicles and equipment that contain our engines and other products over the past several years continued deterioration in infrastructure and commodities markets including the impacts from covid19 could adversely affect our customers’ demand for vehicles and equipment and as a result could adversely affect our business 

we may fail to realize all of the expected enhanced revenue earnings and cash flow from our investment in the eaton cummins automated transmission technologies joint venture 

a significant component of our investment in the eaton cummins automated transmission technologies joint venture related to the expected growth in automated transmission products in north america and china while we believe we will ultimately achieve these objectives it is possible that we will be unable to achieve our original expectations within our anticipated time frame or in the anticipated amounts as part of the purchase accounting associated with the formation of the joint venture significant goodwill and intangible asset balances were recorded on the consolidated balance sheet if cash flows from the joint venture fall short of our anticipated amounts these assets could be subject to noncash impairment charges negatively impacting our earnings 

we derive significant earnings from investees that we do not directly control with more than 50 percent of these earnings from our chinabased investees 

for 2020 we recognized 452 million of equity royalty and interest income from investees compared to 330 million in 2019 approximately half of our equity royalty and interest income from investees is from four of our 50 percent owned joint ventures in china  beijing foton cummins engine co ltd dongfeng cummins engine company ltd chongqing cummins engine company ltd and dongfeng cummins emission solutions co ltd although a significant percentage of our net income is derived from these unconsolidated entities we do not unilaterally control their management or their operations which puts a substantial portion of our net income at risk from the actions or inactions of these entities a significant reduction in the level of contribution by these entities to our net income would likely have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows 

products and technology 

our products are subject to recall for performance or safetyrelated issues 

our products are subject to recall for performance or safetyrelated issues product recalls subject us to reputational risk loss of current and future customers reduced revenue and product recall costs product recall costs are incurred when we decide either voluntarily or involuntarily to recall a product through a formal campaign to solicit the return of specific products due to known or suspected performance or safety issues any significant product recalls could have material adverse effects on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows see note 12 product warranty liability to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

the development of new technologies may materially reduce the demand for our current products and services 

we are investing in new products and technologies including electrified powertrains hydrogen production and fuel cells for planned introduction into certain new and existing markets given the early stages of development of some of these new products and technologies there can be no guarantee of the future market acceptance and investment returns with respect to our planned products which will face competition from an array of other technologies and manufacturers the increased adoption of electrified powertrains in some market segments could result in lower demand for current diesel or natural gas engines and components and over time reduce the demand for related parts and service revenues from diesel or natural gas powertrains furthermore it is possible that we may not be successful in developing segmentleading electrified or alternate fuel powertrains and some of our existing customers could choose to develop their own or source from other manufacturers and any of these factors could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

lowerthananticipated market acceptance of our new or existing products or services could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

although we conduct market research before launching new or refreshed engines and introducing new services many factors both within and outside our control affect the success of new or existing products and services in the marketplace offering engines and services that customers desire and value can mitigate the risks of increasing competition and declining demand but products and services that are perceived to be less than desirable whether in terms of price quality overall value fuel efficiency or other attributes can exacerbate these risks with increased consumer interconnectedness through the internet social media and other media mere allegations relating to poor quality safety fuel efficiency corporate responsibility or other key attributes can negatively impact our reputation or market acceptance of our products or services even if such allegations prove to be inaccurate or unfounded 

our products are exposed to variability in material and commodity costs 

our businesses establish prices with our customers in accordance with contractual time frames however the timing of material and commodity market price increases may prevent us from passing these additional costs on to our customers through timely pricing actions additionally higher material and commodity costs around the world may offset our efforts to reduce our cost structure while we customarily enter into financial transactions and contractual pricing adjustment provisions with our customers that attempt to address some of these risks notably with respect to copper platinum and palladium there can be no assurance that commodity price fluctuations will not adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows in addition while the use of commodity price hedging instruments and contractual pricing adjustments may provide us with some protection from adverse fluctuations in commodity prices by utilizing these instruments we potentially forego the benefits that might result from favorable fluctuations in price as a result higher material and commodity costs as well as hedging these commodity costs during periods of decreasing prices could result in declining margins 

our business is exposed to potential product liability claims 

we face an inherent business risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that our products failure to perform to specification results or is alleged to result in property damage bodily injury andor death at any given time we are subject to various and multiple product liability claims any one of which if decided adversely to us may have a material adverse effect on our reported results of operation in the period in which our liability with respect to any such claim is recognized while we maintain insurance coverage with respect to certain product liability claims we may not be able to obtain such insurance on acceptable terms in the future if at all and any such insurance may not provide adequate coverage against product liability claims in addition product liability claims can be expensive to defend and can divert the attention of management and other personnel for significant periods of time regardless of the ultimate outcome furthermore even if we are successful in defending against a claim relating to our products claims of this nature could cause our customers to lose confidence in our products and us 

general 

the covid19 pandemic created disruptions and turmoil in global credit and financial markets and ongoing impacts could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

the covid19 pandemic created disruptions and turmoil in the global credit and financial markets and made it more difficult and costly for us to access capital on favorable terms to meet our liquidity needs the disruptions to the global credit and financial markets could also have material negative impacts on business operations and financial positions of our customers and suppliers which may negatively impact our orders sales and supply chain if the impacts of the covid19 pandemic on global credit and financial markets continue or worsen it could negatively impact our business along with the financial condition of our customers and suppliers and it could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

we may be adversely impacted by work stoppages and other labor matters 

at december 31 2020 we employed approximately 57825 persons worldwide approximately 20279 of our employees worldwide were represented by various unions under collective bargaining agreements that expire between 2021 and 2025 while we have no reason to believe that we will be materially impacted by work stoppages or other labor matters there can be no assurance that future issues with our labor unions will be resolved favorably or that we will not encounter future strikes work stoppages or other types of conflicts with labor unions or our employees any of these consequences may have an adverse effect on us or may limit our flexibility in dealing with our workforce in addition many of our customers and suppliers have unionized work forces work stoppages or slowdowns experienced by us our customers or suppliers including any work stoppages or slowdowns related to the covid19 pandemic could result in slowdowns or closures that would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flow 

we rely on our executive leadership team and other key personnel as a critical part of our human capital resources 

we depend on the skills institutional knowledge working relationships and continued services and contributions of key personnel including our executive leadership team as a critical part of our human capital resources in addition our ability to achieve our operating and strategic goals depends on our ability to identify hire train and retain qualified individuals we compete with other companies both within and outside of our industry for talented personnel and we may lose key personnel or fail to attract train and retain other talented personnel any such loss or failure could have material adverse effects on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

in particular our continued success will depend in part on our ability to retain the talents and dedication of key employees if key employees terminate their employment or become ill as a result of the covid19 pandemic or otherwise our business activities may be adversely affected and our management team’s attention may be diverted in addition we may not be able to locate suitable replacements for any key employees who leave 

we may be adversely impacted by the effects of climate change and may incur increased costs and experience other impacts due to new or more stringent greenhouse gas regulations designed to address climate change 

the scientific consensus indicates that emissions of greenhouse gases ghg continue to alter the composition of earth’s atmosphere in ways that are affecting and are expected to continue to affect the global climate the potential impacts of climate change on our customers product offerings operations facilities and suppliers are accelerating and uncertain as they will be particular to local and customerspecific circumstances these potential impacts may include among other items physical longterm changes in freshwater availability and the frequency and severity of weather events as well as customer product changes either through preference or regulation 

concerns regarding climate change may lead to additional international national regional and local legislative and regulatory responses various stakeholders including legislators and regulators shareholders and nongovernmental organizations are continuing to look for ways to reduce ghg emissions we could face risks to our brand reputation investor confidence and market share due to an inability to innovate and develop new products that decrease ghg emissions increased input costs such as fuel and electricity and compliancerelated costs could also impact customer operations and demand for our products as the impact of any future ghg legislative or regulatory requirements on our global businesses and products is dependent on the timing scope and design of the mandates or standards we are currently unable to predict its potential impact which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows the regulation of ghg emissions could also increase our operating costs through higher utility transportation and materials costs 

our plan to reposition our portfolio of product offerings through exploration of strategic acquisitions and divestitures may expose us to additional costs and risks 

part of our strategic plan is to improve our revenue growth gross margins and earnings by exploring the repositioning of our portfolio of product line offerings through the pursuit of potential strategic acquisitions andor divestitures to provide future strategic financial and operational benefits and improve shareholder value there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify suitable candidates or consummate these transactions on favorable terms the successful identification and completion of any strategic transaction depends on a number of factors that are not entirely within our control including the availability of suitable candidates and our ability to negotiate terms acceptable to all parties involved conclude satisfactory agreements and obtain all necessary regulatory approvals accordingly we may not be able to successfully negotiate and complete specific transactions the exploration negotiation and consummation of strategic transactions may involve significant expenditures by us which may adversely affect our results of operations at the time such expenses are incurred and may divert management’s attention from our existing business strategic transactions also may have adverse effects on our existing business relationships with suppliers and customers if required the financing for strategic acquisitions could result in an increase in our indebtedness dilute the interests of our shareholders or both any acquisition may not be accretive to us for a significant period of time following the completion of such acquisition also our ability to effectively integrate any potential acquisition into our existing business and culture may not be successful which could jeopardize future financial and operational performance for the combined businesses in addition if an acquisition results in any additional goodwill or increase in other intangible assets on our balance sheet and subsequently becomes impaired we would be required to record a noncash impairment charge which could result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition similarly any strategic divestiture of a product line or business may reduce our revenue and earnings reduce the diversity of our business result in substantial costs and expenses and cause disruption to our employees customers vendors and communities in which we operate 

our information technology systems and our products are exposed to potential security breaches or other disruptions which may adversely impact our competitive position reputation results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

we rely on the capacity reliability and security of our information technology systems and data security infrastructure in connection with various aspects of our business activities we also rely on our ability to expand and continually update these systems and related infrastructure in response to the changing needs of our business as we implement new systems they may not perform as expected we face the challenge of supporting our older systems and implementing necessary upgrades in addition some of these systems are managed by thirdparty service providers and are not under our direct control if we experience a problem with an important information technology system including during system upgrades andor new system implementations the resulting disruptions could have an adverse effect on our business and reputation as customers adopt and rely on cloudbased digital technologies and services we offer any disruption of the confidentiality integrity or availability of those services could have an adverse effect on our business and reputation 

the data handled by our information technology systems is vulnerable to security threats our operations routinely involve receiving storing processing and transmitting sensitive information pertaining to our business customers dealers suppliers employees and other sensitive matters while we continually work to safeguard our systems and mitigate potential risks there is no assurance that these actions will be sufficient to prevent information technology security threats such as security breaches computer malware computer viruses and other cyber attacks which are increasing in both frequency and sophistication along with power outages or hardware failures these threats could result in unauthorized public disclosures of information create financial liability subject us to legal or regulatory sanctions disrupt our ability to conduct our business result in the loss of intellectual property or damage our reputation with customers dealers suppliers and other stakeholders as a result of the covid19 pandemic and resulting government actions to restrict movement a large percentage of our salaried employees are working remotely this remote working environment may pose a heightened risk for security breaches or other disruptions of our information technology systems 

in addition our products including our engines contain interconnected and increasingly complex systems that control various processes and these systems are potentially subject to cyber attacks and disruption the impact of a significant information technology event on either of our information technology systems or our products could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position reputation results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

we are exposed to political economic and other risks that arise from operating a multinational business 

our business is subject to the political economic and other risks that are inherent in operating in numerous countries these risks include 

• public health crises including the spread of a contagious disease such as covid19 and other catastrophic events 

• the difficulty of enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through foreign legal systems 

• trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements 

• the imposition of taxes on foreign income and tax rates in certain foreign countries that exceed those in the us 

• the imposition of tariffs exchange controls or other restrictions 

• difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations and the application of foreign labor regulations 

• required compliance with a variety of foreign laws and regulations and 

• changes in general economic and political conditions in countries where we operate particularly in emerging markets 

as we continue to operate our business globally our success will depend in part on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these and other related risks there can be no assurance that the consequences of these and other factors relating to our multinational operations will not have a material adverse effect upon us 

we face significant competition in the regions we serve 

the markets in which we operate are highly competitive we compete worldwide with a number of other manufacturers and distributors that produce and sell similar products we primarily compete with diesel engines and related diesel products however new technologies continue to be developed for gasoline natural gas electrification and other technologies and we will continue to face new competition from these expanding technologies our products primarily compete on the basis of performance price total cost of ownership fuel economy emissions compliance speed of delivery quality and customer support we also face competitors in some emerging regions who have established local practices and long standing relationships with participants in these markets there can be no assurance that our products will be able to compete successfully with the products of other companies and in other markets 

increasing global competition among our customers may affect our existing customer relationships and restrict our ability to benefit from some of our customers growth 

as our customers in emerging markets continue to grow in size and scope they are increasingly seeking to export their products to other countries this has meant greater demand for our advanced engine technologies to help these customers meet the more stringent emissions requirements of developed markets as well as greater demand for access to our distribution systems for purposes of equipment servicing as these emerging market customers enter into and begin to compete in more developed markets they may increasingly begin to compete with our existing customers in these markets our further aid to emerging market customers could adversely affect our relationships with developed market customers in addition to the extent the competition does not correspond to overall growth in demand we may see little or no benefit from this type of expansion by our emerging market customers 

we are subject to foreign currency exchange rate and other related risks 

we conduct operations in many areas of the world involving transactions denominated in a variety of currencies we are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk to the extent that our costs are denominated in currencies other than those in which we earn revenues in addition since our financial statements are denominated in us dollars changes in foreign currency exchange rates between the us dollar and other currencies have had and will continue to have an impact on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows the us dollar strengthened in recent years resulting in material unfavorable impacts on our revenues in those years if the us dollar continues strengthening against other currencies we will experience additional volatility in our financial statements while we customarily enter into financial transactions that attempt to address these risks and many of our supply agreements with customers include foreign currency exchange rate adjustment provisions there can be no assurance that foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations will not adversely affect our future results of operations and cash flows in addition while the use of currency hedging instruments may provide us with some protection from adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates by utilizing these instruments we potentially forego the benefits that might result from favorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates we also face risks arising from the imposition of foreign exchange controls and currency devaluations foreign exchange controls may limit our ability to convert foreign currencies into us dollars or to remit dividends and other payments by our foreign subsidiaries or businesses located in or conducted within a country imposing controls currency devaluations result in a diminished value of funds denominated in the currency of the country instituting the devaluation see managements discussion and analysis for additional information 

significant declines in future financial and stock market conditions particularly those related to the global recession due to the covid19 pandemic could diminish our pension plan asset performance and adversely impact our results of operations financial condition and cash flow 

we sponsor both funded and unfunded domestic and foreign defined benefit pension and other retirement plans our pension cost and the required contributions to our pension plans are directly affected by the value of plan assets the projected and actual rates of return on plan assets and the actuarial assumptions we use to measure our defined benefit pension plan obligations including the discount rate at which future projected and accumulated pension obligations are discounted to a present value we could experience increased pension cost due to a combination of factors including the decreased investment performance of pension plan assets decreases in the discount rate and changes in our assumptions relating to the expected return on plan assets significant declines in current and future financial and stock market conditions related to the covid19 pandemic could cause material losses in our pension plan assets which could result in increased pension cost in future years and adversely impact our results of operations financial condition and cash flow depending upon the severity and length of market declines and government regulatory changes we may be legally obligated to make pension payments in the us and perhaps other countries and these contributions could be material 

we are exposed to risks arising from the price and availability of energy 

the level of demand for our products and services is influenced in multiple ways by the price and availability of energy high energy costs generally drive greater demand for better fuel economy in almost all countries in which we operate some of our engine products have been developed with a primary purpose of offering fuel economy improvements and if energy costs decrease or increase less than expected demand for these products may likewise decrease the relative unavailability of electricity in some emerging market countries also influences demand for our electricity generating products such as our diesel generators if these countries add energy capacity by expanding their power grids at a rate equal to or faster than the growth in demand for energy the demand for our generating products could also decrease or increase less than would otherwise be the case

executive summary and financial highlights 

overview 

we are a global power leader that designs manufactures distributes and services diesel natural gas electric and hybrid powertrains and powertrainrelated components including filtration aftertreatment turbochargers fuel systems controls systems air handling systems automated transmissions electric power generation systems batteries electrified power systems hydrogen production and fuel cell products we sell our products to original equipment manufacturers oems distributors dealers and other customers worldwide we have longstanding relationships with many of the leading manufacturers in the markets we serve including paccar inc navistar international corporation daimler trucks north america and stellantis nv chrysler we serve our customers through a network of over 500 whollyowned joint venture and independent distributor locations and over 9000 cummins certified dealer locations with service to approximately 190 countries and territories 

our reportable operating segments consist of engine distribution components power systems and new power this reporting structure is organized according to the products and markets each segment serves the engine segment produces engines 15 liters and smaller and associated parts for sale to customers in onhighway and various offhighway markets our engines are used in trucks of all sizes buses and recreational vehicles as well as in various industrial applications including construction agriculture power generation systems and other offhighway applications the distribution segment includes whollyowned and partiallyowned distributorships engaged in wholesaling engines generator sets and service parts as well as performing service and repair activities on our products and maintaining relationships with various oems throughout the world the components segment sells filtration products aftertreatment systems turbochargers electronics fuel systems and automated transmissions the power systems segment is an integrated power provider which designs manufactures and sells engines 16 liters and larger for industrial applications including mining oil and gas marine and rail standby and prime power generator sets alternators and other power components the new power segment designs manufactures sells and supports hydrogen production solutions as well as electrified power systems ranging from fully electric to hybrid along with innovative components and subsystems including battery and fuel cell technologies we continue to serve all our markets as they adopt electrification and alternative power technologies meeting the needs of our oem partners and end customers 

our financial performance depends in large part on varying conditions in the markets we serve particularly the onhighway construction and general industrial markets demand in these markets tends to fluctuate in response to overall economic conditions our sales may also be impacted by oem inventory levels production schedules and stoppages economic downturns in markets we serve generally result in reduced sales of our products and can result in price reductions in certain products andor markets as a worldwide business our operations are also affected by currency political economic public health crises epidemics or pandemics and regulatory matters including adoption and enforcement of environmental and emission standards in the countries we serve as part of our growth strategy we invest in businesses in certain countries that carry high levels of these risks such as china brazil india mexico russia and countries in the middle east and africa at the same time our geographic diversity and broad product and service offerings have helped limit the impact from a drop in demand in any one industry or customer or the economy of any single country on our consolidated results 

covid19 update 

the outbreak of covid19 spread throughout the world and became a global pandemic with the resultant economic impacts evolving into a worldwide recession the pandemic triggered a significant downturn in our markets globally which continued to unfavorably impact market conditions throughout 2020 and these challenging market conditions could continue for an extended period of time in an effort to contain the spread of covid19 maintain the wellbeing of our employees and stakeholders match the reduced demand from our customers and in accordance with governmental requirements we closed or partially shut down certain office manufacturing distribution and technical center facilities around the world in march 2020 although most of our manufacturing distribution and technical center facilities reopened early in the second quarter of 2020 some operated at reduced capacities most of our global office buildings remained closed through the remainder of 2020 despite many of our markets recovering in the second half of 2020 the ongoing spread of the virus prior to widespread vaccination presents several risks to our business especially in the first half of 2021 

covid19 vaccines are currently being administered around the world with the hope that the majority of the population will have access to the vaccine by the middle of 2021 if the distribution and the effectiveness of the vaccine are consistent with current government and health organization estimates we anticipate the vaccine will mitigate the spread of the virus by the end of 2021 and allow a return to more normal operations in the second half of the year 

while the impacts of the pandemic and the resulting global recession are expected to be temporary the duration of the production and supply chain disruptions and related financial impacts cannot be estimated at this time should the reduced manufacturing and distribution capacities continue for an extended period of time or worsen the impact on our production and supply chain could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows our board of directors the board continues to monitor and evaluate all of these factors along with the continuing impacts of the covid19 pandemic on our business and operations 

2020 results 

a summary of our results is as follows 



worldwide revenues decreased 16 percent in 2020 compared to 2019 as we experienced lower demand in all major operating segments and most geographic regions due to the economic impacts of covid19 and the anticipated 2020 down cycle in most of our markets net sales in the us and canada declined by 21 percent primarily due to covid19 impacts resulting in decreased demand in the north american onhighway markets which also negatively impacted our emission solutions automated transmissions and turbo technologies businesses reduced sales in all distribution product lines decreased demand for power generation equipment and lower demand in offhighway markets especially construction international demand excludes the us and canada declined by 7 percent compared to 2019 with lower sales in all geographic regions except china the decrease in international sales was principally due to covid19 impacts resulting in lower demand for industrial products primarily international mining markets decreased demand for power generation equipment lower volumes in onhighway markets mainly mediumduty truck markets reduced demand in all distribution product lines and unfavorable foreign currency impacts of 2 percent of international sales primarily the 

brazilian real and indian rupee partially offset by higher demand in our emission solutions business in china and india and our electronics and fuel systems business in china

2021 outlook 

covid19 impacts 

the covid19 pandemic negatively impacted our financial performance in 2020 and may continue to do so in the future because the magnitude and duration of the pandemic and its economic consequences are unclear the pandemic’s impact on our performance is difficult to predict 

covid19 positive trends 

covid19 vaccines are currently being administered around the world with the hope that the majority of the population will have access to the vaccine by the middle of 2021 if the distribution and the effectiveness of the vaccine are consistent with current government and health organization estimates we anticipate the vaccine will mitigate the spread of the virus by the end of 2021 and allow a return to more normal operations in the second half of the year 

covid19 challenges 

the ongoing spread of the virus and increase in infections prior to widespread vaccination presents several risks to our business especially in the first half of 2021 the three principle areas where covid19 may negatively impact our financial performance are through its impact on customer demand the impact on our ability to procure parts from suppliers and our ability to operate our manufacturing and distribution facilities 

customer demand – the majority of our major customers including paccar navistar daimler and chrysler experienced extended production shutdowns in response to the pandemic in the first half of 2020 although many of these customers reopened their facilities and ramped up their production in the second half of 2020 levels of future production remain uncertain and will be determined by supply chain constraints market demand and government decisions to keep economies open 

supply chain impact – supplier shutdowns may result in parts shortages and negatively impact our ability to manufacture products and meet aftermarket demand in addition industry parts shortages may impact the timing of when customer facilities reopen and the speed at which customers ramp up production negatively impacting demand for our products lower demand increases the risk that certain suppliers will face financial issues potentially impacting their ability to supply parts 

operations impact  our manufacturing and distribution locations are generally considered critical services and the majority of our facilities remain open to meet customer demand in an effort to contain the spread of covid19 maintain the wellbeing of our employees ensure compliance with governmental requirements or respond to declines in demand from customers we closed or partially shut down certain office manufacturing and distribution facilities around the world at the end of the first quarter and into the third quarter of 2020 we have taken and will continue to take a variety of steps to reduce the risk of employees contracting covid19 at work these steps include social distancing expanded cleaning and sanitization adjusting work hours and temperature checks all manufacturing and distribution facilities are now open but remain subject to future closure if deemed necessary for the safety of our employees or to comply with future government mandates 

business outlook considering potential covid19 impacts 

our outlook reflects the following positive trends and challenges to our business that could impact our revenue and earnings potential in 2021 specific impacts of the covid19 pandemic are highlighted in the above section but are reflected in our market outlook 

positive trends 

• we expect demand for pickup trucks in north america to remain strong and in line with the second half of 2020 

• north american mediumduty and heavyduty truck demand improved in the fourth quarter and could continue to strengthen above second half of 2020 levels 

• market demand for trucks in india is expected to improve from 2020 levels 

• we anticipate our aftermarket business will strengthen from second half of 2020 levels driven primarily by increased truck utilization in north america 

• our liquidity of 70 billion in cash marketable securities and available credit facilities puts us in a strong position to deal with any uncertainties that may arise in 2021 

challenges 

• market demand in truck and construction markets in china is expected to decline from record levels in 2020 

• we may close or restructure additional manufacturing and distribution facilities as we evaluate the appropriate size and structure of our manufacturing and distribution capacity which could result in additional charges 

• uncertainty in the uk surrounding its ability to negotiate trade agreements as a sovereign country could have material negative impacts on our european operations in the longterm 

liquidity and capital resources 

key working capital and balance sheet data 

we fund our working capital with cash from operations and shortterm borrowings including commercial paper when necessary various assets and liabilities including shortterm debt can fluctuate significantly from month to month depending on shortterm liquidity needs as a result working capital is a prime focus of managements attention working capital and balance sheet measures are provided in the following table 



cash flows 

cash and cash equivalents were impacted as follows 



2020 vs 2019 

net cash provided by operating activities decreased 459 million primarily due to lower consolidated net income of 457 million higher restructuring payments of 106 million increased equity in income of investees net of dividends of 91 million and lower other liabilities of 51 million partially offset by lower working capital requirements of 396 million during 2020 lower working capital requirements resulted in a cash inflow of 365 million compared to a cash outflow of 31 million in 2019 mainly due to higher accounts payable and accrued expenses partially offset by a decrease in inventory and higher accounts and notes receivable 

net cash used in investing activities decreased 431 million primarily due to the prior year acquisition of hydrogenics for 235 million lower capital expenditures of 172 million and higher cash flows from derivatives not designated as hedges of 48 million partially offset by higher investments in and advances to equity investees of 31 million 

net cash provided by financing activities increased 2375 million principally due to the issuance of 2 billion of longterm debt and lower repurchases of common stock of 630 million partially offset by higher net payments of commercial paper of 217 million 

the effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents decreased 99 million primarily due to favorable fluctuations in the british pound of 73 million 

2019 vs 2018 

for prior year liquidity comparisons see the liquidity and capital resources section of our 2019 form 10k  

sources of liquidity 

we generate significant ongoing cash flow cash provided by operations is our principal source of liquidity with 27 billion provided in 2020 at december 31 2020 our sources of liquidity included 



cash cash equivalents and marketable securities 

a significant portion of our cash flows are generated outside the us we manage our worldwide cash requirements considering available funds among the many subsidiaries through which we conduct our business and the cost effectiveness with which those funds can be accessed as a result we do not anticipate any local liquidity restrictions to preclude us from funding our operating needs with local resources 

if we distribute our foreign cash balances to the us or to other foreign subsidiaries we could be required to accrue and pay withholding taxes for example if we repatriated cash from certain foreign subsidiaries whose earnings we have asserted are permanently reinvested outside of the us foreign earnings for which we assert permanent reinvestment outside the us consist primarily of earnings of our china india and netherlands domiciled subsidiaries at present we do not foresee a need to repatriate any earnings from these subsidiaries for which we have asserted permanent reinvestment however to help fund cash needs of the us or other international subsidiaries as they arise we repatriate available cash from certain foreign subsidiaries whose earnings are not permanently reinvested when it is cost effective to do so 

debt facilities and other sources of liquidity 

on april 14 2020 we were approved for the federal reserve bank of new york’s commercial paper funding facility cpff program to assure access to the commercial paper funding markets during volatile credit market conditions the cpff was intended to provide a liquidity backstop to us issuers of commercial paper through a special purpose vehicle spv the facility allows us based on our current shortterm credit rating to issue threemonth unsecured commercial paper at a rate equal to a  110 basis point spread over the threemonth overnight index swap rate on the date of issuance the maximum amount of commercial paper that we may issue at any time through this program is 15 billion less the total principal amount of all other outstanding commercial paper that we have issued we retain full access to our board authorized 35 billion commercial paper program as reduced by any amounts issued under this facility the spv is currently scheduled to cease purchasing commercial paper on march 17 2021 at december 31 2020 there were no outstanding borrowings under the cpff program 

in june and july of 2020 we settled our february 2014 interest rate swaps which previously converted our 500 million debt issue due in 2023 from fixed rate to floating rate based on a libor spread we will amortize the 24 million gain realized upon settlement over the remaining threeyear term of the related debt 

on august 19 2020 we entered into an amended and restated 364day credit agreement that allows us to borrow up to 15 billion of unsecured funds at any time prior to august 18 2021 this credit agreement amended and restated the prior 15 billion 364day credit facility that matured on august 19 2020 

on august 24 2020 we issued 2 billion aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes consisting of 500 million aggregate principal amount of 075 senior unsecured notes due in 2025 850 million aggregate principal amount of 150 senior unsecured notes due in 2030 and 650 million aggregate principal amount of 260 senior unsecured notes due in 2050 we received net proceeds of 198 billion 

we have access to committed credit facilities that total 35 billion including the new 15 billion 364day facility that expires august 18 2021 and our 20 billion fiveyear facility that expires on august 22 2023 we maintain credit facilities at the current or higher aggregate amounts by renewing or replacing these facilities at or before expiration these revolving credit facilities are maintained primarily to provide backup liquidity for our commercial paper borrowings and for general corporate purposes both credit agreements include a financial covenant requiring that the leverage ratio of net debt of the company and its subsidiaries to the consolidated total capital of the company and its subsidiaries may not exceed 065 to 10 at december 31 2020 our leverage ratio was 007 to 10 

we can issue up to 35 billion of unsecured shortterm promissory notes commercial paper pursuant to the board authorized commercial paper programs the programs facilitate the private placement of unsecured shortterm debt through thirdparty brokers we intend to use the net proceeds from the commercial paper borrowings for general corporate purposes at december 31 2020 we had 323 million of commercial paper outstanding which effectively reduced the available capacity under our revolving credit facilities to 32 billion the total combined borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facilities and commercial paper programs should not exceed 35 billion see note 11 debt to our consolidated financial statements for additional information 

as a wellknown seasoned issuer we filed an automatic shelf registration for an undetermined amount of debt and equity securities with the sec on february 13 2019 under this shelf registration we may offer from time to time debt securities common stock preferred and preference stock depositary shares warrants stock purchase contracts and stock purchase units 

in july 2017 the uks financial conduct authority which regulates the london interbank offered rate libor announced it intends to phase out libor by the end of 2021 the cessation date for submission and publication of rates for certain tenors of libor has since been extended until mid2023 various central bank committees and working groups continue to discuss replacement of benchmark rates the process for amending existing liborbased contracts and the potential economic impacts of different alternatives the alternative reference rates committee has identified the secured overnight financing rate sofr as its preferred alternative rate for usd libor sofr is a measure of the cost of borrowing cash overnight collateralized by us treasury securities and is based on directly observable us treasurybacked repurchase transactions we are evaluating the potential impact of the replacement of the libor benchmark interest rate including risk management internal operational readiness and monitoring the financial accounting standards board standardsetting process to address financial reporting issues that might arise in connection with transition from libor to a new benchmark rate while we do not believe the change will impact us significantly we continue to evaluate contracts throughout the company in anticipation of libors phase out our revolving credit agreements include a transition mechanism for selecting a benchmark replacement rate for libor with such benchmark replacement rate to be subject to our agreement 

supply chain financing 

we currently have supply chain financing programs with financial intermediaries which provide certain vendors the option to be paid by financial intermediaries earlier than the due date on the applicable invoice when a vendor utilizes the program and receives an early payment from a financial intermediary they take a discount on the invoice we then pay the financial intermediary the face amount of the invoice on the regularly scheduled due date we do not reimburse vendors for any costs they incur for participation in the program and their participation is completely voluntary as a result all amounts owed to the financial intermediaries are presented as accounts payable in our consolidated balance sheets  

uses of cash 

stock repurchases 

in december 2019 the board authorized the acquisition of up to 20 billion of additional common stock upon completion of the 2018 repurchase plan in october 2018 the board authorized the acquisition of up to 20 billion of additional common stock for the year ended december 31 2020 we made the following purchases under our stock repurchase programs 



we temporarily suspended share repurchases after the purchases made in the first quarter of 2020 to conserve cash but resumed repurchasing shares in the fourth quarter of 2020 we may repurchase outstanding shares from time to time during 2021 to enhance shareholder value and to offset the dilutive impact of employee stockbased compensation plans 

dividends 

total dividends paid to common shareholders in 2020 2019 and 2018 were 782 million 761 million and 718 million respectively declaration and payment of dividends in the future depends upon our income and liquidity position among other factors and is subject to declaration by the board who meets quarterly to consider our dividend payment we expect to fund dividend payments with cash from operations 

in october 2020 the board authorized an increase to our quarterly dividend of 3 percent from 1311 per share to 135 per share cash dividends per share paid to common shareholders and the board authorized increases for the last three years were as follows 



capital expenditures 

capital expenditures including spending on internal use software were 575 million 775 million and 784 million in 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively we continue to invest in new product lines and targeted capacity expansions we plan to spend an estimated 725 million to 775 million in 2021 on capital expenditures excluding internal use software with over 50 percent of these expenditures expected to be invested in north america in addition we plan to spend an estimated 60 million to 70 million on internal use software in 2021 

pensions 

our global pension plans including our unfunded and nonqualified plans were 112 percent funded at december 31 2020 our us defined benefit plan which represents approximately 52 percent of the worldwide pension obligation was 128 percent funded and our uk defined benefit plan was 114 percent funded the funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon a variety of variables and assumptions including return on invested assets market interest rates and levels of voluntary contributions to the plans in 2020 the investment gain on our us pension trust was 89 percent while our uk pension trust gain was 137 percent approximately 72 percent of our pension plan assets are held in highly liquid investments such as fixed income and equity securities the remaining 28 percent of our plan assets are held in less liquid but market valued investments including real estate private equity venture capital opportunistic credit and insurance contracts 

we sponsor funded and unfunded domestic and foreign defined benefit pension plans contributions to the us and uk plans were as follows 



we anticipate making total contributions of approximately 75 million to our global defined benefit pension plans in 2021 expected contributions to our defined benefit pension plans in 2021 will meet or exceed the current funding requirements 

current maturities of short and longterm debt 

we had 323 million of commercial paper outstanding at december 31 2020 that matures in less than one year the maturity schedule of our existing longterm debt does not require significant cash outflows until 2023 when our 365 senior notes are due required annual longterm debt principal payments range from 23 million to 526 million over the next five years see note 11 debt to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

restructuring actions 

in the fourth quarter of 2019 we began executing restructuring actions primarily in the form of voluntary and involuntary employee separation programs we incurred a charge of 119 million 90 million aftertax in the fourth quarter of 2019 for these actions which impacted approximately 2300 employees restructuring payments were substantially complete at september 27 2020 see note 21 restructuring actions to the consolidated financial statements for additional information  

credit ratings 

our rating and outlook from each of the credit rating agencies as of the date of filing are shown in the table below 



managements assessment of liquidity 

despite the global recession and volatility in the capital markets due to the pandemic our financial condition and liquidity remain strong our solid balance sheet and credit ratings enable us to have ready access to credit and the capital markets we assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate adequate cash to fund our operating investing and financing activities we believe our existing cash and marketable securities operating cash flow and revolving credit facilities provide us with the financial flexibility needed to fund working capital common stock repurchases acquisitions targeted capital expenditures dividend payments projected pension obligations and debt service obligations through 2021 and beyond we continue to generate significant cash from operations and maintain access to our expanded revolving credit facilities and commercial paper programs as noted above 

contractual obligations and other commercial commitments 

a summary of our contractual obligations and other commercial commitments at december 31 2020 are as follows 



the contractual obligations reported above exclude our unrecognized tax benefits of 122 million as of december 31 2020 we are not able to reasonably estimate the period in which cash outflows relating to uncertain tax contingencies could occur see note 4 income taxes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

application of critical accounting estimates 

a summary of our significant accounting policies is included in note 1 summary of significant accounting policies of our consolidated financial statements which discusses accounting policies that we have selected from acceptable alternatives 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the us which often requires management to make judgments estimates and assumptions regarding uncertainties that affect the reported amounts presented and disclosed in the financial statements management reviews these estimates and assumptions based on historical experience changes in business conditions including the impacts of covid19 and other relevant factors they believe to be reasonable under the circumstances in any given reporting period our actual results may differ from the estimates and assumptions used in preparing our consolidated financial statements 

critical accounting estimates are defined as follows the estimate requires management to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the estimate was made different estimates reasonably could have been used or if changes in the estimate are reasonably likely to occur from period to period and the change would have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations our senior management has discussed the development and selection of our accounting policies related accounting estimates and the disclosures set forth below with the audit committee of the board we believe our critical accounting estimates include estimating liabilities for warranty programs assessing goodwill impairments accounting for income taxes and pension benefits 

warranty programs 

we estimate and record a liability for base warranty programs at the time our products are sold our estimates are based on historical experience and reflect managements best estimates of expected costs at the time products are sold and subsequent adjustment to those expected costs when actual costs differ as a result of the uncertainty surrounding the nature and frequency of product recall programs the liability for such programs is recorded when we commit to a recall action or when a recall becomes probable and estimable which generally occurs when management internally approves or commits to the action our warranty liability is generally affected by component failure rates repair costs and the point of failure within the product life cycle future events and circumstances related to these factors could materially change our estimates and require adjustments to our liability new product launches require a greater use of judgment in developing estimates until historical experience becomes available product specific experience is typically available four or five quarters after product launch with a clear experience trend evident eight quarters after launch we generally record warranty expense for new products upon shipment using a preceding products warranty history and a multiplicative factor based upon preceding similar product experience and new product assessment until sufficient new product data is available for warranty estimation we then use a blend of actual new product experience and preceding product historical experience for several subsequent 

quarters and new product specific experience thereafter note 12 product warranty liability to our consolidated financial statements contains a summary of the activity in our warranty liability account for 2020 2019 and 2018 including adjustments to preexisting warranties 

goodwill impairment 

we are required to make certain subjective and complex judgments in assessing whether a goodwill impairment event has occurred including assumptions and estimates used to determine the fair value of our reporting units we test for goodwill impairment at the reporting unit level and our reporting units are the operating segments or the components of operating segments that constitute businesses for which discrete financial information is available and is regularly reviewed by management 

we have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform an annual quantitative goodwill impairment test we have elected this option on certain reporting units the following events and circumstances are considered when evaluating whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 

• macroeconomic conditions such as a deterioration in general economic conditions including covid19 impacts fluctuations in foreign exchange rates andor other developments in equity and credit markets 

• industry and market considerations such as a deterioration in the environment in which an entity operates material loss in market share and significant declines in product pricing 

• cost factors such as an increase in raw materials labor or other costs 

• overall financial performance such as negative or declining cash flows or a decline in actual or forecasted revenue 

• other relevant entityspecific events such as material changes in management or key personnel and 

• events affecting a reporting unit such as a change in the composition or carrying amount of its net assets including acquisitions and dispositions 

the examples noted above are not allinclusive and we consider other relevant events and circumstances that affect the fair value of a reporting unit in determining whether to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test 

our goodwill recoverability assessment is based on our annual strategic planning process this process includes an extensive review of expectations for the longterm growth of our businesses and forecasted future cash flows in order to determine the valuation of our reporting units we use either the market approach or the income approach using a discounted cash flow model our income approach method uses a discounted cash flow model in which cash flows anticipated over several periods plus a terminal value at the end of that time horizon are discounted to their present value using an appropriate rate of return our estimates are based upon our historical experience our current knowledge from our commercial relationships and available external information about future trends 

the discounted cash flow model requires us to make projections of revenue gross margin operating expenses working capital investment and fixed asset additions for the reporting units over a multiyear period additionally management must estimate a weightedaverage cost of capital which reflects a market rate for each reporting unit for use as a discount rate the discounted cash flows are compared to the carrying value of the reporting unit and if less than the carrying value the difference is recorded as a goodwill impairment loss in addition we also perform a sensitivity analysis to determine how much our forecasts can fluctuate before the fair value of a reporting unit would be lower than its carrying amount we perform the required procedures as of the end of our fiscal third quarter while none of our reporting units recorded a goodwill impairment in 2020 we determined the automated transmission business is our only reporting unit with material goodwill where the estimated fair value does not substantially exceed the carrying value the estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount of 11 billion by approximately 18 percent total goodwill in this reporting unit is 544 million since this reporting unit is made up of only one business our joint venture with eaton corporation plc eaton cummins automated transmission technologies acquired in 2017 we did not expect the estimated fair value would exceed the carrying value by a significant amount we valued this reporting unit primarily using an income approach based on its expected future cash flows the critical assumptions that factored into the valuation are the projected future revenues and ebitda margins of the business as well as the discount rate used to present value these future cash flows a 100 basis point increase in the discount rate would result in a 16 percent decline in the fair value of the reporting unit 

accounting for income taxes 

we determine our income tax expense using the asset and liability method under this method deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax effects of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis future tax benefits of net operating loss and credit carryforwards are also recognized as deferred tax assets we evaluate the recoverability of our deferred tax assets each quarter by assessing the likelihood of future profitability and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize our net deferred tax assets at december 31 2020 we recorded net deferred tax assets of 154 million the assets included 382 million for the value of net operating loss and credit carryforwards a valuation allowance of 346 million was recorded to reduce the tax assets to the net value management believed was more likely than not to be realized in the event our operating performance deteriorates future assessments could conclude that a larger valuation allowance will be needed to further reduce the deferred tax assets 

in addition we operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and are subject to tax audits in these jurisdictions these audits can involve complex issues which may require an extended period of time to resolve we accrue for the estimated additional tax and interest that may result from tax authorities disputing uncertain tax positions we believe we made adequate provisions for income taxes for all years that are subject to audit based upon the latest information available a more complete description of our income taxes and the future benefits of our net operating loss and credit carryforwards is disclosed in note 4 income taxes to our consolidated financial statements  

pension benefits 

we sponsor a number of pension plans globally with the majority of assets in the us and the uk in the us and the uk we have several major defined benefit plans that are separately funded we account for our pension programs in accordance with employers accounting for defined benefit pension plans which requires that amounts recognized in financial statements be determined using an actuarial basis as a result our pension benefit programs are based on a number of statistical and judgmental assumptions that attempt to anticipate future events and are used in calculating the expense and liability related to our plans each year at december 31 these assumptions include discount rates used to value liabilities assumed rates of return on plan assets future compensation increases employee turnover rates actuarial assumptions relating to retirement age mortality rates and participant withdrawals the actuarial assumptions we use may differ significantly from actual results due to changing economic conditions participant life span and withdrawal rates these differences may result in a material impact to the amount of net periodic pension cost to be recorded in our consolidated financial statements in the future 

the expected longterm return on plan assets is used in calculating the net periodic pension cost we considered several factors in developing our expected rate of return on plan assets the longterm rate of return considers historical returns and expected returns on current and projected asset allocations projected returns are based primarily on broad publicly traded passive fixed income and equity indices and forwardlooking estimates of the value added by active investment management at december 31 2020 based upon our target asset allocations it is anticipated that our us investment policy will generate an average annual return over the 30year projection period equal to or in excess of 625 percent including the additional positive returns expected from active investment management 

the oneyear return for our us plans was 89 percent for 2020 our us plan assets averaged annualized returns of 912 percent over the prior ten years and resulted in approximately 443 million of actuarial gains in accumulated other comprehensive loss aocl in the same period based on the historical returns and forwardlooking return expectations as plan assets continue to be derisked consistent with our investment policy we believe continuing our investment return assumption of 625 percent per year in 2021 for us pension assets is reasonable 

the methodology used to determine the rate of return on pension plan assets in the uk was based on establishing an equityrisk premium over current longterm bond yields adjusted based on target asset allocations at december 31 2020 based upon our target asset allocations it is anticipated that our uk investment policy will generate an average annual return over the 20year projection period equal to or in excess of 4 percent the oneyear return for our uk plans was 137 percent for 2020 we generated average annualized returns of 920 percent over ten years resulting in approximately 724 million of actuarial gains in aocl our strategy with respect to our investments in pension plan assets is to be invested with a longterm outlook based on the historical returns and forwardlooking return expectations as the plan assets continue to be derisked we believe continuing our investment return 

assumption of 40 percent in 2021 for uk pension assets is reasonable our pension plan asset allocations at december 31 2020 and 2019 and target allocation for 2021 are as follows 



the differences between the actual return on plan assets and expected longterm return on plan assets are recognized in the asset value used to calculate net periodic cost over five years the table below sets forth the expected return assumptions used to develop our pension cost for the period 20182020 and our expected rate of return for 2021 



pension accounting offers various acceptable alternatives to account for the differences that eventually arise between the estimates used in the actuarial valuations and the actual results it is acceptable to delay or immediately recognize these differences under the delayed recognition alternative changes in pension obligations including those resulting from plan amendments and changes in the value of assets set aside to meet those obligations are not recognized in net periodic pension cost as they occur but are recognized initially in aocl and subsequently amortized as components of net periodic pension cost systematically and gradually over future periods in addition to this approach we may also adopt immediate recognition of actuarial gains or losses immediate recognition introduces volatility in financial results we have chosen to delay recognition and amortize actuarial differences over future periods if we adopted the immediate recognition approach we would record a loss of 989 million 772 million aftertax from cumulative actuarial net losses for our us and uk pension plans 

the difference between the expected return and the actual return on plan assets is deferred from recognition in our results of operations and under certain circumstances such as when the difference exceeds 10 percent of the greater of the market value of plan assets or the projected benefit obligation the difference is amortized over future years of service this is also true of changes to actuarial assumptions under the delayed recognition alternative the actuarial gains and losses are recognized and recorded in aocl at december 31 2020 we had net pension actuarial losses of 714 million and 250 million for the us and uk pension plans respectively as these amounts exceed 10 percent of their respective plan assets the excess is amortized over the average remaining service lives of participating employees net actuarial losses decreased our shareholders equity by 63 million aftertax in 2020 the loss is primarily due to lower discount rates in the us and uk partially offset by strong asset returns in the us and uk 

the table below sets forth the net periodic pension cost for the years ended december 31 and our expected cost for 2021 



we expect 2021 net periodic pension cost to decrease compared to 2020 primarily due to favorable actuarial experience and investment returns partially offset by lower discount rates in the us and uk the increase in net periodic pension cost in 2020 compared to 2019 was primarily due to lower discount rates in the us and uk the decrease in net periodic pension cost in 2019 compared to 2018 was due to higher discount rates and favorable actuarial experience in the us and uk partially offset by a lower expected rate of return in the us 

the weightedaverage discount rates used to develop our net periodic pension cost are set forth in the table below 



the discount rate enables us to state expected future cash payments for benefits as a present value on the measurement date the guidelines for setting this rate suggest the use of a highquality corporate bond rate we used bond information provided by moodys investor services inc and standard  poors rating services all bonds used to develop our hypothetical portfolio in the us and uk were deemed highquality noncallable bonds aa or better at december 31 2020 by at least one of the bond rating agencies 

our model called for projected payments until near extinction for the us and the uk for both countries our model matches the present value of the plans projected benefit payments to the market value of the theoretical settlement bond portfolio a single equivalent discount rate is determined to align the present value of the required cash flow with the value of the bond portfolio the resulting discount rate is reflective of both the current interest rate environment and the plans distinct liability characteristics 

the table below sets forth the estimated impact on our 2021 net periodic pension cost relative to a change in the discount rate and a change in the expected rate of return on plan assets 



the above sensitivities reflect the impact of changing one assumption at a time a higher discount rate decreases the plan obligations and decreases our net periodic pension cost a lower discount rate increases the plan obligations and increases our net periodic pension cost it should be noted that economic factors and conditions often affect multiple assumptions simultaneously and the effects of changes in key assumptions are not necessarily linear note 13 pensions and other postretirement benefits to our consolidated financial statements provides a summary of our pension benefit plan activity the funded status of our plans and the amounts recognized in our consolidated financial statements

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to financial risk resulting from volatility in foreign exchange rates interest rates and commodity prices this risk is closely monitored and managed through the use of financial derivative instruments including foreign currency forward contracts interest rate swaps commodity swap contracts zerocost collars and physical forward contracts these instruments as further described below are accounted for as cash flow or fair value hedges or as economic hedges not designated as hedges for accounting purposes financial derivatives are used expressly for hedging purposes and under no circumstances are they used for speculative purposes when material we adjust the estimated fair value of our derivative contracts for counterparty or our credit risk none of our derivative instruments are subject to collateral requirements substantially all of our derivative contracts are subject to master netting arrangements which provide us with the option to settle certain contracts on a net basis when they settle on the same day with the same currency in addition these arrangements provide for a net settlement of all contracts with a given counterparty in the event that the arrangement is terminated due to the occurrence of default or a termination event 

we also enter into physical forward contracts with certain suppliers to purchase minimum volumes of commodities at contractually stated prices for various periods these arrangements as further described below enable us to fix the prices of portions of our normal purchases of these commodities which otherwise are subject to market volatility 

the following describes our risk exposures and provides the results of a sensitivity analysis performed at december 31 2020 the sensitivity analysis assumes instantaneous parallel shifts in foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices 

foreign exchange rate risk 

as a result of our international business presence we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risks we transact business in foreign currencies and as a result our income experiences some volatility related to movements in foreign currency exchange rates to help manage our exposure to exchange rate volatility we use foreign currency forward contracts on a regular basis to hedge forecasted intercompany and thirdparty sales and purchases denominated in nonfunctional currencies our foreign currency cash flow hedges generally mature within two years these foreign currency forward contracts are designated and qualify as foreign currency cash flow hedges for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 there were no circumstances that resulted in the discontinuance of a foreign currency cash flow hedge 

to minimize the income volatility resulting from the remeasurement of net monetary assets and payables denominated in a currency other than the functional currency we enter into foreign currency forward contracts which are considered economic hedges the objective is to offset the gain or loss from remeasurement with the gain or loss from the fair market valuation of the forward contract these derivative instruments are not designated as hedges 

at december 31 2020 the potential gain or loss in the fair value of our outstanding foreign currency contracts assuming a hypothetical 10 percent fluctuation in the currencies of such contracts would be approximately 10 million the sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates assumes the notional value to remain constant for the next 12 months the analysis ignores the impact of foreign exchange movements on our competitive position and potential changes in sales levels any change in the value of the contracts real or hypothetical would be significantly offset by an inverse change in the value of the underlying hedged items 

interest rate risk 

we are exposed to market risk from fluctuations in interest rates we manage our exposure to interest rate fluctuations through the use of interest rate swaps the objective of the swaps is to more effectively balance our borrowing costs and interest rate risk see note 11 debt interest rate risk section for additional information 

commodity price risk 

we are exposed to fluctuations in commodity prices due to contractual agreements with component suppliers in order to protect ourselves against future price volatility and consequently fluctuations in gross margins we periodically enter into commodity swap forward and zerocost collar contracts with designated banks and other counterparties to fix the cost of certain raw material purchases with the objective of minimizing changes in inventory cost due to market price fluctuations commencing in 2019 these commodity swaps are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges at december 31 2020 realized and unrealized gains and losses related to these hedges were not material to our financial statements the physical forward contracts qualify for the normal purchases scope exceptions and are treated as purchase commitments the commodity zerocost collar contracts that represent an economic hedge but are not designated for hedge accounting are marked to market through earnings 

at december 31 2020 the potential gain or loss related to the outstanding commodity zerocost collar contracts assuming a hypothetical 10 percent fluctuation in the price of such commodities would be approximately 1 million the sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in commodity prices assumes the notional value to remain constant for the next 12 months the analysis ignores the impact of commodity price movements on our competitive position and potential changes in sales levels any change in the value of the zerocost collar contracts real or hypothetical would be significantly offset by an inverse change in the value of the underlying hedged items 

we also limit our exposure to commodity price risk by entering into purchasing arrangements to fix the price of certain volumes of platinum and palladium expected to be used in our products we enter into physical forward contracts with suppliers of platinum and palladium to purchase some volumes of the commodities at contractually stated prices for various periods generally less than two years these arrangements enable us to fix the prices of a portion of our purchases of these commodities which otherwise are subject to market volatility

in the third quarter of 2019 we formed a joint venture with lair liquide sa via the purchase of hydrogenics corporation which was consolidated and included in our new power segment see note 21   acquisitions  to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

supply 

the performance of the endtoend supply chain extending through to our suppliers is foundational to our ability to meet customers expectations and support longterm growth we are committed to having a robust strategy for how we select and manage our suppliers to enable a market focused supply chain this requires us to continuously evaluate and upgrade our supply base as necessary to ensure we are meeting the needs of our customers 

we use a category strategy process a process designed to create the most value for the company that reviews our longterm needs and guides decisions on what we make internally and what we purchase externally for the items we decide to purchase externally the strategies also identify the suppliers we should partner with longterm to provide the best technology the lowest total cost and highest supply chain performance we design andor manufacture our strategic components used in or with our engines and power generation units including cylinder blocks and heads turbochargers connecting rods camshafts crankshafts filters alternators electronic and emissions controls automated transmissions and fuel systems we source externally purchased material and manufactured components from leading global suppliers many key suppliers are managed through longterm supply agreements that assure capacity delivery quality and cost requirements are met over an extended period approximately 19 percent of the direct material in our product designs are single sourced to external suppliers we have an established sourcing strategy and supplier management process to evaluate and mitigate risk these processes are leading us to determine our need for dual sourcing and increase our use of dual and parallel sources to minimize risk and increase supply chain responsiveness our current target for dual and parallel sourcing is approximately 90 percent of our direct material spend as of december 31 2019  our analysis indicates that we have approximately 81 percent of direct material spend with dual or parallel sources 

other important elements of our sourcing strategy include 



patents and trademarks 

we own or control a significant number of patents and trademarks relating to the products we manufacture these patents and trademarks were granted and registered over a period of years although these patents and trademarks are generally considered beneficial to our operations we do not believe any patent group of patents or trademark other than our leading brand house trademarks is significant to our business 

seasonality 

while individual product lines may experience modest seasonal variation in production there is no material effect on the demand for the majority of our products on a quarterly basis with the exceptions that our power systems segment normally experiences seasonal declines in the first quarter due to general declines in construction spending during this period 

largest customers 

we have thousands of customers around the world and have developed longstanding business relationships with many of them paccar is our largest customer accounting for 17 percent of our consolidated net sales in 2019 15 percent in 2018 and 14 percent in 2017 we have longterm supply agreements with paccar for our heavyduty and midrange engines while a significant number of our sales to paccar are under longterm supply agreements these agreements provide for particular engine requirements for specific vehicle models and not a specific volume of engines paccar is our only customer accounting for more than 10 percent of our net sales in 2019 the loss of this customer or a significant decline in the production level of paccar vehicles that use our engines would have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition we have been an engine supplier to paccar for 75 years a summary of principal customers for each operating segment is included in our segment discussion 

in addition to our agreement with paccar we have longterm heavyduty and mediumduty engine supply agreements with navistar and daimler we also have an agreement with chrysler to supply engines for its ram trucks collectively our net sales to these four customers including paccar were 37 percent of our consolidated net sales in 2019  35 percent in 2018 and 33 percent in 2017 excluding paccar net sales to any single customer were less than 9 percent of our consolidated net sales in 2019  less than 9 percent in 2018 and less than 7 percent in 2017 these agreements contain standard purchase and sale agreement terms covering engine and engine parts pricing quality and delivery commitments as well as engineering product support obligations the basic nature of our agreements with oem customers is that they are longterm price and operations agreements that help assure the availability of our products to each customer through the duration of the respective agreements agreements with most oems contain bilateral termination provisions giving either party the right to terminate in the event of a material breach change of control or insolvency or bankruptcy of the other party 

backlog 

we have supply agreements with some truck and offhighway equipment oems however most of our business is transacted through open purchase orders these open orders are historically subject to monthtomonth releases and are subject to cancellation on reasonable notice without cancellation charges and therefore are not considered firm at december 31 2019  we did not have any significant backlogs 

research and development 

in 2019  we continued to invest in future critical technologies and products we will continue to make investments to develop new products and improve our current technologies to meet future emission requirements around the world and improve fuel economy performance of diesel and natural gaspowered engines and related components as well as development activities around fully electric hybrid and hydrogen power solutions 

our research and development program is focused on product improvements product extensions innovations and cost reductions for our customers research and development expenditures include salaries contractor fees building costs utilities testing technical it administrative expenses and allocation of corporate costs and are expensed net of contract reimbursements when incurred from time to time we enter into agreements with customers and government agencies to fund a portion of the research and development costs of a particular project when not associated with a sales contract we generally account for these reimbursements as an offset to the related research and development expenditure research and development expenses net of contract reimbursements were 998 million in 2019 894 million in 2018 and 734 million in 2017 contract reimbursements were 90 million  120 million and 137 million in 2019 2018 and 2017 respectively 

environmental sustainability 

we adopted our comprehensive environmental sustainability plan in 2014 after examining our entire environmental footprint focusing on the key areas of water waste energy and greenhouse gases ghg as the concept and scope of environmental sustainability has matured and broadened leaders have moved from initially working on environmental impacts within our direct control in our operations to an expanded view of fuel and raw materials that reaches across the entire product lifecycle from design to manufacture to end of life our environmental sustainability plan is the way we carry out our priorities goals and initiatives in our action areas including reducing our carbon footprint using fewer natural resources and partnering to solve complex problems 

the highest level of accountability for cummins’ climaterelated risks and opportunities is with the safety environment and technology set committee of the board of directors the board the action committee for environmental sustainability meets monthly and reports to the chairman and to the set committee at least annually 

our sustainability progress report for 2018  2019 includes goal progress and other key environmental and climate metrics and targets this and prior reports as well as a data book of more detailed environmental data in accordance with the global reporting initiatives standard core compliance designation are available on our website at wwwcumminscom our annual submission to the carbon disclosure project cdp for climate change and water are also available on the website the climate submission provides information on our scenario planning exercise for climate and other risks as requested by cdp these reports and data book are not incorporated into this form 10k by reference we currently report on the following environmental sustainability goals and commitments from our 2014 plan 

 we continue to articulate our positions on key public policy issues and on a wide range of environmental issues we are actively engaged with regulatory industry and other stakeholder groups around the world as ghg and fuel efficiency standards become more prevalent globally we were named number 17 in newsweeks 2019 green ranking of us companies number 14 among barrons top 100 most sustainable companies as well as named to the dow jones north american sustainability index for the fourteenth consecutive year in 2019  

in late 2019 cummins introduced planet 2050 a sustainability strategy focused on three priority areas addressing climate change and air emissions using natural resources in the most sustainable way and improving communities it includes eight specific goals to achieve by 2030 as well as aspirational targets for 2050 cummins is currently evaluating how the new goals will be integrated into business planning and will report on progress beginning in 2022 

environmental compliance 

product certification and compliance 

our engines are subject to extensive statutory and regulatory requirements that directly or indirectly impose standards governing emission and noise over the past several years we have substantially increased our global environmental compliance presence and expertise to understand and meet emerging product environmental regulations around the world our ability to comply with these and future emission standards is an essential element in maintaining our leadership position in regulated markets we have made and will continue to make significant capital and research expenditures to comply with these standards 

following conversations with the us environmental protection agency epa and california air resources board carb regarding certification for the engines in the 2019 ram 2500 and 3500 trucks we made the decision to review our certification process and compliance with emission standards this review is being conducted with external advisers to ensure the certification and all of our processes for our pickup truck applications are consistent with our internal policies engineering standards and applicable laws in addition we voluntarily disclosed our formal internal review to our regulators and other agencies and have been working cooperatively with them to ensure a complete and thorough review 

we strive to be a leader in developing and implementing technologies that provide customers with the highest performing products that also have the least impact on the environment and have a long history of working with governments and regulators to achieve these goals we remain committed to ensuring that our products meet all current and future emission standards and delivering value to our customers 

on october 17 2019 the board approved the creation of a new product compliance and regulatory affairs organization to lead engine emission certification and compliance and regulatory affairs this new organization is led by the vice president  product compliance and regulatory affairs who reports directly to the chief executive officer and the new vice president joins the cummins executive team and cummins leadership team the focus of this new organization will be to strengthen our ability to design great products that help our customers win while ensuring compliance with increasingly challenging global emission regulations the organization will also work to enhance our collaboration with the agencies that set the direction and regulations of emissions to best ensure we are meeting every expectation today while planning ahead for future changes 

eu and epa engine certifications 

the current onhighway nox and pm emission standards came into effect in the eu on january 1 2013 euro vi and on january 1 2010 for the epa to meet these regulations we used an evolution of our proven selective catalytic reduction scr and exhaust gas recirculation egr technology solutions and refined them for the eu and epa certified engines to maintain power and torque with substantial fuel economy improvement and maintenance intervals comparable with our previous compliant engines we offer a complete lineup of onhighway engines to meet the nearzero emission standards midrange and heavyduty engines for eu and epa require nox aftertreatment nox reduction is achieved by an integrated technology solution comprised of the xpi high pressure common rail fuel system scr technology nextgeneration cooled egr advanced electronic controls proven air handling and the cummins diesel particulate filter dpf the eu epa and carb have certified that our engines meet the current emission requirements emission standards in international markets including japan mexico australia brazil russia india and china are becoming more stringent we believe that our experience in meeting the eu and epa emission standards leaves us well positioned to take advantage of opportunities in these markets as the need for emission control capability grows 

in 2013 we certified to epas first ever ghg regulations for onhighway medium and heavyduty engines additionally the epa 2013 regulations added the requirement of onboard diagnostics which were introduced on the isx 15 in 2010 across the full onhighway product line while maintaining the same nearzero emission levels of nox and particulate matter required in 2010 onboard diagnostics provide enhanced service capability with standardized diagnostic trouble codes service tool interface incab warning lamp and service information availability the new ghg and fuelefficiency regulations were required for all heavyduty diesel and natural gas engines beginning in january 2014 our ghg certification was the first engine certificate issued by the epa and uses the same proven base engine with the xpi fuel system variable geometry turbocharger vgt tm  and cummins aftertreatment system with dpf and scr technology application of these engines and aftertreatment technologies continues in our products that comply with the 2017 ghg regulations 

the current epa tier 4 offhighway emission standards came into effect between the 2013  2015 time frame for all power categories the current eu stage v offhighway emission standards became effective in 2019 for certain power categories and are expected to be completely effective by january 2021 for all remaining categories engines designed for tier 4  stage v standards were based on our extensive onhighway experience developing scr high pressure fuel systems dpf and vgt tm  our products offer low fuel consumption high torque rise and power output extended maintenance intervals reliable and durable operation and a long life to overhaul period all while meeting the most stringent emission standards in the industrial market our offhighway products power multiple applications including construction mining marine agriculture rail defense and oil and gas and serve a global customer base 

other environmental statutes and regulations 

expenditures for environmental control activities and environmental remediation projects at our facilities in the us have not been a substantial portion of our annual expenses and are not expected to be material in 2020  we believe we are in compliance in all material respects with laws and regulations applicable to our plants and operations 

in the us pursuant to notices received from federal and state agencies andor defendant parties in site environmental contribution actions we have been identified as a potentially responsible party under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of 1980 as amended or similar state laws at fewer than 20 waste disposal sites 

based upon our experiences at similar sites we believe that our aggregate future remediation costs will not be material we have established accruals that we believe are adequate for our expected future liability with respect to these sites in addition we have several other sites where we are working with governmental authorities on remediation projects the costs for these remediation projects are not expected to be material 

employees

 item 1a risk factors 

set forth below and elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k are some of the principal risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual business results to differ materially from any forwardlooking statements contained in this report and could individually or in combination have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows these risk factors should be considered in addition to our cautionary comments concerning forwardlooking statements in this report including statements related to markets for our products and trends in our business that involve a number of risks and uncertainties our separate section above cautionary statements regarding forwardlooking information should be considered in addition to the following statements 

we are conducting a formal internal review of our emission certification process and compliance with emission standards with respect to our pickup truck applications and working with the epa and carb as well as the department of justice doj and sec to address their questions about these applications the results of this formal review and regulatory and government agency processes or the discovery of any noncompliance issues could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and cash flows 

we previously announced that we are conducting a formal internal review of our emissions certification process and compliance with emission standards with respect to all of our pickup truck applications following conversations with the epa and carb regarding certification of our engines for model year 2019 ram 2500 and 3500 trucks during conversations with the epa and carb about the effectiveness of our pickup truck applications the regulators raised concerns that certain aspects of our emissions systems may reduce the effectiveness of our emissions control systems and thereby act as defeat devices as a result our internal review focuses in part on the regulators’ concerns we are working closely with the regulators to enhance our emissions systems to improve the effectiveness of all of our pickup truck applications and to fully address the regulators’ requirements based on discussions with the regulators we have developed a new calibration for the engines in model year 2019 ram 2500 and 3500 trucks that has been included in all engines shipped since september 2019 during our discussions the regulators have asked us to look at other model years and other engines though the primary focus of our review has been the model year 2019 ram we will continue to work together closely with the relevant regulators to develop and implement recommendations for improvement as part of our ongoing commitment to compliance we are also fully cooperating with the dojs and the secs information requests and inquiries due to the continuing nature of the formal review our ongoing cooperation with the regulators and other government agencies and the presence of many unknown facts and circumstances we are not yet able to estimate the financial impact of these matters it is possible that the consequences of any remediation plans resulting from our formal review and these regulatory and agency processes could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and cash flows in the periods in which these emissions certification issues are addressed 

our products are subject to extensive statutory and regulatory requirements that can significantly increase our costs and along with increased scrutiny from regulatory agencies and unpredictability in the adoption implementation and enforcement of increasingly stringent emission standards by multiple jurisdictions around the world could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

our engines are subject to extensive statutory and regulatory requirements governing emissions and noise including standards imposed by the epa the eu state regulatory agencies such as the carb and other regulatory agencies around the world regulatory agencies are making certification and compliance with emissions and noise standards more stringent and subjecting diesel engine products to an increasing level of scrutiny the discovery of noncompliance issues could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

developing engines and components to meet more stringent and changing regulatory requirements with different implementation timelines and emission requirements makes developing engines efficiently for multiple markets complicated and could result in substantial additional costs that may be difficult to recover in certain markets while we have met previous deadlines our ability to comply with existing and future regulatory standards will be essential for us to maintain our competitive advantage in the engine markets we serve the successful development and introduction of new and enhanced products in order to comply with new regulatory requirements are subject to other risks such as delays in product development cost overruns and unanticipated technical and manufacturing difficulties 

in addition to these risks the nature and timing of government implementation and enforcement of increasingly stringent emission standards in our worldwide markets are unpredictable and subject to change any delays in implementation or enforcement could result in a loss of our competitive advantage and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

a sustained slowdown or significant downturn in our markets could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

many of our on and offhighway markets are cyclical in nature and experience volatility in demand throughout these cycles in the second half of 2019 we experienced slowing of demand growth in most of our north american onhighway and certain offhighway markets while international sales declined in most markets including china if the north american or chinese markets suffer a significant downturn or if a slower pace of economic growth and weaker demand in our other significant international markets were to occur depending upon the length duration and severity of the slowdown it could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

our manufacturing and supply chain abilities may be adversely impacted by an extended shutdown of our operations in china due to the recent coronavirus outbreak 

in december 2019 a novel strain of coronavirus began to impact the population of wuhan china where several of our manufacturing and distribution facilities are located in late january 2020 in an effort to contain the spread of the virus maintain the wellbeing of our employees and in accordance with governmental requirements we closed several production and distribution facilities in the hubei provence of china we rely upon these facilities to support our business in china as well as to export components for use in products in other parts of the world while the closures and limitations on movement in the region are expected to be temporary the duration of the production and supply chain disruption and related financial impact cannot be estimated at this time should the production and distribution closures continue for an extended period of time the impact on our supply chain in china and globally could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows 

our products are subject to recall for performance or safetyrelated issues 

our products are subject to recall for performance or safetyrelated issues product recalls subject us to reputational risk loss of current and future customers reduced revenue and product recall costs product recall costs are incurred when we decide either voluntarily or involuntarily to recall a product through a formal campaign to solicit the return of specific products due to known or suspected performance or safety issues any significant product recalls could have material adverse effects on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows see note 12   product warranty liability  to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

the development of new technologies may materially reduce the demand for our current products and services 

we are investing in new products and technologies including electrified powertrains hydrogen generation and fuel cells for planned introduction into certain existing and new markets given the early stages of development of some of these new products and technologies there can be no guarantee of the future market acceptance and investment returns with respect to these planned products the increased adoption of electrified powertrains in some market segments could result in lower demand for current diesel or natural gas engines and components and over time reduce the demand for related parts and service revenues from diesel or natural gas powertrains furthermore it is possible that we may not be successful in developing segmentleading electrified powertrains and some of our existing customers could choose to develop their own electrified or alternate fuel powertrains or source from other manufacturers and any of these factors could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

we operate our business on a global basis and policy changes affecting international trade could adversely impact the demand for our products and our competitive position 

we manufacture sell and service products globally and rely upon a global supply chain to deliver the raw materials components systems and parts that we need to manufacture and service our products changes in government policies on foreign trade and investment can affect the demand for our products and services cause nonus customers to shift preferences toward domestically manufactured or branded products and impact the competitive position of our products or prevent us from being able to sell products in certain countries our business benefits from free trade agreements such as the new united statesmexicocanada agreement and the us trade relationship with china brazil and france and efforts to withdraw from or substantially modify such agreements or arrangements in addition to the implementation of more restrictive trade policies such as more detailed inspections higher tariffs including but not limited to additional tariffs on the import of steel or aluminum import or export licensing requirements exchange controls or new barriers to entry could adversely impact our 

production costs customer demand and our relationships with customers and suppliers any of these consequences could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

a slowdown in infrastructure development andor depressed commodity prices could adversely affect our business 

infrastructure development and strong commodity prices have been significant drivers of our historical growth but as the pace of investment in infrastructure slowed in recent years especially in china and brazil commodity prices were significantly lower and demand for our products in offhighway markets was weak weakness in commodity prices such as oil gas and coal adversely impacted mining industry participants’ demand for vehicles and equipment that contain our engines and other products over the past several years deterioration or renewed weakness in infrastructure and commodities markets could adversely affect our customers’ demand for vehicles and equipment and as a result could adversely affect our business 

the uk’s exit from the european union eu could materially and adversely impact our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

on january 31 2020 the uk exited from the eu brexit additionally the results of the uk’s brexit has caused and may continue to cause volatility in global stock markets currency exchange rate fluctuations and global economic uncertainty although it is unknown what the terms of the uk’s future relationship with the eu will be it is possible that there will be higher tariffs or greater restrictions on imports and exports between the u k and the eu and increased regulatory complexities the effects of brexit will depend on any agreements the uk makes to retain access to eu markets either during a transitional period or on a permanent basis these measures could potentially disrupt our supply chain including delays of imports and exports limited access to human capital within some of the target markets and jurisdictions in which we operate and adverse changes to tax benefits or liabilities in these or other jurisdictions in addition brexit could lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations including with respect to emissions and similar certifications granted to us by the eu as the uk determines which eu laws to replace or replicate any of these effects of brexit among others could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

lowerthananticipated market acceptance of our new or existing products or services including reductions in demand for diesel engines could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

although we conduct market research before launching new or refreshed engines and introducing new services many factors both within and outside our control affect the success of new or existing products and services in the marketplace offering engines and services that customers desire and value can mitigate the risks of increasing price competition and declining demand but products and services that are perceived to be less than desirable whether in terms of price quality overall value fuel efficiency or other attributes can exacerbate these risks with increased consumer interconnectedness through the internet social media and other media mere allegations relating to poor quality safety fuel efficiency corporate responsibility or other key attributes can negatively impact our reputation or market acceptance of our products or services even if such allegations prove to be inaccurate or unfounded 

we are vulnerable to supply shortages from singlesourced suppliers 

during 2019 we single sourced approximately 19 percent of the total types of parts in our product designs compared to approximately 20 percent in 2018 any delay in our suppliers deliveries may adversely affect our operations at multiple manufacturing locations forcing us to seek alternative supply sources to avoid serious disruptions delays may be caused by factors affecting our suppliers including capacity constraints labor disputes economic downturns availability of credit the impaired financial condition suppliers allocations to other purchasers weather emergencies natural disasters or acts of war or terrorism any extended delay in receiving critical supplies could impair our ability to deliver products to our customers and adversely affect our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

our truck manufacturers and oem customers may discontinue outsourcing their engine supply needs 

several of our engine customers including paccar volvo navistar chrysler daimler dongfeng and tata are truck manufacturers or oems that manufacture engines for some of their own vehicles despite their own engine manufacturing abilities these customers have historically chosen to outsource certain types of engine production to us due to the quality of our engine products our emission compliance capabilities our systems integration their customers preferences their desire for cost reductions their desire for eliminating production risks and their desire to maintain company focus however there can be no assurance that these customers will continue to outsource or outsource as much of their engine production in the future in addition increased levels of oem vertical integration could result from a number of factors such as shifts in our customers business strategies acquisition by a customer of another engine manufacturer the inability of thirdparty suppliers to meet product specifications and the emergence of lowcost production opportunities in foreign countries any significant reduction in 

the level of engine production outsourcing from our truck manufacturer or oem customers could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

our plan to reposition our portfolio of product offerings through exploration of strategic acquisitions and divestitures may expose us to additional costs and risks 

part of our strategic plan is to improve our revenue growth gross margins and earnings by exploring the repositioning of our portfolio of product line offerings through the pursuit of potential strategic acquisitions andor divestitures to provide future strategic financial and operational benefits and improve shareholder value there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify suitable candidates or consummate these transactions on favorable terms the successful identification and completion of any strategic transaction depends on a number of factors that are not entirely within our control including the availability of suitable candidates and our ability to negotiate terms acceptable to all parties involved conclude satisfactory agreements and obtain all necessary regulatory approvals accordingly we may not be able to successfully negotiate and complete specific transactions the exploration negotiation and consummation of strategic transactions may involve significant expenditures by us which may adversely affect our results of operations at the time such expenses are incurred and may divert management’s attention from our existing business strategic transactions also may have adverse effects on our existing business relationships with suppliers and customers if required the financing for strategic acquisitions could result in an increase in our indebtedness dilute the interests of our shareholders or both any acquisition may not be accretive to us for a significant period of time following the completion of such acquisition also our ability to effectively integrate any potential acquisition into our existing business and culture may not be successful which could jeopardize future financial and operational performance for the combined businesses in addition if an acquisition results in any additional goodwill or increase in other intangible assets on our balance sheet and subsequently becomes impaired we would be required to record a noncash impairment charge which could result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows similarly any strategic divestiture of a product line or business may reduce our revenue and earnings reduce the diversity of our business result in substantial costs and expenses and cause disruption to our employees customers vendors and communities in which we operate 

our information technology systems and our products are exposed to potential security breaches or other disruptions which may adversely impact our competitive position reputation results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

we rely on the capacity reliability and security of our information technology systems and data security infrastructure in connection with various aspects of our business activities we also rely on our ability to expand and continually update these systems and related infrastructure in response to the changing needs of our business as we implement new systems they may not perform as expected we face the challenge of supporting our older systems and implementing necessary upgrades in addition some of these systems are managed by third party service providers and are not under our direct control if we experience a problem with an important information technology system including during system upgrades andor new system implementations the resulting disruptions could have an adverse effect on our business and reputation as customers adopt and rely on cloudbased digital technologies and services we offer any disruption of the confidentiality integrity or availability of those services could have an adverse effect on our business and reputation 

the data handled by our information technology systems is vulnerable to security threats our operations routinely involve receiving storing processing and transmitting sensitive information pertaining to our business customers dealers suppliers employees and other sensitive matters while we continually work to safeguard our systems and mitigate potential risks there is no assurance that these actions will be sufficient to prevent information technology security threats such as security breaches computer malware computer viruses and other cyber attacks which are increasing in both frequency and sophistication along with power outages or hardware failures these threats could result in unauthorized public disclosures of information create financial liability subject us to legal or regulatory sanctions disrupt our ability to conduct our business result in the loss of intellectual property or damage our reputation with customers dealers suppliers and other stakeholders in addition our products including our engines contain interconnected and increasingly complex systems that control various processes and these systems are potentially subject to cyber attacks and disruption the impact of a significant information technology event on either of our information technology systems or our products could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position reputation results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

we face the challenge of accurately aligning our capacity with our demand 

we can experience idle capacity as economies slow or demand for certain products decline while we can also experience capacity constraints and longer lead times for certain products in times of growing demand accurately forecasting our expected volumes and appropriately adjusting our capacity have been and will continue to be important factors in determining 

our results of operations and cash flows we cannot guarantee that we will be able to decrease our manufacturing capacity during market troughs which could result in underutilized manufacturing assets and unnecessary overhead costs or that we will be able to increase our manufacturing capacity to a level that meets demand for our products during market peaks which could prevent us from meeting increased customer demand and could harm our business if we overestimate our demand and overbuild our capacity we may have significantly underutilized assets and we may experience reduced margins if we do not accurately align our manufacturing capabilities with demand it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

we may experience difficulties and delays or unexpected costs in completing our cost reduction actions and announced restructuring initiatives including achieving any anticipated savings and other benefits of these initiatives 

during the fourth quarter of 2019 and the first quarter of 2020 we are undertaking cost reduction actions and announced restructuring initiatives to respond to the slowdown in our global markets as we implement these initiatives we may not realize anticipated savings or other benefits from one or more of the initiatives in the amounts or within the time periods we expect other events or circumstances such as implementation difficulties and delays or unexpected costs may occur which could result in us not realizing our targeted cost reductions we are also subject to the risks of negative publicity and business disruption in connection with our restructuring and other cost reduction initiatives if we are unable to realize the expected savings or benefits from these initiatives certain aspects of our business may be adversely affected if we experience any of these circumstances or otherwise fail to realize the anticipated savings or benefits from our restructuring and cost reduction initiatives our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

financial distress or a changeincontrol of one of our large truck oem customers could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

we recognize significant sales of engines and components to a few large onhighway truck oem customers in north america which have been an integral part of our positive business results for several years if one of our large truck oem customers experiences financial distress bankruptcy or a changeincontrol such circumstance could likely lead to significant reductions in our sales volumes commercial disputes receivable collection issues and other negative consequences that could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

we may fail to realize all of the expected enhanced revenue earnings and cash flow from our investment in the eaton cummins automated transmission technologies joint venture 

our ability to realize all of the expected enhanced revenue earnings and cash flow from our 2017 investment in the eaton cummins automated transmission technologies joint venture will depend in substantial part on our ability to successfully launch the automated transmission products in north america and china and achieve our projected market penetration in those regions while we believe we will ultimately achieve these objectives it is possible that we will be unable to achieve all of the goals within our anticipated time frame or in the anticipated amounts if we are not able to successfully complete our automated transmission strategy the anticipated enhanced revenue earnings and cash flows resulting from this joint venture may not be realized fully or may take longer to realize than expected as part of the purchase accounting associated with the formation of the joint venture significant goodwill and intangible asset balances were recorded on the consolidated balance sheet if cash flows from the joint venture fall short of our anticipated amounts these assets could be subject to noncash impairment charges negatively impacting our earnings 

we are exposed to political economic and other risks that arise from operating a multinational business 

our business is subject to the political economic and other risks that are inherent in operating in numerous countries these risks include 



as we continue to operate our business globally our success will depend in part on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these and other related risks there can be no assurance that the consequences of these and other factors relating to our multinational operations will not have a material adverse effect upon us 

we face significant competition in the markets we serve 

the markets in which we operate are highly competitive we compete worldwide with a number of other manufacturers and distributors that produce and sell similar products we primarily compete in the market with diesel engines and related diesel products however new technologies continue to be developed for gasoline natural gas electrification and other technologies and we will continue to face new competition from these expanding technologies our products primarily compete on the basis of price performance fuel economy emissions compliance speed of delivery quality and customer support we also face competitors in some emerging markets who have established local practices and long standing relationships with participants in these markets there can be no assurance that our products will be able to compete successfully with the products of other companies and in other markets 

increasing global competition among our customers may affect our existing customer relationships and restrict our ability to benefit from some of our customers growth 

as our customers in emerging markets continue to grow in size and scope they are increasingly seeking to export their products to other countries this has meant greater demand for our advanced engine technologies to help these customers meet the more stringent emissions requirements of developed markets as well as greater demand for access to our distribution systems for purposes of equipment servicing as these emerging market customers enter into and begin to compete in more developed markets they may increasingly begin to compete with our existing customers in these markets our further aid to emerging market customers could adversely affect our relationships with developed market customers in addition to the extent the competition does not correspond to overall growth in demand we may see little or no benefit from this type of expansion by our emerging market customers 

we are subject to foreign currency exchange rate and other related risks 

we conduct operations in many areas of the world involving transactions denominated in a variety of currencies we are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk to the extent that our costs are denominated in currencies other than those in which we earn revenues in addition since our financial statements are denominated in us dollars changes in foreign currency exchange rates between the us dollar and other currencies have had and will continue to have an impact on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows the us dollar strengthened in recent years resulting in material unfavorable impacts on our revenues in those years if the us dollar continues strengthening against other currencies we will experience additional volatility in our financial statements while we customarily enter into financial transactions that attempt to address these risks and many of our supply agreements with customers include foreign currency exchange rate adjustment provisions there can be no assurance that foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations will not adversely affect our future results of operations and cash flows in addition while the use of currency hedging instruments may provide us with some protection from adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates by utilizing these instruments we potentially forego the benefits that might result from favorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates we also face risks arising from the imposition of foreign exchange controls and currency devaluations foreign exchange controls may limit our ability to convert foreign currencies into us dollars or to remit dividends and other payments by our foreign subsidiaries or businesses located in or conducted within a country imposing controls currency devaluations result in a diminished value of funds denominated in the currency of the country instituting the devaluation see managements discussion and analysis for additional information 

our products are exposed to variability in material and commodity costs 

our businesses establish prices with our customers in accordance with contractual time frames however the timing of material and commodity market price increases may prevent us from passing these additional costs on to our customers through timely pricing actions additionally higher material and commodity costs around the world may offset our efforts to reduce our cost structure while we customarily enter into financial transactions and contractual pricing adjustment provisions with our customers that attempt to address some of these risks notably with respect to copper platinum and palladium there can be no assurance that commodity price fluctuations will not adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows in addition while the use of commodity price hedging instruments and contractual pricing adjustments may provide us with some protection from adverse fluctuations in commodity prices by utilizing these instruments we potentially forego the benefits that 

might result from favorable fluctuations in price as a result higher material and commodity costs as well as hedging these commodity costs during periods of decreasing prices could result in declining margins 

we derive significant earnings from investees that we do not directly control with more than 50 percent of these earnings from our chinabased investees 

for 2019 we recognized 330 million of equity royalty and interest income from investees compared to 394 million in 2018 approximately half of our equity royalty and interest income from investees is from four of our 50 percent owned joint ventures in china  beijing foton cummins engine co ltd dongfeng cummins engine company ltd chongqing cummins engine company ltd and dongfeng cummins emission solutions co ltd as a result although a significant percentage of our net income is derived from these unconsolidated entities we do not unilaterally control their management or their operations which puts a substantial portion of our net income at risk from the actions or inactions of these entities a significant reduction in the level of contribution by these entities to our net income would likely have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows 

unanticipated changes in our effective tax rate the adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could adversely affect our profitability 

we are subject to income taxes in the us and numerous international jurisdictions our income tax provision and cash tax liability in the future could be adversely affected by changes in earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities changes in tax laws and the discovery of new information in the course of our tax return preparation process the carrying value of deferred tax assets which are predominantly in the us is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income in the us we are also subject to ongoing tax audits these audits can involve complex issues which may require an extended period of time to resolve and can be highly judgmental tax authorities may disagree with certain tax reporting positions taken by us and as a result assess additional taxes against us we regularly assess the likely outcomes of these audits in order to determine the appropriateness of our tax provision the amounts ultimately paid upon resolution of these or subsequent tax audits could be materially different from the amounts previously included in our income tax provision and therefore could have a material impact on our tax provision 

our global operations are subject to laws and regulations that impose significant compliance costs and create reputational and legal risk 

due to the international scope of our operations we are subject to a complex system of commercial and trade regulations around the world recent years have seen an increase in the development and enforcement of laws regarding trade compliance and anticorruption such as the us foreign corrupt practices act and similar laws from other countries as well as new regulatory requirements regarding data privacy such as the european union general data protection regulation our numerous foreign subsidiaries affiliates and joint venture partners are governed by laws rules and business practices that differ from those of the us the activities of these entities may not comply with us laws or business practices or our code of business conduct violations of these laws may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions could disrupt our business and result in an adverse effect on our reputation business and results of operations financial condition and cash flows we cannot predict the nature scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our operations might be subject or the manner in which existing laws might be administered or interpreted 

our business is exposed to potential product liability claims 

we face an inherent business risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that our products failure to perform to specification results or is alleged to result in property damage bodily injury andor death at any given time we are subject to various and multiple product liability claims any one of which if decided adversely to us may have a material adverse effect on our reported results of operation in the period in which our liability with respect to any such claim is recognized while we maintain insurance coverage with respect to certain product liability claims we may not be able to obtain such insurance on acceptable terms in the future if at all and any such insurance may not provide adequate coverage against product liability claims in addition product liability claims can be expensive to defend and can divert the attention of management and other personnel for significant periods of time regardless of the ultimate outcome furthermore even if we are successful in defending against a claim relating to our products claims of this nature could cause our customers to lose confidence in our products and us 

our operations are subject to increasingly stringent environmental laws and regulations 

our plants and operations are subject to increasingly stringent environmental laws and regulations in all of the countries in which we operate including laws and regulations governing air emission discharges to water and the generation handling storage transportation treatment and disposal of waste materials while we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with these environmental laws and regulations there can be no assurance that we will not be adversely impacted by 

costs liabilities or claims with respect to existing or subsequently acquired operations under either present laws and regulations or those that may be adopted or imposed in the future we are also subject to laws requiring the cleanup of contaminated property if a release of hazardous substances occurs at or from any of our current or former properties or at a landfill or another location where we have disposed of hazardous materials we may be held liable for the contamination and the amount of such liability could be material 

future bans or limitations on the use of dieselpowered vehicles or other applications could have a material adverse impact on our business over the long term 

in an effort to limit greenhouse gas emissions and combat climate change multiple countries and cities have announced that they plan to implement a ban on the use in their cities or countries of dieselpowered products in the near or distant future these countries include china india and germany in addition california government officials have called for the state to phase out sales of dieselpowered vehicles by 2040 to the extent that these types of bans are actually implemented in the future on a broad basis or in one or more of our key markets our business over the longterm could experience material adverse impacts 

we are exposed to risks arising from the price and availability of energy 

the level of demand for our products and services is influenced in multiple ways by the price and availability of energy high energy costs generally drive greater demand for better fuel economy in almost all countries in which we operate some of our engine products have been developed with a primary purpose of offering fuel economy improvements and if energy costs decrease or increase less than expected demand for these products may likewise decrease the relative unavailability of electricity in some emerging market countries also influences demand for our electricity generating products such as our diesel generators if these countries add energy capacity by expanding their power grids at a rate equal to or faster than the growth in demand for energy the demand for our generating products could also decrease or increase less than would otherwise be the case 

significant declines in future financial and stock market conditions could diminish our pension plan asset performance and adversely impact our results of operations financial condition and cash flow 

we sponsor both funded and unfunded domestic and foreign defined benefit pension and other retirement plans our pension cost and the required contributions to our pension plans are directly affected by the value of plan assets the projected and actual rates of return on plan assets and the actuarial assumptions we use to measure our defined benefit pension plan obligations including the discount rate at which future projected and accumulated pension obligations are discounted to a present value we could experience increased pension cost due to a combination of factors including the decreased investment performance of pension plan assets decreases in the discount rate and changes in our assumptions relating to the expected return on plan assets significant declines in future financial and stock market conditions could cause material losses in our pension plan assets which could result in increased pension cost in future years and adversely impact our results of operations financial condition and cash flow depending upon the severity of market declines and government regulatory changes we may be legally obligated to make pension payments in the us and perhaps other countries and these contributions could be material 

we may be adversely impacted by work stoppages and other labor matters 

at december 31 2019 we employed approximately 61615 persons worldwide approximately 19048 of our employees worldwide are represented by various unions under collective bargaining agreements that expire between 2020 and 2024 while we have no reason to believe that we will be materially impacted by work stoppages or other labor matters there can be no assurance that future issues with our labor unions will be resolved favorably or that we will not encounter future strikes work stoppages or other types of conflicts with labor unions or our employees any of these consequences may have an adverse effect on us or may limit our flexibility in dealing with our workforce in addition many of our customers and suppliers have unionized work forces work stoppages or slowdowns experienced by our customers or suppliers could result in slowdowns or closures that would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flow

the matters described under loss contingency in note 12   product warranty liability  to the consolidated financial statements are incorporated herein by reference 

we conduct significant business operations in brazil that are subject to the brazilian federal state and local labor social security tax and customs laws while we believe we comply with such laws they are complex subject to varying interpretations and we are often engaged in litigation regarding the application of these laws to particular circumstances 

on april 29 2019 we announced that we were conducting a formal internal review of our emissions certification process and compliance with emission standards for our pickup truck applications following conversations with the epa and the carb regarding certification of our engines in model year 2019 ram 2500 and 3500 trucks this review is being conducted with external advisors to ensure the certification and compliance processes for all of our pickup truck applications are consistent with our internal policies engineering standards and applicable laws in addition we voluntarily disclosed our formal internal review to our regulators and to other government agencies the doj and the sec  and have been working cooperatively with them to ensure a complete and thorough review during conversations with the epa and carb about the effectiveness of our pickup truck applications the regulators raised concerns that certain aspects of our emissions systems may reduce the effectiveness of our emissions control systems and thereby act as defeat devices as a result our internal review focuses in part on the regulators’ concerns we are working closely with the regulators to enhance our emissions systems to improve the effectiveness of all of our pickup truck applications and to fully address the regulators’ requirements based on discussions with the regulators we have developed a new calibration for the engines in model year 2019 ram 2500 and 3500 trucks that has been included in all engines shipped since september 2019 during our discussions the regulators have asked us to look at other model years and other engines though the primary focus of our review has been the model year 2019 ram we are also fully cooperating with the dojs and the secs information requests and inquiries due to the continuing nature of our formal review our ongoing cooperation with our regulators and other government agencies and the presence of many unknown facts and circumstances we cannot predict the final outcome of this review and these regulatory and agency processes and we cannot provide assurance that the matter will not have a materially adverse impact on our results of operations and cash flows

executive summary and financial highlights 

we are a global power leader that designs manufactures distributes and services diesel natural gas electric and hybrid powertrains and powertrainrelated components including filtration aftertreatment turbochargers fuel systems controls systems air handling systems automated transmissions electric power generation systems batteries electrified power systems hydrogen generation and fuel cell products we sell our products to original equipment manufacturers oems distributors dealers and other customers worldwide we have longstanding relationships with many of the leading manufacturers in the markets we serve including paccar inc navistar international corporation daimler trucks north america and fiat chrysler automobiles chrysler we serve our customers through a network of approximately 600 whollyowned joint venture and independent distributor locations and over 7600 cummins certified dealer locations in more than 190 countries and territories 

in november 2019 we renamed our electrified power segment as new power in order to better represent the incorporation of fuel cell and hydrogen production technologies resulting from our acquisition of hydrogenics corporation the new power segment includes our electrified power fuel cell and hydrogen production technologies 

our reportable operating segments consist of engine distribution components power systems and new power this reporting structure is organized according to the products and markets each segment serves  the engine segment produces engines 15 liters and smaller and associated parts for sale to customers in onhighway and various offhighway markets our engines are used in trucks of all sizes buses and recreational vehicles as well as in various industrial applications including construction agriculture power generation systems and other offhighway applications the distribution segment includes whollyowned and partiallyowned distributorships engaged in wholesaling engines generator sets and service parts as well as performing service and repair activities on our products and maintaining relationships with various oems throughout the world the components segment sells filtration products aftertreatment systems turbochargers electronics fuel systems and automated transmissions the power systems segment is an integrated power provider which designs manufactures and sells engines 16 liters and larger for industrial applications including mining oil and gas marine and rail standby and prime power generator sets alternators and other power components the new power segment designs manufactures sells and supports electrified power systems ranging from fully electric to hybrid along with innovative components and subsystems including battery fuel cell and hydrogen production technologies we continue to serve all our markets as they adopt electrification and alternative power technologies meeting the needs of our oem partners and end customers 

our financial performance depends in large part on varying conditions in the markets we serve particularly the onhighway construction and general industrial markets demand in these markets tends to fluctuate in response to overall economic conditions our sales may also be impacted by oem inventory levels production schedules and stoppages economic downturns in markets we serve generally result in reduced sales of our products and can result in price reductions in certain products andor markets as a worldwide business our operations are also affected by currency political economic and regulatory matters including adoption and enforcement of environmental and emission standards in the countries we serve as part of our growth strategy we invest in businesses in certain countries that carry high levels of these risks such as china brazil india mexico russia and countries in the middle east and africa at the same time our geographic diversity and broad product and service offerings have helped limit the impact from a drop in demand in any one industry or customer or the economy of any single country on our consolidated results 

worldwide revenues decreased 1 percent in 2019 compared to 2018  as higher sales in the distribution and new power segments were more than offset by lower sales in all other operating segments international demand excludes the us and canada declined by 6 percent compared to 2018 with lower sales in most regions especially in europe india russia asia pacific and latin america the decrease in international sales was driven by lower onhighway demand mainly in the lightcommercial vehicle lcv market in china and russia truck markets in western europe and india which negatively impacted our emission solutions and turbo technologies businesses the mediumduty truck market in brazil and the bus market in europe unfavorable foreign currency impacts of 4 percent of international sales primarily the chinese renminbi euro british pound australian dollar brazilian real and indian rupee  and decreased demand in industrial markets especially construction markets in china asia pacific and india and most international mining markets these decreases were partially offset by increased demand in china for both engines for oil and gas customers and power generation equipment for data center customers net sales in the us and canada improved by 3 percent primarily due to increased demand in the pickup truck and mediumduty truck markets and increased demand in most of our distribution product lines largely related to power generation equipment for data center customers partially offset by lower demand in heavyduty truck and bus markets and decreased industrial demand especially in the oil and gas market

cash cash equivalents and marketable securities 

a significant portion of our cash flows is generated outside the us we manage our worldwide cash requirements considering available funds among the many subsidiaries through which we conduct our business and the cost effectiveness with which those funds can be accessed as a result we do not anticipate any local liquidity restrictions to preclude us from funding our operating needs with local resources 

debt facilities and other sources of liquidity 

on august 21 2019 we entered into an amended and restated 364  day credit agreement that allows us to borrow up to 15 billion of unsecured funds at any time through august 18 2020 this credit agreement amends and restates the prior 15 billion 364day credit facility that matured on august 21 2019

in july 2017 the uks financial conduct authority which regulates the london interbank offered rate libor announced that it intends to phase out libor by the end of 2021 various central bank committees and working groups continue to discuss replacement of benchmark rates the process for amending existing liborbased contracts and the potential economic impacts of different alternatives the alternative reference rates committee has identified the secured overnight financing rate sofr as its preferred alternative rate for usd libor sofr is a measure of the cost of borrowing cash overnight collateralized by us treasury securities and is based on directly observable us treasurybacked repurchase transactions 

we are evaluating the potential impact of the replacement of the libor benchmark interest rate including risk management internal operational readiness and monitoring the financial accounting standards board standardsetting process to address financial reporting issues that might arise in connection with transition from libor to a new benchmark rate 

supply chain financing 

we currently have supply chain financing programs with financial intermediaries which provide certain vendors the option to be paid by financial intermediaries earlier than the due date on the applicable invoice when a vendor utilizes the program and receives an early payment from a financial intermediary they take a discount on the invoice we then pay the financial intermediary the face amount of the invoice on the regularly scheduled due date we do not reimburse vendors for any costs they incur for participation in the program and their participation is completely voluntary as a result all amounts owed to the financial intermediaries are presented as accounts payable in our consolidated balance sheets

capital expenditures including spending on internal use software were 775 million  784 million and 587 million in 2019  2018 and 2017  respectively we continue to invest in new product lines and targeted capacity expansions we plan to spend an estimated 675 million to 700 million in 2020 on capital expenditures as we continue with product launches and facility improvements approximately 50 percent of our capital expenditures are expected to be invested outside of the us in 2020 in addition we plan to spend an estimated 70 million to 80 million on internal use software in 2020 

pensions 

the funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon a variety of variables and assumptions including return on invested assets market interest rates and levels of voluntary contributions to the plans in 2019  the investment gain on our us pension trust was 176 percent while our uk pension trust gain was 109 percent approximately 73 percent of our pension plan assets are held in highly liquid investments such as fixed income and equity securities the remaining 27 percent of our plan assets are held in less liquid but market valued investments including real estate private equity venture capital opportunistic credit and insurance contracts 

we sponsor funded and unfunded domestic and foreign defined benefit pension plans contributions to the us and uk plans were as follows 

  

we anticipate making total contributions of approximately 100 million to our defined benefit pension plans in 2020  expected contributions to our defined benefit pension plans in 2020 will meet or exceed the current funding requirements 

current maturities of short and longterm debt 

we had 660 million of commercial paper outstanding at december 31 2019 that matures in less than one year the maturity schedule of our existing longterm debt does not require significant cash outflows until 2023 when our 365 senior notes are due required annual longterm debt principal payments range from 5 million to 506 million over the next five years  see note 11   debt  to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

credit ratings 

our ratings and outlook from each of the credit rating agencies as of the date of filing are shown in the table below 



 

1 credit ratings are not recommendations to buy are subject to change and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating in addition we undertake no obligation to update disclosures concerning our credit ratings whether as a result of new information future events or otherwise 

managements assessment of liquidity 

our financial condition and liquidity remain strong our solid balance sheet and credit ratings enable us to have ready access to credit and the capital markets we assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate adequate cash to fund our operating investing and financing activities we believe our operating cash flow and liquidity provide us with the financial flexibility needed to fund working capital common stock repurchases acquisitions capital expenditures dividend payments projected pension obligations debt service obligations and restructuring actions we continue to generate significant cash from operations and maintain access to our revolving credit facilities and commercial paper programs as noted above 

contractual obligations and other commercial commitments 

a summary of our contractual obligations and other commercial commitments at december 31 2019  are as follows 



   

 the contractual obligations reported above exclude our unrecognized tax benefits of 77 million as of december 31 2019  we are not able to reasonably estimate the period in which cash outflows relating to uncertain tax contingencies could occur see note 5   income taxes  to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

application of critical accounting estimates 

a summary of our significant accounting policies is included in note 1   summary of significant accounting policies  of our consolidated financial statements which discusses accounting policies that we have selected from acceptable alternatives 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the us  gaap  which often requires management to make judgments estimates and assumptions regarding uncertainties that affect the reported amounts presented and disclosed in the financial statements management reviews these estimates and assumptions based on historical experience changes in business conditions and other relevant factors they believe to be reasonable under the circumstances in any given reporting period our actual results may differ from the estimates and assumptions used in preparing our consolidated financial statements  

critical accounting estimates are defined as follows the estimate requires management to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the estimate was made different estimates reasonably could have been used or if changes in the estimate are reasonably likely to occur from period to period and the change would have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations our senior management has discussed the development and selection of our accounting policies related accounting estimates and the disclosures set forth below with the audit committee of the board we believe our critical accounting estimates include estimating liabilities for warranty programs accounting for income taxes and pension benefits and assessing goodwill impairments 

warranty programs 

we estimate and record a liability for base warranty programs at the time our products are sold our estimates are based on historical experience and reflect managements best estimates of expected costs at the time products are sold and subsequent adjustment to those expected costs when actual costs differ as a result of the uncertainty surrounding the nature and frequency of product recall programs the liability for such programs is recorded when we commit to a recall action or when a recall becomes probable and estimable which generally occurs when it is announced our warranty liability is generally affected by component failure rates repair costs and the point of failure within the product life cycle future events and circumstances related to these factors could materially change our estimates and require adjustments to our liability new product launches require a greater use of judgment in developing estimates until historical experience becomes available product specific experience is typically available four or five quarters after product launch with a clear experience trend evident eight quarters after launch we generally record warranty expense for new products upon shipment using a preceding products warranty history and a multiplicative factor based upon preceding similar product experience and new product assessment until sufficient new product data is available for warranty estimation we then use a blend of actual new product experience and preceding product historical experience for several subsequent quarters and new product specific experience thereafter note 12   product warranty liability  to our consolidated financial statements contains a summary of the activity in our warranty liability account for 2019  2018 and 2017 including adjustments to preexisting warranties 

accounting for income taxes 

we determine our income tax expense using the asset and liability method under this method deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax effects of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis future tax benefits of net operating loss and credit carryforwards are also recognized as deferred tax assets we evaluate the recoverability of our deferred tax assets each quarter by assessing the likelihood of future profitability and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize our net deferred tax assets at december 31 2019  we recorded net deferred tax assets of 135 million  the assets included 364 million for the value of net operating loss and credit carryforwards a valuation allowance of 317 million was recorded to reduce the tax assets to the net value management believed was more likely than not to be realized in the event our operating performance deteriorates future assessments could conclude that a larger valuation allowance will be needed to further reduce the deferred tax assets 

in addition we operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and are subject to tax audits in these jurisdictions these audits can involve complex issues which may require an extended period of time to resolve we accrue for the estimated additional tax and interest that may result from tax authorities disputing uncertain tax positions we have taken and we believe we have made adequate provisions for income taxes for all years that are subject to audit based upon the latest information available a more complete description of our income taxes and the future benefits of our net operating loss and credit carryforwards is disclosed in note 5   income taxes  to our consolidated financial statements  

pension benefits 

we sponsor a number of pension plans globally with the majority of assets in the us and the uk in the us and the uk we have several major defined benefit plans that are separately funded we account for our pension programs in accordance with employers accounting for defined benefit pension plans under gaap gaap requires that amounts recognized in financial statements be determined using an actuarial basis as a result our pension benefit programs are based on a number of statistical and judgmental assumptions that attempt to anticipate future events and are used in calculating the expense and liability related to our plans each year at december 31 these assumptions include discount rates used to value liabilities assumed rates of return on plan assets future compensation increases employee turnover rates actuarial assumptions relating to retirement age mortality rates and participant withdrawals the actuarial assumptions we use may differ significantly from actual results due to changing economic conditions participant life span and withdrawal rates these differences may result in a material impact to the amount of net periodic pension cost to be recorded in our consolidated financial statements in the future 

the expected longterm return on plan assets is used in calculating the net periodic pension cost we considered several factors in developing our expected rate of return on plan assets the longterm rate of return considers historical returns and expected returns on current and projected asset allocations projected returns are based primarily on broad publicly traded passive fixed income and equity indices and forwardlooking estimates of the value added by active investment management at december 31 2019 based upon our target asset allocations it is anticipated that our us investment policy will generate an average annual return over the 30year projection period equal to or in excess of 625 percent  including the additional positive returns expected from active investment management 

the oneyear return for our us plans was 176 percent for 2019  our us plan assets have averaged annualized returns of 977 percent over the prior ten years and resulted in approximately 490 million of actuarial gains in accumulated other comprehensive income aoci in the same period based on the historical returns and forwardlooking return expectations as plan assets continue to be derisked consistent with our investment policy we believe an investment return assumption of 625 percent per year in 2020 for us pension assets is reasonable 

the methodology used to determine the rate of return on pension plan assets in the uk was based on establishing an equityrisk premium over current longterm bond yields adjusted based on target asset allocations at december 31 2019 based upon our target asset allocations it is anticipated that our uk investment policy will generate an average annual return over the 20year projection period equal to or in excess of 4 percent the oneyear return for our uk plans was 109 percent for 2019  we have generated average annualized returns of 913 percent over ten years resulting in approximately 580 million of actuarial gains in aoci our strategy with respect to our investments in pension plan assets is to be invested with a longterm outlook based on the historical returns and forwardlooking return expectations as the plan assets continue to be derisked we believe an investment return assumption of 40 percent in 2020 for uk pension assets is reasonable our pension plan asset allocations at december 31 2019 and 2018 and target allocation for 2020 are as follows 



the differences between the actual return on plan assets and expected longterm return on plan assets are recognized in the asset value used to calculate net periodic cost over five years the table below sets forth the expected return assumptions used to develop our pension cost for the period 2017  2019 and our expected rate of return for 2020  



gaap for pensions offers various acceptable alternatives to account for the differences that eventually arise between the estimates used in the actuarial valuations and the actual results it is acceptable to delay or immediately recognize these differences under the delayed recognition alternative changes in pension obligations including those resulting from plan amendments and changes in the value of assets set aside to meet those obligations are not recognized in net periodic pension cost as they occur but are recognized initially in accumulated other comprehensive loss aocl and subsequently amortized as components of net periodic pension cost systematically and gradually over future periods in addition to this approach gaap also allows immediate recognition of actuarial gains or losses immediate recognition introduces volatility in financial results we have chosen to delay recognition and amortize actuarial differences over future periods if we adopted the immediate recognition approach we would record a loss of 963 million  762 million aftertax from cumulative actuarial net losses for our us and uk pension plans 

the difference between the expected return and the actual return on plan assets is deferred from recognition in our results of operations and under certain circumstances such as when the difference exceeds 10 percent of the greater of the market value of plan assets or the projected benefit obligation the difference is amortized over future years of service this is also true of changes to actuarial assumptions under gaap the actuarial gains and losses are recognized and recorded in aocl at december 31 2019  we had net pension actuarial losses of 611 million and 323 million for the us and uk pension plans respectively as these amounts exceed 10 percent of their respective plan assets the excess is amortized over the average remaining service lives of participating employees net actuarial losses decreased our shareholders equity by 85 million aftertax in 2019  the loss is primarily due to lower discount rates in the us and uk partially offset by strong asset returns in the us and uk 

the table below sets forth the net periodic pension cost for the years ended december 31 and our expected cost for 2020  



we expect 2020 net periodic pension cost to increase compared to 2019  primarily due to lower discount rates in the us and uk the decrease in net periodic pension cost in 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily due to higher discount rates and favorable actuarial experience in the us and uk partially offset by a lower expected rate of return in the us the increase in net periodic pension cost in 2018 compared to 2017 was due to a lower expected rate of return in the us and uk as we derisked plan trust assets partially offset by reduced loss amortization in the us and uk 

the weightedaverage discount rates used to develop our net periodic pension cost are set forth in the table below 



the discount rate enables us to state expected future cash payments for benefits as a present value on the measurement date the guidelines for setting this rate are discussed in gaap which suggests the use of a highquality corporate bond rate we used bond information provided by moodys investor services inc and standard  poors rating services all bonds used to develop our hypothetical portfolio in the us and uk were deemed highquality noncallable bonds aa or better at december 31 2019  by at least one of the bond rating agencies 

our model called for projected payments until near extinction for the us and the uk for both countries our model matches the present value of the plans projected benefit payments to the market value of the theoretical settlement bond portfolio a single equivalent discount rate is determined to align the present value of the required cash flow with the value of the bond portfolio the resulting discount rate is reflective of both the current interest rate environment and the plans distinct liability characteristics 

the table below sets forth the estimated impact on our 2020 net periodic pension cost relative to a change in the discount rate and a change in the expected rate of return on plan assets 



the above sensitivities reflect the impact of changing one assumption at a time a higher discount rate decreases the plan obligations and decreases our net periodic pension cost a lower discount rate increases the plan obligations and increases our net periodic pension cost it should be noted that economic factors and conditions often affect multiple assumptions simultaneously and the effects of changes in key assumptions are not necessarily linear note 13   pensions and other postretirement benefits  to our consolidated financial statements provides a summary of our pension benefit plan activity the funded status of our plans and the amounts recognized in our consolidated financial statements  

goodwill impairment 

we are required to make certain subjective and complex judgments in assessing whether a goodwill impairment event has occurred including assumptions and estimates used to determine the fair value of our reporting units we test for goodwill impairment at the reporting unit level and our reporting units are the operating segments or the components of operating segments that constitute businesses for which discrete financial information is available and is regularly reviewed by management 

under gaap for goodwill we have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform an annual quantitative goodwill impairment test we have elected this option on certain reporting units the following events and circumstances are considered when evaluating whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 

 the examples noted above are not allinclusive and we consider other relevant events and circumstances that affect the fair value of a reporting unit in determining whether to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test 

our goodwill recoverability assessment is based on our annual strategic planning process this process includes an extensive review of expectations for the longterm growth of our businesses and forecasted future cash flows our valuation method is an income approach using a discounted cash flow model in which cash flows anticipated over several periods plus a terminal value at the end of that time horizon are discounted to their present value using an appropriate rate of return our estimates are based upon our historical experience our current knowledge from our commercial relationships and available external information about future trends 

the discounted cash flow model requires us to make projections of revenue gross margin operating expenses working capital investment and fixed asset additions for the reporting units over a multiyear period additionally management must estimate a weightedaverage cost of capital which reflects a market rate for each reporting unit for use as a discount rate the discounted cash flows are compared to the carrying value of the reporting unit and if less than the carrying value the difference is recorded as a goodwill impairment loss in addition we also perform a sensitivity analysis to determine how much our forecasts can fluctuate before the fair value of a reporting unit would be lower than its carrying amount we perform the required procedures as of the end of our fiscal third quarter while none of our reporting units recorded a goodwill impairment in 2019 we determined the automated transmission business is our only reporting unit with material goodwill where the estimated fair value does not substantially exceed the carrying value the estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount of 12 billion by approximately 34 percent  total goodwill in this reporting unit is 544 million  this reporting unit is made up of only one business our joint venture with eaton eaton cummins automated transmission technologies which was acquired and recorded at fair value in the third quarter of 2017 as a result we did not expect the estimated fair value would exceed the carrying value by a significant amount we valued this reporting unit primarily using an income approach based on its expected future cash flows the critical assumptions that factored into the valuation are the projected future revenues and ebitda margins of the business as well as the discount rate used to present value these future cash flows a 100 basis point increase in the discount rate would result in a 17 percent decline in the fair value of the reporting unit

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to financial risk resulting from volatility in foreign exchange rates interest rates and commodity prices this risk is closely monitored and managed through the use of financial derivative instruments including foreign currency forward contracts interest rate swaps commodity swap contracts and zerocost collars and physical forward contracts these instruments as further described below are accounted for as cash flow or fair value hedges or as economic hedges not designated as hedges for accounting purposes financial derivatives are used expressly for hedging purposes and under no circumstances are they used for speculative purposes when material we adjust the estimated fair value of our derivative contracts for counterparty or our credit risk none of our derivative instruments are subject to collateral requirements substantially all of our derivative contracts are subject to master netting arrangements which provide us with the option to settle certain contracts on a net basis when they settle on the same day with the same currency in addition these arrangements provide for a net settlement of all contracts with a given counterparty in the event that the arrangement is terminated due to the occurrence of default or a termination event 

we also enter into physical forward contracts with certain suppliers to purchase minimum volumes of commodities at contractually stated prices for various periods these arrangements as further described below enable us to fix the prices of portions of our normal purchases of these commodities which otherwise are subject to market volatility 

the following describes our risk exposures and provides the results of a sensitivity analysis performed at december 31 2019  the sensitivity analysis assumes instantaneous parallel shifts in foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices 

foreign exchange rate risk 

as a result of our international business presence we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risks we transact business in foreign currencies and as a result our income experiences some volatility related to movements in foreign currency exchange rates to help manage our exposure to exchange rate volatility we use foreign currency forward contracts on a regular basis to hedge forecasted intercompany and thirdparty sales and purchases denominated in nonfunctional currencies our foreign currency cash flow hedges generally mature within two years  these foreign currency forward contracts are designated and qualify as foreign currency cash flow hedges under gaap for the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018  there were no circumstances that resulted in the discontinuance of a foreign currency cash flow hedge 

to minimize the income volatility resulting from the remeasurement of net monetary assets and payables denominated in a currency other than the functional currency we enter into foreign currency forward contracts which are considered economic hedges the objective is to offset the gain or loss from remeasurement with the gain or loss from the fair market valuation of the forward contract these derivative instruments are not designated as hedges under gaap 

at december 31 2019 the potential gain or loss in the fair value of our outstanding foreign currency contracts assuming a hypothetical 10 percent fluctuation in the currencies of such contracts would be approximately 4 million  the sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates assumes the notional value to remain constant for the next 12 months the analysis ignores the impact of foreign exchange movements on our competitive position and potential changes in sales levels any change in the value of the contracts real or hypothetical would be significantly offset by an inverse change in the value of the underlying hedged items  

interest rate risk 

we are exposed to market risk from fluctuations in interest rates we manage our exposure to interest rate fluctuations through the use of interest rate swaps the objective of the swaps is to more effectively balance our borrowing costs and interest rate risk see note 11   debt  interest rate risk section for additional information 

commodity price risk 

we are exposed to fluctuations in commodity prices due to contractual agreements with component suppliers in order to protect ourselves against future price volatility and consequently fluctuations in gross margins we periodically enter into commodity swap forward and zerocost collar contracts with designated banks and other counterparties to fix the cost of certain raw material purchases with the objective of minimizing changes in inventory cost due to market price fluctuations commencing in 2019  these commodity swaps are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges under gaap at december 31 2019 realized and unrealized gains and losses related to these hedges were not material to our financial statements the physical forward contracts qualify for the normal purchases scope exceptions and are treated as purchase commitments the commodity zerocost collar contracts that represent an economic hedge but are not designated for hedge accounting are marked to market through earnings 

at december 31 2019 the potential gain or loss related to the outstanding commodity zerocost collar contracts assuming a hypothetical 10 percent fluctuation in the price of such commodities would be approximately 1 million  the sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in commodity prices assumes the notional value to remain constant for the next 12 months the analysis ignores the impact of commodity price movements on our competitive position and potential changes in sales levels any change in the value of the zerocost collar contracts real or hypothetical would be significantly offset by an inverse change in the value of the underlying hedged items 

we also limit our exposure to commodity price risk by entering into purchasing arrangements to fix the price of certain volumes of platinum and palladium expected to be used in our products we enter into physical forward contracts with suppliers of platinum and palladium to purchase some volumes of the commodities at contractually stated prices for various periods generally less than two years these arrangements enable us to fix the prices of a portion of our purchases of these commodities which otherwise are subject to market volatility

in the event of a change of control of either party to certain of these joint ventures and other strategic alliances certain consequences may result including automatic termination and liquidation of the venture exercise of put or call rights of ownership by the nonacquired partner termination or transfer of technology license rights to the nonacquired partner and increases in component transfer prices to the acquired partner we will continue to evaluate joint venture and partnership opportunities in order to penetrate new markets develop new products and generate manufacturing and operational efficiencies 

financial information about our investments in joint ventures and alliances is incorporated by reference from note 3   investments in equity investees  to the consolidated financial statements 

our equity income from these investees was as follows 



 

1 us tax legislation passed in december 2017 decreased our equity earnings at certain equity investees including a 7 million unfavorable impact to cummins westport inc due to the remeasurement of deferred taxes and 15 million unfavorable impact to tata cummins ltd and a 17 million unfavorable impact to all other manufacturers due to withholding tax adjustments on foreign earnings see note 4   income taxes  to our consolidated financial statements for additional information  

2 during 2016 we acquired the remaining interests in the final unconsolidated north american distributor joint venture 

3 this total represents our share of net income of our equity investees and is exclusive of royalties and interest income from our equity investees to see how this amount reconciles to equity royalty and interest income from investees in the consolidated statements of income  see note 3   investments in equity investees  to our consolidated financial statements for additional information  

manufacturing entities 

our manufacturing joint ventures have generally been formed with customers and are primarily intended to allow us to increase our market penetration in geographic regions reduce capital spending streamline our supply chain management and develop technologies our largest manufacturing joint ventures are based in china and are included in the list below our engine manufacturing joint ventures are supplied by our components segment in the same manner as it supplies our whollyowned engine segment and power systems segment manufacturing facilities our components segment joint ventures and wholly owned entities provide electronics fuel systems filtration aftertreatment systems turbocharger products and transmissions that are used with our engines as well as some competitors products the results and investments in our joint ventures in which we have 50 percent or less ownership interest except for eaton cummins automated transmission technologies joint venture discussed below  are included in “equity royalty and interest income from investees” and “investments and advances related to equity method investees” in our consolidated statements of income and consolidated balance sheets  respectively 

 distribution entity 

komatsu cummins chile ltda  komatsu cummins chile ltda is a joint venture with komatsu america corporation the joint venture is a distributor that offers the full range of our products and services to customers and endusers in chile and peru see further discussion of our distribution network under the distribution segment section above 

nonwhollyowned subsidiary 

we have a controlling interest in cummins india ltd cil which is a publicly listed company on various stock exchanges in india cil produces midrange heavyduty and highhorsepower diesel engines generators for the indian and export markets and natural gas sparkignited engines for power generation automotive and industrial applications cil also has distribution and power generation operations 

in the third quarter of 2017 we formed the eaton cummins automated transmission technologies joint venture  which was consolidated and included in our components segment as the automated transmissions business see note 19   acquisitions  to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

supply 

the performance of the endtoend supply chain extending through to our suppliers is foundational to our ability to meet customers expectations and support longterm growth we are committed to having a robust strategy for how we select and manage our suppliers to enable a market focused supply chain this requires us to continuously evaluate and upgrade our supply base as necessary to ensure we are meeting the needs of our customers 

we use a category strategy process a process designed to create the most value for the company that reviews our longterm needs and guides decisions on what we make internally and what we purchase externally for the items we decide to purchase externally the strategies also identify the suppliers we should partner with longterm to provide the best technology the lowest total cost and highest supply chain performance we design andor manufacture our strategic components used in or with our engines and power generation units including cylinder blocks and heads turbochargers connecting rods camshafts crankshafts filters alternators electronic and emissions controls automated transmissions and fuel systems we source externally purchased material and manufactured components from leading global suppliers many key suppliers are managed through longterm supply agreements that assure capacity delivery quality and cost requirements are met over an extended period approximately 20 percent of the direct material in our product designs are single sourced to external suppliers we have an established sourcing strategy and supplier management process to evaluate and mitigate risk these processes are leading us to determine our need for dual sourcing and increase our use of dual and parallel sources to minimize risk and increase supply chain responsiveness our current target for dual and parallel sourcing is approximately 90 percent of our direct material spend as of december 31 2018  our analysis indicates that we have approximately 80 percent of direct material spend with dual or parallel sources 

other important elements of our sourcing strategy include 



patents and trademarks 

we own or control a significant number of patents and trademarks relating to the products we manufacture these patents and trademarks were granted and registered over a period of years although these patents and trademarks are generally considered beneficial to our operations we do not believe any patent group of patents or trademark other than our leading brand house trademarks is significant to our business 

seasonality 

while individual product lines may experience modest seasonal variation in production there is no material effect on the demand for the majority of our products on a quarterly basis with the exceptions that our power systems segment normally experiences seasonal declines in the first quarter due to general declines in construction spending during this period and our distribution segment normally experiences seasonal declines in its first quarter business activity due to holiday periods in asia and australia 

largest customers 

we have thousands of customers around the world and have developed longstanding business relationships with many of them paccar is our largest customer accounting for 15 percent of our consolidated net sales in 2018 14 percent in 2017 and 13 percent in 2016 we have longterm supply agreements with paccar for our heavyduty and midrange engines while a significant number of our sales to paccar are under longterm supply agreements these agreements provide for particular engine requirements for specific vehicle models and not a specific volume of engines paccar is our only customer accounting for more than 10 percent of our net sales in 2018 the loss of this customer or a significant decline in the production level of paccar vehicles that use our engines would have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition we have been an engine supplier to paccar for 74 years a summary of principal customers for each operating segment is included in our segment discussion 

in addition to our agreement with paccar we have longterm heavyduty and mediumduty engine supply agreements with navistar and daimler we also have an agreement with fiat chrysler to supply engines for its ram trucks collectively our net sales to these four customers including paccar were 35 percent of our consolidated net sales in 2018  33 percent in 2017 and 33 percent in 2016 excluding paccar net sales to any single customer were less than 9 percent of our consolidated net 

sales in 2018  less than 7 percent in 2017 and less than 7 percent in 2016 these agreements contain standard purchase and sale agreement terms covering engine and engine parts pricing quality and delivery commitments as well as engineering product support obligations the basic nature of our agreements with oem customers is that they are longterm price and operations agreements that help assure the availability of our products to each customer through the duration of the respective agreements agreements with most oems contain bilateral termination provisions giving either party the right to terminate in the event of a material breach change of control or insolvency or bankruptcy of the other party 

backlog 

we have supply agreements with some truck and offhighway equipment oems however most of our business is transacted through open purchase orders these open orders are historically subject to monthtomonth releases and are subject to cancellation on reasonable notice without cancellation charges and therefore are not considered firm at december 31 2018  we did not have any significant backlogs 

research and development 

in 2018  we continued to invest in future critical technologies and products we will continue to make investments to improve our current technologies meet future emission requirements around the world and improve fuel economy 

our research and development program is focused on product improvements product extensions innovations and cost reductions for our customers research and development expenditures include salaries contractor fees building costs utilities testing technical it administrative expenses and allocation of corporate costs and are expensed net of contract reimbursements when incurred from time to time we enter into agreements with customers and government agencies to fund a portion of the research and development costs of a particular project we generally account for these reimbursements as an offset to the related research and development expenditure research and development expenses net of contract reimbursements were 894 million in 2018 734 million in 2017 and 616 million in 2016 contract reimbursements were 120 million  137 million and 131 million in 2018 2017 and 2016 respectively 

environmental sustainability 

we adopted our comprehensive environmental sustainability plan in 2014 after examining our entire environmental footprint focusing on the key areas of water waste energy and greenhouse gases ghg as the concept and scope of environmental sustainability has matured and broadened leaders have moved from initially working on environmental impacts within our direct control in our operations to an expanded view of fuel and raw materials that reaches across the entire product lifecycle from design to manufacture to end of life our environmental sustainability plan is the way we carry out our priorities goals and initiatives in our action areas including reducing our carbon footprint using fewer natural resources and partnering to solve complex problems 

the highest level of accountability for cummins’ climaterelated risks and opportunities is with the safety environment and technology set committee of the board of directors the action committee for environmental sustainability meets monthly and reports to the chairman and to the set committee at least annually 

our sustainability progress report for 2017  2018 includes goal progress and other key environmental and climate metrics and targets this and prior reports as well as a data book of more detailed environmental data in accordance with the global reporting initiatives standard core compliance designation are available on our website at wwwcumminscom  our annual submission to the carbon disclosure project cdp is also available on the website this submission provides information on our scenario planning exercise for climate and other risks as requested by cdp these reports and data book are not incorporated into this form 10k by reference we currently have the following environmental sustainability goals and commitments 



 we continue to articulate our positions on key public policy issues and on a wide range of environmental issues we are actively engaged with regulatory industry and other stakeholder groups around the world as ghg and fuel efficiency standards become more prevalent globally we were named in the top 25 in newsweeks 2018 green ranking of us companies as well as named to the dow jones north american sustainability index for the thirteenth consecutive year in 2018 and given the highest scores possible in the 2018 inaugural esg rating from institutional investor services 

environmental compliance 

product certification and compliance 

we strive to have robust certification and compliance processes adhering to all emissions regulations worldwide including prohibiting the use of defeat devices in all of our products we are transparent with all governing bodies in these processes from disclosure of the design and operation of the emission control system to test processes and results and later to any necessary reporting and corrective action processes if required 

we work collaboratively and proactively with emission regulators globally to ensure emission standards are clear appropriately stringent and enforceable in an effort to ensure our products deliver on our commitments to our customers and the environment in real world use every day 

our engines are subject to extensive statutory and regulatory requirements that directly or indirectly impose standards governing emission and noise over the past several years we have substantially increased our global environmental compliance presence and expertise to understand and meet emerging product environmental regulations around the world our ability to comply with these and future emission standards is an essential element in maintaining our leadership position in regulated markets we have made and will continue to make significant capital and research expenditures to comply with these standards our failure to comply with these standards could result in adverse effects on our future financial results 

eu and epa engine certifications 

the current onhighway nox and pm emission standards came into effect in the european union eu on january 1 2013 euro vi and on january 1 2010 for the epa to meet the more stringent heavyduty onhighway emission standards we used an evolution of our proven selective catalytic reduction scr and exhaust gas recirculation egr technology solutions and refined them for the eu and epa certified engines to maintain power and torque with substantial fuel economy improvement and maintenance intervals comparable with our previous compliant engines we offer a complete lineup of onhighway engines to meet the nearzero emission standards midrange and heavyduty engines for eu and epa require nox aftertreatment nox reduction is achieved by an integrated technology solution comprised of the xpi high pressure common rail fuel system scr technology nextgeneration cooled egr advanced electronic controls proven air handling and the cummins diesel particulate filter dpf the eu epa and california air resources board carb have certified that our engines meet the current emission requirements emission standards in international markets including japan mexico australia brazil russia india and china are becoming more stringent we believe that our experience in meeting the eu and epa emission standards leaves us well positioned to take advantage of opportunities in these markets as the need for emission control capability grows 

in 2013 we certified to epas first ever ghg regulations for onhighway medium and heavyduty engines additionally the epa 2013 regulations added the requirement of onboard diagnostics which were introduced on the isx 15 in 2010 across the full onhighway product line while maintaining the same nearzero emission levels of nox and particulate matter required in 2010 onboard diagnostics provide enhanced service capability with standardized diagnostic trouble codes service tool interface incab warning lamp and service information availability the new ghg and fuelefficiency regulations were required for all heavyduty diesel and natural gas engines beginning in january 2014 our ghg certification was the first engine certificate issued by the epa and uses the same proven base engine with the xpi fuel system variable geometry turbocharger vgt tm  and cummins aftertreatment system with dpf and scr technology application of these engines and aftertreatment technologies continues in our products that comply with the 2017 ghg regulations 

the current epa tier 4 offhighway emission standards came into effect between the 2013  2015 time frame for all power categories the current eu stage v offhighway emission standards will come into effect between the 2019  2020 time frame for all power categories engines designed for tier 4  stage v standards were based on our extensive onhighway experience developing scr high pressure fuel systems dpf and vgt tm  our products offer low fuel consumption high torque rise and power output extended maintenance intervals reliable and durable operation and a long life to overhaul period all while 

meeting the most stringent emission standards in the industrial market our offhighway products power multiple applications including construction mining marine agriculture rail defense and oil and gas and serve a global customer base 

other environmental statutes and regulations 

expenditures for environmental control activities and environmental remediation projects at our facilities in the us have not been a substantial portion of our annual expenses and are not expected to be material in 2019  we believe we are in compliance in all material respects with laws and regulations applicable to our plants and operations 

in the us pursuant to notices received from federal and state agencies andor defendant parties in site environmental contribution actions we have been identified as a potentially responsible party under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of 1980 as amended or similar state laws at fewer than 20 waste disposal sites 

based upon our experiences at similar sites we believe that our aggregate future remediation costs will not be material we have established accruals that we believe are adequate for our expected future liability with respect to these sites in addition we have several other sites where we are working with governmental authorities on remediation projects the costs for these remediation projects are not expected to be material 

employees 

at december 31 2018 we employed approximately 62610 persons worldwide approximately 21460 of our employees worldwide are represented by various unions under collective bargaining agreements that expire between 2019 and 2022

executive officers of the registrant 

following are the names and ages of our executive officers their positions with us at january 31 2019 and summaries of their backgrounds and business experience 



our chairman and chief executive officer is elected annually by our board of directors and holds office until the meeting of the board of directors at which his election is next considered other officers are appointed by the chairman and chief executive officer are ratified by our board of directors and hold office for such period as the chairman and chief executive officer or the board of directors may prescribe 




 item 1a risk factors 

set forth below and elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k are some of the principal risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual business results to differ materially from any forwardlooking statements contained in this report and could individually or in combination have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows these risk factors should be considered in addition to our cautionary comments concerning forwardlooking statements in this report including statements related to markets for our products and trends in our business that involve a number of risks and uncertainties our separate section above cautionary statements regarding forwardlooking information should be considered in addition to the following statements 

a sustained slowdown or significant downturn in our markets could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

many of our on and offhighway markets are cyclical in nature and experience volatility in demand throughout these cycles although in 2018 we experienced demand growth in most of our north american onhighway and certain offhighway markets and continued strong demand in chinese markets as well as growth in many of our other international markets if the north american or chinese markets suffer a significant downturn or if a slower pace of economic growth and weaker demand in our other significant international markets were to occur depending upon the length duration and severity of the slowdown our results of operations financial condition and cash flows would likely have a materially adverse impact 

our truck manufacturers and oem customers may discontinue outsourcing their engine supply needs 

several of our engine customers including paccar volvo navistar fiat chrysler daimler dongfeng and tata are truck manufacturers or oems that manufacture engines for some of their own vehicles despite their own engine manufacturing abilities these customers have historically chosen to outsource certain types of engine production to us due to the quality of our engine products our emission compliance capabilities our systems integration their customers preferences their desire for cost reductions their desire for eliminating production risks and their desire to maintain company focus however there can be no assurance that these customers will continue to outsource or outsource as much of their engine production in the future in fact several of these customers have expressed their intention to significantly increase their own engine production and to decrease engine purchases from us in addition increased levels of oem vertical integration could result from a number of factors such as shifts in our customers business strategies acquisition by a customer of another engine manufacturer the inability of thirdparty suppliers to meet product specifications and the emergence of lowcost production opportunities in foreign countries any significant reduction in the level of engine production outsourcing from our truck manufacturer or oem customers could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

the development of new technologies may materially reduce the demand for our current products and services 

we are investing in new products and technologies including electrified powertrains for planned introduction into certain existing and new markets given the early stages of development of some of these new products and technologies there can be no guarantee of the future market acceptance and investment returns with respect to these planned products the increased adoption of electrified powertrains in some market segments could result in lower demand for current diesel or natural gas engines and components and over time reduce the demand for related parts and service revenues from diesel or natural gas powertrains furthermore it is possible that we may not be successful in developing segmentleading electrified powertrains and some of our existing customers could choose to develop their own electrified or alternate fuel powertrains or source from other manufacturers and any of these factors could have a materially adverse impact our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

our products are subject to extensive statutory and regulatory requirements that can significantly increase our costs and along with increased scrutiny from regulatory agencies and unpredictability in the adoption implementation and enforcement of increasingly stringent emission standards by multiple jurisdictions around the world could have a materially adverse impact on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

our engines are subject to extensive statutory and regulatory requirements governing emissions and noise including standards imposed by the epa the eu state regulatory agencies such as the carb and other regulatory agencies around the world regulatory agencies are making certification and compliance with emissions and noise standards more stringent and subjecting diesel engine products to an increasing level of scrutiny the discovery of noncompliance issues could have a materially adverse impact on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

developing engines and components to meet more stringent and changing regulatory requirements with different implementation timelines and emission requirements makes developing engines efficiently for multiple markets complicated and could result in substantial additional costs that may be difficult to recover in certain markets while we have met previous deadlines our ability to comply with existing and future regulatory standards will be essential for us to maintain our 

competitive advantage in the engine markets we serve the successful development and introduction of new and enhanced products in order to comply with new regulatory requirements are subject to other risks such as delays in product development cost overruns and unanticipated technical and manufacturing difficulties 

in addition to these risks the nature and timing of government implementation and enforcement of increasingly stringent emission standards in our worldwide markets are unpredictable and subject to change any delays in implementation or enforcement could result in a loss of our competitive advantage and could have a materially adverse impact on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

our products are subject to recall for performance or safetyrelated issues 

our products are subject to recall for performance or safetyrelated issues product recalls subject us to reputational risk loss of current and future customers reduced revenue and product recall costs product recall costs are incurred when we decide either voluntarily or involuntarily to recall a product through a formal campaign to solicit the return of specific products due to a known or suspected performance issue any significant product recalls could have material adverse effects on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows see note 9   product warranty liability  to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

we operate our business on a global basis and policy changes affecting international trade could adversely impact the demand for our products and our competitive position 

we manufacture sell and service products globally and rely upon a global supply chain to deliver the raw materials components systems and parts that we need to manufacture and service our products changes in government policies on foreign trade and investment can affect the demand for our products and services cause nonus nationals to shift preferences toward domestically manufactured or branded products and impact the competitive position of our products or prevent us from being able to sell products in certain countries our business benefits from free trade agreements such as the new united statesmexicocanada agreement and the us trade relationship with china and efforts to withdraw from or substantially modify such agreements or arrangements in addition to the implementation of more restrictive trade policies such as more detailed inspections higher tariffs including but not limited to additional tariffs on the import of steel or aluminum import or export licensing requirements exchange controls or new barriers to entry could adversely impact our production costs customer demand and our relationships with customers and suppliers any of these consequences could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

the united kingdom’s decision to end its membership in the european union could materially and adversely impact our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

in june 2016 a majority of voters in the united kingdom elected to withdraw from the european union eu in a national referendum brexit additionally the results of the united kingdom’s brexit has caused and may continue to cause volatility in global stock markets currency exchange rate fluctuations and global economic uncertainty although it is unknown what the terms of the united kingdom’s future relationship with the eu will be it is possible that there will be higher tariffs or greater restrictions on imports and exports between the united kingdom and the eu and increased regulatory complexities the effects of brexit will depend on any agreements the united kingdom makes to retain access to eu markets either during a transitional period or on a permanent basis these measures could potentially disrupt our supply chain access to human capital and some of our target markets and jurisdictions in which we operate and adversely change tax benefits or liabilities in these or other jurisdictions in addition brexit could lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations including with respect to emissions and similar certifications granted to us by the eu as the united kingdom determines which eu laws to replace or replicate any of these effects of brexit among others could have a materially adverse impact on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

lowerthananticipated market acceptance of our new or existing products or services including reductions in demand for diesel engines could have a materially adverse impact on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

although we conduct market research before launching new or refreshed engines and introducing new services many factors both within and outside our control affect the success of new or existing products and services in the marketplace offering engines and services that customers desire and value can mitigate the risks of increasing price competition and declining demand but products and services that are perceived to be less than desirable whether in terms of price quality overall value fuel efficiency or other attributes can exacerbate these risks with increased consumer interconnectedness through the internet social media and other media mere allegations relating to poor quality safety fuel efficiency corporate responsibility or other key attributes can negatively impact our reputation or market acceptance of our products or services including with respect to the demand for diesel engines even if such allegations prove to be inaccurate or unfounded 

a slowdown in infrastructure development andor depressed commodity prices could adversely affect our business 

infrastructure development and strong commodity prices have been significant drivers of our historical growth but as the pace of investment in infrastructure slowed in recent years especially in china and brazil commodity prices were significantly lower and demand for our products in offhighway markets was weak weakness in commodity prices such as oil gas and coal adversely impacted mining industry participants’ demand for vehicles and equipment that contain our engines and other products over the past several years although many of our offhighway markets began to recover in 2017 and 2018 additional deterioration or renewed weakness in infrastructure and commodities markets could adversely affect our customers’ demand for vehicles and equipment and as a result could adversely affect our business 

we are vulnerable to supply shortages from singlesourced suppliers 

during 2018 we single sourced approximately 20 percent of the total types of parts in our product designs compared to approximately 20 percent in 2017 any delay in our suppliers deliveries may adversely affect our operations at multiple manufacturing locations forcing us to seek alternative supply sources to avoid serious disruptions delays may be caused by factors affecting our suppliers including capacity constraints labor disputes economic downturns availability of credit the impaired financial condition suppliers allocations to other purchasers weather emergencies natural disasters or acts of war or terrorism any extended delay in receiving critical supplies could impair our ability to deliver products to our customers and adversely affect our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

our information technology systems and our products are exposed to potential security breaches or other disruptions which may adversely impact our competitive position reputation results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

we rely on the capacity reliability and security of our information technology systems and data security infrastructure in connection with various aspects of our business activities we also rely on our ability to expand and continually update these systems and related infrastructure in response to the changing needs of our business as we implement new systems they may not perform as expected we face the challenge of supporting our older systems and implementing necessary upgrades in addition some of these systems are managed by third party service providers and are not under our direct control if we experience a problem with an important information technology system including during system upgrades andor new system implementations the resulting disruptions could have an adverse effect on our business and reputation as customers adopt and rely on cloudbased digital technologies and services we offer any disruption of the confidentiality integrity or availability of those services could have an adverse effect on our business and reputation 

the data handled by our information technology systems is vulnerable to security threats our operations routinely involve receiving storing processing and transmitting sensitive information pertaining to our business customers dealers suppliers employees and other sensitive matters information technology security threats such as security breaches computer malware computer viruses and other cyber attacks which are increasing in both frequency and sophistication along with power outages or hardware failures could result in unauthorized public disclosures of information and create financial liability subject us to legal or regulatory sanctions disrupt our ability to conduct our business or damage our reputation with customers dealers suppliers and other stakeholders in addition our products including our engines contain interconnected and increasingly complex systems that control various processes and these systems are potentially subject to cyber attacks and disruption the impact of a significant information technology event on either of our information technology systems or our products could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position reputation results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

financial distress or a changeincontrol of one of our large truck oem customers could have a materially adverse impact on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

we recognize significant sales of engines and components to a few large onhighway truck oem customers in north america which have been an integral part of our positive business results for several years if one of our large truck oem customers experiences financial distress bankruptcy or a changeincontrol such circumstance could likely lead to significant reductions in our sales volumes commercial disputes receivable collection issues and other negative consequences that could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

we derive significant earnings from investees that we do not directly control with more than 50 percent of these earnings from our chinabased investees 

for 2018 we recognized 394 million of equity royalty and interest income from investees compared to 357 million in 2017 approximately half of our equity royalty and interest income from investees is from four of our 50 percent owned joint ventures in china  beijing foton cummins engine co ltd dongfeng cummins engine company ltd chongqing cummins engine company ltdand dongfeng cummins emission solutions co ltd as a result although a significant percentage of our net income is derived from these unconsolidated entities we do not unilaterally control their management or 

their operations which puts a substantial portion of our net income at risk from the actions or inactions of these entities a significant reduction in the level of contribution by these entities to our net income would likely have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows 

our plan to reposition our portfolio of product offerings through exploration of strategic acquisitions and divestitures may expose us to additional costs and risks 

part of our strategic plan is to improve our revenue growth gross margins and earnings by exploring the repositioning of our portfolio of product line offerings through the pursuit of potential strategic acquisitions andor divestitures to provide future strategic financial and operational benefits and improve shareholder value there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify suitable candidates or consummate these transactions on favorable terms the successful identification and completion of any strategic transaction depends on a number of factors that are not entirely within our control including the availability of suitable candidates and our ability to negotiate terms acceptable to all parties involved conclude satisfactory agreements and obtain all necessary regulatory approvals accordingly we may not be able to successfully negotiate and complete specific transactions the exploration negotiation and consummation of strategic transactions may involve significant expenditures by us which may adversely affect our results of operations at the time such expenses are incurred and may divert management’s attention from our existing business strategic transactions also may have adverse effects on our existing business relationships with suppliers and customers if required the financing for strategic acquisitions could result in an increase in our indebtedness dilute the interests of our shareholders or both any acquisition may not be accretive to us for a significant period of time following the completion of such acquisition also our ability to effectively integrate any potential acquisition into our existing business and culture may not be successful which could jeopardize future financial and operational performance for the combined businesses in addition if an acquisition results in any additional goodwill or increase in other intangible assets on our balance sheet and subsequently becomes impaired we would be required to record a noncash impairment charge which could result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows similarly any strategic divestiture of a product line or business may reduce our revenue and earnings reduce the diversity of our business result in substantial costs and expenses and cause disruption to our employees customers vendors and communities in which we operate 

we may fail to realize all of the expected enhanced revenue earnings and cash flow from our investment in the eaton cummins automated transmission technologies joint venture 

our ability to realize all of the expected enhanced revenue earnings and cash flow from our 2017 investment in the eaton cummins automated transmission technologies joint venture will depend in substantial part on our ability to successfully launch the automated transmission products in north america and achieve our projected market penetration while we believe we will ultimately achieve these objectives it is possible that we will be unable to achieve all of the goals within our anticipated time frame or in the anticipated amounts if we are not able to successfully complete our automated transmission strategy the anticipated enhanced revenue earnings and cash flows resulting from this joint venture may not be realized fully or may take longer to realize than expected as part of the purchase accounting associated with the formation of the joint venture significant goodwill and intangible asset balances were recorded on the consolidated balance sheet if cash flows from the joint venture fall short of our anticipated amounts these assets could be subject to impairment charges negatively impacting our earnings 

we face significant competition in the markets we serve 

the markets in which we operate are highly competitive we compete worldwide with a number of other manufacturers and distributors that produce and sell similar products we primarily compete in the market with diesel engines and related diesel products however new technologies continue to be developed for gasoline natural gas electrification and other technologies and we will continue to face new competition from these expanding technologies our products primarily compete on the basis of price performance fuel economy emissions compliance speed of delivery quality and customer support we also face competitors in some emerging markets who have established local practices and long standing relationships with participants in these markets there can be no assurance that our products will be able to compete successfully with the products of other companies and in other markets 

increasing global competition among our customers may affect our existing customer relationships and restrict our ability to benefit from some of our customers growth 

as our customers in emerging markets continue to grow in size and scope they are increasingly seeking to export their products to other countries this has meant greater demand for our advanced engine technologies to help these customers meet the more stringent emissions requirements of developed markets as well as greater demand for access to our distribution systems for purposes of equipment servicing as these emerging market customers enter into and begin to compete in more developed markets they may increasingly begin to compete with our existing customers in these markets our further aid to emerging market customers could adversely affect our relationships with developed market customers in addition to the extent the competition does not correspond to overall growth in demand we may see little or no benefit from this type of expansion by our emerging market customers 

we are subject to foreign currency exchange rate and other related risks 

we conduct operations in many areas of the world involving transactions denominated in a variety of currencies we are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk to the extent that our costs are denominated in currencies other than those in which we earn revenues in addition since our financial statements are denominated in us dollars changes in foreign currency exchange rates between the us dollar and other currencies have had and will continue to have an impact on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows the us dollar strengthened in recent years resulting in material unfavorable impacts on our revenues in those years if the us dollar continues strengthening against other currencies we will experience additional volatility in our financial statements while we customarily enter into financial transactions that attempt to address these risks and many of our supply agreements with customers include foreign currency exchange rate adjustment provisions there can be no assurance that foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations will not adversely affect our future results of operations and cash flows in addition while the use of currency hedging instruments may provide us with some protection from adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates by utilizing these instruments we potentially forego the benefits that might result from favorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates we also face risks arising from the imposition of foreign exchange controls and currency devaluations foreign exchange controls may limit our ability to convert foreign currencies into us dollars or to remit dividends and other payments by our foreign subsidiaries or businesses located in or conducted within a country imposing controls currency devaluations result in a diminished value of funds denominated in the currency of the country instituting the devaluation see managements discussion and analysis for additional information 

our products are exposed to variability in material and commodity costs 

our businesses establish prices with our customers in accordance with contractual time frames however the timing of material and commodity market price increases may prevent us from passing these additional costs on to our customers through timely pricing actions additionally higher material and commodity costs around the world may offset our efforts to reduce our cost structure while we customarily enter into financial transactions and contractual pricing adjustment provisions with our customers that attempt to address some of these risks notably with respect to copper platinum and palladium there can be no assurance that commodity price fluctuations will not adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows in addition while the use of commodity price hedging instruments and contractual pricing adjustments may provide us with some protection from adverse fluctuations in commodity prices by utilizing these instruments we potentially forego the benefits that might result from favorable fluctuations in price as a result higher material and commodity costs as well as hedging these commodity costs during periods of decreasing prices could result in declining margins 

we are exposed to political economic and other risks that arise from operating a multinational business 

our business is subject to the political economic and other risks that are inherent in operating in numerous countries these risks include 



 as we continue to operate our business globally our success will depend in part on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these and other related risks there can be no assurance that the consequences of these and other factors relating to our multinational operations will not have a material adverse effect upon us 

the adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could adversely affect our profitability 

on december 22 2017 the us enacted the tax cuts and jobs act tax legislation and all adjustments to the 2017 estimates were incorporated into our financial results in 2018 there continues to be a risk that states or foreign jurisdictions may amend their tax laws in response to the tax legislation which could have a material impact on our future results 

we are subject to income taxes in the us and numerous international jurisdictions our income tax provision and cash tax liability in the future could be adversely affected by changes in earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities changes in tax laws and the discovery of new information in the course of our tax return preparation process the carrying value of deferred tax assets which are predominantly in the us is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income in the us we are also subject to ongoing tax audits these audits can involve complex issues which may require an extended period of time to resolve and can be highly judgmental tax authorities may disagree with certain tax reporting positions taken by us and as a result assess additional taxes against us we regularly assess the likely outcomes of these audits in order to determine the appropriateness of our tax provision the amounts ultimately paid upon resolution of these or subsequent tax audits could be materially different from the amounts previously included in our income tax provision and therefore could have a material impact on our tax provision 

our global operations are subject to laws and regulations that impose significant compliance costs and create reputational and legal risk 

due to the international scope of our operations we are subject to a complex system of commercial and trade regulations around the world recent years have seen an increase in the development and enforcement of laws regarding trade compliance and anticorruption such as the us foreign corrupt practices act and similar laws from other countries as well as new regulatory requirements regarding data privacy such as the european union general data protection regulation our numerous foreign subsidiaries affiliates and joint venture partners are governed by laws rules and business practices that differ from those of the us the activities of these entities may not comply with us laws or business practices or our code of business conduct violations of these laws may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions could disrupt our business and result in an adverse effect on our reputation business and results of operations financial condition and cash flows we cannot predict the nature scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our operations might be subject or the manner in which existing laws might be administered or interpreted 

we face the challenge of accurately aligning our capacity with our demand 

we can experience capacity constraints and longer lead times for certain products in times of growing demand while we can also experience idle capacity as economies slow or demand for certain products decline accurately forecasting our expected volumes and appropriately adjusting our capacity have been and will continue to be important factors in determining our results of operations and cash flows we cannot guarantee that we will be able to increase manufacturing capacity to a level that meets demand for our products which could prevent us from meeting increased customer demand and could harm our business however if we overestimate our demand and overbuild our capacity we may have significantly underutilized assets and we may experience reduced margins if we do not accurately align our manufacturing capabilities with demand it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

our business is exposed to potential product liability claims 

we face an inherent business risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that our products failure to perform to specification results or is alleged to result in property damage bodily injury andor death at any given time we are subject to various and multiple product liability claims any one of which if decided adversely to us may have a material adverse effect on our reported results of operation in the period in which our liability with respect to any such claim is recognized while we maintain insurance coverage with respect to certain product liability claims we may not be able to obtain such insurance on acceptable terms in the future if at all and any such insurance may not provide adequate coverage against product liability claims in addition product liability claims can be expensive to defend and can divert the attention of management and other personnel for significant periods of time regardless of the ultimate outcome furthermore even if we are successful in 

defending against a claim relating to our products claims of this nature could cause our customers to lose confidence in our products and us 

our operations are subject to increasingly stringent environmental laws and regulations 

our plants and operations are subject to increasingly stringent environmental laws and regulations in all of the countries in which we operate including laws and regulations governing air emission discharges to water and the generation handling storage transportation treatment and disposal of waste materials while we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with these environmental laws and regulations there can be no assurance that we will not be adversely impacted by costs liabilities or claims with respect to existing or subsequently acquired operations under either present laws and regulations or those that may be adopted or imposed in the future we are also subject to laws requiring the cleanup of contaminated property if a release of hazardous substances occurs at or from any of our current or former properties or at a landfill or another location where we have disposed of hazardous materials we may be held liable for the contamination and the amount of such liability could be material 

future bans or limitations on the use of dieselpowered vehicles or other applications could have a materially adverse impact on our business over the long term 

in an effort to limit greenhouse gas emissions and combat climate change multiple countries and cities have announced that they plan to implement a ban on the use in their cities or countries of dieselpowered products in the near or distant future these countries include china india and germany in addition california government officials have called for the state to phase out sales of dieselpowered vehicles by 2040 to the extent that these types of bans are actually implemented in the future on a broad basis or in one or more of our key markets our business over the longterm could experience materially adverse impacts 

we are exposed to risks arising from the price and availability of energy 

the level of demand for our products and services is influenced in multiple ways by the price and availability of energy high energy costs generally drive greater demand for better fuel economy in almost all countries in which we operate some of our engine products have been developed with a primary purpose of offering fuel economy improvements and if energy costs decrease or increase less than expected demand for these products may likewise decrease the relative unavailability of electricity in some emerging market countries also influences demand for our electricity generating products such as our diesel generators if these countries add energy capacity by expanding their power grids at a rate equal to or faster than the growth in demand for energy the demand for our generating products could also decrease or increase less than would otherwise be the case 

significant declines in future financial and stock market conditions could diminish our pension plan asset performance and adversely impact our results of operations financial condition and cash flow 

we sponsor both funded and unfunded domestic and foreign defined benefit pension and other retirement plans our pension cost and the required contributions to our pension plans are directly affected by the value of plan assets the projected and actual rates of return on plan assets and the actuarial assumptions we use to measure our defined benefit pension plan obligations including the discount rate at which future projected and accumulated pension obligations are discounted to a present value we could experience increased pension cost due to a combination of factors including the decreased investment performance of pension plan assets decreases in the discount rate and changes in our assumptions relating to the expected return on plan assets significant declines in future financial and stock market conditions could cause material losses in our pension plan assets which could result in increased pension cost in future years and adversely impact our results of operations financial condition and cash flow depending upon the severity of market declines and government regulatory changes we may be legally obligated to make pension payments in the us and perhaps other countries and these contributions could be material 

we may be adversely impacted by work stoppages and other labor matters 

at december 31 2018 we employed approximately 62610 persons worldwide approximately 21460 of our employees worldwide are represented by various unions under collective bargaining agreements that expire between 2019 and 2022 while we have no reason to believe that we will be materially impacted by work stoppages or other labor matters there can be no assurance that future issues with our labor unions will be resolved favorably or that we will not encounter future strikes work stoppages or other types of conflicts with labor unions or our employees any of these consequences may have an adverse effect on us or may limit our flexibility in dealing with our workforce in addition many of our customers and suppliers have unionized work forces work stoppages or slowdowns experienced by our customers or suppliers could result in slowdowns or closures that would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flow 

our financial statements are subject to changes in accounting standards that could adversely impact our profitability or financial position 

our financial statements are subject to the application of generally accepted accounting principles gaap in the united states of america which are periodically revised andor expanded accordingly from time to time we are required to adopt new or revised accounting standards issued by recognized authoritative bodies including the financial accounting standards board recently accounting standard setters issued new guidance which further interprets or seeks to revise accounting pronouncements related to lease accounting as well as to issue new standards expanding disclosures the impact of accounting pronouncements that have been issued but not yet implemented is disclosed in our annual and quarterly reports on form 10k and form 10q an assessment of proposed standards is not provided as such proposals are subject to change through the exposure process and therefore their effects on our financial statements cannot be meaningfully assessed it is possible that future accounting standards we are required to adopt could change the current accounting treatment that we apply to our consolidated financial statements and that such changes could have a material adverse effect on our reported results of operations and financial position

worldwide revenues improved 16 percent in 2018 compared to 2017  with all operating segments reporting higher sales net sales in the united states us and canada improved by 19 percent primarily due to increased demand in the north american onhighway markets primarily in the heavy and mediumduty truck markets increased demand in all of our distribution product lines sales from the automated transmission business acquired during the third quarter of 2017 and increased industrial demand especially in oil and gas and construction markets international demand growth excludes the us and canada in 2018 improved international net sales by 12 percent compared to 2017 with sales up in most of our markets especially in europe asia pacific latin america china and india the increase in international sales was primarily due to increased demand in industrial markets especially construction and mining markets in china and europe increased onhighway demand especially in brazil europe and india increased demand in our distribution business especially in western europe asia pacific and china and increased demand for power generation equipment primarily in the middle east asia pacific and china

a summary of our contractual obligations and other commercial commitments at december 31 2018  are as follows 



   

 the contractual obligations reported above exclude our unrecognized tax benefits of 71 million as of december 31 2018  we are not able to reasonably estimate the period in which cash outflows relating to uncertain tax contingencies could occur see note 4   income taxes  to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

application of critical accounting estimates 

a summary of our significant accounting policies is included in note 1   summary of significant accounting policies  of our consolidated financial statements which discusses accounting policies that we have selected from acceptable alternatives 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the us gaap which often requires management to make judgments estimates and assumptions regarding uncertainties that affect the reported amounts presented and disclosed in the financial statements management reviews these estimates and assumptions based on historical experience changes in business conditions and other relevant factors they believe to be reasonable under the circumstances in any given reporting period our actual results may differ from the estimates and assumptions used in preparing our consolidated financial statements 

critical accounting estimates are defined as follows the estimate requires management to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the estimate was made different estimates reasonably could have been used or if changes in the estimate are reasonably likely to occur from period to period and the change would have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations our senior management has discussed the development and selection of our accounting policies related accounting estimates and the disclosures set forth below with the audit committee of our board of directors we believe our critical accounting estimates include estimating liabilities for warranty programs accounting for income taxes and pension benefits and assessing goodwill impairments 

warranty programs 

we estimate and record a liability for base warranty programs at the time our products are sold our estimates are based on historical experience and reflect managements best estimates of expected costs at the time products are sold and subsequent adjustment to those expected costs when actual costs differ as a result of the uncertainty surrounding the nature and frequency of product recall programs the liability for such programs is recorded when we commit to a recall action or when a recall becomes probable and estimable which generally occurs when it is announced our warranty liability is generally affected by component failure rates repair costs and the point of failure within the product life cycle future events and circumstances related to these factors could materially change our estimates and require adjustments to our liability new product launches require a greater use of judgment in developing estimates until historical experience becomes available product specific experience is typically available four or five quarters after product launch with a clear experience trend evident eight quarters after launch we generally record warranty expense for new products upon shipment using a preceding products warranty history and a multiplicative factor based upon preceding similar product experience and new product assessment until sufficient new product data is available for warranty estimation we then use a blend of actual new product experience and preceding product historical experience for several subsequent quarters and new product specific experience thereafter note 9   product warranty liability  to our consolidated financial statements contains a summary of the activity in our warranty liability account for 2018  2017 and 2016 including adjustments to preexisting warranties 

accounting for income taxes 

we determine our income tax expense using the asset and liability method under this method deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax effects of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis future tax benefits of net operating loss and credit carryforwards are also recognized as deferred tax assets we evaluate the recoverability of our deferred tax assets each quarter by assessing the likelihood of future profitability and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize our net deferred tax assets at december 31 2018  we recorded net deferred tax assets of 147 million  the assets included 340 million for the value of net operating loss and credit carryforwards a valuation allowance of 327 million was recorded to reduce the tax assets to the net value management believed was more likely than not to be realized in the event our operating performance deteriorates future assessments could conclude that a larger valuation allowance will be needed to further reduce the deferred tax assets 

on december 22 2017 the us enacted the tax cuts and jobs act tax legislation  the sec issued guidance permitting final calculations to be completed within a one year measurement period ending december 22 2018 we made provisional estimates of the effects on our existing deferred tax balances the onetime transition tax and the withholding tax accrued on those earnings not permanently reinvested at december 31 2017 as additional tax reform guidance was released during 2018 any provisional amounts were reported in income from continuing operations in the period in which tax reform guidance was issued we have completed our accounting for the tax effects of the enactment of the tax legislation and included in our reporting the nature and amount of any measurement period adjustments recognized during 2018 and the effect of measurement period adjustments on the effective tax rate 

in addition we operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and are subject to tax audits in these jurisdictions these audits can involve complex issues which may require an extended period of time to resolve we accrue for the estimated additional tax and interest that may result from tax authorities disputing uncertain tax positions we have taken and we believe we have made adequate provisions for income taxes for all years that are subject to audit based upon the latest information available a more complete description of our income taxes and the future benefits of our net operating loss and credit carryforwards is disclosed in note 4   income taxes  to our consolidated financial statements  

pension benefits 

we sponsor a number of pension plans globally with the majority of assets in the us and the uk in the us and the uk we have several major defined benefit plans that are separately funded we account for our pension programs in accordance with employers accounting for defined benefit pension plans under gaap gaap requires that amounts recognized in financial statements be determined using an actuarial basis as a result our pension benefit programs are based on a number of statistical and judgmental assumptions that attempt to anticipate future events and are used in calculating the expense and liability related to our plans each year at december 31 these assumptions include discount rates used to value liabilities assumed rates of return on plan assets future compensation increases employee turnover rates actuarial assumptions relating to retirement age mortality rates and participant withdrawals the actuarial assumptions we use may differ significantly from actual results due to changing economic conditions participant life span and withdrawal rates these differences may result in a material impact to the amount of net periodic pension cost to be recorded in our consolidated financial statements in the future 

the expected longterm return on plan assets is used in calculating the net periodic pension cost we considered several factors in developing our expected rate of return on plan assets the longterm rate of return considers historical returns and expected returns on current and projected asset allocations projected returns are based primarily on broad publicly traded passive fixed income and equity indices and forwardlooking estimates of the value added by active investment management at december 31 2018 based upon our target asset allocations it is anticipated that our us investment policy will generate an average annual return over the 30year projection period equal to or in excess of 625 percent approximately 37 percent of the time  including the additional positive returns expected from active investment management 

the oneyear return for our us plans was 17 percent for 2018 our us plan assets have averaged annualized returns of 1022 percent over the prior ten years and resulted in approximately 313 million of actuarial gains in accumulated other comprehensive income in the same period based on the historical returns and forwardlooking return expectations and as plan assets continue to be derisked consistent with our investment policy we believe an investment return assumption of 625 percent per year in 2019 for us pension assets is reasonable 

the methodology used to determine the rate of return on pension plan assets in the uk was based on establishing an equityrisk premium over current longterm bond yields adjusted based on target asset allocations at december 31 2018 based upon our target asset allocations it is anticipated that our uk investment policy will generate an average annual return over the 20year projection period equal to or in excess of 4 percent approximately 50 percent of the time the oneyear return for our uk plans was 18 percent for 2018  we have generated average annualized returns of 997 percent over ten years resulting in approximately 352 million of actuarial gains in accumulated other comprehensive income our strategy with respect to our investments in pension plan assets is to be invested with a longterm outlook based on the historical returns and forwardlooking return expectations as the plan assets continue to be derisked we believe an investment return assumption of 40 percent in 2019 for uk pension assets is reasonable our pension plan asset allocations at december 31 2018 and 2017 and target allocation for 2019 are as follows 



the differences between the actual return on plan assets and expected longterm return on plan assets are recognized in the asset value used to calculate net periodic cost over five years the table below sets forth the expected return assumptions used to develop our pension cost for the period 2016  2018 and our expected rate of return for 2019  



gaap for pensions offers various acceptable alternatives to account for the differences that eventually arise between the estimates used in the actuarial valuations and the actual results it is acceptable to delay or immediately recognize these differences under the delayed recognition alternative changes in pension obligations including those resulting from plan amendments and changes in the value of assets set aside to meet those obligations are not recognized in net periodic pension cost as they occur but are recognized initially in accumulated other comprehensive loss and subsequently amortized as components of net periodic pension cost systematically and gradually over future periods in addition to this approach gaap also allows immediate recognition of actuarial gains or losses immediate recognition introduces volatility in financial results we have chosen to delay recognition and amortize actuarial differences over future periods if we adopted the immediate recognition approach we would record a loss of 889 million  699 million aftertax from cumulative actuarial net losses for our us and uk pension plans 

the difference between the expected return and the actual return on plan assets is deferred from recognition in our results of operations and under certain circumstances such as when the difference exceeds 10 percent of the market value of plan assets or the projected benefit obligation amortized over future years of service this is also true of changes to actuarial assumptions under gaap the actuarial gains and losses are recognized and recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss at december 31 2018  we had net pension actuarial losses of 635 million and 230 million for the us and uk pension plans respectively as these amounts exceed 10 percent of their respective plan assets the excess is amortized over the average remaining service lives of participating employees net actuarial losses decreased our shareholders equity by 74 million aftertax in 2018  the loss is primarily due to lower asset returns in the us and uk partially offset by higher discount rates in the us and uk 

the table below sets forth the net periodic pension cost for the years ended december 31 and our expected cost for 2019  



we expect 2019 net periodic pension cost to decrease compared to 2018  primarily due to higher discount rates in the us and uk partially offset by a lower expected rate of return in the us the increase in net periodic pension cost in 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily due to lower expected asset returns in the us and uk as we derisked plan trust assets partially offset by reduced loss amortizations in the us and uk the increase in net periodic pension cost in 2017 compared to 2016 was due to onboarding north american distributors to cummins pension benefits a lower expected rate of return in the us and uk and lower discount rates in the us and uk 

the weightedaverage discount rates used to develop our net periodic pension cost are set forth in the table below 



the discount rate enables us to state expected future cash payments for benefits as a present value on the measurement date the guidelines for setting this rate are discussed in gaap which suggests the use of a highquality corporate bond rate we used bond information provided by moodys investor services inc and standard  poors rating services all bonds used to develop our hypothetical portfolio in the us and uk were deemed highquality noncallable bonds aa or better at december 31 2018  by at least one of the bond rating agencies 

our model called for projected payments until near extinction for the us and the uk for both countries our model matches the present value of the plans projected benefit payments to the market value of the theoretical settlement bond portfolio a single equivalent discount rate is determined to align the present value of the required cash flow with the value of the bond portfolio the resulting discount rate is reflective of both the current interest rate environment and the plans distinct liability characteristics 

the table below sets forth the estimated impact on our 2019 net periodic pension cost relative to a change in the discount rate and a change in the expected rate of return on plan assets 



the above sensitivities reflect the impact of changing one assumption at a time a higher discount rate decreases the plan obligations and decreases our net periodic pension cost a lower discount rate increases the plan obligations and increases our net periodic pension cost it should be noted that economic factors and conditions often affect multiple assumptions simultaneously and the effects of changes in key assumptions are not necessarily linear note 11   pensions and other postretirement benefits  to our consolidated financial statements provides a summary of our pension benefit plan activity the funded status of our plans and the amounts recognized in our consolidated financial statements  

goodwill impairment 

we are required to make certain subjective and complex judgments in assessing whether a goodwill impairment event has occurred including assumptions and estimates used to determine the fair value of our reporting units we test for goodwill impairment at the reporting unit level and our reporting units are the operating segments or the components of operating segments that constitute businesses for which discrete financial information is available and is regularly reviewed by management 

under gaap for goodwill we have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform an annual quantitative goodwill impairment test we have elected this option on certain reporting units the following events and circumstances are considered when evaluating whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 

 the examples noted above are not allinclusive and we will consider other relevant events and circumstances that affect the fair value of a reporting unit in determining whether to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test 

our goodwill recoverability assessment is based on our annual strategic planning process this process includes an extensive review of expectations for the longterm growth of our businesses and forecasted future cash flows our valuation method is an “income approach” using a discounted cash flow model in which cash flows anticipated over several periods plus a terminal value at the end of that time horizon are discounted to their present value using an appropriate rate of return our estimates are based upon our historical experience our current knowledge from our commercial relationships and available external information about future trends 

our valuation method requires us to make projections of revenue operating expenses working capital investment and fixed asset additions for the reporting units over a multiyear period additionally management must estimate a weightedaverage cost of capital which reflects a market rate for each reporting unit for use as a discount rate the discounted cash flows are compared to the carrying value of the reporting unit and if less than the carrying value the difference is recorded as a goodwill impairment loss in addition we also perform a sensitivity analysis to determine how much our forecasts can fluctuate before the fair value of a reporting unit would be lower than its carrying amount we perform the required procedures as of the end of our fiscal third quarter we determined that the automated transmission business is our only reporting unit with material goodwill where the estimated fair value does not substantially exceed the carrying value the estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount by approximately 21 percent  total goodwill in this reporting unit is 544 million and the total carrying amount at the time of the evaluation was 12 billion  this reporting unit is made up of only one business our joint venture with eaton eaton cummins automated transmission technologies which was acquired and recorded at fair value in the third quarter of 2017 as a result we did not expect that the estimated fair value would exceed the carrying value by a significant amount we valued this reporting unit primarily using an income approach based on its expected future cash flows the critical assumptions that factored into the valuation are the projected future revenues and ebitda margins of the 

business as well as the discount rate used to present value these future cash flows a 100 basis point increase in the discount rate would result in a 15 percent decline in the fair value of the reporting unit

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to financial risk resulting from volatility in foreign exchange rates interest rates and commodity prices this risk is closely monitored and managed through the use of financial derivative instruments including foreign currency forward contracts interest rate swaps commodity zerocost collars and physical forward contracts these instruments as further described below are accounted for as cash flow or fair value hedges or as economic hedges not designated as hedges for accounting purposes financial derivatives are used expressly for hedging purposes and under no circumstances are they used for speculative purposes when material we adjust the estimated fair value of our derivative contracts for counterparty or our credit risk none of our derivative instruments are subject to collateral requirements substantially all of our derivative contracts are subject to master netting arrangements which provide us with the option to settle certain contracts on a net basis when they settle on the same day with the same currency in addition these arrangements provide for a net settlement of all contracts with a given counterparty in the event that the arrangement is terminated due to the occurrence of default or a termination event 

we also enter into physical forward contracts with certain suppliers to purchase minimum volumes of commodities at contractually stated prices for various periods these arrangements as further described below enable us to fix the prices of portions of our normal purchases of these commodities which otherwise are subject to market volatility 

the following describes our risk exposures and provides the results of a sensitivity analysis performed at december 31 2018  the sensitivity analysis assumes instantaneous parallel shifts in foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices 

foreign exchange rate risk 

as a result of our international business presence we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risks we transact business in foreign currencies and as a result our income experiences some volatility related to movements in foreign currency exchange rates to help manage our exposure to exchange rate volatility we use foreign currency forward contracts on a regular basis to hedge forecasted intercompany and thirdparty sales and purchases denominated in nonfunctional currencies our foreign currency cash flow hedges generally mature within two years  these foreign currency forward contracts are designated and qualify as foreign currency cash flow hedges under gaap for the years ended december 31 2018 and 2017  there were no circumstances that resulted in the discontinuance of a foreign currency cash flow hedge 

to minimize the income volatility resulting from the remeasurement of net monetary assets and payables denominated in a currency other than the functional currency we enter into foreign currency forward contracts which are considered economic hedges the objective is to offset the gain or loss from remeasurement with the gain or loss from the fair market valuation of the forward contract these derivative instruments are not designated as hedges under gaap 

at december 31 2018 the potential gain or loss in the fair value of our outstanding foreign currency contracts assuming a hypothetical 10 percent fluctuation in the currencies of such contracts would be approximately 91 million  the sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates assumes the notional value to remain constant for the next 12 months the analysis ignores the impact of foreign exchange movements on our competitive position and potential changes in sales levels any change in the value of the contracts real or hypothetical would be significantly offset by an inverse change in the value of the underlying hedged items  

interest rate risk 

we are exposed to market risk from fluctuations in interest rates we manage our exposure to interest rate fluctuations through the use of interest rate swaps the objective of the swaps is to more effectively balance our borrowing costs and interest rate risk see note 10   debt  interest rate risk section for additional information 

commodity price risk 

we are exposed to fluctuations in commodity prices due to contractual agreements with component suppliers in order to protect ourselves against future price volatility and consequently fluctuations in gross margins we periodically enter into commodity zerocost collar contracts with designated banks to fix the cost of certain raw material purchases with the objective of minimizing changes in inventory cost due to market price fluctuations these commodity zerocost collar contracts represent an economic hedge but are not designated for hedge accounting and are marked to market through earnings our cash flow hedges generally mature within two years 

at december 31 2018 the potential gain or loss related to the outstanding commodity zerocost collar contracts assuming a hypothetical 10 percent fluctuation in the price of such commodities would be approximately 2 million  the sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in commodity prices assumes the notional value to remain constant for the next 12 months the analysis ignores the impact of commodity price movements on our competitive position and potential changes in sales levels any change in the value of the zerocost collar contracts real or hypothetical would be significantly offset by an inverse change in the value of the underlying hedged items 

we also limit our exposure to commodity price risk by entering into purchasing arrangements to fix the price of certain volumes of platinum and palladium expected to be used in our products we enter into physical forward contracts with suppliers of platinum and palladium to purchase some volumes of the commodities at contractually stated prices for various periods generally less than two years these arrangements enable us to fix the prices of a portion of our purchases of these commodities which otherwise are subject to market volatility

joint ventures alliances and nonwhollyowned subsidiaries 

we have entered into a number of joint venture agreements and alliances with business partners around the world our joint ventures are either distribution or manufacturing entities we also own controlling interests in nonwhollyowned manufacturing and distribution subsidiaries 

in the event of a change of control of either party to certain of these joint ventures and other strategic alliances certain consequences may result including automatic termination and liquidation of the venture exercise of put or call rights of ownership by the nonacquired partner termination or transfer of technology license rights to the nonacquired partner and increases in component transfer prices to the acquired partner we will continue to evaluate joint venture and partnership opportunities in order to penetrate new markets develop new products and generate manufacturing and operational efficiencies 

financial information about our investments in joint ventures and alliances is incorporated by reference from note 3   investments in equity investees  to the consolidated financial statements 

our equity income from these investees was as follows 



 

1 us tax legislation passed in december 2017 decreased our equity earnings at certain equity investees including a 7 million unfavorable impact to cummins westport inc due to the remeasurement of deferred taxes and a 32 million unfavorable impact to all other manufacturers due to withholding tax adjustments on foreign earnings see note 2   income taxes  to our consolidated financial statements for additional information  

2 this total represents our share of net income of our equity investees and is exclusive of royalties and interest income from our equity investees to see how this amount reconciles to equity royalty and interest income from investees in the consolidated statements of income  see note 3   investments in equity investees  to our consolidated financial statements for additional information  

  

distribution entities 



 see further discussion of our distribution network under the distribution segment section above 

manufacturing entities 

our manufacturing joint ventures have generally been formed with customers and generally are intended to allow us to increase our market penetration in geographic regions reduce capital spending streamline our supply chain management and develop technologies our largest manufacturing joint ventures are based in china and are included in the list below our engine manufacturing joint ventures are supplied by our components segment in the same manner as it supplies our whollyowned engine segment and power systems segment manufacturing facilities our components segment joint ventures and wholly owned entities provide fuel systems filtration aftertreatment systems turbocharger products and transmissions that are used with our engines as well as some competitors products the results and investments in our joint ventures in which we have 50 percent or less ownership interest are included in “equity royalty and interest income from investees” and “investments and advances related to equity method investees” in our consolidated statements of income and consolidated balance sheets  respectively 

 nonwhollyowned subsidiary 

we have a controlling interest in cummins india ltd cil which is a publicly listed company on various stock exchanges in india cil produces midrange heavyduty and highhorsepower diesel engines generators for the indian and export markets and natural gas sparkignited engines for power generation automotive and industrial applications cil also has distribution and power generation operations 

in the third quarter of 2017 we formed the eaton cummins automated transmission technologies joint venture  which was consolidated and included in our components segment as the automated transmissions business see note 18   acquisitions  to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

supply 

the performance of the endtoend supply chain extending through to our suppliers is foundational to our ability to meet customers expectations and support longterm growth we are committed to having a robust strategy for how we select and manage our suppliers to enable a market focused supply chain this requires us to continuously evaluate and upgrade our supply base as necessary to ensure we are meeting the needs of our customers 

we use a category strategy process a process designed to create the most value for the company that reviews our longterm needs and guides decisions on what we make internally and what we purchase externally for the items we decide to purchase externally the strategies also identify the suppliers we should partner with longterm to provide the best technology the lowest total cost and highest supply chain performance we design andor manufacture our strategic components used in or with our engines and power generation units including cylinder blocks and heads turbochargers connecting rods camshafts crankshafts filters alternators electronic and emissions controls and fuel systems we source externally purchased material and manufactured components from leading global suppliers many key suppliers are managed through longterm supply agreements that assure capacity delivery quality and cost requirements are met over an extended period approximately 20 percent of the direct material in our product designs are single sourced to external suppliers we have an established sourcing strategy and supplier management process to evaluate and mitigate risk these processes are leading us to determine our need for dual sourcing and increase our use of dual and parallel sources to minimize risk and increase supply chain responsiveness our current target for dual and parallel sourcing is approximately 90 percent of our direct material spend as of december 31 2017  our analysis indicates that we have approximately 80 percent of direct material spend with dual or parallel sources or 89 percent of our target 

other important elements of our sourcing strategy include 



patents and trademarks 

we own or control a significant number of patents and trademarks relating to the products we manufacture these patents and trademarks were granted and registered over a period of years although these patents and trademarks are generally considered beneficial to our operations we do not believe any patent group of patents or trademark other than our leading brand house trademarks is significant to our business 

seasonality 

while individual product lines may experience modest seasonal variation in production there is no material effect on the demand for the majority of our products on a quarterly basis with the exceptions that our power systems segment normally experiences seasonal declines in the first quarter due to general declines in construction spending during this period and our distribution segment normally experiences seasonal declines in its first quarter business activity due to holiday periods in asia and australia 

largest customers 

we have thousands of customers around the world and have developed longstanding business relationships with many of them paccar is our largest customer accounting for 14 percent of our consolidated net sales in 2017 13 percent in 2016 and 15 percent in 2015 we have longterm supply agreements with paccar for our heavyduty isx 15 liter and isx 119 liter engines and our midrange isl 9 liter engine while a significant number of our sales to paccar are under longterm supply agreements these agreements provide for particular engine requirements for specific vehicle models and not a specific volume of engines paccar is our only customer accounting for more than 10 percent of our net sales in 2017 the loss of this customer or a significant decline in the production level of paccar vehicles that use our engines would have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition we have been an engine supplier to paccar for 73 years a summary of principal customers for each operating segment is included in our segment discussion 

in addition to our agreement with paccar we have longterm heavyduty engine supply agreements with daimler and navistar and a longterm midrange supply agreement with daimler we also have an agreement with fiat chrysler to supply engines for its ram trucks collectively our net sales to these four customers including paccar were 33 percent of our consolidated net sales in 2017  33 percent in 2016 and 36 percent in 2015 excluding paccar net sales to any single 

customer were less than 7 percent of our consolidated net sales in 2017  less than 7 percent in 2016 and less than 9 percent in 2015 these agreements contain standard purchase and sale agreement terms covering engine and engine parts pricing quality and delivery commitments as well as engineering product support obligations the basic nature of our agreements with oem customers is that they are longterm price and operations agreements that help assure the availability of our products to each customer through the duration of the respective agreements agreements with most oems contain bilateral termination provisions giving either party the right to terminate in the event of a material breach change of control or insolvency or bankruptcy of the other party 

backlog 

we have supply agreements with some truck and offhighway equipment oems however most of our business is transacted through open purchase orders these open orders are historically subject to monthtomonth releases and are subject to cancellation on reasonable notice without cancellation charges and therefore are not considered firm at december 31 2017  we did not have any significant backlogs 

research and development 

in 2017  we continued to invest in future critical technologies and products we will continue to make investments to improve our current technologies meet the future emission requirements around the world and improve fuel economy 

our research and development program is focused on product improvements product extensions innovations and cost reductions for our customers research and development expenditures include salaries contractor fees building costs utilities testing technical it administrative expenses and allocation of corporate costs and are expensed net of contract reimbursements when incurred from time to time we enter into agreements with customers and government agencies to fund a portion of the research and development costs of a particular project we generally account for these reimbursements as an offset to the related research and development expenditure research and development expenses net of contract reimbursements were 734 million in 2017 616 million in 2016 and 718 million in 2015 contract reimbursements were 137 million in 2017 131 million in 2016 and 98 million in 2015 

for 2017  2016 and 2015  approximately 10 million  77 million and 90 million  or 1 percent  13 percent and 13 percent  respectively of our research and development expenditures were directly related to compliance with 2017 us environmental protection agency epa emission standards  

environmental sustainability 

we adopted our comprehensive environmental sustainability plan in 2014 after examining our entire environmental footprint focusing on the key areas of water waste energy and greenhouse gases ghg as the concept and scope of environmental sustainability has matured and broadened leaders have moved from initially working on environmental impacts within our direct control in our operations to an expanded view of fuel and raw materials that reaches across the entire product lifecycle from design to manufacture to end of life our environmental sustainability plan is the way we carry out our priorities goals and initiatives in our action areas including reducing our carbon footprint using fewer natural resources and partnering to solve complex problems 

our sustainability report for 20162017 including goal progress and prior reports as well as a data book of more detailed environmental data in accordance with the global reporting initiatives standard core compliance designation are available on our website at wwwcumminscom  although such reports and data book are not incorporated into this form 10k we currently have the following environmental sustainability goals and commitments 



 we continue to articulate our positions on key public policy issues and on a wide range of environmental issues we are actively engaged with regulatory industry and other stakeholder groups around the world as ghg and fuel efficiency standards become more prevalent globally we were named in the top 25 in newsweeks 2017 green ranking of us companies while also being named best in industry in the machinery category for us companies as well as named to the dow jones north american sustainability index for the twelfth consecutive year in 2017 and rated aaa by msci esg research included in the “disclosure leadership index” of the carbon disclosure project’s climate report in 2015

we strive to have robust certification and compliance processes adhering to all emissions regulations worldwide including prohibiting the use of defeat devices in all of our products we are transparent with all governing bodies in these processes from disclosure of the design and operation of the emission control system to test processes and results and later to any necessary reporting and corrective action processes if required 

we work collaboratively and proactively with emission regulators globally to ensure emission standards are clear appropriately stringent and enforceable in an effort to ensure our products deliver on our commitments to our customers and the environment in real world use every day 

our engines are subject to extensive statutory and regulatory requirements that directly or indirectly impose standards governing emission and noise over the past several years we have substantially increased our global environmental compliance presence and expertise to understand and meet emerging product environmental regulations around the world our ability to comply with these and future emission standards is an essential element in maintaining our leadership position in regulated markets we have made and will continue to make significant capital and research expenditures to comply with these standards our failure to comply with these standards could result in adverse effects on our future financial results 

eu and epa engine certifications 

the current onhighway nox and pm emission standards came into effect in the european union eu on january 1 2013 euro vi and on january 1 2010 for the epa to meet the more stringent heavyduty onhighway emission standards we used an evolution of our proven selective catalytic reduction scr and exhaust gas recirculation egr technology solutions and refined them for the eu and epa certified engines to maintain power and torque with substantial fuel economy improvement and maintenance intervals comparable with our previous compliant engines we offer a complete lineup of onhighway engines to meet the nearzero emission standards midrange and heavyduty engines for eu and epa require nox aftertreatment nox reduction is achieved by an integrated technology solution comprised of the xpi high pressure common rail fuel system scr technology nextgeneration cooled egr advanced electronic controls proven air handling and the cummins diesel particulate filter dpf the eu epa and california air resources board carb have certified that our engines meet the current emission requirements emission standards in international markets including japan mexico australia brazil russia india and china are becoming more stringent we believe that our experience in meeting the eu and epa emission standards leaves us well positioned to take advantage of opportunities in these markets as the need for emission control capability grows 

in 2013 we certified to epas first ever ghg regulations for onhighway medium and heavyduty engines additionally the epa 2013 regulations added the requirement of onboard diagnostics which were introduced on the isx15 in 2010 across the full onhighway product line while maintaining the same nearzero emission levels of nox and particulate matter required in 2010 onboard diagnostics provide enhanced service capability with standardized diagnostic trouble codes service tool interface incab warning lamp and service information availability the new ghg and fuelefficiency regulations were required for all heavyduty diesel and natural gas engines beginning in january 2014 our ghg certification was the first engine certificate issued by the epa and uses the same proven base engine with the xpi fuel system variable geometry turbocharger vgt tm  and cummins aftertreatment system with dpf and scr technology application of these engines and aftertreatment technologies continues in our products that comply with the 2017 ghg regulations 

the current offhighway emission standards for epa and eu came into effect between the 2013  2015 time frame for all power categories these engines were designed for tier 4  stage 4 standards and were based on our extensive onhighway experience developing scr high pressure fuel systems dpf and vgt tm  our products offer low fuel consumption high torque rise and power output extended maintenance intervals reliable and durable operation and a long life to overhaul period all while 

meeting the most stringent emission standards in the industrial market our offhighway products power multiple applications including construction mining marine agriculture rail defense and oil and gas and serves a global customer base 

other environmental statutes and regulations 

expenditures for environmental control activities and environmental remediation projects at our facilities in the us have not been a substantial portion of our annual expenses and are not expected to be material in 2018  we believe we are in compliance in all material respects with laws and regulations applicable to our plants and operations 

in the us pursuant to notices received from federal and state agencies andor defendant parties in site environmental contribution actions we have been identified as a potentially responsible party under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of 1980 as amended or similar state laws at fewer than 20 waste disposal sites 

based upon our experiences at similar sites we believe that our aggregate future remediation costs will not be material we have established accruals that we believe are adequate for our expected future liability with respect to these sites in addition we have several other sites where we are working with governmental authorities on remediation projects the costs for these remediation projects are not expected to be material 

employees 

at december 31 2017 we employed approximately 58600 persons worldwide approximately 20830 of our employees worldwide are represented by various unions under collective bargaining agreements that expire between 2018 and 2022

 item 1a risk factors 

set forth below and elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k are some of the principal risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual business results to differ materially from any forwardlooking statements contained in this report and could individually or in combination have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows these risk factors should be considered in addition to our cautionary comments concerning forwardlooking statements in this report including statements related to markets for our products and trends in our business that involve a number of risks and uncertainties our separate section above cautionary statements regarding forwardlooking information should be considered in addition to the following statements 

a sustained slowdown or significant downturn in our markets could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial condition or cash flows 

many of our on and offhighway markets are cyclical in nature and experience volatility in demand throughout these cycles although in 2017 we experienced demand growth in most of our north american and chinese onhighway markets and certain offhighway markets as well as growth in many of our international markets if the north american or chinese markets suffer a significant downturn or if a slower pace of economic growth and weaker demand in our other significant international markets were to occur depending upon the length duration and severity of the slowdown our results of operations financial condition or cash flows would likely be materially adversely affected 

our truck manufacturers and oem customers may discontinue outsourcing their engine supply needs 

several of our engine customers including paccar volvo  navistar fiat chrysler daimler and dongfeng are truck manufacturers or oems that manufacture engines for some of their own vehicles despite their own engine manufacturing abilities these customers have historically chosen to outsource certain types of engine production to us due to the quality of our engine products our emission compliance capabilities our systems integration their customers preferences their desire for cost reductions their desire for eliminating production risks and their desire to maintain company focus however there can be no assurance that these customers will continue to outsource or outsource as much of their engine production in the future in fact several of these customers have expressed their intention to significantly increase their own engine production and to decrease engine purchases from us in addition increased levels of oem vertical integration could result from a number of factors such as shifts in our customers business strategies acquisition by a customer of another engine manufacturer the inability of thirdparty suppliers to meet product specifications and the emergence of lowcost production opportunities in foreign countries any significant reduction in the level of engine production outsourcing from our truck manufacturer or oem customers could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

the development of new technologies may materially reduce the demand for our current products and services 

we are investing in new products and technologies including electrified powertrains for planned introduction into certain existing and new markets given the early stages of development of some of these new products and technologies there can be no guarantee of the future market acceptance and investment returns with respect to these planned products the increased adoption of electrified powertrains in some market segments could result in lower demand for current diesel or natural gas engines and components and over time reduce the demand for related parts and service revenues from diesel or natural gas powertrains furthermore it is possible that we may not be successful in developing segmentleading electrified powertrains and some of our existing customers could choose to develop their own electrified or alternate fuel powertrains or source from other manufacturers and any of these factors could materially adversely impact our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

the discovery of any significant additional problems with our engine platforms or aftertreatment systems in north america could further materially adversely impact our results of operations financial condition or cash flows 

during 2017 the carb and us epa selected certain of our pre2013 model year engine systems for additional emissions testing some of these engine systems failed carb and epas tests as a result of degradation of an aftertreatment component we have not been issued an official notice from the carb or epa regarding these particular engine systems we are working with the agencies and will meet with them beginning in the first quarter of 2018 to develop a resolution of these matters we are developing and testing a variety of solutions to address the technical issues which could include a combination of calibration changes service practices and hardware changes 

in addition we continue to evaluate other engine systems for model years 2010 through 2015 that could potentially be subject to similar aftertreatment component degradation issues at the close of 2017 we had not yet determined the impact to other model years or engine systems or the percentage of the engine system populations that could be affected 

since there are many unresolved variables with respect to these degradation issues we are not yet able to estimate the financial impact of these matters it is possible that they could have a material impact on our results of operations in the periods in which these degradation issues are resolved and a solution is determined 

our products are subject to recall for performance or safetyrelated issues 

our products may be subject to recall for performance or safetyrelated issues product recalls subject us to harm to our reputation loss of current and future customers reduced revenue and product recall costs product recall costs are incurred when we decide either voluntarily or involuntarily to recall a product through a formal campaign to solicit the return of specific products due to a known or suspected performance issue any significant product recalls could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows see note 12   commitments and contingencies  to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

lowerthananticipated market acceptance of our new or existing products or services including reductions in demand for diesel engines could materially adversely impact our results of operations financial condition or cash flows 

although we conduct market research before launching new or refreshed engines and introducing new services many factors both within and outside our control affect the success of new or existing products and services in the marketplace offering engines and services that customers desire and value can mitigate the risks of increasing price competition and declining demand but products and services that are perceived to be less than desirable whether in terms of price quality overall value fuel efficiency or other attributes can exacerbate these risks with increased consumer interconnectedness through the internet social media and other media mere allegations relating to poor quality safety fuel efficiency corporate responsibility or other key attributes can negatively impact our reputation or market acceptance of our products or services even if such allegations prove to be inaccurate or unfounded 

a slowdown in infrastructure development andor depressed commodity prices could adversely affect our business 

infrastructure development and strong commodity prices have been significant drivers of our historical growth but as the pace of investment in infrastructure slowed in recent years especially in china and brazil commodity prices were significantly lower and demand for our products in offhighway markets was weak weakness in commodities such as oil gas and coal adversely impacted mining industry participants’ demand for vehicles and equipment that contain our engines and other products over the past several years although many of our offhighway markets began to recover in 2017 additional deterioration or renewed weakness in infrastructure and commodities markets could adversely affect our customers’ demand for vehicles and equipment and could adversely affect our business 

unpredictability in the adoption implementation and enforcement of increasingly stringent emission standards by multiple jurisdictions around the world could adversely affect our business 

our engines are subject to extensive statutory and regulatory requirements governing emission and noise including standards imposed by the epa the eu state regulatory agencies such as the carb and other regulatory agencies around the world we have made and will be required to continue to make significant capital and research expenditures to ensure our engines comply with these emission standards developing engines and components to meet numerous changing government regulatory requirements with different implementation timelines and emission requirements makes developing engines efficiently for multiple markets complicated and could result in substantial additional costs that may be difficult to recover in certain markets in some cases we are required to develop new products to comply with new regulations particularly those relating to air emissions while we have met previous deadlines our ability to comply with other existing and future regulatory standards will be essential for us to maintain our competitive advantage in the engine markets we serve the successful development and introduction of new and enhanced products in order to comply with new regulatory requirements are subject to other risks such as delays in product development cost overruns and unanticipated technical and manufacturing difficulties in addition to these risks the nature and timing of government implementation and enforcement of increasingly stringent emission standards in emerging markets are unpredictable and subject to change any delays in implementation or enforcement could result in the products we developed or modified to comply with these standards becoming unnecessary or becoming necessary later than expected thereby in some cases negating our competitive advantage this in turn can delay diminish or eliminate the expected return on capital and research expenditures that we have invested in such products and may adversely affect our perceived competitive advantage in being an early advanced developer of compliant engines 

we derive significant earnings from investees that we do not directly control with more than 50 percent of these earnings from our chinabased investees 

for 2017 we recognized 357 million of equity royalty and interest income from investees compared to 301 million in 2016 more than half of our equity royalty and interest income from investees is from three of our 50 percent owned joint ventures in 

china  beijing foton cummins engine co ltd dongfeng cummins engine company ltd and chongqing cummins engine company ltd as a result although a significant percentage of our net income is derived from these unconsolidated entities we do not unilaterally control their management or their operations which puts a substantial portion of our net income at risk from the actions or inactions of these entities a significant reduction in the level of contribution by these entities to our net income would likely have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows 

the adoption of new tax legislation changes in our provisional estimates or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could adversely affect our profitability 

on december 22 2017 the us enacted the tax cuts and jobs act tax legislation  the estimated effects based upon current interpretation of the tax legislation have been incorporated into our financial results as additional data is prepared and analyzed and as additional clarification and implementation guidance is issued on the new tax law it may be necessary to adjust the provisional amounts any adjustments could have a material impact on provisional amounts in addition there is a risk that states or foreign jurisdictions may amend their tax laws in response to the tax legislation which could have a material impact on our future results 

we are subject to income taxes in the us and numerous international jurisdictions our income tax provision and cash tax liability in the future could be adversely affected by changes in earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities changes in tax laws and the discovery of new information in the course of our tax return preparation process the carrying value of deferred tax assets which are predominantly in the us is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income in the us we are also subject to ongoing tax audits these audits can involve complex issues which may require an extended period of time to resolve and can be highly judgmental tax authorities may disagree with certain tax reporting positions taken by us and as a result assess additional taxes against us we regularly assess the likely outcomes of these audits in order to determine the appropriateness of our tax provision the amounts ultimately paid upon resolution of these or subsequent tax audits could be materially different from the amounts previously included in our income tax provision and therefore could have a material impact on our tax provision 

we are exposed to and may be adversely affected by potential security breaches or other disruptions to our information technology systems and data security 

we rely on the capacity reliability and security of our information technology systems and data security infrastructure in connection with various aspects of our business activities we also rely on our ability to expand and continually update these systems and related infrastructure in response to the changing needs of our business as we implement new systems they may not perform as expected we also face the challenge of supporting our older systems and implementing necessary upgrades in addition some of these systems are managed by third party service providers and are not under our direct control if we experience a problem with an important information technology system including during system upgrades andor new system implementations the resulting disruptions could have an adverse effect on our business and reputation as customers adopt and rely on the cloudbased digital technologies and services we offer any disruption of the confidentiality integrity or availability of those services could have an adverse effect on our business and reputation 

the data handled by our information technology systems is vulnerable to security threats our operations routinely involve receiving storing processing and transmitting sensitive information pertaining to our business customers dealers suppliers employees and other sensitive matters information technology security threats such as security breaches computer malware and other cyber attacks which are increasing in both frequency and sophistication could result in unauthorized disclosures of information and create financial liability subject us to legal or regulatory sanctions or damage our reputation with customers dealers suppliers and other stakeholders we continuously seek to maintain a robust program of information security and controls but the impact of a material information technology event could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position reputation results of operations financial condition and cash flow 

financial distress or a changeincontrol of one of our large truck oem customers could materially adversely impact our results of operations 

we recognize significant sales of engines and components to a few large onhighway truck oem customers in north america which have been an integral part of our positive business results for several years if one of our large truck oem customers experiences financial distress bankruptcy or a changeincontrol such circumstance could likely lead to significant reductions in our revenues and earnings commercial disputes receivable collection issues and other negative consequences that could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

our plan to reposition our portfolio of product offerings through exploring strategic acquisitions and divestitures may expose us to additional costs and risks 

part of our strategic plan is to improve our gross margins and earnings by exploring the repositioning of our portfolio of product line offerings through the pursuit of potential strategic acquisitions andor divestitures to provide future strategic financial and operational benefits and improve shareholder value there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify suitable candidates or consummate these transactions on favorable terms the successful identification and completion of any strategic transaction depends on a number of factors that are not entirely within our control including the availability of suitable candidates and our ability to negotiate terms acceptable to all parties involved conclude satisfactory agreements and obtain all necessary regulatory approvals accordingly we may not be able to successfully negotiate and complete specific transactions the exploration negotiation and consummation of strategic transactions may involve significant expenditures by us which may adversely affect our results of operations at the time such expenses are incurred and may divert management’s attention from our existing business strategic transactions also may have adverse effects on our existing business relationships with suppliers and customers if required the financing for strategic acquisitions could result in an increase in our indebtedness dilute the interests of our shareholders or both any acquisition may not be accretive to us for a significant period of time following the completion of such acquisition also our ability to effectively integrate any potential acquisition into our existing business and culture may not be successful which could jeopardize future financial and operational performance for the combined businesses in addition if an acquisition results in any additional goodwill or increase in other intangible assets on our balance sheet and subsequently becomes impaired we would be required to record a noncash impairment charge which could result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations similarly any strategic divestiture of a product line or business may reduce our revenue and earnings reduce the diversity of our business result in substantial costs and expenses and cause disruption to our employees customers vendors and communities in which we operate 

we are vulnerable to supply shortages from singlesourced suppliers 

during 2017 we single sourced approximately 20 percent of the total types of parts in our product designs compared to approximately 56 percent in 2016 any delay in our suppliers deliveries may adversely affect our operations at multiple manufacturing locations forcing us to seek alternative supply sources to avoid serious disruptions delays may be caused by factors affecting our suppliers including capacity constraints labor disputes economic downturns availability of credit the impaired financial condition of a particular supplier suppliers allocations to other purchasers weather emergencies natural disasters or acts of war or terrorism any extended delay in receiving critical supplies could impair our ability to deliver products to our customers and our results of operations 

we face significant competition in the markets we serve 

the markets in which we operate are highly competitive we compete worldwide with a number of other manufacturers and distributors that produce and sell similar products we primarily compete in the market with diesel engines and related diesel products however new technologies continue to be developed for gasoline natural gas electrification and other technologies and we will continue to face new competition from these expanding technologies our products primarily compete on the basis of price performance fuel economy speed of delivery quality and customer support we also face competitors in some emerging markets who have established local practices and long standing relationships with participants in these markets there can be no assurance that our products will be able to compete successfully with the products of other companies and in other markets 

increasing global competition among our customers may affect our existing customer relationships and restrict our ability to benefit from some of our customers growth 

as our customers in emerging markets continue to grow in size and scope they are increasingly seeking to export their products to other countries this has meant greater demand for our advanced engine technologies to help these customers meet the more stringent emissions requirements of developed markets as well as greater demand for access to our distribution systems for purposes of equipment servicing as these emerging market customers enter into and begin to compete in more developed markets they may increasingly begin to compete with our existing customers in these markets our further aid to emerging market customers could adversely affect our relationships with developed market customers in addition to the extent the competition does not correspond to overall growth in demand we may see little or no benefit from this type of expansion by our emerging market customers 

policy changes affecting international trade could adversely impact the demand for our products and our competitive position 

changes in government policies on foreign trade and investment can affect the demand for our products and services impact the competitive position of our products or prevent us from being able to sell products in certain countries our business benefits from free trade agreements such as the north american free trade agreement and efforts to withdraw from or substantially modify such agreements in addition to the implementation of more restrictive trade policies such as more detailed inspections higher tariffs import or export licensing requirements exchange controls or new barriers to entry could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition or cash flows additionally the results of the united kingdom’s referendum on eu membership   advising for the exit from the eu has caused and may continue to cause significant volatility in global stock markets currency exchange rate fluctuations and global economic uncertainty although it is unknown what the terms of the united kingdom’s future relationship with the eu will be it is possible that there will be greater restrictions on imports and exports between the united kingdom and eu and increased regulatory complexities any of these factors could adversely impact customer demand our relationships with customers and suppliers and our results of operations 

we are subject to foreign currency exchange rate and other related risks 

we conduct operations in many areas of the world involving transactions denominated in a variety of currencies we are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk to the extent that our costs are denominated in currencies other than those in which we earn revenues in addition since our financial statements are denominated in us dollars changes in foreign currency exchange rates between the us dollar and other currencies have had and will continue to have an impact on our results of operations although the us dollar weakened in 2017 the us dollar strengthened in recent years through 2016 and resulted in material unfavorable impacts on our revenues in those years if the us dollar returns to strengthening against other currencies we will experience additional volatility in our financial statements while we customarily enter into financial transactions that attempt to address these risks and many of our supply agreements with customers include foreign currency exchange rate adjustment provisions there can be no assurance that foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations will not adversely affect our future results of operations in addition while the use of currency hedging instruments may provide us with some protection from adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates by utilizing these instruments we potentially forego the benefits that might result from favorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates we also face risks arising from the imposition of foreign exchange controls and currency devaluations foreign exchange controls may limit our ability to convert foreign currencies into us dollars or to remit dividends and other payments by our foreign subsidiaries or businesses located in or conducted within a country imposing controls currency devaluations result in a diminished value of funds denominated in the currency of the country instituting the devaluation see managements discussion and analysis for additional information 

our products are exposed to variability in material and commodity costs 

our businesses establish prices with our customers in accordance with contractual time frames however the timing of material and commodity market price increases may prevent us from passing these additional costs on to our customers through timely pricing actions additionally higher material and commodity costs around the world may offset our efforts to reduce our cost structure while we customarily enter into financial transactions and contractual pricing adjustment provisions with our customers that attempt to address some of these risks notably with respect to copper platinum and palladium there can be no assurance that commodity price fluctuations will not adversely affect our results of operations in addition while the use of commodity price hedging instruments and contractual pricing adjustments may provide us with some protection from adverse fluctuations in commodity prices by utilizing these instruments we potentially forego the benefits that might result from favorable fluctuations in price as a result higher material and commodity costs as well as hedging these commodity costs during periods of decreasing prices could result in declining margins 

we may fail to realize all of the expected enhanced revenue earnings and cash flow from our investment in the eaton cummins automated transmission technologies joint venture 

our ability to realize all of the expected enhanced revenue earnings and cash flow from our recent investment in the eaton cummins automated transmission technologies joint venture will depend in substantial part on our ability to successfully launch the automated transmission products in north america and achieve our projected market penetration while we believe 

we will ultimately achieve these objectives it is possible that we will be unable to achieve all of the goals within our anticipated time frame or in the anticipated amounts if we are not able to successfully complete our automated transmission strategy the anticipated enhanced revenue earnings and cash flows resulting from this joint venture may not be realized fully or may take longer to realize than expected as part of the purchase accounting associated with the formation of the joint venture significant goodwill and intangible asset balances were recorded on the consolidated balance sheet if cash flows from the joint venture fall short of our anticipated amounts these assets could be subject to impairment charges negatively impacting our earnings 

we are exposed to political economic and other risks that arise from operating a multinational business 

our business is subject to the political economic and other risks that are inherent in operating in numerous countries these risks include 

 as we continue to operate our business globally our success will depend in part on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these and other related risks there can be no assurance that the consequences of these and other factors relating to our multinational operations will not have a material adverse effect upon us 

our global operations are subject to laws and regulations that impose significant compliance costs and create reputational and legal risk 

due to the international scope of our operations we are subject to a complex system of commercial and trade regulations around the world recent years have seen an increase in the development and enforcement of laws regarding trade compliance and anticorruption such as the us foreign corrupt practices act and similar laws from other countries as well as new regulatory requirements regarding data privacy such as the european union general data protection regulation our numerous foreign subsidiaries affiliates and joint venture partners are governed by laws rules and business practices that differ from those of the us the activities of these entities may not comply with us laws or business practices or our code of business conduct violations of these laws may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions could disrupt our business and result in an adverse effect on our reputation business and results of operations or financial condition we cannot predict the nature scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our operations might be subject or the manner in which existing laws might be administered or interpreted 

we face the challenge of accurately aligning our capacity with our demand 

we can experience idle capacity as economies slow or demand for certain products decline accurately forecasting our expected volumes and appropriately adjusting our capacity have been and will continue to be important factors in determining our results of operations if we overestimate our demand and overbuild our capacity we may have significantly underutilized assets and we may experience reduced margins if we do not accurately align our manufacturing capabilities with demand it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

our business is exposed to potential product liability claims 

we face an inherent business risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that our products failure to perform to specification results or is alleged to result in property damage bodily injury andor death at any given time we are subject to various and multiple product liability claims any one of which if decided adversely to us may have a material adverse effect on our reported results of operation in the period in which our liability with respect to any such claim is recognized while we maintain insurance coverage with respect to certain product liability claims we may not be able to obtain such insurance on acceptable terms in the future if at all and any such insurance may not provide adequate coverage against product liability claims in addition product liability claims can be expensive to defend and can divert the attention of management and other personnel for significant periods of time regardless of the ultimate outcome furthermore even if we are successful in 

defending against a claim relating to our products claims of this nature could cause our customers to lose confidence in our products and us 

our operations are subject to increasingly stringent environmental laws and regulations 

our plants and operations are subject to increasingly stringent environmental laws and regulations in all of the countries in which we operate including laws and regulations governing air emission discharges to water and the generation handling storage transportation treatment and disposal of waste materials while we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with these environmental laws and regulations there can be no assurance that we will not be adversely impacted by costs liabilities or claims with respect to existing or subsequently acquired operations under either present laws and regulations or those that may be adopted or imposed in the future we are also subject to laws requiring the cleanup of contaminated property if a release of hazardous substances occurs at or from any of our current or former properties or at a landfill or another location where we have disposed of hazardous materials we may be held liable for the contamination and the amount of such liability could be material 

future bans or limitations on the use of dieselpowered vehicles in an effort to limit greenhouse gas emissions could materially adversely affect our business over the long term 

in an effort to limit greenhouse gas emissions mayors of several large international cities announced that they plan to implement a ban on the use in their cities of dieselpowered vehicles by 2025 these cities include athens madrid mexico city and paris similarly germany adopted legislation to ban new internal combustion engine vehicles by 2030 and china is considering a ban on the production and sale of dieselpowered vehicles to be adopted in the near future in addition california government officials have called for the state to phase out sales of dieselpowered vehicles by 2040 to the extent that these types of bans are actually implemented in the future on a broad basis or in one or more of our key markets our business over the longterm could be materially adversely affected 

we are exposed to risks arising from the price and availability of energy 

the level of demand for our products and services is influenced in multiple ways by the price and availability of energy high energy costs generally drive greater demand for better fuel economy in almost all countries in which we operate some of our engine products have been developed with a primary purpose of offering fuel economy improvements and if energy costs decrease or increase less than expected demand for these products may likewise decrease the relative unavailability of electricity in some emerging market countries also influences demand for our electricity generating products such as our diesel generators if these countries add energy capacity by expanding their power grids at a rate equal to or faster than the growth in demand for energy the demand for our generating products could also decrease or increase less than would otherwise be the case 

significant declines in future financial and stock market conditions could diminish our pension plan asset performance and adversely impact our results of operations financial condition and cash flow 

we sponsor both funded and unfunded domestic and foreign defined benefit pension and other retirement plans our pension cost and the required contributions to our pension plans are directly affected by the value of plan assets the projected and actual rates of return on plan assets and the actuarial assumptions we use to measure our defined benefit pension plan obligations including the discount rate at which future projected and accumulated pension obligations are discounted to a present value we could experience increased pension cost due to a combination of factors including the decreased investment performance of pension plan assets decreases in the discount rate and changes in our assumptions relating to the expected return on plan assets significant declines in future financial and stock market conditions could cause material losses in our pension plan assets which could result in increased pension cost in future years and adversely impact our results of operations financial condition and cash flow depending upon the severity of market declines and government regulatory changes we may be legally obligated to make pension payments in the us and perhaps other countries and these contributions could be material 

we may be adversely impacted by work stoppages and other labor matters 

at december 31 2017 we employed approximately 58600 persons worldwide approximately 20830 of our employees worldwide are represented by various unions under collective bargaining agreements that expire between 2018 and 2022 while we have no reason to believe that we will be materially impacted by work stoppages or other labor matters there can be no assurance that future issues with our labor unions will be resolved favorably or that we will not encounter future strikes work stoppages or other types of conflicts with labor unions or our employees any of these consequences may have an adverse effect on us or may limit our flexibility in dealing with our workforce in addition many of our customers and suppliers have 

unionized work forces work stoppages or slowdowns experienced by our customers or suppliers could result in slowdowns or closures that would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flow 

our financial statements are subject to changes in accounting standards that could adversely impact our profitability or financial position 

our financial statements are subject to the application of generally accepted accounting principles gaap in the united states of america which are periodically revised andor expanded accordingly from time to time we are required to adopt new or revised accounting standards issued by recognized authoritative bodies including the financial accounting standards board recently accounting standard setters issued new guidance which further interprets or seeks to revise accounting pronouncements related to revenue recognition and lease accounting as well as to issue new standards expanding disclosures the impact of accounting pronouncements that have been issued but not yet implemented is disclosed in our annual and quarterly reports on form 10k and form 10q an assessment of proposed standards is not provided as such proposals are subject to change through the exposure process and therefore their effects on our financial statements cannot be meaningfully assessed it is possible that future accounting standards we are required to adopt could change the current accounting treatment that we apply to our consolidated financial statements and that such changes could have a material adverse effect on our reported results of operations and financial position

our financial performance depends in large part on varying conditions in the markets we serve particularly the onhighway construction and general industrial markets demand in these markets tends to fluctuate in response to overall economic conditions our sales may also be impacted by oem inventory levels production schedules and stoppages economic downturns in markets we serve generally result in reduced sales of our products and can result in price reductions in certain products andor markets as a worldwide business our operations are also affected by currency political economic and regulatory matters including adoption and enforcement of environmental and emission standards in the countries we serve as part of our growth strategy we invest in businesses in certain countries that carry high levels of these risks such as china brazil india mexico russia and countries in the middle east and africa at the same time our geographic diversity and broad product and service offerings have helped limit the impact from a drop in demand in any one industry or customer or the economy of any single country on our consolidated results 

worldwide revenues improved 17 percent in 2017 compared to 2016  with all operating segments reporting higher revenue revenue in the us and canada improved by 15 percent primarily due to increased demand in the north american onhighway markets increased industrial demand especially in oil and gas construction and mining markets and organic growth and higher sales related to the acquisition of a north american distributor in the fourth quarter of 2016 international demand growth excludes the us and canada in 2017 improved revenues by 19 percent with sales up in most of our markets 

especially in china russia india and the uk the increase in international sales was primarily due to increased demand in the truck market in china new emission regulations in india and increased demand in industrial markets especially construction markets in china and mining markets in europe 

on december 22 2017 the us enacted the tax cuts and jobs act tax legislation among other things the tax legislation changed the us statutory rate to 21 percent effective january 1 2018 the impact of the tax legislation resulted in a net incremental charge to our consolidated statements of income of 777 million  the components of the 2017 charge were as follows

liquidity and capital resources 

key working capital and balance sheet data 

we fund our working capital with cash from operations and shortterm borrowings including commercial paper when necessary various assets and liabilities including shortterm debt can fluctuate significantly from month to month depending on shortterm liquidity needs as a result working capital is a prime focus of management attention working capital and balance sheet measures are provided in the following table 



 

1 working capital includes cash and cash equivalents 

cash flows 

cash and cash equivalents were impacted as follows 



2017 vs 2016 

net cash provided by operating activities increase d 338 million versus 2016  primarily due to improved earnings of 358 million excluding the noncash impact of tax legislation of 820 million and lower working capital levels of 352 million partially offset by higher pension contributions of 109 million a decrease in deferred tax expense of 104 million lower loss contingency charges of 117 million and higher equity earnings of 77 million the lower working capital requirements in 2017 resulted in a cash inflow of 90 million compared to a cash outflow of 262 million in 2016 

net cash used in investing activities increase d 135 million versus 2016  primarily due to higher acquisitions of businesses net of cash acquired of 568 million and the absence of 60 million in proceeds from the sale of of equity investees in 2016 partially offset by lower net investments in marketable securities of 244 million higher cash flows from derivatives not designated as hedges of 178 million and higher proceeds from the disposal of property plant and equipment of 96 million 

net cash used in financing activities decrease d 339 million versus 2016  primarily due to lower repurchases of common stock of 327 million 

the effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents increased 298 million versus 2016  primarily due to the british pound which increased cash and cash equivalents 249 million 

2016 vs 2015 

net cash provided by operating activities decreased 126 million versus 2015 primarily due to the absence of the 2015 impairment of lightduty diesel assets of 211 million and a 123 million year over year impact related to restructuring partially offset by an increase in deferred income taxes of 158 million and higher loss contingency charges of 62 million resulting in lower cash net income in 2016 

net cash used in investing activities decreased 1 million versus 2015 primarily due to lower capital expenditures of 213 million and proceeds from the sale of equity investees of 60 million partially offset by higher net investments in marketable securities of 160 million and changes in cash flows from derivatives not designated as hedges of 110 million 

net cash used in financing activities decreased 237 million versus 2015 primarily due to higher net borrowings of commercial paper of 212 million lower common stock repurchases of 122 million and higher proceeds from borrowings of 67 million partially offset by higher acquisitions of noncontrolling interests of 88 million and higher payments on borrowings and capital lease obligations of 87 million 

the effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents decreased 113 million versus 2015 primarily due to the british pound which decreased cash and cash equivalents 112 million 

sources of liquidity 

we generate significant ongoing cash flow cash provided by operations is our principal source of liquidity with 23 billion provided in 2017  

at december 31 2017  our sources of liquidity included 



 

1 the majority of marketable securities could be liquidated into cash within a few days 

2 the fiveyear credit facility for 175 billion and the 364day credit facility for 10 billion maturing november 2020 and september 2018 respectively are maintained primarily to provide backup liquidity for our commercial paper borrowings and general corporate purposes at december 31 2017  we had 298 million of commercial paper outstanding which effectively reduced the 175 billion available capacity under our fiveyear revolving credit facility to 145 billion  

cash cash equivalents and marketable securities 

a significant portion of our cash flows is generated outside the us we manage our worldwide cash requirements considering available funds among the many subsidiaries through which we conduct our business and the cost effectiveness with which those funds can be accessed as a result we do not anticipate any local liquidity restrictions to preclude us from funding our operating needs with local resources 

the tax legislation made significant changes to us tax law including a onetime transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings of 298 million with a cash impact of 338 million  the payments associated with this deemed repatriation will be paid over eight years the unrepatriated foreign earnings at december 31 2017 will be repatriated as needed to fund cash needs the estimated accrued withholding taxes of 331 million on foreign earnings that we plan to repatriate in the foreseeable future will be paid as cash is repatriated  see note 2   income taxes  to our consolidated financial statements for additional information  

debt facilities and other sources of liquidity 

on november 13 2015 we entered into an amended and restated fiveyear revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of lenders which provides us with a 175 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility and expires on november 13 2020  on september 5 2017 we entered into a 364day credit facility that allows us to borrow up to 1 billion of additional unsecured funds at any time through september 2018 we have access to both credit facilities which total 275 billion of borrowing capacity we intend to maintain credit facilities of a similar aggregate amount by renewing or replacing these facilities before expiration revolving credit facilities are maintained primarily to provide backup liquidity for our commercial paper borrowings letters of credit and general corporate purposes 

we can issue up to 175 billion of unsecured shortterm promissory notes commercial paper pursuant to our board authorized commercial paper programs the programs facilitate the private placement of unsecured shortterm debt through third party brokers we intend to use the net proceeds from the commercial paper borrowings for general corporate purposes 

the total combined borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facility and commercial paper program should not exceed 275 billion see note 9   debt  to our consolidated financial statements for additional information 

as a wellknown seasoned issuer we filed an automatic shelf registration for an undetermined amount of debt and equity securities with the securities and exchange commission sec on february 16 2016 under this shelf registration we may offer from time to time debt securities common stock preferred and preference stock depositary shares warrants stock purchase contracts and stock purchase units 

uses of cash 

stock repurchases 

in december 2016 our board of directors authorized the acquisition of up to 1 billion of additional common stock upon completion of the 2015 repurchase plan in 2017  we made the following purchases under the 2015 repurchase program 



 

1 the remaining authorized capacity under the 2015 plan was calculated based on the cost to purchase the shares but excludes commission expenses in accordance with the authorized plan   

we intend to repurchase outstanding shares from time to time during 2018 to enhance shareholder value and to offset the dilutive impact of employee stock based compensation plans 

dividends 

total dividends paid to common shareholders in 2017  2016 and 2015 were 701 million  676 million and 622 million  respectively declaration and payment of dividends in the future depends upon our income and liquidity position among other factors and is subject to declaration by our board of directors who meet quarterly to consider our dividend payment we expect to fund dividend payments with cash from operations 

in july 2017 our board of directors authorized an increase to our quarterly dividend of 54 percent from 1025 per share to 108 per share in july 2016 our board of directors authorized an increase to our quarterly dividend of 51 percent from 0975 per share to 1025 per share in july 2015 our board of directors authorized an increase to our quarterly dividend of 25 percent from 078 per share to 0975 per share cash dividends per share paid to common shareholders for the last three years were as follows 



acquisitions 

on july 31 2017 we formed a joint venture with eaton corporation plc by purchasing a 50 percent interest in the new venture named eaton cummins automated transmission technologies ecjv for 600 million in cash in addition each partner contributed 20 million for working capital see note 18  acquisitions  to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

on november 1 2017 we acquired brammo inc an engineerer and manufacturer of lithium ion batteries primarily related to the utility vehicle markets for 68 million see note 18  acquisitions  to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

capital expenditures 

capital expenditures including spending on internal use software were 587 million in 2017  compared to 594 million in 2016  we continue to invest in new product lines and targeted capacity expansions we plan to spend between 730 million and 760 million in 2018 on capital expenditures as we continue with product launches and facility improvements approximately 50 percent of our capital expenditures are expected to be invested outside of the us in 2018 

pensions 

the funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon a variety of variables and assumptions including return on invested assets market interest rates and levels of voluntary contributions to the plans in 2017  the investment return on our us pension trust was 129 percent while our uk pension trust return was 44 percent approximately 77 percent of our pension plan assets are held in highly liquid investments such as fixed income and equity securities the remaining 23 percent of our plan assets are held in less liquid but market valued investments including real estate private equity venture capital opportunistic credit and insurance contracts 

we sponsor funded and unfunded domestic and foreign defined benefit pension plans contributions to these plans were as follows 

  

we anticipate making total contributions of approximately 38 million to our defined benefit pension plans in 2018  expected contributions to our defined benefit pension plans in 2018 will meet or exceed the current funding requirements 

current maturities of short and longterm debt 

we had 298 million of commercial paper outstanding at december 31 2017 that matures in less than one year the maturity schedule of our existing longterm debt does not require significant cash outflows in the intermediate term required annual principal payments range from 6 million to 63 million over the next five years see note 9  debt to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

credit ratings 

our ratings and outlook from each of the credit rating agencies as of the date of filing are shown in the table below 



 

1 credit ratings are not recommendations to buy are subject to change and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating in addition we undertake no obligation to update disclosures concerning our credit ratings whether as a result of new information future events or otherwise 

managements assessment of liquidity 

our financial condition and liquidity remain strong our solid balance sheet and credit ratings enable us to have ready access to credit and the capital markets we assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate adequate cash to fund our operating investing and financing activities we believe our operating cash flow and liquidity provides us with the financial flexibility needed to fund working capital common stock repurchases acquisitions capital expenditures dividend payments projected pension obligations and debt service obligations while we expect more efficient access to overseas earnings as a result of tax legislation we continue to generate cash from operations in the us and maintain access to our revolving credit facility as noted above 

contractual obligations and other commercial commitments 

a summary of our contractual obligations and other commercial commitments at december 31 2017  are as follows 



   

 the contractual obligations reported above exclude our unrecognized tax benefits of 41 million as of december 31 2017  we are not able to reasonably estimate the period in which cash outflows relating to uncertain tax contingencies could occur see note 2   income taxes  to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

application of critical accounting estimates 

a summary of our significant accounting policies is included in note 1   summary of significant accounting policies  of our consolidated financial statements which discusses accounting policies that we have selected from acceptable alternatives 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the us gaap which often requires management to make judgments estimates and assumptions regarding uncertainties that affect the reported amounts presented and disclosed in the financial statements management reviews these estimates and assumptions based on historical experience changes in business conditions and other relevant factors they believe to be reasonable under the circumstances in any given reporting period our actual results may differ from the estimates and assumptions used in preparing our consolidated financial statements 

critical accounting estimates are defined as follows the estimate requires management to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the estimate was made different estimates reasonably could have been used or if changes in the estimate are reasonably likely to occur from period to period and the change would have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations our senior management has discussed the development and selection of our accounting policies related accounting estimates and the disclosures set forth below with the audit committee of our board of directors we believe our critical accounting estimates include those addressing the estimation of liabilities for warranty programs accounting for income taxes and pension benefits 

warranty programs 

we estimate and record a liability for base warranty programs at the time our products are sold our estimates are based on historical experience and reflect managements best estimates of expected costs at the time products are sold and subsequent adjustment to those expected costs when actual costs differ as a result of the uncertainty surrounding the nature and frequency of product recall programs the liability for such programs is recorded when we commit to a recall action or when a recall becomes probable and estimable which generally occurs when it is announced our warranty liability is generally affected by component failure rates repair costs and the point of failure within the product life cycle future events and circumstances related to these factors could materially change our estimates and require adjustments to our liability new product launches require a greater use of judgment in developing estimates until historical experience becomes available product specific experience is typically available four or five quarters after product launch with a clear experience trend evident eight quarters after launch we generally record warranty expense for new products upon shipment using a preceding products warranty history and a multiplicative factor based upon preceding similar product experience and new product assessment until sufficient new product data is available for warranty estimation we then use a blend of actual new product experience and preceding product historical experience for several subsequent quarters and new product specific experience thereafter note 8   product warranty liability  to our consolidated financial statements contains a summary of the activity in our warranty liability account for 2017  2016 and 2015 including adjustments to preexisting warranties 

accounting for income taxes 

we determine our income tax expense using the asset and liability method under this method deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax effects of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases future tax benefits of net operating loss and credit carryforwards are also recognized as deferred tax assets we evaluate the recoverability of our deferred tax assets each quarter by assessing the likelihood of future profitability and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize our net deferred tax assets at december 31 2017  we recorded net deferred tax liabilities of 85 million  the assets included 359 million for the value of net operating loss and credit carryforwards a valuation allowance of 347 million was recorded to reduce the tax assets to the net value management believed was more likely than not to be realized in the event our operating performance deteriorates future assessments could conclude that a larger valuation allowance will be needed to further reduce the deferred tax assets 

on december 22 2017 the us enacted the tax cuts and jobs act tax legislation  we have not completed our accounting for the tax effects of enactment of the tax legislation we made provisional estimates of the effects on our existing deferred tax balances the onetime transition tax and the withholding tax accrued on those earnings not permanently reinvested at december 31 2017 the final transition impacts of the tax legislation may differ from our estimates possibly materially due to among other things changes in interpretations for the tax legislation any legislative action to address questions that arise because of the tax legislation any changes in accounting standards for income taxes or related interpretations in response to the tax legislation or any updates or changes to estimates the company has utilized to calculate the transition impacts final calculations will be completed within the one year measurement period ending december 22 2018 as required under the rules issued by the sec any change of provisional amounts will be reported in income from continuing operations in the period in which the initial estimates are revised in addition we operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and are subject to tax audits in these jurisdictions these audits can involve complex issues which may require an extended period of time to resolve we accrue for the estimated additional tax and interest that may result from tax authorities disputing uncertain tax positions we have taken and we believe we have made adequate provisions for income taxes for all years that are subject to audit based upon the latest information available a more complete description of our income taxes and the future benefits of our net operating loss and credit carryforwards is disclosed in note 2   income taxes  to our consolidated financial statements  

pension benefits 

we sponsor a number of pension plans primarily in the us and the uk and to a lesser degree in various other countries in the us and the uk we have several major defined benefit plans that are separately funded we account for our pension programs in accordance with employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans under gaap gaap requires that amounts recognized in financial statements be determined using an actuarial basis as a result our pension benefit programs are based on a number of statistical and judgmental assumptions that attempt to anticipate future events and are used in calculating the expense and liability related to our plans each year at december 31 these assumptions include discount rates used to value liabilities assumed rates of return on plan assets future compensation increases employee turnover rates actuarial assumptions relating to retirement age mortality rates and participant withdrawals the actuarial assumptions we use may differ significantly from actual results due to changing economic conditions participant life span and withdrawal rates these differences may result in a material impact to the amount of net periodic pension cost to be recorded in our consolidated financial statements in the future 

the expected longterm return on plan assets is used in calculating the net periodic pension cost we considered several factors in developing our expected rate of return on plan assets the longterm rate of return considers historical returns and expected returns on current and projected asset allocations projected returns are based primarily on broad publicly traded passive fixed income and equity indices and forwardlooking estimates of the value added by active investment management at december 31 2017 based upon our target asset allocations it is anticipated that our us investment policy will generate an average annual return over the 10year projection period equal to or in excess of 65 percent approximately 32 percent of the time while returns of 70 percent or greater are anticipated 21 percent of the time including the additional positive returns expected from active investment management 

our plan assets have averaged annualized returns of 105 percent over the prior eight years and resulted in approximately 418 million of actuarial gains in accumulated other comprehensive income in the same period based on the historical returns and forwardlooking return expectations we believe an investment return assumption of 65 percent per year in 2018 for us pension assets is reasonable 

the methodology used to determine the rate of return on pension plan assets in the uk was based on establishing an equityrisk premium over current longterm bond yields adjusted based on target asset allocations at december 31 2017 based upon our target asset allocations it is anticipated that our uk investment policy will generate an average annual return over the 20year projection period equal to or in excess of 41 percent approximately 50 percent of the time while returns of 48 percent or greater are anticipated 25 percent of the time we expect modest additional positive returns from active investment management the oneyear return for our uk plans was 44 percent for 2017  and similar to our us plans the strong returns since 2010 have resulted in approximately 383 million of actuarial gains in accumulated other comprehensive income our strategy with respect to our investments in pension plan assets is to be invested with a longterm outlook therefore the risk and return balance of our asset portfolio should reflect a longterm horizon based on the historical returns and forwardlooking return expectations as the plan assets continue to be derisked we believe an investment return assumption of 40 percent in 2018 for uk pension assets is reasonable our pension plan asset allocations at december 31 2017 and 2016 and target allocation for 2018 are as follows 



the differences between the actual return on plan assets and expected longterm return on plan assets are recognized in the asset value used to calculate net periodic cost over five years the table below sets forth the expected return assumptions used to develop our pension cost for the period 2015  2017 and our expected rate of return for 2018  



a lower expected rate of return will increase our net periodic pension cost and reduce profitability 

gaap for pensions offers various acceptable alternatives to account for the differences that eventually arise between the estimates used in the actuarial valuations and the actual results it is acceptable to delay or immediately recognize these differences under the delayed recognition alternative changes in pension obligations including those resulting from plan amendments and changes in the value of assets set aside to meet those obligations are not recognized in net periodic pension cost as they occur but are recognized initially in accumulated other comprehensive loss and subsequently amortized as components of net periodic pension cost systematically and gradually over future periods in addition to this approach gaap also allows immediate recognition of actuarial gains or losses immediate recognition introduces volatility in financial results we have chosen to delay recognition and amortize actuarial differences over future periods if we adopted the immediate recognition approach we would record a loss of 864 million  680 million aftertax from cumulative actuarial net losses for our us and uk pension plans 

the difference between the expected return and the actual return on plan assets is deferred from recognition in our results of operations and under certain circumstances such as when the difference exceeds 10 percent of the market value of plan assets or the projected benefit obligation amortized over future years of service this is also true of changes to actuarial assumptions under gaap the actuarial gains and losses are recognized and recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss at december 31 2017  we had net pension actuarial losses of 649 million and 207 million for the us and uk pension plans respectively as these amounts exceed 10 percent of their respective plan assets the excess is amortized over the average remaining service lives of participating employees net actuarial losses decreased our shareholders equity by 28 million aftertax in 2017  the loss is due to lower discount rates in the us and uk and unfavorable foreign currency partially offset by strong asset performance in the us and the uk 

the table below sets forth the net periodic pension cost for the years ended december 31 and our expected cost for 2018  



we expect 2018 net periodic pension cost to decrease compared to 2017  primarily due to reduced loss amortization in the us and uk which resulted from strong asset performance partially offset by lower expected asset returns in the us and uk as we derisk plan trust assets the increase in net periodic pension cost in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily due to onboarding north american distributors to cummins pension benefits a lower expected rate of return in the us and uk and lower discount rates in the us and uk the decrease in net periodic pension cost in 2016 compared to 2015 was due to reduced loss amortizations in the us and uk and higher discount rates in the us and uk partially offset by lower expected asset returns in the uk as we derisked plan trust assets another key assumption used in the development of the net periodic pension cost is the discount rate the weightedaverage discount rates used to develop our net periodic pension cost are set forth in the table below 



changes in the discount rate assumptions will impact the interest cost component of the net periodic pension cost calculation 

the discount rate enables us to state expected future cash payments for benefits as a present value on the measurement date the guidelines for setting this rate are discussed in gaap which suggests the use of a highquality corporate bond rate we used bond information provided by moodys investor services inc and standard  poors rating services all bonds used to develop our hypothetical portfolio in the us and uk were deemed highquality noncallable bonds aa or better at december 31 2017  by at least one of the bond rating agencies 

our model called for projected payments until near extinction for the us and the uk for both countries our model matches the present value of the plans projected benefit payments to the market value of the theoretical settlement bond portfolio a single equivalent discount rate is determined to align the present value of the required cash flow with the value of the bond portfolio the resulting discount rate is reflective of both the current interest rate environment and the plans distinct liability characteristics 

the table below sets forth the estimated impact on our 2018 net periodic pension cost relative to a change in the discount rate and a change in the expected rate of return on plan assets 



the above sensitivities reflect the impact of changing one assumption at a time a higher discount rate decreases the plan obligations and decreases our net periodic pension cost a lower discount rate increases the plan obligations and increases our net periodic pension cost it should be noted that economic factors and conditions often affect multiple assumptions simultaneously and the effects of changes in key assumptions are not necessarily linear note 10   pension and other postretirement benefits  to our consolidated financial statements provides a summary of our pension benefit plan activity the funded status of our plans and the amounts recognized in our consolidated financial statements

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to financial risk resulting from volatility in foreign exchange rates interest rates and commodity prices this risk is closely monitored and managed through the use of financial derivative instruments including foreign currency forward contracts interest rate swaps commodity zerocost collars and physical forward contracts these instruments as further described below are accounted for as cash flow or fair value hedges or as economic hedges not designated as hedges for accounting purposes financial derivatives are used expressly for hedging purposes and under no circumstances are they used for speculative purposes when material we adjust the estimated fair value of our derivative contracts for counterparty or our credit risk none of our derivative instruments are subject to collateral requirements substantially all of our derivative contracts are subject to master netting arrangements which provide us with the option to settle certain contracts on a net basis when they settle on the same day with the same currency in addition these arrangements provide for a net settlement of all contracts with a given counterparty in the event that the arrangement is terminated due to the occurrence of default or a termination event 

we also enter into physical forward contracts with certain suppliers to purchase minimum volumes of commodities at contractually stated prices for various periods these arrangements as further described below enable us to fix the prices of portions of our normal purchases of these commodities which otherwise are subject to market volatility 

the following describes our risk exposures and provides the results of a sensitivity analysis performed at december 31 2017  the sensitivity analysis assumes instantaneous parallel shifts in foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices 

foreign exchange rate risk 

as a result of our international business presence we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risks we transact business in foreign currencies and as a result our income experiences some volatility related to movements in foreign currency exchange rates to help manage our exposure to exchange rate volatility we use foreign currency forward contracts on a regular basis to hedge forecasted intercompany and thirdparty sales and purchases denominated in nonfunctional currencies our internal policy allows for managing anticipated foreign currency cash flows for up to 18 months  these foreign currency forward contracts are designated and qualify as foreign currency cash flow hedges under gaap for the years ended december 31 2017 and 2016  there were no circumstances that would have resulted in the discontinuance of a foreign currency cash flow hedge 

to minimize the income volatility resulting from the remeasurement of net monetary assets and payables denominated in a currency other than the functional currency we enter into foreign currency forward contracts which are considered economic hedges the objective is to offset the gain or loss from remeasurement with the gain or loss from the fair market valuation of the forward contract these derivative instruments are not designated as hedges under gaap 

at december 31 2017 the potential gain or loss in the fair value of our outstanding foreign currency contracts assuming a hypothetical 10 percent fluctuation in the currencies of such contracts would be approximately 101 million  the sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates assumes the notional value to remain constant for the next 12 months the analysis ignores the impact of foreign exchange movements on our competitive position and potential changes in sales levels any change in the value of the contracts real or hypothetical would be significantly offset by an inverse change in the value of the underlying hedged items  

interest rate risk 

we are exposed to market risk from fluctuations in interest rates we manage our exposure to interest rate fluctuations through the use of interest rate swaps the objective of the swaps is to more effectively balance our borrowing costs and interest rate risk 

we have a series of interest rate swaps to effectively convert our september 2013 500 million debt issue due in 2023 from a fixed rate of 365 percent to a floating rate equal to the onemonth libor plus a spread the terms of the swaps mirror those of the debt with interest paid semiannually the swaps were designated and will be accounted for as fair value hedges under gaap the gain or loss on these derivative instruments as well as the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in current income as “interest expense” the net swap settlements that accrue each period are also reported in interest expense 

the following table summarizes these gains and losses for the years presented below

we are exposed to fluctuations in commodity prices due to contractual agreements with component suppliers in order to protect ourselves against future price volatility and consequently fluctuations in gross margins we periodically enter into commodity zerocost collar contracts with designated banks to fix the cost of certain raw material purchases with the objective of minimizing changes in inventory cost due to market price fluctuations these commodity zerocost collar contracts that represent an economic hedge but are not designated for hedge accounting and are marked to market through earnings our internal policy allows for managing our cash flow hedges for up to three years 

at december 31 2017 the potential gain or loss related to the outstanding commodity zerocost collar contracts assuming a hypothetical 10 percent fluctuation in the price of such commodities would be approximately 3 million  the sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in commodity prices assumes the notional value to remain constant for the next 12 months the analysis ignores the impact of commodity price movements on our competitive position and potential changes in sales levels any change in the value of the zerocost collar contracts real or hypothetical would be significantly offset by an inverse change in the value of the underlying hedged items 

we also limit our exposure to commodity price risk by entering into purchasing arrangements to fix the price of certain volumes of platinum and palladium expected to be used in our products we enter into physical forward contracts with suppliers of platinum and palladium to purchase some volumes of the commodities at contractually stated prices for various periods generally not exceeding one year these arrangements enable us to fix the prices of a portion of our purchases of these commodities which otherwise are subject to market volatility

joint ventures alliances and nonwhollyowned subsidiaries 

we have entered into a number of joint venture agreements and alliances with business partners around the world our joint ventures are either distribution or manufacturing entities we also own controlling interests in nonwhollyowned manufacturing and distribution subsidiaries 

in the event of a change of control of either party to certain of these joint ventures and other strategic alliances certain consequences may result including automatic termination and liquidation of the venture exercise of put or call rights of ownership by the nonacquired partner termination or transfer of technology license rights to the nonacquired partner and increases in component transfer prices to the acquired partner we will continue to evaluate joint venture and partnership opportunities in order to penetrate new markets develop new products and generate manufacturing and operational efficiencies 

financial information about our investments in joint ventures and alliances is incorporated by reference from note 2   investments in equity investees  to the consolidated financial statements 

our equity income from these investees was as follows 



 

1  this total represents our share of net income of our equity investees and is exclusive of royalties and interest income from our equity investees to see how this amount reconciles to equity royalty and interest income from investees in the consolidated statements of income  see note 2   investments in equity investees  to our consolidated financial statements for additional information  

distribution entities 

 see further discussion of our distribution network under the distribution segment section above 

manufacturing entities 

our manufacturing joint ventures have generally been formed with customers and generally are intended to allow us to increase our market penetration in geographic regions reduce capital spending streamline our supply chain management and develop technologies our largest manufacturing joint ventures are based in china and are included in the list below our engine manufacturing joint ventures are supplied by our components segment in the same manner as it supplies our whollyowned engine segment and power systems segment manufacturing facilities our components segment joint ventures and wholly owned entities provide fuel systems filtration aftertreatment systems and turbocharger products that are used in our engines as well as some competitors products the results and investments in our joint ventures in which we have 50 percent  or less ownership interest are included in “equity royalty and interest income from investees” and “investments and advances related to equity method investees” in our consolidated statements of income   and   consolidated balance sheets  respectively   

 nonwhollyowned subsidiary 

we have a controlling interest in cummins india ltd cil which is a publicly listed company on various stock exchanges in india cil produces midrange heavyduty and highhorsepower engines generators for the indian and export markets and natural gas sparkignited engines for power generation automotive and industrial applications cil also has distribution and power generation operations 

supply 

the performance of the endtoend supply chain extending through to our suppliers is foundational to our ability to meet customers expectations and support longterm growth we are committed to having a robust strategy for how we select and manage our suppliers to enable a market focused supply chain this requires us to continuously evaluate and upgrade our supply base as necessary to ensure we are meeting the needs of our customers 

we use a category strategy process a process designed to create the most value for the company that reviews our longterm needs and guides decisions on what we make internally and what we purchase externally for the items we decide to purchase externally the strategies also identify the suppliers we should partner with longterm to provide the best technology the lowest total cost and highest supply chain performance we design andor manufacture our strategic components used in or with our engines and power generation units including cylinder blocks and heads turbochargers connecting rods camshafts crankshafts filters alternators electronic and emissions controls and fuel systems we source externally purchased material and manufactured components from leading global suppliers many key suppliers are managed through longterm supply agreements that assure capacity delivery quality and cost requirements are met over an extended period approximately 20  percent of the direct material in our product designs are single sourced to external suppliers we have an established sourcing strategy and supplier management process to evaluate and mitigate risk these processes are leading us to determine our need for dual sourcing and increase our use of dual and parallel sources to minimize risk and increase supply chain responsiveness our current target for dual and parallel sourcing is approximately 90 percent  of our direct material spend as of december 31 2016  our analysis indicates that we have approximately 80 percent  of direct material spend with dual or parallel sources or 89 percent  of our target 

other important elements of our sourcing strategy include 



patents and trademarks 

we own or control a significant number of patents and trademarks relating to the products we manufacture these patents and trademarks were granted and registered over a period of years although these patents and trademarks are generally considered beneficial to our operations we do not believe any patent group of patents or trademark other than our leading brand house trademarks is significant to our business 

seasonality 

while individual product lines may experience modest seasonal variation in production there is no material effect on the demand for the majority of our products on a quarterly basis with the exceptions that our power systems segment normally experiences seasonal declines in the first quarter due to general declines in construction spending during this period and our distribution segment normally experiences seasonal declines in its first quarter business activity due to holiday periods in asia and australia 

largest customers 

we have thousands of customers around the world and have developed longstanding business relationships with many of them paccar is our largest customer accounting for 13 percent of our consolidated net sales in 2016 15 percent in 2015 and 14 percent in 2014 we have longterm supply agreements with paccar for our heavyduty isx 15 liter and isx 119 liter engines and our midrange isl 9 liter engine while a significant number of our sales to paccar are under longterm supply agreements these agreements provide for particular engine requirements for specific vehicle models and not a specific volume of engines paccar is our only customer accounting for more than 10 percent of our net sales in 2016 the loss of this customer or a significant decline in the production level of paccar vehicles that use our engines would have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition we have been an engine supplier to paccar for 72 years a summary of principal customers for each operating segment is included in our segment discussion 

in addition to our agreement with paccar we have longterm heavyduty engine supply agreements with daimler and navistar and a longterm midrange supply agreement with daimler we also have an agreement with fiat chrysler to supply engines for its ram trucks  collectively our net sales to these four customers including paccar were 33 percent of our consolidated net sales in 2016  36 percent in 2015 and 32 percent in 2014  excluding paccar net sales to any single customer were less than 7 percent of our consolidated net sales in 2016  less than 9 percent in 2015 and less than 8 percent in 2014  these agreements contain standard purchase and sale agreement terms covering engine and engine parts pricing quality and delivery commitments as well as engineering product support obligations the basic nature of our agreements with oem customers is that they are longterm price and operations agreements that help assure the availability of our products to each customer through the duration of the respective agreements agreements with most oems contain bilateral termination provisions giving either party the right to terminate in the event of a material breach change of control or insolvency or bankruptcy of the other party   

backlog 

we have supply agreements with some truck and offhighway equipment oems however most of our business is transacted through open purchase orders these open orders are historically subject to monthtomonth releases and are subject to cancellation on reasonable notice without cancellation charges and therefore are not considered firm at december 31 2016  we did not have any significant backlogs 

research and development 

in 2016  we continued to invest in future critical technologies and products we will continue to make investments to improve our current technologies meet the future emission requirements around the world and improve fuel economy 

our research and development program is focused on product improvements product extensions innovations and cost reductions for our customers research and development expenditures include salaries contractor fees building costs utilities testing technical it administrative expenses and allocation of corporate costs and are expensed net of contract reimbursements when incurred from time to time we enter into agreements with customers and government agencies to fund a portion of the research and development costs of a particular project we generally account for these reimbursements as an offset to the related research and development expenditure research and development expenses net of contract reimbursements were 616 million  in 2016   718 million  in 2015 and 737 million  in 2014  contract reimbursements were 131 million  in 2016   98 million  in 2015 and 121 million  in 2014   

for 2016  2015  and 2014  approximately 77 million  90 million  and 60 million  or 13 percent  13 percent  and 8 percent  respectively of our  research and development expenditures were directly related to compliance with 2017 us environmental protection agency epa emission standards  

environmental sustainability 

we adopted our first ever comprehensive environmental sustainability plan in 2014 after examining our entire environmental footprint focusing on the key areas of water waste energy and greenhouse gases ghg as the concept and scope of environmental sustainability has matured and broadened leaders have moved from initially working on environmental impacts within our direct control to an expanded view of fuel and raw materials that reaches across the entire product lifecycle envolve cummins is the comprehensive lens through which we view environmental sustainability from design to manufacture to end of life our environmental sustainability plan is the way we carry out our priorities goals and initiatives in our action areas including reducing our carbon footprint using fewer natural resources and partnering to solve complex problems 

we currently have the following environmental sustainability goals and commitments 

 in 2016 we announced that we exceeded our second energy and ghg emission goal of a 25 percent and 27 percent reduction respectively by achieving intensity reductions of 33 and 36 percent respectively 

we continue to articulate our positions on key public policy issues and on a wide range of environmental issues we are actively engaged with regulatory industry and other stakeholder groups around the world as ghg and fuel efficiency standards become more prevalent globally we were named to the dow jones north american sustainability index for the eleventh consecutive year in 2016 included in the “disclosure leadership index” of the carbon disclosure project’s climate report in 2015 and we were identified as a “natural capital decoupling leader” by green biz group and trucost for reductions in environmental footprint amid company growth in 2014 our sustainability report for 20152016 and prior reports as well as a data book of more detailed environmental data in accordance with the global reporting initiatives g4 core designation are available on our website at wwwcumminscom although such reports and data book are not incorporated into this form 10k 

environmental compliance 

product certification and compliance 

we strive to have robust certification and compliance processes adhering to all emissions regulations worldwide including prohibiting the use of defeat devices in all of our products we are transparent with all governing bodies in these processes from disclosure of the design and operation of the emission control system to test processes and results and later to any necessary reporting and corrective action processes if required 

we work collaboratively and proactively with emission regulators globally to ensure emission standards are clear appropriately stringent and enforceable in an effort to ensure our products deliver on our commitments to our customers and the environment in real world use every day 

our engines are subject to extensive statutory and regulatory requirements that directly or indirectly impose standards governing emission and noise we have substantially increased our global environmental compliance presence and expertise to understand and meet emerging product environmental regulations around the world our ability to comply with these and future emission standards is an essential element in maintaining our leadership position in regulated markets we have made and will continue to make significant capital and research expenditures to comply with these standards our failure to comply with these standards could result in adverse effects on our future financial results 

eu and epa engine certifications 

the current onhighway nox and pm emission standards came into effect in the european union eu on january 1 2013 euro vi and on january 1 2010 for the epa to meet the more stringent heavyduty onhighway emission standards we used an evolution of our proven selective catalytic reduction scr and exhaust gas recirculation egr technology solutions and refined them for the eu and epa certified engines to maintain power and torque with substantial fuel economy improvement and maintenance intervals comparable with our previous compliant engines we offer a complete lineup of onhighway engines to meet the nearzero emission standards midrange and heavyduty engines for eu and epa require nox aftertreatment nox reduction is achieved by an integrated technology solution comprised of the xpi high pressure common rail fuel system scr technology nextgeneration cooled egr advanced electronic controls proven air handling and the cummins diesel particulate filter dpf the eu epa and california air resources board carb have certified that our engines meet the current emission requirements emission standards in international markets including japan mexico australia brazil russia india and china are becoming more stringent we believe that our experience in meeting the eu and epa emission standards leaves us well positioned to take advantage of opportunities in these markets as the need for emission control capability grows 

in 2013 we certified to epas first ever ghg regulations for onhighway medium and heavyduty engines additionally the epa 2013 regulations added the requirement of onboard diagnostics which were introduced on the isx15 in 2010 across the full onhighway product line while maintaining the same nearzero emission levels of nox and particulate matter required in 2010 onboard diagnostics provide enhanced service capability with standardized diagnostic trouble codes service tool interface incab warning lamp and service information availability the new ghg and fuelefficiency regulations were required for all heavyduty diesel and natural gas engines beginning in january 2014 our ghg certification was the first engine certificate issued by the epa and uses the same proven base engine with the xpi fuel system variable geometry turbocharger vgt tm  cummins aftertreatment system with dpf and scr technology application of these engines and aftertreatment technologies continues in our products that comply with the 2017 ghg regulations 

the current offhighway emission standards for epa and eu came into effect between the 2013  2015 timeframe for all power categories these engines were designed for tier 4  stage 4 standards and were based on our extensive onhighway experience developing scr high pressure fuel systems dpf and vgt tm  our products offer low fuel consumption high torque rise and power output extended maintenance intervals reliable and durable operation and a long life to overhaul period all while meeting the most stringent emission standards in the industrial market our offhighway products power multiple applications including construction mining marine agriculture rail defense and oil and gas and serves a global customer base 

in 2016 the epa certified our locomotive engine as the first to meet the tier 4 standards and will enter the market as the propulsion prime mover for siemens new charger passenger locomotive serving multiple routes in major us cities the 95 liter qsk95 engine provides over 4000 horsepower and is the uss first low emission tier 4 engine to power the passenger train service market 

other environmental statutes and regulations 

expenditures for environmental control activities and environmental remediation projects at our facilities in the us have not been a substantial portion of our annual expenses and are not expected to be material in 2017 we believe we are in compliance in all material respects with laws and regulations applicable to our plants and operations 

in the us pursuant to notices received from federal and state agencies andor defendant parties in site environmental contribution actions we have been identified as a potentially responsible party under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of 1980 as amended or similar state laws at fewer than 20 waste disposal sites 

based upon our experiences at similar sites we believe that our aggregate future remediation costs will not be material we have established accruals that we believe are adequate for our expected future liability with respect to these sites in addition we have several other sites where we are working with governmental authorities on remediation projects the costs for these remediation projects are not expected to be material 

employees 

at december 31 2016 we employed approximately 55400 persons worldwide approximately 18340 of our employees worldwide are represented by various unions under collective bargaining agreements that expire between 2017 and 2021

 item 1a risk factors 

set forth below and elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k are some of the principal risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual business results to differ materially from any forwardlooking statements contained in this report and could individually or in combination have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows these risk factors should be considered in addition to our cautionary comments concerning forwardlooking statements in this report including statements related to markets for our products and trends in our business that involve a number of risks and uncertainties our separate section above cautionary statements regarding forwardlooking information should be considered in addition to the following statements 

a sustained slowdown or more significant downturn in our markets could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial condition or cash flows 

many of our on and offhighway markets are cyclical in nature and experience volatility in demand throughout these cycles as experienced in 2016 with downward market pressure both domestically and internationally while north american onhighway markets remained strong for several years in 2016 these markets began to decline as they transitioned to a lower demand cycle as evidenced by the slowing demand for heavyduty trucks as a result of lower capital spending by truck fleets in response to weak growth in the economy most international markets in 2016 continued to experience weak demand consistent with the last several years especially in south america the middle east uk singapore and mexico if the nort h american markets suffer a further significant downturn or if the slower pace of economic growth and weaker demand in our significant international markets were to persist or worsen depending upon the length duration and severity of the slowdown our results of operations financial condition or cash flows would likely be materially adversely affected specifically our revenues would likely decrease we may need to realign capacity with demand we may need to increase our allowance for doubtful accounts our days sales outstanding may increase and we could experience impairments to assets of certain businesses   

our truck manufacturers and oem customers may discontinue outsourcing their engine supply needs 

several of our engine customers including paccar volvo ab navistar fiat chrysler daimler and dongfeng cummins engine company ltd are truck manufacturers or oems that manufacture engines for some of their own vehicles despite their own engine manufacturing abilities these customers have historically chosen to outsource certain types of engine production to us due to the quality of our engine products our emission compliance capabilities our systems integration their customers preferences their desire for cost reductions their desire for eliminating production risks and their desire to maintain company focus however there can be no assurance that these customers will continue to outsource or outsource as much of their engine production in the future in fact several of these customers have expressed their intention to significantly increase their own engine production and to decrease engine purchases from us in addition increased levels of oem vertical integration could result from a number of factors such as shifts in our customers business strategies acquisition by a customer of another engine manufacturer the inability of thirdparty suppliers to meet product specifications and the emergence of lowcost production opportunities in foreign countries any significant reduction in the level of engine production outsourcing from our truck manufacturer or oem customers could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

financial distress of one of our large truck oem customers could materially adversely impact our results of operations   

we recognize significant sales of engines and components to a few large onhighway truck oem customers in north america which have been an integral part of our positive business results for several years if one of our large truck oem customers experiences financial distress or bankruptcy such circumstance would likely lead to significant reductions in our revenues and earnings commercial disputes receivable collection issues and other negative consequences that could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations   

lowerthananticipated market acceptance of our new or existing products or services   

although we conduct market research before launching new or refreshed engines and introducing new services many factors both within and outside our control affect the success of new or existing products and services in the marketplace offering engines and services that customers desire and value can mitigate the risks of increasing price competition and declining demand but products and services that are perceived to be less than desirable whether in terms of price quality overall value fuel efficiency or other attributes can exacerbate these risks with increased consumer interconnectedness through the internet social media and other media mere allegations relating to poor quality safety fuel efficiency corporate responsibility or other key attributes can negatively impact our reputation or market acceptance of our products or services even if such allegations prove to be inaccurate or unfounded 

the discovery of any significant problems with our recentlyintroduced engine platforms in north america could materially adversely impact our results of operations financial condition and cash flow   

the epa and carb have certified all of our 2017 onhighway engines which utilize scr technology to meet requisite emission and ghg levels the effective performance of scr technology and the overall performance of our engine platforms impacts a number of our operating segments and remains crucial to our success in north america the discovery of any significant problems in these platforms could result in recall campaigns increased warranty costs reputational risk and brand risk and could materially adversely impact our results of operations financial condition or cash flows 

further slowdown in infrastructure development andor continuing depressed commodity prices could adversely affect our business   

infrastructure development and strong commodity prices have been significant drivers of our historical growth but as the pace of investment in infrastructure has slowed especially in china and brazil commodity prices have been significantly lower in recent years and demand for our products in offhighway markets has remained weak for several years weakness in commodities such as oil gas and coal has adversely impacted mining industry participants’ demand for vehicles and equipment that contain our engines and other products further deterioration or continued weakness in infrastructure and commodities markets will continue to adversely affect our customers’ demand for vehicles and equipment and will adversely affect our business 

unpredictability in the adoption implementation and enforcement of increasingly stringent emission standards by multiple jurisdictions around the world could adversely affect our business   

our engines are subject to extensive statutory and regulatory requirements governing emission and noise including standards imposed by the epa the eu state regulatory agencies such as the carb and other regulatory agencies around the world we have made and will be required to continue to make significant capital and research expenditures to ensure our engines comply with these emission standards developing engines and components to meet numerous changing government regulatory requirements with different implementation timelines and emission requirements makes developing engines efficiently for multiple markets complicated and could result in substantial additional costs that may be difficult to recover in certain markets in some cases we are required to develop new products to comply with new regulations particularly those relating to air emissions while we have met previous deadlines our ability to comply with other existing and future regulatory standards will be essential for us to maintain our competitive advantage in the engine markets we serve the successful development and introduction of new and enhanced products in order to comply with new regulatory requirements are subject to other risks such as delays in product development cost overruns and unanticipated technical and manufacturing difficulties in addition to these risks the nature and timing of government implementation and enforcement of increasingly stringent emission standards in emerging markets are unpredictable and subject to change any delays in implementation or enforcement could result in the products we developed or modified to comply with these standards becoming unnecessary or becoming necessary later than expected thereby in some cases negating our competitive advantage this in turn can delay diminish or eliminate the expected return on capital and research expenditures that we have invested in such products and may adversely affect our perceived competitive advantage in being an early advanced developer of compliant engines 

we are subject to foreign currency exchange rate and other related risks   

we conduct operations in many areas of the world involving transactions denominated in a variety of currencies we are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk to the extent that our costs are denominated in currencies other than those in which we earn revenues in addition since our financial statements are denominated in us dollars changes in foreign currency exchange rates between the us dollar and other currencies have had and will continue to have an impact on our results of operations the us dollar has strengthened in recent years and has resulted in material unfavorable impacts on our revenues if the us dollar continues to strengthen against other currencies we will continue to experience additional volatility in our financial statements while we customarily enter into financial transactions that attempt to address these risks and many of our supply agreements with customers include foreign currency exchange rate adjustment provisions there can be no assurance that foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations will not adversely affect our future results of operations in addition while the use of currency hedging instruments may provide us with some protection from adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates by utilizing these instruments we potentially forego the benefits that might result from favorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates we also face risks arising from the imposition of foreign exchange controls and currency devaluations foreign exchange controls may limit our ability to convert foreign currencies into us dollars or to remit dividends and other payments by our 

foreign subsidiaries or businesses located in or conducted within a country imposing controls currency devaluations result in a diminished value of funds denominated in the currency of the country instituting the devaluation see managements discussion and analysis for additional information 

we derive significant earnings from investees that we do not directly control with more than 50 percent of these earnings from our chinabased investees   

for 2016 we recognized 301 million of equity royalty and interest income from investees compared to 315 million in 2015   more than half of our equity royalty and interest income from investees is from   three of our 50 percent owned joint ventures in china beijing foton cummins engine co ltd dongfeng cummins engine company ltd and chongqing cummins engine company ltd   as a result although a significant percentage of our net income is derived from these unconsolidated entities we do not unilaterally control their management or their operations which puts a substantial portion of our net income at risk from the actions or inactions of these entities a significant reduction in the level of contribution by these entities to our net income would likely have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows   

we may fail to realize all of the expected enhanced revenue earnings cash flow cost savings and other benefits from the acquisition and integration of our partiallyowned united states and canadian distributors   

our ability to realize all of the expected enhanced revenue earnings cash flow cost savings and other benefits from our recent distributor acquisitions will depend in substantial part on our ability to successfully complete the integration of the acquired distributors with our other businesses while we believe we will ultimately achieve these expected benefits it is possible that we will be unable to achieve all of the objectives within our anticipated time frame or in the anticipated amounts the expected benefits from integration also may not be fully realized or may be delayed due to certain prohibitions in applicable state franchise and distributor laws if we are not able to successfully complete our integration strategy the anticipated enhanced revenue earnings cash flow cost savings and other benefits resulting from our distributor acquisitions may not be realized fully or may take longer to realize than expected 

delays encountered or increased costs incurred in completing the integration of these acquisitions could negatively impact our revenues expenses operating results cash flow and financial condition including the loss of current customers or suppliers increased exposure to legal claims and other liabilities and the distraction or departure of key managers and employees 

our plan to reposition our portfolio of product offerings through exploring strategic acquisitions and divestitures may expose us to additional costs and risks   

part of our strategic plan is to improve our gross margins and earnings by exploring the repositioning of our portfolio of product line offerings through the pursuit of potential strategic acquisitions andor divestitures to provide future strategic financial and operational benefits and improve shareholder value there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify suitable candidates or consummate these transactions on favorable terms the successful identification and completion of any strategic transaction depends on a number of factors that are not entirely within our control including the availability of suitable candidates and our ability to negotiate terms acceptable to all parties involved conclude satisfactory agreements and obtain all necessary regulatory approvals accordingly we may not be able to successfully negotiate and complete specific transactions the exploration negotiation and consummation of strategic transactions may involve significant expenditures by us which may adversely affect our results of operations at the time such expenses are incurred and may divert management’s attention from our existing business strategic transactions also may have adverse effects on our existing business relationships with suppliers and customers if required the financing for strategic acquisitions could result in an increase in our indebtedness dilute the interests of our shareholders or both any acquisition may not be accretive to us for a significant period of time following the completion of such acquisition also our ability to effectively integrate any potential acquisition into our existing business and culture may not be successful which could jeopardize future financial and operational performance for the combined businesses in addition if an acquisition results in any additional goodwill or increase in other intangible assets on our balance sheet and subsequently becomes impaired we would be required to record a noncash impairment charge which could result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations similarly any strategic divestiture of a product line or business may reduce our revenue and earnings reduce the diversity of our business result in substantial costs and expenses and cause disruption to our employees customers vendors and communities in which we operate 

we are vulnerable to supply shortages from singlesourced suppliers   

during 2016 we single sourced approximately 20 percent of the total types of parts in our product designs compared to approximately 56 percent in 2015 any delay in our suppliers deliveries may adversely affect our operations at multiple 

manufacturing locations forcing us to seek alternative supply sources to avoid serious disruptions delays may be caused by factors affecting our suppliers including capacity constraints labor disputes economic downturns availability of credit the impaired financial condition of a particular supplier suppliers allocations to other purchasers weather emergencies natural disasters or acts of war or terrorism any extended delay in receiving critical supplies could impair our ability to deliver products to our customers and our results of operations   

our products are exposed to variability in material and commodity costs   

our businesses establish prices with our customers in accordance with contractual time frames however the timing of material and commodity market price increases may prevent us from passing these additional costs on to our customers through timely pricing actions additionally higher material and commodity costs around the world may offset our efforts to reduce our cost structure while we customarily enter into financial transactions and contractual pricing adjustment provisions with our customers that attempt to address some of these risks notably with respect to copper platinum and palladium there can be no assurance that commodity price fluctuations will not adversely affect our results of operations in addition while the use of commodity price hedging instruments and contractual pricing adjustments may provide us with some protection from adverse fluctuations in commodity prices by utilizing these instruments we potentially forego the benefits that might result from favorable fluctuations in price as a result higher material and commodity costs as well as hedging these commodity costs during periods of decreasing prices could result in declining margins   

our products are subject to recall for performance or safetyrelated issues 

our products may be subject to recall for performance or safetyrelated issues product recalls subject us to harm to our reputation loss of current and future customers reduced revenue and product recall costs product recall costs are incurred when we decide either voluntarily or involuntarily to recall a product through a formal campaign to solicit the return of specific products due to a known or suspected performance issue any significant product recalls could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows  see note 12   commitments and contingencies  to the consolidated financial statements  for additional information 

we face significant competition in the markets we serve   

the markets in which we operate are highly competitive we compete worldwide with a number of other manufacturers and distributors that produce and sell similar products we primarily compete in the market with diesel engines and related diesel products however new technologies continue to be developed for gasoline natural gas and other technologies and we will continue to face new competition from these expanding technologies our products primarily compete on the basis of price performance fuel economy speed of delivery quality and customer support we also face competitors in some emerging markets who have established local practices and long standing relationships with participants in these markets there can be no assurance that our products will be able to compete successfully with the products of other companies and in other markets   

increasing global competition among our customers may affect our existing customer relationships and restrict our ability to benefit from some of our customers growth   

as our customers in emerging markets continue to grow in size and scope they are increasingly seeking to export their products to other countries this has meant greater demand for our advanced engine technologies to help these customers meet the more stringent emissions requirements of developed markets as well as greater demand for access to our distribution systems for purposes of equipment servicing as these emerging market customers enter into and begin to compete in more developed markets they may increasingly begin to compete with our existing customers in these markets our further aid to emerging market customers could adversely affect our relationships with developed market customers and as a result we may be pressured to restrict the sale or support of some of our products in the areas of increased competition in addition to the extent the competition does not correspond to overall growth in demand we may see little or no benefit from this type of expansion by our emerging market customers 

we are exposed to and may be adversely affected by potential security breaches or other disruptions to our information technology systems and data security   

we rely on the capacity reliability and security of our information technology systems and data security infrastructure in connection with various aspects of our business activities we also rely on our ability to expand and continually update these systems and infrastructure in response to the changing needs of our business as we implement new systems they may not perform as expected we also face the challenge of supporting our older systems and implementing necessary upgrades in addition some of these systems are managed by third party service providers and are not under our direct control if we experience a problem with an important information technology system including during system upgrades andor new system implementations the resulting disruptions could have an adverse effect on our business and reputation as customers adopt and 

rely on the cloudbased digital technologies and services we offer any disruption of the confidentiality integrity or availability of those services could have an adverse effect on our business and reputation 

the information handled by our information technology systems is vulnerable to security threats our operations routinely involve receiving storing processing and transmitting sensitive information pertaining to our business customers dealers suppliers employees and other sensitive matters information technology security threats such as security breaches computer malware and other cyber attacks which are increasing in both frequency and sophistication could result in unauthorized disclosures of information and create financial liability subject us to legal or regulatory sanctions or damage our reputation with customers dealers suppliers and other stakeholders we continuously seek to maintain a robust program of information security and controls but the impact of a material information technology event could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position reputation results of operations financial condition and cash flow   

we are exposed to political economic and other risks that arise from operating a multinational business   

approximately 46 percent of our net sales for 2016 and 44 percent in 2015 were attributable to customers outside the us   accordingly our business is subject to the political economic and other risks that are inherent in operating in numerous countries these risks include   

 as we continue to operate our business globally our success will depend in part on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these and other related risks there can be no assurance that the consequences of these and other factors relating to our multinational operations will not have a material adverse effect upon us   

unanticipated changes in our effective tax rate the adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could adversely affect our profitability 

we are subject to income taxes in the us and numerous international jurisdictions our income tax provision and cash tax liability in the future could be adversely affected by changes in the distribution of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities changes to our assertions regarding permanent reinvestment of our foreign earnings changes in tax laws and the discovery of new information in the course of our tax return preparation process the carrying value of deferred tax assets which are predominantly in the us is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income in the us we are also subject to ongoing tax audits these audits can involve complex issues which may require an extended period of time to resolve and can be highly judgmental tax authorities may disagree with certain tax reporting positions taken by us and as a result assess additional taxes against us we regularly assess the likely outcomes of these audits in order to determine the appropriateness of our tax provision the amounts ultimately paid upon resolution of these or subsequent tax audits could be materially different from the amounts previously included in our income tax provision and therefore could have a material impact on our tax provision   

our global operations are subject to laws and regulations that impose significant compliance costs and create reputational and legal risk   

due to the international scope of our operations we are subject to a complex system of commercial and trade regulations around the world recent years have seen an increase in the development and enforcement of laws regarding trade compliance and anticorruption such as the us foreign corrupt practices act and similar laws from other countries our numerous foreign subsidiaries affiliates and joint venture partners are governed by laws rules and business practices that differ from those of the us the activities of these entities may not comply with us laws or business practices or our code of business conduct violations of these laws may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions could disrupt our business and result in an adverse effect on our reputation business and results of operations or financial condition we cannot predict the nature scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our operations might be subject or the manner in which existing laws might be administered or interpreted   

we face the challenge of accurately aligning our capacity with our demand   

we can experience idle capacity as economies slow or demand for certain products decline accurately forecasting our expected volumes and appropriately adjusting our capacity have been and will continue to be important factors in determining our results of operations if we overestimate our demand and overbuild our capacity we may have significantly underutilized assets and we may experience reduced margins if we do not accurately align our manufacturing capabilities with demand it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations   

our business is exposed to potential product liability claims   

we face an inherent business risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that our products failure to perform to specification results or is alleged to result in property damage bodily injury andor death at any given time we are subject to various and multiple product liability claims any one of which if decided adversely to us may have a material adverse effect on our reported results of operation in the period in which our liability with respect to any such claim is recognized while we maintain insurance coverage with respect to certain product liability claims we may not be able to obtain such insurance on acceptable terms in the future if at all and any such insurance may not provide adequate coverage against product liability claims in addition product liability claims can be expensive to defend and can divert the attention of management and other personnel for significant periods of time regardless of the ultimate outcome furthermore even if we are successful in defending against a claim relating to our products claims of this nature could cause our customers to lose confidence in our products and us   

our operations are subject to increasingly stringent environmental laws and regulations   

our plants and operations are subject to increasingly stringent environmental laws and regulations in all of the countries in which we operate including laws and regulations governing air emission discharges to water and the generation handling storage transportation treatment and disposal of waste materials while we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with these environmental laws and regulations there can be no assurance that we will not be adversely impacted by costs liabilities or claims with respect to existing or subsequently acquired operations under either present laws and regulations or those that may be adopted or imposed in the future we are also subject to laws requiring the cleanup of contaminated property if a release of hazardous substances occurs at or from any of our current or former properties or at a landfill or another location where we have disposed of hazardous materials we may be held liable for the contamination and the amount of such liability could be material   

we are exposed to risks arising from the price and availability of energy   

the level of demand for our products and services is influenced in multiple ways by the price and availability of energy high energy costs generally drive greater demand for better fuel economy in almost all countries in which we operate some of our engine products have been developed with a primary purpose of offering fuel economy improvements and if energy costs decrease or increase less than expected demand for these products may likewise decrease the relative unavailability of electricity in some emerging market countries also influences demand for our electricity generating products such as our diesel generators if these countries add energy capacity by expanding their power grids at a rate equal to or faster than the growth in demand for energy the demand for our generating products could also decrease or increase less than would otherwise be the case 

significant declines in future financial and stock market conditions could diminish our pension plan asset performance and adversely impact our results of operations financial condition and cash flow   

we sponsor both funded and unfunded domestic and foreign defined benefit pension and other retirement plans our pension cost and the required contributions to our pension plans are directly affected by the value of plan assets the projected and actual rates of return on plan assets and the actuarial assumptions we use to measure our defined benefit pension plan obligations including the discount rate at which future projected and accumulated pension obligations are discounted to a present value we could experience increased pension cost due to a combination of factors including the decreased investment performance of pension plan assets decreases in the discount rate and changes in our assumptions relating to the expected return on plan assets significant declines in future financial and stock market conditions could cause material losses in our pension plan assets which could result in increased pension cost in future years and adversely impact our results of operations financial condition and cash flow depending upon the severity of market declines and government regulatory changes we may be legally obligated to make pension payments in the us and perhaps other countries and these contributions could be material   

we may be adversely impacted by work stoppages and other labor matters 

at december 31 2016 we employed approximately 55400 persons worldwide approximately 18340 of our employees worldwide are represented by various unions under collective bargaining agreements that expire between 2017 and 2021  while we have no reason to believe that we will be materially impacted by work stoppages or other labor matters there can be no assurance that future issues with our labor unions will be resolved favorably or that we will not encounter future strikes work stoppages or other types of conflicts with labor unions or our employees any of these consequences may have an adverse effect on us or may limit our flexibility in dealing with our workforce in addition many of our customers and suppliers have unionized work forces work stoppages or slowdowns experienced by our customers or suppliers could result in slowdowns or closures that would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flow   

our financial statements are subject to changes in accounting standards that could adversely impact our profitability or financial position 

our financial statements are subject to the application of generally accepted accounting principles gaap in the united states of america which are periodically revised andor expanded accordingly from time to time we are required to adopt new or revised accounting standards issued by recognized authoritative bodies including the financial accounting standards board recently accounting standard setters issued new guidance which further interprets or seeks to revise accounting pronouncements related to revenue recognition and lease accounting as well as to issue new standards expanding disclosures the impact of accounting pronouncements that have been issued but not yet implemented is disclosed in our annual and quarterly reports on form 10k and form 10q an assessment of proposed standards is not provided as such proposals are subject to change through the exposure process and therefore their effects on our financial statements cannot be meaningfully assessed it is possible that future accounting standards we are required to adopt could change the current accounting treatment that we apply to our consolidated financial statements and that such changes could have a material adverse effect on our reported results of operations and financial position   

future bans or limitations on the use of dieselpowered vehicles could materially adversely affect our business over the long term 

mayors of several large international cities have announced that they plan to implement a ban on the use in their cities of dieselpowered vehicles by 2025 similarly germany adopted legislation to ban new internal combustion engine vehicles by 2030 to the extent that these types of bans are actually implemented in the future on a broad basis or in one or more of our key markets our business over the longterm could be materially adversely affected

 item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

organization of information 

the following managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations mda was prepared to provide the reader with a view and perspective of our business through the eyes of management and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements  and the accompanying notes to those financial statements our mda is presented in the following sections 



executive summary and financial highlights 

we are a global power leader that designs manufactures distributes and services diesel and natural gas engines and enginerelated component products including filtration aftertreatment turbochargers fuel systems controls systems air handling systems and electric power generation systems we sell our products to original equipment manufacturers oems distributors and other customers worldwide   we have longstanding relationships with many of the leading manufacturers in the markets we serve including paccar inc daimler trucks north america navistar international corporation and fiat chrysler automobiles   we serve our customers through a network of approximately   600  whollyowned and independent distributor locations and over   7400   dealer locations in more than 190  countries and territories   

our reportable operating segments consist of engine distribution components and power systems this reporting structure is organized according to the products and markets each segment serves  the engine segment produces engines 15 liters and less in size and associated parts for sale to customers in onhighway and various offhighway markets our engines are used in trucks of all sizes buses and recreational vehicles as well as in various industrial applications including construction agriculture power generation systems and other offhighway applications the distribution segment includes whollyowned and partiallyowned distributorships engaged in wholesaling engines generator sets and service parts as well as performing service and repair activities on our products and maintaining relationships with various oems throughout the world the components segment sells filtration products aftertreatment systems turbochargers and fuel systems the power systems segment is an integrated power provider which designs manufactures and sells engines 16 liters and larger for industrial applications including mining oil and gas and marine standby and prime power generator sets alternators and other power components   

our financial performance depends in large part on varying conditions in the markets we serve particularly the onhighway construction and general industrial markets demand in these markets tends to fluctuate in response to overall economic conditions our sales may also be impacted by oem inventory levels production schedules and stoppages economic downturns in markets we serve generally result in reduced sales of our products and can result in price reductions in certain products andor markets as a worldwide business our operations are also affected by currency political economic and regulatory matters including adoption and enforcement of environmental and emission standards in the countries we serve as part of our growth strategy we invest in businesses in certain countries that carry high levels of these risks such as china brazil india mexico russia and countries in the middle east and africa at the same time our geographic diversity and broad product and service offerings have helped limit the impact from a drop in demand in any one industry or customer or the economy of any single country on our consolidated results   

worldwide revenues declined   8 percent  in 2016  compared to 2015  primarily due to lower demand in most global onhighway markets decreased demand in most global power generation markets unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations and lower demand in most global highhorsepower industrial markets partially offset by sales increases related to the consolidation of north american distributors since december 31 2014 and an increase in lightduty automotive sales primarily due to new sales for the nissan pickup platform launched in the second half of 2015 revenue in the us and canada declined  by 12 percent   

primarily due to decreased demand in the north american onhighway markets lower organic sales in our distribution markets and unfavorable demand in the industrial oil and gas and construction markets partially offset by increased distribution segment sales related to the consolidation of north american distributors and an increase in lightduty automotive sales primarily due to new sales for the nissan pickup platform launched in the second half of 2015 continued global economic weakness in 2016 negatively impacted our international revenues excludes the us and canada which declined  by 2 percent  with sales down in most of our markets especially in south america the middle east uk singapore and mexico  the decline in international sales was primarily due to declines in most international power generation markets unfavorable foreign currency impacts of 4 percent  of international sales primarily in the british pound chinese renminbi indian rupee brazilian real south african rand and australian dollar  decreased demand in highhorsepower industrial markets led by declines in marine and mining lower demand in distribution markets in asia pacific africa and the middle east and lower demand in the onhighway markets in brazil and mexico

we allocate certain common costs and expenses primarily corporate functions among segments these include certain costs and expenses of shared services such as information technology human resources legal finance and supply chain management in addition to the reorganization noted above we reevaluated the allocation of these costs considering the new segment structure created in april 2016 and adjusted our allocation methodology accordingly the revised methodology which is based on a combination of relative segment sales and relative service usage levels is effective for the periods beginning after january 1 2016 and resulted in the revision of our segment operating results including segment ebit for all four segments for the first quarter of 2016 with a greater share of costs allocated to the distribution and components segments than in previous years prior periods were not revised for the new allocation methodology these changes had no impact on our consolidated results

liquidity and capital resources 

key working capital and balance sheet data 

we fund our working capital with cash from operations and shortterm borrowings including commercial paper when necessary various assets and liabilities including shortterm debt can fluctuate significantly from month to month depending on shortterm liquidity needs as a result working capital is a prime focus of management attention  working capital and balance sheet measures are provided in the following table 



 

1 working capital includes cash and cash equivalents 

2 the increase in our debt to capital ratio was due to higher total debt as a result of the commercial paper program added in 2016 and a net decrease in shareholders equity  

cash flows 

cash and cash equivalents were impacted as follows 



2016  vs 2015 

net cash provided by  operating activities decrease d 124 million  versus 2015  primarily due to the absence of the 2015 impairment of lightduty diesel assets of 211 million and a 123 million year over year impact related to restructuring partially offset by an increase in deferred income taxes of 158 million and higher loss contingency charges of 62 million resulting in lower cash net income in 2016 

net cash used in  investing activities decrease d 1 million  versus 2015  primarily due to lower capital expenditures of 213 million and proceeds from the sale of equity investees of 60 million partially offset by higher net investments in marketable securities of 160 million and changes in cash flows from derivatives not designated as hedges of 110 million 

net cash used in  financing activities decrease d 235 million  versus 2015  primarily due to higher net borrowings of commercial paper of 212 million lower common stock repurchases of 122 million and higher proceeds from borrowings of 67 million partially offset by higher acquisitions of noncontrolling interests of 88 million and higher payments on borrowings and capital lease obligations of 87 million 

the effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents decreased 113 million  versus 2015  primarily due to the british pound which decreased cash and cash equivalents by 112 million 

2015  vs 2014 

net cash provided by operating activities decreased 207 million versus 2014 primarily due to lower consolidated net income of 266 million and unfavorable working capital fluctuations of 328 million partially offset by the impact of the noncash impairment of lightduty diesel assets of 211 million during 2015 the higher working capital requirements resulted in a cash outflow of 260 million compared to a cash inflow of 68 million in 2014 this change of 328 million was primarily driven by a decrease in accrued expenses and accounts payable partially offset by a decrease in inventory and accounts and notes receivable 

net cash used in investing activities decreased 316 million versus 2014 primarily due to lower cash investment for the acquisitions of businesses of 319 million 

net cash used in financing activities increased 301 million versus 2014 primarily due to higher common stock repurchases of 230 million and higher dividend payments of 110 million 

sources of liquidity 

we generate significant ongoing cash flow cash provided by operations is our principal source of liquidity with 19 billion  provided in 2016  

at december 31 2016  our sources of liquidity included 



 

1 the majority of marketable securities could be liquidated into cash within a few days 

2 the revolving credit facility is maintained primarily to provide backup liquidity for our commercial paper borrowings and general corporate purposes at december 31 2016  we had 212 million  of commercial paper outstanding which effectively reduced the 175 billion  available capacity under our revolving credit facility to 154 billion  

3  the available capacity is net of letters of credit 

cash cash equivalents and marketable securities 

a significant portion of our cash flows is generated outside the us the geographic location of our cash and marketable securities aligns well with our ongoing investments we manage our worldwide cash requirements considering available funds among the many subsidiaries through which we conduct our business and the cost effectiveness with which those funds can be accessed as a result we do not anticipate any local liquidity restrictions to preclude us from funding our operating needs with local resources 

if we distribute our foreign cash balances to the us or to other foreign subsidiaries we could be required to accrue and pay us taxes for example if we repatriated cash from certain foreign subsidiaries whose earnings we have asserted are permanently reinvested outside of the us foreign earnings for which we assert permanent reinvestment outside the us consist primarily of earnings of our china and uk domiciled subsidiaries at present we do not foresee a need to repatriate any earnings from these subsidiaries for which we have asserted permanent reinvestment however to help fund cash needs of the us or other international subsidiaries as they arise we repatriate available cash from certain foreign subsidiaries whose earnings are not permanently reinvested when it is cost effective to do so earnings generated after december 31 2011 from our china operations are considered permanently reinvested while earnings generated prior to january 1 2012 for which us deferred tax liabilities have been recorded are expected to be repatriated in future years 

debt facilities and other sources of liquidity 

in february 2016 the board of directors authorized the issuance of up to 175 billion of unsecured shortterm promissory notes commercial paper pursuant to a commercial paper program the program will facilitate the private placement of unsecured shortterm debt through third party brokers we intend to use the net proceeds from the commercial paper program for general corporate purposes 

we have a 175 billion  revolving credit facility the proceeds of which can be used for general corporate purposes this facility expires on november 13 2020 the revolving credit facility is maintained primarily to provide backup liquidity for our commercial paper borrowings letters of credit and general corporate purposes the total combined borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facility and commercial paper program should not exceed 175 billion see note 9   debt  to our consolidated financial statements  for additional information the credit agreement includes one financial covenant a leverage ratio the required leverage ratio which measures the sum of total debt plus securitization financing to consolidated earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda as of the last day of any fiscal quarter for the four fiscal quarters ended on such date may not exceed 35 to 10 at december 31 2016  our leverage ratio was 075  to 10 

as a wellknown seasoned issuer we filed an automatic shelf registration for an undetermined amount of debt and equity securities with the securities and exchange commission on february 16 2016 under this shelf registration we may offer from time to time debt securities common stock preferred and preference stock depositary shares warrants stock purchase contracts and stock purchase units 

the maturity schedule of our existing longterm debt does not require significant cash outflows in the intermediate term required annual principal payments range from 4 million  to 35 million  over each of the next five years 

uses of cash 

share repurchases 

in december 2016 our board of directors authorized the acquisition of up to 1 billion of additional common stock upon completion of the 2015 repurchase plan   in november 2015 our board of directors authorized the acquisition of up to 1 billion of additional common stock upon the completion of the 2014 repurchase plan  in 2016  we made the following purchases under the respective purchase programs 



    

1 the remaining authorized capacity under the 2015 plan was calculated based on the cost to purchase the shares but excludes commission expenses in accordance with the authorized plan   

2  upon completion of the accelerated share repurchase in the second quarter of 2016 the shares purchased and average cost per share were updated based on the final valuation 

in 2016 we entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement with a third party financial institution to repurchase 500 million  of our common stock under our previously announced share repurchase plans and received   47 million  shares at an average purchase price of 10550  per share 

dividends 

total dividends paid to common shareholders in 2016  2015  and 2014  were 676 million  622 million  and 512 million  respectively declaration and payment of dividends in the future depends upon our income and liquidity position among other factors and is subject to declaration by our board of directors who meet quarterly to consider our dividend payment we expect to fund dividend payments with cash from operations 

in july 2016 our board of directors authorized an increase to our quarterly dividend of 51 percent from 0975 per share to 1025 per share  in july 2015 our board of directors authorized an increase to our quarterly dividend of 25 percent from 078 per share to 0975 per share in july 2014 the board of directors authorized a 25 percent increase to our quarterly dividend on our common stock from 0625 per share to 078 per share cash dividends per share paid to common shareholders for the last three years were as follows 



capital expenditures 

capital expenditures and spending on internal use software were 594 million  in 2016  compared to 799 million  in 2015  we continue to invest in new product lines and targeted capacity expansions we plan to spend between 500 million and 530 million in 2017 on capital expenditures as we continue with product launches and facility improvements approximately 50 percent of our capital expenditures are expected to be invested outside of the us in 2017 

pensions 

the funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon a variety of variables and assumptions including return on invested assets market interest rates and levels of voluntary contributions to the plans  in 2016  the investment return on our us pension trust was 72 percent while our uk pension trust return was 255 percent   approximately 78 percent of our pension plan assets are held in highly liquid investments such as fixed income and equity securities the remaining 22 percent of our plan assets are held in less liquid but market valued investments including real estate private equity venture capital opportunistic credit and insurance contracts 

we sponsor funded and unfunded domestic and foreign defined benefit pension plans contributions to these plans were as follows 

  

we anticipate making total contributions of approximately 134 million  to our defined benefit pension plans in 2017  expected contributions to our defined benefit pension plans in 2017  will meet or exceed the current funding requirements 

restructuring actions 

in 2015 we executed worldwide work force restructuring actions primarily in the form of professional voluntary and involuntary employee separation programs in response to lower demand for our products in the us and key markets around the world we incurred a charge of 90 million   61 million  aftertax for the headcount reductions with 86 million  expected to be settled in cash in 2016 we paid 58 million  and as of december 31 2016 substantially all terminations were complete see note 20   restructuring actions and other charges  to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

acquisitions 

during 2016 we paid 109 million   to acquire the remaining interest in the last two partially owned north american distributors including the related debt retirements and recognized a total gain of 15 million on the fair value adjustment resulting from the acquisition of the controlling interest in the previously unconsolidated entity  see note 18   acquisitions  to the consolidated financial statements  for additional information 

credit ratings 

our ratings and outlook from each of the credit rating agencies as of the date of filing are shown in the table below   



 

1   credit ratings are not recommendations to buy are subject to change and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating in addition we undertake no obligation to update disclosures concerning our credit ratings whether as a result of new information future events or otherwise    

managements assessment of liquidity 

our financial condition and liquidity remain strong our solid balance sheet and credit ratings enable us to have ready access to credit and the capital markets we assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate adequate cash to fund our operating investing and financing activities we believe our operating cash flow and liquidity provides us with the financial flexibility needed to fund working capital common stock repurchases capital expenditures dividend payments projected pension obligations and debt service obligations we continue to generate cash from operations in the us and maintain access to our revolving credit facility as noted above 

contractual obligations and other commercial commitments 

a summary of our contractual obligations and commercial commitments at december 31 2016  are as follows 



   

 the contractual obligations reported above exclude our unrecognized tax benefits of 59 million as of december 31 2016  we are not able to reasonably estimate the period in which cash outflows relating to uncertain tax contingencies could occur see note 3   income taxes  to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

our other commercial commitments at december 31 2016  are as follows 



application of critical accounting estimates 

a summary of our significant accounting policies is included in note 1   summary of significant accounting policies  of our consolidated financial statements  which discusses accounting policies that we have selected from acceptable alternatives 

our consolidated financial statements  are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the us gaap which often requires management to make judgments estimates and assumptions regarding uncertainties that affect the reported amounts presented and disclosed in the financial statements management reviews these estimates and assumptions based on historical experience changes in business conditions and other relevant factors they believe to be reasonable under the circumstances in any given reporting period our actual results may differ from the estimates and assumptions used in preparing our consolidated financial statements 

critical accounting estimates are defined as follows the estimate requires management to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the estimate was made different estimates reasonably could have been used or if changes in the estimate are reasonably likely to occur from period to period and the change would have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations our senior management has discussed the development and selection of our accounting policies related accounting estimates and the disclosures set forth below with the audit committee of our board of directors we believe our critical accounting estimates include those addressing the estimation of liabilities for warranty programs accounting for income taxes and pension benefits 

warranty programs 

we estimate and record a liability for base warranty programs at the time our products are sold our estimates are based on historical experience and reflect managements best estimates of expected costs at the time products are sold and subsequent adjustment to those expected costs when actual costs differ as a result of the uncertainty surrounding the nature and frequency of product recall programs the liability for such programs is recorded when we commit to a recall action or when a recall becomes probable and estimable which generally occurs when it is announced our warranty liability is generally affected by component failure rates repair costs and the point of failure within the product life cycle future events and circumstances related to these factors could materially change our estimates and require adjustments to our liability new product launches require a greater use of judgment in developing estimates until historical experience becomes available product specific experience is typically available four or five quarters after product launch with a clear experience trend evident eight quarters after launch we generally record warranty expense for new products upon shipment using a preceding products warranty history and a multiplicative factor based upon preceding similar product experience and new product assessment until sufficient new product data is available for warranty estimation we then use a blend of actual new product experience and preceding product historical experience for several subsequent quarters and new product specific experience thereafter note 10   product warranty liability  to our consolidated financial statements  contains a summary of the activity in our warranty liability account for 2016  and 2015  including adjustments to preexisting warranties 

accounting for income taxes 

we determine our income tax expense using the asset and liability method under this method deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax effects of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases future tax benefits of net operating loss and credit carryforwards are also recognized as deferred tax assets we evaluate the recoverability of our deferred tax assets each quarter by assessing the likelihood of future profitability and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize our net deferred tax assets  at december 31 2016  we recorded net deferred tax assets of 344 million  these assets included 313 million  for the value of net operating loss and credit carryforwards a valuation allowance of 307 million  was recorded to reduce the tax assets to the net value management believed was more likely than not to be realized in the event our operating performance deteriorates future assessments could conclude that a larger valuation allowance will be needed to further reduce the deferred tax assets in addition we operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and are subject to tax audits in these jurisdictions these audits can involve complex issues which may require an extended period of time to resolve we accrue for the estimated additional tax and interest that may result from tax authorities disputing uncertain tax positions we have taken and we believe we have made adequate provision for income taxes for all years that are subject to audit based upon the latest information available a more complete description of our income taxes and the future benefits of our net operating loss and credit carryforwards is disclosed in  note 3   income taxes  to our consolidated financial statements  

pension benefits 

we sponsor a number of pension plans primarily in the us and the uk and to a lesser degree in various other countries in the us and the uk we have several major defined benefit plans that are separately funded we account for our pension programs in accordance with employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans under gaap gaap requires that amounts recognized in financial statements be determined using an actuarial basis as a result our pension benefit programs are based on a number of statistical and judgmental assumptions that attempt to anticipate future events and are used in calculating the expense and liability related to our plans each year at december 31 these assumptions include discount rates used to value liabilities assumed rates of return on plan assets future compensation increases employee turnover rates actuarial assumptions relating to retirement age mortality rates and participant withdrawals the actuarial assumptions we use may differ significantly from actual results due to changing economic conditions participant life span and withdrawal rates these differences may result in a material impact to the amount of net periodic pension cost to be recorded in our consolidated financial statements  in the future 

the expected longterm return on plan assets is used in calculating the net periodic pension cost we considered several factors in developing our expected rate of return on plan assets the longterm rate of return considers historical returns and expected returns on current and projected asset allocations and is generally applied to a fiveyear average market value of return projected returns are based primarily on broad publicly traded fixed income and equity indices and forwardlooking estimates of active portfolio and investment management at december 31 2016 based upon our target asset allocations it is anticipated that our us investment policy will generate an average annual return over the 10year projection period equal to or in excess of 725 percent approximately 35 percent of the time while returns of 80 percent or greater are anticipated 26 percent of the time including the additional positive returns expected from active investment management  despite the 2016  oneyear return of 72 percent  our plan assets have averaged 100 percent  returns since 2010 and resulted in approximately 271 million  of 

actuarial gains in accumulated other comprehensive income in the same period based on the historical returns and forwardlooking return expectations we believe an investment return assumption of 725 percent  per year in 2017  for us pension assets is reasonable 

the methodology used to determine the rate of return on pension plan assets in the uk was based on establishing an equityrisk premium over current longterm bond yields adjusted based on target asset allocations at december 31 2016 based upon our target asset allocations it is anticipated that our uk investment policy will generate an average annual return over the 20year projection period equal to or in excess of 39 percent approximately 50 percent of the time while returns of 46 percent or greater are anticipated 25 percent of the time  we expect additional positive returns from active investment management the oneyear return for our uk plan was 255 percent  for 2016  and similar to our us plan the strong returns since 2010 have resulted in approximately 544 million  of actuarial gains in accumulated other comprehensive income our strategy with respect to our investments in pension plan assets is to be invested with a longterm outlook therefore the risk and return balance of our asset portfolio should reflect a longterm horizon based on the historical returns and forwardlooking return expectations we believe an investment return assumption of 45 percent  in 2017  for uk pension assets is reasonable our pension plan asset allocations at december 31 2016  and 2015  and target allocation for 2017  are as follows 



the differences between the actual return on plan assets and expected longterm return on plan assets are recognized in the asset value used to calculate net periodic cost over five years the table below sets forth the expected return assumptions used to develop our pension cost for the period 2014  2016  and our expected rate of return for 2017  



a lower expected rate of return will increase our net periodic pension cost and reduce profitability 

gaap for pensions offers various acceptable alternatives to account for the differences that eventually arise between the estimates used in the actuarial valuations and the actual results it is acceptable to delay or immediately recognize these differences under the delayed recognition alternative changes in pension obligation including those resulting from plan amendments and changes in the value of assets set aside to meet those obligations are not recognized in net periodic pension cost as they occur but are recognized initially in accumulated other comprehensive loss and subsequently amortized as components of net periodic pension cost systematically and gradually over future periods in addition to this approach gaap also allows immediate recognition of actuarial gains or losses immediate recognition introduces volatility in financial results we have chosen to delay recognition and amortize actuarial differences over future periods if we adopted the immediate recognition approach we would record a loss of 951 million   634 million  aftertax from cumulative actuarial net losses for our us and uk pension plans 

the difference between the expected return and the actual return on plan assets is deferred from recognition in our results of operations and under certain circumstances such as when the difference exceeds 10 percent  of the market value of plan assets or the projected benefit obligation amortized over future years of service this is also true of changes to actuarial assumptions under gaap the actuarial gains and losses are recognized and recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss at december 31 2016  we had net pension actuarial losses of 770 million  and 172 million  for the us and uk pension plans respectively as these amounts exceed 10 percent  of their respective plan assets the excess is amortized over the average remaining service lives of participating employees net actuarial losses decreased our shareholders equity by 65 million   aftertax in 2016  the loss is due to lower discount rates in the us and uk and unfavorable foreign currency partially offset by strong asset performance in the uk 

the table below sets forth the net periodic pension cost for the years ended december 31 and our expected cost for 2017  



we expect 2017  net periodic pension cost to increase  compared to 2016  primarily due to onboarding a significant portion of our newly acquired north american distributors to cummins pension benefits a lower expected rate of return in the us and uk and lower discount rates in the us and uk the decrease in net periodic pension cost in 2016  compared to 2015  was due to reduced loss amortizations in the us and uk and higher discount rates in the us and uk partially offset by lower expected asset returns in the uk as we derisked plan trust assets the increase  in net periodic pension cost in 2015  compared to 2014  was due to lower discount rates in the us and uk and unfavorable mortality demographics in the us another key assumption used in the development of the net periodic pension cost is the discount rate the weighted average discount rates used to develop our net periodic pension cost are set forth in the table below 



changes in the discount rate assumptions will impact the interest cost component of the net periodic pension cost calculation 

the discount rate enables us to state expected future cash payments for benefits as a present value on the measurement date the guidelines for setting this rate are discussed in gaap which suggests the use of a highquality corporate bond rate we used bond information provided by moodys investor services inc and standard  poors rating services all bonds used to develop our hypothetical portfolio in the us and uk were deemed highquality noncallable bonds aa or better at december 31 2016  by at least one of the bond rating agencies 

our model called for projected payments until near extinction for the us and the uk for both countries our model matches the present value of the plans projected benefit payments to the market value of the theoretical settlement bond portfolio a single equivalent discount rate is determined to align the present value of the required cash flow with the value of the bond portfolio the resulting discount rate is reflective of both the current interest rate environment and the plans distinct liability characteristics 

the table below sets forth the estimated impact on our 2017  net periodic pension cost relative to a change in the discount rate and a change in the expected rate of return on plan assets 



the above sensitivities reflect the impact of changing one assumption at a time a higher discount rate decreases the plan obligations and decreases our net periodic pension cost a lower discount rate increases the plan obligations and increases our net periodic pension cost it should be noted that economic factors and conditions often affect multiple assumptions simultaneously and the effects of changes in key assumptions are not necessarily linear note 8   pension and other postretirement benefits  to our consolidated financial statements  provides a summary of our pension benefit plan activity the funded status of our plans and the amounts recognized in our consolidated financial statements  

recently issued accounting pronouncements 

in august 2016 the financial accounting standards board fasb amended its standards related to the classification of certain cash receipts and cash payments the new standard will make eight targeted changes to how cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows the standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2017 and interim periods within those fiscal years early adoption is permitted including adoption in an interim period if 

an entity early adopts the amendments in an interim period any adjustments should be reflected as of the beginning of the fiscal year that includes that interim period an entity that elects early adoption must adopt all of the amendments in the same period the new standard will require adoption on a retrospective basis unless it is impracticable to apply in which case it would be required to apply the amendments prospectively as of the earliest date practicable we are in the process of evaluating the impact this standard will have on our  consolidated statements of cash flows 

in june 2016 the fasb amended its standards related to the accounting for credit losses on financial instruments this amendment introduces new guidance for accounting for credit losses on instruments including trade receivables and heldtomaturity debt securities the new rules are effective for annual and interim periods beginning after december 15 2019 early adoption is permitted for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2018 including interim periods within those fiscal years we are in the process of evaluating the impact the amendment will have on our  consolidated financial statements 

in march 2016 the fasb amended its standards related to the accounting for stock compensation this amendment addresses several aspects of the accounting for sharebased payment transactions that could impact us including but not limited to recognition of excess tax benefits or deficiencies in the income statement each period and classification of the excess tax benefits or deficiencies as operating activities in the cash flow statement the new standard is effective for annual periods beginning after december 15 2016 the adoption of this standard could result in future volatility in our income tax expense since all excess tax benefits and deficiencies are now recorded in the income statement we are unable to estimate this impact since the amount of excess benefits and deficiencies are dependent on our stock price at the time a stock award vests or is exercised 

in february 2016 the fasb amended its standards related to the accounting for leases under the new standard lessees will now be required to recognize substantially all leases on the balance sheet as both a rightofuseasset and a liability the standard will continue to have two types of leases for income statement recognition purposes operating leases and finance leases operating leases will result in the recognition of a single lease expense on a straightline basis over the lease term similar to the treatment for operating leases under todays standards finance leases will result in an accelerated expense similar to the accounting for capital leases under todays standards the determination of a lease classification as operating or finance will be done in a manner similar to todays standard the new standard also contains amended guidance regarding the identification of embedded leases in service contracts and the identification of lease and nonlease components in an arrangement the new standard is effective on january 1 2019 with early adoption permitted we are still evaluating the impact the standard could have on our  consolidated financial statements  however while we have not yet quantified the amount we do expect the standard will have a material impact on our  consolidated balance sheets  due to the recognition of additional assets and liabilities for operating leases   

in january 2016 the fasb amended its standards related to the accounting for certain financial instruments this amendment addresses certain aspects of recognition measurement presentation and disclosure the new rules will become effective for annual and interim periods beginning after december 15 2017 early adoption is not permitted we are in the process of evaluating the impact the amendment will have on our  consolidated financial statements  

in may 2014 the fasb amended its standards related to revenue recognition this amendment replaces all existing revenue recognition guidance and provides a single comprehensive revenue recognition model for all contracts with customers the standard contains principles that we will apply to determine the measurement of revenue and timing of when it is recognized the underlying principle is that we will recognize revenue in a manner that depicts the transfer of goods or services to customers at an amount that we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services the guidance provides a fivestep analysis of transactions to determine when and how revenue is recognized other major provisions include capitalization of certain contract costs consideration of the time value of money in the transaction price and allowing estimates of variable consideration to be recognized before contingencies are resolved in certain circumstances the amendment also requires additional disclosure about the nature amount timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts including significant judgments and changes in those judgments and assets recognized from costs incurred to fulfill a contract the standard allows either full or modified retrospective adoption effective for annual and interim periods beginning january 1 2018 we are in the process of evaluating the impact the amendment will have on our  consolidated financial statements   we expect to adopt the standard using the modified retrospective approach while we have not yet completed our evaluation process we have identified that a change will be required related to our accounting for remanufactured product sales that include an exchange of the used product referred to as core revenue is not currently recognized related to the core component unless the used product is not returned under the new standard the transaction will be accounted for as a gross sale and a purchase of inventory as a result the exchange will increase both sales and cost of sales in equal amounts related to the used core this will not impact gross margin dollars but will impact the gross margin percentage we are still quantifying the amount of this change we have also identified transactions where revenue recognition is currently limited to the amount of billings not contingent on our future performance with the allocation provisions of the new model we expect to accelerate the 

timing of revenue recognition for amounts related to satisfied performance obligations that would have been delayed under the current guidance we do not expect the impact of this change to be material but we are still quantifying the impact 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to financial risk resulting from volatility in foreign exchange rates interest rates and commodity prices this risk is closely monitored and managed through the use of financial derivative instruments including foreign currency forward contracts interest rate swaps commodity zerocost collars and physical forward contracts these instruments as further described below are accounted for as cash flow or fair value hedges or as economic hedges not designated as hedges for accounting purposes financial derivatives are used expressly for hedging purposes and under no circumstances are they used for speculative purposes when material we adjust the estimated fair value of our derivative contracts for counterparty or our credit risk none of our derivative instruments are subject to collateral requirements substantially all of our derivative contracts are subject to master netting arrangements which provide us with the option to settle certain contracts on a net basis when they settle on the same day with the same currency in addition these arrangements provide for a net settlement of all contracts with a given counterparty in the event that the arrangement is terminated due to the occurrence of default or a termination event   

we also enter into physical forward contracts with certain suppliers to purchase minimum volumes of commodities at contractually stated prices for various periods these arrangements as further described below enable us to fix the prices of portions of our normal purchases of these commodities which otherwise are subject to market volatility 

the following describes our risk exposures and provides the results of a sensitivity analysis performed at december 31 2016  the sensitivity analysis assumes instantaneous parallel shifts in foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices 

foreign exchange rate risk 

as a result of our international business presence we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risks we transact business in foreign currencies and as a result our income experiences some volatility related to movements in foreign currency exchange rates to help manage our exposure to exchange rate volatility we use foreign currency forward contracts on a regular basis to hedge forecasted intercompany and thirdparty sales and purchases denominated in nonfunctional currencies our internal policy allows for managing anticipated foreign currency cash flows for up to 18 months  these foreign currency forward contracts are designated and qualify as foreign currency cash flow hedges under gaap  for the years ended december 31 2016  and 2015  there were no circumstances that would have resulted in the discontinuance of a foreign currency cash flow hedge   

to minimize the income volatility resulting from the remeasurement of net monetary assets and payables denominated in a currency other than the functional currency we enter into foreign currency forward contracts which are considered economic hedges the objective is to offset the gain or loss from remeasurement with the gain or loss from the fair market valuation of the forward contract these derivative instruments are not designated as hedges under gaap   

at december 31 2016 the potential gain or loss in the fair value of our outstanding foreign currency contracts assuming a hypothetical 10  percent fluctuation in the currencies of such contracts would be approximately 63 million  the sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates assumes the notional value to remain constant for the next 12 months the analysis ignores the impact of foreign exchange movements on our competitive position and potential changes in sales levels any change in the value of the contracts real or hypothetical would be significantly offset by an inverse change in the value of the underlying hedged items  

interest rate risk   

we are exposed to market risk from fluctuations in interest rates we manage our exposure to interest rate fluctuations through the use of interest rate swaps the objective of the swaps is to more effectively balance our borrowing costs and interest rate risk   

in february 2014 we settled our november 2005 interest rate swap which previously converted our 250 million  debt issue due in 2028 from a fixed rate  of 7125 percent  to a floating rate based on the libor   plus a spread   also in february 2014 we entered into a series of interest rate swaps to effectively convert our september 2013 500 million  debt issue due in 2023 from a fixed rate of 365 percent  to a floating rate equal to the onemonth libor   plus a spread  the terms of the swaps mirror those of the debt with interest paid semiannually the swaps were designated and will be accounted for as fair value hedges under gaap the gain or loss on these derivative instruments as well as the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in current income as “interest expense” the net swap settlements that accrue each period are also reported in interest expense 

the following table summarizes these gains and losses for the years presented below   



 

1   the difference between the gainloss on swaps and borrowings represents hedge ineffectiveness 

commodity price risk   

we are exposed to fluctuations in commodity prices due to contractual agreements with component suppliers in order to protect ourselves against future price volatility and consequently fluctuations in gross margins we periodically enter into commodity zerocost collar contracts with designated banks to fix the cost of certain raw material purchases with the objective of minimizing changes in inventory cost due to market price fluctuations these commodity zerocost collar contracts that represent an economic hedge but are not designated for hedge accounting and are marked to market through earnings our internal policy allows for managing our cash flow hedges for up to three years 

at december 31 2016 the potential gain or loss related to the outstanding commodity zerocost collar contracts assuming a hypothetical 10  percent fluctuation in the price of such commodities was less than   1 million  the sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in commodity prices assumes the notional value to remain constant for the next 12 months the analysis ignores the impact of commodity price movements on our competitive position and potential changes in sales levels any change in the value of the zerocost collar contracts real or hypothetical would be significantly offset by an inverse change in the value of the underlying hedged items   

we also limit our exposure to commodity price risk by entering into purchasing arrangements to fix the price of certain volumes of platinum and palladium expected to be used in our products during 2014 we began entering into physical forward contracts with suppliers of platinum and palladium to purchase some volumes of the commodities at contractually stated prices for various periods generally not exceeding one year these arrangements enable us to fix the prices of a portion of our purchases of these commodities which otherwise are subject to market volatility

joint ventures alliances and nonwhollyowned subsidiaries 

we have entered into a number of joint venture agreements and alliances with business partners around the world our joint ventures are either distribution or manufacturing entities we also own controlling interests in nonwhollyowned manufacturing and distribution subsidiaries three entities in which we own more than a 50 percent equity interest or have a controlling interest are consolidated in our distribution segment results as well as several manufacturing joint ventures in the other operating segments 

in the event of a change of control of either party to certain of these joint ventures and other strategic alliances certain consequences may result including automatic termination and liquidation of the venture exercise of put or call rights of ownership by the nonacquired partner termination or transfer of technology license rights to the nonacquired partner and increases in component transfer prices to the acquired partner we will continue to evaluate joint venture and partnership opportunities in order to penetrate new markets develop new products and generate manufacturing and operational efficiencies 

financial information about our investments in joint ventures and alliances is incorporated by reference from note 2   investments in equity investees  to the consolidated financial statements 

our equity income from these investees was as follows 



 

1  this total represents our share of net income of our equity investees and is exclusive of royalties and interest income from our equity investees to see how this amount reconciles to equity royalty and interest income from investees in the consolidated statements of income  see note 2   investments in equity investees  to our consolidated financial statements for additional information  

distribution entities 

 see further discussion of our distribution network under the distribution segment section above 

manufacturing entities 

our manufacturing joint ventures have generally been formed with customers and generally are intended to allow us to increase our market penetration in geographic regions reduce capital spending streamline our supply chain management and develop technologies our largest manufacturing joint ventures are based in china and are included in the list below our engine manufacturing joint ventures are supplied by our components segment in the same manner as it supplies our whollyowned engine segment and power generation segment manufacturing facilities our components segment joint ventures and wholly owned entities provide fuel systems filtration aftertreatment systems and turbocharger products that are used in our engines as well as some competitors products the results and investments in our joint ventures in which we have 50 percent  or less ownership interest are included in “equity royalty and interest income from investees” and “investments and advances related to equity method investees” in our consolidated statements of income   and   consolidated balance sheets  respectively   

 nonwhollyowned subsidiary 

we have a controlling interest in cummins india ltd cil which is a publicly listed company on various stock exchanges in india cil produces midrange heavyduty and highhorsepower engines generators for the indian and export markets and natural gas sparkignited engines for power generation automotive and industrial applications cil also has distribution and power generation operations 

supply 

the performance of the endtoend supply chain extending through to our suppliers is foundational to our ability to meet customers expectations and support longterm growth we are committed to having a robust strategy for how we select and manage our suppliers to enable a market focused supply chain this requires us to continuously evaluate and upgrade our supply base as necessary to ensure we are meeting the needs of our customers 

we use a category strategy process a process designed to create the most value for the company that reviews our long term needs and guides decisions on what we make internally and what we purchase externally for the items we decide to purchase externally the strategies also identify the suppliers we should partner with long term to provide the best technology the lowest total cost and highest supply chain performance we design andor manufacture our strategic components used in or with our engines and power generation units including cylinder blocks and heads turbochargers connecting rods camshafts crankshafts filters alternators electronic and emissions controls and fuel systems we source externally purchased material and manufactured components from leading global suppliers many key suppliers are managed through longterm supply agreements that assure capacity delivery quality and cost requirements are met over an extended period approximately 56  percent of the direct material in our product designs are single sourced to external suppliers although we have elected to source a relatively high proportion of our total raw materials and components from single suppliers we have an established sourcing strategy and supplier management process to evaluate and mitigate risk these processes are leading us to determine our need for dual sourcing and increase our use of dual and parallel sources to minimize risk and increase supply chain responsiveness our current target for dual and parallel sourcing is approximately 63 percent  of our direct material spend as of december 31 2015  our analysis indicates that we have 44 percent  of direct material spend with dual or parallel sources or 70 percent  of our target 

other important elements of our sourcing strategy include 

 patents and trademarks 

we own or control a significant number of patents and trademarks relating to the products we manufacture these patents and trademarks were granted and registered over a period of years although these patents and trademarks are generally considered beneficial to our operations we do not believe any patent group of patents or trademark other than our leading brand house trademarks is significant to our business 

seasonality 

while individual product lines may experience modest seasonal variation in production there is no material effect on the demand for the majority of our products on a quarterly basis with the exception that our power generation segment normally experiences seasonal declines in the first quarter due to general declines in construction spending during this period and our distribution segment normally experiences seasonal declines in its first quarter business activity due to holiday periods in asia and australia 

largest customers 

we have thousands of customers around the world and have developed longstanding business relationships with many of them paccar is our largest customer accounting for approximately 15 percent of our consolidated net sales in 2015 compared to approximately 14 percent in 2014 and 12 percent in 2013 we have longterm supply agreements with paccar for our heavyduty isx 15 liter and isx 119 liter engines and our isl 9 liter midrange engine while a significant number of our sales to paccar are under longterm supply agreements these agreements provide for particular engine requirements for specific vehicle models and not a specific volume of engines paccar is our only customer accounting for more than 10 percent of our net sales in 2015 the loss of this customer or a significant decline in the production level of paccar vehicles that use our engines would have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition we have been an engine supplier to paccar for over 71 years a summary of principal customers for each operating segment is included in our segment discussion 

in addition to our agreement with paccar we have longterm heavyduty engine supply agreements with daimler trucks north america navistar and volvo trucks north america and longterm midrange supply agreements with daimler trucks north america navistar and man we also have an agreement with fiat chrysler to supply engines for its ram trucks in our offhighway markets we have various engine and component supply agreements across our midrange and highhorsepower businesses with komatsu ltd as well as various joint ventures and other license agreements in our engine component and distribution segments  collectively our net sales to these seven customers including paccar were approximately 40 percent of our consolidated net sales in 2015  compared to approximately 36 percent in 2014 and 34 percent in 2013  excluding paccar net sales to any single customer were less than 9 percent of our consolidated net sales in 2015  compared to less than 

8 percent in 2014 and less than 7 percent in 2013  these agreements contain standard purchase and sale agreement terms covering engine and engine parts pricing quality and delivery commitments as well as engineering product support obligations the basic nature of our agreements with oem customers is that they are longterm price and operations agreements that help assure the availability of our products to each customer through the duration of the respective agreements agreements with most oems contain bilateral termination provisions giving either party the right to terminate in the event of a material breach change of control or insolvency or bankruptcy of the other party   

backlog 

we have supply agreements with some truck and offhighway equipment oems however most of our business is transacted through open purchase orders these open orders are historically subject to monthtomonth releases and are subject to cancellation on reasonable notice without cancellation charges and therefore are not considered firm at december 31 2015  we did not have any significant backlogs 

research and development 

in 2015  we decrease d our research development and engineering expenses however we continued to invest in future critical technologies and products we will continue to make investments to improve our current technologies continue to meet the future emission requirements around the world and improve fuel economy 

our research and development program is focused on product improvements innovations and cost reductions for our customers research and development expenditures include salaries contractor fees building costs utilities administrative expenses and allocation of corporate costs and are expensed net of contract reimbursements when incurred from time to time we enter into agreements with customers to fund a portion of the research and development costs of a particular project we generally account for these reimbursements as an offset to the related research and development expenditure research and development expenses net of contract reimbursements were 718 million  in 2015   737 million  in 2014 and 700 million  in 2013  contract reimbursements were 98 million  in 2015   121 million  in 2014 and 76 million  in 2013   

for 2015 2014 and 2013 approximately 90 million 60 million and 32 million or 13 percent 8 percent and 5 percent respectively of our research and development expenditures were directly related to compliance with 2017 epa emission standards 

environmental sustainability 

we adopted our first comprehensive environmental sustainability plan in 2014 to continue to positively impact the environment through the products we make the way we use our facilities management of our supply chain and improvement of the communities where we live and work we examined our entire environmental footprint focusing on the key areas of water waste energy and greenhouse gases and identified the top four environmental sustainability priorities of products inuse materials and fuel efficiency transportation and facilities and operations we set initial goals in our facilities where we have the most data influence and experience to 

 in 2015 we set two new environmental sustainability goals 

 in addition in 2016 we expect to articulate a strategy around efficiency in product design and a material management strategy to decouple business growth from natural resource use 

since 2010 we reduced companywide water use intensity by approximately 36 percent uswide processderived hazardous waste generation by approximately 29 percent and companywide disposal waste by approximately 41 percent all normalized to total work hours as part of the us department of energys better buildings better plants program we pledged to achieve 

a 25 percent energy intensity energy use adjusted for sales reduction by 2015 at the end of 2014 we had achieved a 34 percent reduction 

we articulated our positions on key public policy issues and on a wide range of environmental issues we are actively engaged with regulatory industry and other stakeholder groups around the world as greenhouse gas and fuel efficiency standards become more prevalent globally for the tenth consecutive year we were named to the dow jones north american sustainability index and were included in the 2015 “disclosure leadership index” of the carbon disclosure project’s climate report in 2014 we were identified as a “natural capital decoupling leader” by green biz group and trucost for reductions in environmental footprint amid company growth our sustainability report for 20142015 and prior reports as well as data book of more detailed environmental data are available on our website at wwwcumminscom  although such reports and data book are not incorporated into this form 10k 

environmental compliance 

product environmental compliance 

cummins strives to have robust certification and compliance processes adhering to all emissions regulations worldwide including prohibiting the use of defeat devices in all of our products we are transparent with all governing bodies in these processes from disclosure of the design and operation of the emission control system to test processes and results and later to any necessary reporting and corrective action processes if required 

we work collaboratively and proactively with emission regulators globally to ensure emission standards are clear appropriately stringent and enforceable in an effort to ensure our products deliver on our commitments to our customers and the environment in real world use every day 

our engines are subject to extensive statutory and regulatory requirements that directly or indirectly impose standards governing emission and noise we have substantially increased our global environmental compliance presence and expertise to   understand and meet emerging product environmental regulations around the world our ability to comply with these and future emission standards is an essential element in maintaining our leadership position in regulated markets we have made and will continue to make significant capital and research expenditures to comply with these standards our failure to comply with these standards could result in adverse effects on our future financial results 

eu and epa engine certifications 

the current onhighway emission standards came into effect in the european union eu on january 1 2013 euro vi and on january 1 2010 for the epa to meet the more stringent heavyduty onhighway emission standards we used an evolution of our proven selective catalytic reduction scr and exhaust gas recirculation egr technology solutions and refined them for the eu and epa certified engines to maintain power and torque with substantial fuel economy improvement and maintenance intervals comparable with our previous compliant engines we offer a complete lineup of onhighway engines to meet the nearzero emission standards midrange and heavyduty engines for eu and epa require nox aftertreatment nox reduction is achieved by an integrated technology solution comprised of the xpi high pressure common rail fuel system scr technology nextgeneration cooled egr advanced electronic controls proven air handling and the cummins diesel particulate filter dpf the eu epa and california air resources board carb have certified that our engines meet the current emission requirements emission standards in international markets including japan mexico australia brazil russia india and china are becoming more stringent we believe that our experience in meeting the eu and epa emission standards leaves us well positioned to take advantage of opportunities in these markets as the need for emission control capability grows 

we received certification from the epa that we met both the epa 2013 and 2014 greenhouse gas ghg regulations and rules the epa 2013 regulations add the requirement of onboard diagnostics which were introduced on the isx15 in 2010 across the full onhighway product line in 2013 in addition to maintaining the same nearzero emission levels of nox and particulate matter pm required in 2010 onboard diagnostics provide enhanced service capability with standardized diagnostic trouble codes service tool interface incab warning lamp and service information availability the new ghg and fuelefficiency regulations were required for all heavyduty diesel and natural gas engines beginning in january 2014 our ghg certification was the first engine certificate issued by the epa and uses the same proven base engine with the xpi fuel system variable geometry turbocharger vgt tm  cummins aftertreatment system with dpf and scr technology 

other environmental statutes and regulations 

expenditures for environmental control activities and environmental remediation projects at our facilities in the us have not been a substantial portion of our annual capital outlays and are not expected to be material in 2016 we believe we are in compliance in all material respects with laws and regulations applicable to our plants and operations 

in the us pursuant to notices received from federal and state agencies andor defendant parties in site environmental contribution actions we have been identified as a potentially responsible party under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of 1980 as amended or similar state laws at fewer than 20 waste disposal sites based upon our experiences at similar sites we believe that our aggregate future remediation costs will not be significant we have established accruals that we believe are adequate for our expected future liability with respect to these sites 

in addition we have several other sites where we are working with governmental authorities on remediation projects the costs for these remediation projects are not expected to be material 

employees 

at december 31 2015 we employed approximately 55200 persons worldwide approximately 17740 of our employees worldwide are represented by various unions under collective bargaining agreements that expire between 2016 and 2021

 item 1a risk factors 

set forth below and elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k are some of the principal risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual business results to differ materially from any forwardlooking statements contained in this report and could individually or in combination have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows these risk factors should be considered in addition to our cautionary comments concerning forwardlooking statements in this report including statements related to markets for our products and trends in our business that involve a number of risks and uncertainties our separate section above cautionary statements regarding forwardlooking information should be considered in addition to the following statements 

a sustained slowdown or significant downturn in our markets could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial condition or cash flows 

our financial performance in the last 3 years has been supported by improving demand in onhighway markets in north america while demand in most international markets has been weak our revenues from international markets have been significantly impacted by unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations related to the stronger us dollar and slower growth in emerging markets especially china which has negatively impacted global demand for offhighway equipment  if the global economy or some of our significant markets encounter a sustained slowdown depending upon the length duration and severity of such a slowdown our results of operations financial condition or cash flows would almost certainly be materially adversely affected specifically our revenues would likely decrease we may be forced to consider further restructuring actions we may need to increase our allowance for doubtful accounts our days sales outstanding may increase and we could experience impairments to assets of certain of our businesses   

a downturn in the north american truck industry or other factors negatively affecting any of our truck oem customers could materially adversely impact our results of operations   

we recognize significant sales of engines and components to a few large truck oems in north america the north american onhighway markets have been a large driver of our positive business results for the last few years if the north american truck market suffers a significant downturn or if one of our large truck oem customers experiences financial distress or bankruptcy such circumstance would likely lead to significant reductions in our revenues and earnings commercial disputes receivable collection issues and other negative consequences that could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations   

our truck manufacturers and original equipment manufacturers oems customers may not continue to outsource their engine supply needs 

several of our engine customers including paccar volvo ab navistar fiat chrysler daimler and dcec are truck manufacturers or oems that manufacture engines for some of their own products despite their own engine manufacturing abilities these customers have historically chosen to outsource certain types of engine production to us due to the quality of our engine products our emission capabilities our systems integration their customers preferences their desire for cost reductions their desire for eliminating production risks and their desire to maintain company focus however there can be no assurance that these customers will continue to outsource or outsource as much of their engine production in the future in fact several of these customers have expressed their intention to significantly increase their own engine production and to decrease engine purchases from us in addition increased levels of oem vertical integration could result from a number of factors such as shifts in our customers business strategies acquisition by a customer of another engine manufacturer the inability of thirdparty suppliers to meet product specifications and the emergence of lowcost production opportunities in foreign countries any significant reduction in the level of engine production outsourcing from our truck manufacturer or oem customers could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

the discovery of any significant problems with our recentlyintroduced engine platforms in north america could materially adversely impact our results of operations financial condition and cash flow   

the epa and carb have certified all of our 20122013 onhighway and offhighway engines which utilize scr technology to meet requisite emission levels we introduced scr technology into our engine platforms in 2010 the effective performance of scr technology and the overall performance of these engine platforms impact a number of our operating segments and remain crucial to our success in north america while these 2010 and 2013 engine platforms have generally performed well in the field the discovery of any significant problems in these platforms could result in recall campaigns increased warranty costs reputational risk and brand risk and could materially adversely impact our results of operations financial condition or cash flows 

further slowdown in infrastructure development could adversely affect our business   

infrastructure development has been a significant driver of growth over time but as the pace of investment in infrastructure has slowed in recent years especially in the emerging markets of china and brazil demand for our products in offhighway markets has weakened if the slowdown in infrastructure development continues or increases in severity as a result of weaker economic growth or other circumstances our business could be adversely affected 

unpredictability in the adoption implementation and enforcement of increasingly stringent emission standards by multiple jurisdictions around the world could adversely affect our business   

our engines are subject to extensive statutory and regulatory requirements governing emission and noise including standards imposed by the epa the european union state regulatory agencies such as the carb and other regulatory agencies around the world we have made and will be required to continue to make significant capital and research expenditures to comply with these emission standards developing engines and components to meet numerous changing government regulatory requirements with different implementation timelines and emission requirements makes developing engines efficiently for multiple markets complicated and could result in substantial additional costs that may be difficult to recover in certain markets in some cases we may be required to develop new products to comply with new regulations particularly those relating to air emissions while we have met previous deadlines our ability to comply with other existing and future regulatory standards will be essential for us to maintain our position in the engine markets we serve the successful development and introduction of new and enhanced products in order to comply with new regulatory requirements are subject to other risks such as delays in product development cost overruns and unanticipated technical and manufacturing difficulties in addition to these risks the nature and timing of government implementation and enforcement of increasingly stringent emission standards in emerging markets are unpredictable and subject to change any delays in implementation or enforcement could result in the products we developed or modified to comply with these standards becoming unnecessary or becoming necessary later than expected thereby in some cases negating our competitive advantage this in turn can delay diminish or eliminate the expected return on capital and research expenditures that we have invested in such products and may adversely affect our perceived competitive advantage in being an early advanced developer of compliant engines 

we are subject to foreign currency exchange rate and other related risks   

we conduct operations in many areas of the world involving transactions denominated in a variety of currencies we are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk to the extent that our costs are denominated in currencies other than those in which we earn revenues in addition since our financial statements are denominated in us dollars changes in foreign currency exchange rates between the us dollar and other currencies have had and will continue to have an impact on our results of operations the us dollar has strengthened in recent years and has resulted in material unfavorable impacts on our financial statements if the us dollar continues to strengthen against other currencies we will continue to experience additional unfavorable impacts to our financial statements while we customarily enter into financial transactions that attempt to address these risks and many of our supply agreements with customers include foreign currency exchange rate adjustment provisions there can be no assurance that foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations will not adversely affect our results of operations in addition while the use of currency hedging instruments may provide us with some protection from adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates by utilizing these instruments we potentially forego the benefits that might result from favorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates we also face risks arising from the imposition of foreign exchange controls and currency devaluations foreign exchange controls may limit our ability to convert foreign currencies into us dollars or to remit dividends and other payments by our foreign subsidiaries or businesses located in or conducted within a country imposing controls currency devaluations result in a diminished value of funds denominated in the currency of the country instituting the devaluation 

we derive significant income from investees that we do not directly control   

for 2015 we recognized 315 million of equity royalty and interest income from investees compared to 370 million in 2014   approximately half of our equity royalty and interest income from investees is from   three of our 50 percent owned joint ventures in china beijing foton cummins engine co ltd bfcec dongfeng cummins engine company ltd dcec and chongqing cummins engine company ltd ccec   as a result although a significant percentage of our net income is derived from these unconsolidated entities we do not unilaterally control their management or their operations which puts a substantial portion of our net income at risk from the actions or inactions of these entities a significant reduction in the level of contribution by these entities to our net income would likely have a material adverse effect on our results of operations   

we may fail to realize all of the expected enhanced revenue earnings cash flow cost savings and other benefits from the integration of our partiallyowned united states and canadian distributors   

our ability to realize all of the expected enhanced revenue earnings cash flow cost savings and other benefits from our recent distributor acquisitions will depend in substantial part on our ability to successfully complete the integration of the acquired distributors with our other businesses while we believe we will ultimately achieve these expected benefits it is possible that we will be unable to achieve all of the objectives within our anticipated time frame or in the anticipated amounts the expected benefits from integration also may not be fully realized or may be delayed due to certain prohibitions in applicable state franchise and distributor laws if we are not able to successfully complete our integration strategy the anticipated enhanced revenue earnings cash flow cost savings and other benefits resulting from our distributor acquisitions may not be realized fully or may take longer to realize than expected 

delays encountered or increased costs incurred in completing the integration of these acquisitions could negatively impact our revenues expenses operating results cash flow and financial condition after completion of the acquisitions including the loss of current customers or suppliers increased exposure to legal claims and other liabilities and the distraction or departure of key managers and employees 

our plan to grow through strategic acquisitions may expose us to additional costs and risks   

part of our strategic plan is to increase our revenue and earnings by strategic acquisitions if we determine they are likely to provide future financial and operational benefits there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify suitable candidates or consummate these acquisitions on favorable terms the successful identification and completion of any strategic acquisition depends on a number of factors that are not entirely within our control including the availability of suitable candidates and our ability to negotiate terms acceptable to all parties involved conclude satisfactory agreements and obtain all necessary regulatory approvals accordingly we may not be able to successfully negotiate and complete a specific transaction in addition our ability to effectively integrate any potential acquisition into our existing business and culture may not be successful which could jeopardize future financial and operational performance for the combined businesses the exploration negotiation and consummation of strategic transactions may involve significant expenditures by us which may adversely affect our results of operations at the time such expenses are incurred and may divert management’s attention from our existing business acquisitions also may have adverse effects on our existing business relationships with suppliers and customers if required the financing for strategic transactions could result in an increase in our indebtedness dilute the interests of our shareholders or both any acquisition may not be accretive to us for a significant period of time following the completion of such acquisition in addition if an acquisition results in any additional goodwill or increase in other intangible assets on our balance sheet and subsequently becomes impaired we would be required to record a noncash impairment charge which could result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

we may experience difficulties and delays or unexpected costs in completing our restructuring and cost reduction initiatives including achieving any anticipated savings and other benefits of these initiatives   

during the fourth quarter of 2015 we undertook restructuring and cost reduction initiatives to respond to the slowdown in our global markets as we implement these initiatives we may not realize anticipated savings or other benefits from one or more of the initiatives in the amounts or within the time periods we expect other events and circumstances such as implementation difficulties and delays or unexpected costs may occur which could result in our not realizing our targeted cost reductions we are also subject to the risks of negative publicity and business disruption in connection with our restructuring and other cost reduction initiatives if we are unable to realize the expected savings or benefits from these initiatives certain aspects of our business may be adversely affected if we experience any of these circumstances or otherwise fail to realize the anticipated savings or benefits from our restructuring and cost reduction initiatives our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

we are vulnerable to supply shortages from singlesourced suppliers   

during 2015 we single sourced approximately 56 percent of the total types of parts in our product designs compared to approximately 55 percent in 2014 any delay in our suppliers deliveries may adversely affect our operations at multiple manufacturing locations forcing us to seek alternative supply sources to avoid serious disruptions delays may be caused by factors affecting our suppliers including capacity constraints labor disputes economic downturns availability of credit the impaired financial condition of a particular supplier suppliers allocations to other purchasers weather emergencies natural disasters or acts of war or terrorism any extended delay in receiving critical supplies could impair our ability to deliver products to our customers and our results of operations   

our products are exposed to variability in material and commodity costs   

our businesses establish prices with our customers in accordance with contractual time frames however the timing of material and commodity market price increases may prevent us from passing these additional costs on to our customers through timely pricing actions additionally higher material and commodity costs around the world may offset our efforts to reduce our cost structure while we customarily enter into financial transactions and contractual pricing adjustment provisions with our customers that attempt to address some of these risks notably with respect to copper platinum and palladium there can be no assurance that commodity price fluctuations will not adversely affect our results of operations in addition while the use of commodity price hedging instruments and contractual pricing adjustments may provide us with some protection from adverse fluctuations in commodity prices by utilizing these instruments we potentially forego the benefits that might result from favorable fluctuations in price as a result higher material and commodity costs as well as hedging these commodity costs during periods of decreasing prices could result in declining margins   

our products are subject to recall for performance or safetyrelated issues   

our products may be subject to recall for performance or safetyrelated issues product recalls subject us to harm to our reputation loss of current and future customers reduced revenue and product recall costs product recall costs are incurred when we decide either voluntarily or involuntarily to recall a product through a formal campaign to solicit the return of specific products due to a known or suspected performance issue any significant product recalls could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows   

we face significant competition in the markets we serve   

the markets in which we operate are highly competitive we compete worldwide with a number of other manufacturers and distributors that produce and sell similar products we primarily compete in the market with diesel engines and related diesel products however new technologies continue to be developed for gasoline natural gas and other technologies and we will continue to face new competition from these expanding technologies our products primarily compete on the basis of price performance fuel economy speed of delivery quality and customer support we also face competitors in some emerging markets who have established local practices and long standing relationships with participants in these markets there can be no assurance that our products will be able to compete successfully with the products of other companies and in other markets for a more complete discussion of the competitive environment in which each of our segments operates see “operating segments” in “item 1 business”   

increasing global competition among our customers may affect our existing customer relationships and restrict our ability to benefit from some of our customers growth   

as our customers in emerging markets continue to grow in size and scope they are increasingly seeking to export their products to other countries this has meant greater demand for our advanced engine technologies to help these customers meet the more stringent emissions requirements of developed markets as well as greater demand for access to our distribution systems for purposes of equipment servicing as these emerging market customers enter into and begin to compete in more developed markets they may increasingly begin to compete with our existing customers in these markets our further aid to emerging market customers could adversely affect our relationships with developed market customers and as a result we may be pressured to restrict sale or support of some of our products in the areas of increased competition in addition to the extent the competition does not correspond to overall growth in demand we may see little or no benefit from this type of expansion by our emerging market customers 

we are exposed to and may be adversely affected by potential security breaches or other disruptions to our information technology systems and data security   

we rely on the capacity reliability and security of our information technology systems and data security infrastructure in connection with various aspects of our business activities we also rely on our ability to expand and continually update these systems and infrastructure in response to the changing needs of our business as we implement new systems they may not perform as expected we also face the challenge of supporting our older systems and implementing necessary upgrades in addition some of these systems are managed by third party service providers and are not under our direct control if we experience a problem with an important information technology system including during system upgrades andor new system implementations the resulting disruptions could have an adverse effect on our business and reputation 

the information handled by our information technology systems is vulnerable to security threats our operations routinely involve receiving storing processing and transmitting sensitive information pertaining to our business customers dealers suppliers employees and other sensitive matters information technology security threats such as security breaches computer malware and other cyber attacks which are increasing in both frequency and sophistication could result in unauthorized disclosures of information and create financial liability subject us to legal or regulatory sanctions or damage our reputation 

with customers dealers suppliers and other stakeholders we continuously seek to maintain a robust program of information security and controls but the impact of a material information technology event could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position reputation results of operations financial condition and cash flow   

we are exposed to political economic and other risks that arise from operating a multinational business   

approximately 44 percent of our net sales for 2015 and 48 percent in 2014 were attributable to customers outside the us   accordingly our business is subject to the political economic and other risks that are inherent in operating in numerous countries these risks include   

 as we continue to operate our business globally our success will depend in part on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these and other related risks there can be no assurance that the consequences of these and other factors relating to our multinational operations will not have a material adverse effect upon us   

unanticipated changes in our effective tax rate the adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could adversely affect our profitability 

we are subject to income taxes in the us and numerous international jurisdictions our income tax provision and cash tax liability in the future could be adversely affected by changes in the distribution of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities changes to our assertions regarding permanent reinvestment of our foreign earnings changes in tax laws and the discovery of new information in the course of our tax return preparation process the carrying value of deferred tax assets which are predominantly in the us is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income in the us we are also subject to ongoing tax audits these audits can involve complex issues which may require an extended period of time to resolve and can be highly judgmental tax authorities may disagree with certain tax reporting positions taken by us and as a result assess additional taxes against us we regularly assess the likely outcomes of these audits in order to determine the appropriateness of our tax provision the amounts ultimately paid upon resolution of these or subsequent tax audits could be materially different from the amounts previously included in our income tax provision and therefore could have a material impact on our tax provision   

our global operations are subject to laws and regulations that impose significant compliance costs and create reputational and legal risk   

due to the international scope of our operations we are subject to a complex system of commercial and trade regulations around the world recent years have seen an increase in the development and enforcement of laws regarding trade compliance and anticorruption such as the us foreign corrupt practices act and similar laws from other countries our numerous foreign subsidiaries affiliates and joint venture partners are governed by laws rules and business practices that differ from those of the us the activities of these entities may not comply with us laws or business practices or our code of business conduct violations of these laws may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions could disrupt our business and result in an adverse effect on our reputation business and results of operations or financial condition we cannot predict the nature scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our operations might be subject or the manner in which existing laws might be administered or interpreted   

we face the challenge of accurately aligning our capacity with our demand   

we can experience idle capacity as economies slow or demand for certain products decline accurately forecasting our expected volumes and appropriately adjusting our capacity have been and will continue to be important factors in determining our results of operations if we overestimate our demand and overbuild our capacity we may have significantly underutilized assets and we may experience reduced margins if we do not accurately align our manufacturing capabilities with demand it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations   

our business is exposed to risks of product liability claims   

we face an inherent business risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that our products failure to perform to specification results or is alleged to result in property damage bodily injury andor death at any given time we are subject to various and multiple product liability claims any one of which if decided adversely to us may have a material adverse effect on our reported results of operation in the period in which our liability with respect to any such claim is recognized while we maintain insurance coverage with respect to certain product liability claims we may not be able to obtain such insurance on acceptable terms in the future if at all and any such insurance may not provide adequate coverage against product liability claims in addition product liability claims can be expensive to defend and can divert the attention of management and other personnel for significant periods of time regardless of the ultimate outcome furthermore even if we are successful in defending against a claim relating to our products claims of this nature could cause our customers to lose confidence in our products and us   

our operations are subject to increasingly stringent environmental laws and regulations   

our plants and operations are subject to increasingly stringent environmental laws and regulations in all of the countries in which we operate including laws and regulations governing air emission discharges to water and the generation handling storage transportation treatment and disposal of waste materials while we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with these environmental laws and regulations there can be no assurance that we will not be adversely impacted by costs liabilities or claims with respect to existing or subsequently acquired operations under either present laws and regulations or those that may be adopted or imposed in the future we are also subject to laws requiring the cleanup of contaminated property if a release of hazardous substances occurs at or from any of our current or former properties or at a landfill or another location where we have disposed of hazardous materials we may be held liable for the contamination and the amount of such liability could be material   

we are exposed to risks arising from the price and availability of energy   

the level of demand for our products and services is influenced in multiple ways by the price and availability of energy high energy costs generally drive greater demand for better fuel economy in almost all countries in which we operate some of our engine products have been developed with a primary purpose of offering fuel economy improvements and if energy costs decrease or increase less than expected demand for these products may likewise decrease the relative unavailability of electricity in some emerging market countries also influences demand for our electricity generating products such as our diesel generators if these countries add energy capacity by expanding their power grids at a rate equal to or faster than the growth in demand for energy the demand for our generating products could also decrease or increase less than would otherwise be the case 

significant declines in future financial and stock market conditions could diminish our pension plan asset performance and adversely impact our results of operations financial condition and cash flow   

we sponsor both funded and unfunded domestic and foreign defined benefit pension and other retirement plans our pension cost and the required contributions to our pension plans are directly affected by the value of plan assets the projected and actual rates of return on plan assets and the actuarial assumptions we use to measure our defined benefit pension plan obligations including the discount rate at which future projected and accumulated pension obligations are discounted to a present value we could experience increased pension cost due to a combination of factors including the decreased investment performance of pension plan assets decreases in the discount rate and changes in our assumptions relating to the expected return on plan assets significant declines in future financial and stock market conditions could cause material losses in our pension plan assets which could result in increased pension cost in future years and adversely impact our results of operations financial condition and cash flow depending upon the severity of market declines and government regulatory changes we may be legally obligated to make pension payments in the us and perhaps other countries and these contributions could be material   

we may be adversely impacted by work stoppages and other labor matters 

at december 31 2015 we employed approximately 55200 persons worldwide approximately 17740 of our employees worldwide are represented by various unions under collective bargaining agreements that expire between 2016 and 2021  while we have no reason to believe that we will be materially impacted by work stoppages or other labor matters there can be no assurance that future issues with our labor unions will be resolved favorably or that we will not encounter future strikes work stoppages or other types of conflicts with labor unions or our employees any of these consequences may have an adverse effect on us or may limit our flexibility in dealing with our workforce in addition many of our customers and suppliers have unionized work forces work stoppages or slowdowns experienced by our customers or suppliers could result in slowdowns or closures that would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flow   

our financial statements are subject to changes in accounting standards that could adversely impact our profitability or financial position   

our financial statements are subject to the application of generally accepted accounting principles gaap in the united states of america which are periodically revised andor expanded accordingly from time to time we are required to adopt new or revised accounting standards issued by recognized authoritative bodies including the financial accounting standards board recently accounting standard setters issued new guidance which further interprets or seeks to revise accounting pronouncements related to revenue recognition and lease accounting as well as to issue new standards expanding disclosures the impact of accounting pronouncements that have been issued but not yet implemented is disclosed in our annual and quarterly reports on form 10k and form 10q an assessment of proposed standards is not provided as such proposals are subject to change through the exposure process and therefore their effects on our financial statements cannot be meaningfully assessed it is possible that future accounting standards we are required to adopt could change the current accounting treatment that we apply to our consolidated financial statements and that such changes could have a material adverse effect on the reported results of operations and financial position

 item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

organization of information 

the following managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations mda was prepared to provide the reader with a view and perspective of our business through the eyes of management and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements  and the accompanying notes to those financial statements our mda is presented in the following sections 

 executive summary and financial highlights 

we are a global power leader that designs manufactures distributes and services diesel and natural gas engines and enginerelated component products including filtration aftertreatment turbochargers fuel systems controls systems air handling systems and electric power generation systems we sell our products to original equipment manufacturers oems distributors and other customers worldwide   we have longstanding relationships with many of the leading manufacturers in the markets we serve including paccar inc daimler trucks north america navistar international corporation fiat chrysler automobiles fiat chrysler volvo ab komatsu and man nutzfahrzeuge ag   we serve our customers through a network of approximately   600  companyowned and independent distributor locations and over   7200   dealer locations in more than 190  countries and territories   

our reportable operating segments consist of the following engine distribution components and power generation this reporting structure is organized according to the products and markets each segment serves  the engine segment produces engines and parts for sale to customers in onhighway and various industrial markets our engines are used in trucks of all sizes buses and recreational vehicles as well as in various industrial applications including construction mining agriculture marine oil and gas rail and military equipment the distribution segment includes whollyowned and partiallyowned distributorships engaged in wholesaling engines generator sets and service parts as well as performing service and repair activities on our products and maintaining relationships with various oems throughout the world the components segment sells filtration products aftertreatment systems turbochargers and fuel systems the power generation segment is an integrated provider of power systems which sells engines generator sets and alternators   

our financial performance depends in large part on varying conditions in the markets we serve particularly the onhighway construction and general industrial markets demand in these markets tends to fluctuate in response to overall economic conditions our sales may also be impacted by oem inventory levels and production schedules and stoppages economic downturns in markets we serve generally result in reduced sales of our products and can result in price reductions in certain products andor markets as a worldwide business our operations are also affected by currency political economic and regulatory matters including adoption and enforcement of environmental and emission standards in the countries we serve as part of our growth strategy we invest in businesses in certain countries that carry high levels of these risks such as china brazil india mexico russia and countries in the middle east and africa at the same time our geographic diversity and broad product and service offerings have helped limit the impact from a drop in demand in any one industry or customer or the economy of any single country on our consolidated results   

worldwide revenues declined   1 percent  in 2015  compared to 2014  primarily due to unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations lower global demand in most industrial markets and lower onhighway demand in international markets especially in brazil mostly offset by the consolidation of our partiallyowned north american distributors since december 31 2013 and higher demand in north american onhighway markets continued international economic weakness in 2015 negatively impacted our 

international revenues which declined  by 11 percent  with sales down in most of our markets especially in brazil and europe as a result of their challenging economic conditions and slower growth in china the decline in international sales was primarily due to unfavorable foreign currency impacts of 4 percent   primarily in the euro brazilian real australian dollar canadian dollar british pound and indian rupee  declines in international industrial markets led by declines in the commercial marine market and the construction market primarily in europe and lower demand in onhighway markets primarily in brazil and china revenue in the us and canada improved  by 7 percent  primarily due to increased distribution segment sales related to the consolidation of north american distributors and higher demand in north american onhighway markets partially offset by lower demand in construction and mining markets 

the following table contains sales and earnings before interest expense income tax expense and noncontrolling interests ebit results by operating segment for the years ended december 31 2015  and 2014  refer to the section titled operating segment results for a more detailed discussion of net sales and ebit by operating segment including the reconciliation of segment ebit to income before income taxes

results of operations 



 

nm  not meaningful information 



2015 vs 2014 

net sales 

net sales decrease d 111 million  versus 2014  primarily driven by the following 

 the decreases above were partially offset by the following 

 34 

 sales to international markets excluding the us and canada based on location of customers were 39 percent of total net sales in 2015  compared with 44 percent  of total net sales in 2014  

a more detailed discussion of sales by segment is presented in the “operating segment results” section 

gross margin 

gross margin increase d 86 million  and 06 points  as a percentage of sales primarily due to improved distribution segment sales from the consolidation of partiallyowned north american distributors since december 31 2013 and lower material and commodity costs partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations primarily in the australian dollar canadian dollar brazilian real and euro unfavorable pricing unfavorable mix and lower volumes   

the provision for warranties issued excluding campaigns as a percentage of sales was 18 percent  in 2015  and 20 percent  in 2014  a more detailed discussion of margin by segment is presented in the operating segment results section 

selling general and administrative expenses 

selling general and administrative expenses decreased   3 million  primarily due to lower consulting expenses of 41 million partially offset by higher compensation and related expenses of 19 million largely due to the acquisition of partiallyowned north american distributors since december 31 2013 compensation and related expenses include salaries fringe benefits and variable compensation overall selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales was 109 percent  in 2015  and 2014  

research development and engineering expenses 

research development and engineering expenses decreased   19 million  primarily due to higher expense recovery of 12 million partially offset by higher consulting expenses of 8 million overall research development and engineering expenses as a percentage of sales decreased  to 38 percent  in 2015  from 39 percent  in 2014  research activities continue to focus on development of new products to meet future emission standards around the world and improvements in fuel economy performance 

equity royalty and interest income from investees 

equity royalty and interest income from investees decrease d 55 million  primarily due to the consolidation of partiallyowned north american distributors since december 31 2013 of 74 million  lower earnings at dongfeng cummins engine company ltd  of 16 million  and chongqing cummins engine company ltd  of 10 million  these decreases were partially offset by higher earnings at beijing foton cummins engine co ltd  of 64 million  as it continues to increase market share with the new heavyduty engine platform introduced in 2014 



impairment of lightduty diesel assets 

we began development of a new north american lightduty diesel engine ldd platform in july of 2006 for use in a variety of on and offhighway applications since that time and as of december 31 2015 we capitalized investments of approximately 279 million  with a net book value prior to the impairment of 246 million   235 million  of which is in our engine segment and 11 million  of which is in our components segment market uncertainty due to the global recession in 20082009 resulted in some customers delaying or canceling their vehicle programs while others remained active we announced an agreement with nissan motor co ltd in 2013 to supply our lightduty diesel engine and began commercial shipment in 2015 in the fourth quarter of 2015 we learned that we were not successful in our bid to supply this product for an additional customer in addition the recent deterioration in global economic conditions and excess manufacturing capacity in other markets make it unlikely that we will manufacture additional products on the ldd line to utilize its excess capacity during the asset recovery period as a result we concluded that the combination of these events presented a triggering event requiring an assessment of the recoverability of these assets in the fourth quarter of 2015 the assessment indicated that the projected undiscounted cash flows related to this asset group were not sufficient to recover its carrying value consequently we were required to write down the ldd asset group to fair value our fourth quarter results included an impairment charge of 211 million   133 million  aftertax of which   202 million  is in the engine segment and 9 million  is in the components segment to reflect the assets at fair value  we remain committed to servicing existing contracts and are not exiting this product line 

the fair value of the asset group was estimated to be 35 million   33 million  for the engine segment and 2 million  for the components segment and was calculated primarily using a cost approach with consideration of a market approach where 

secondary market information was available for the type and age of these assets in the application of the market approach we determined that the liquidation value inplace reflected the best estimate of fair value in the application of the cost approach we considered the current cost of replacing the assets with a reduction for physical deterioration given the age of the assets and a reduction for functional and economic obsolescence in the form of a discount reflecting the current and projected underutilization of the assets the fair value of these assets are considered level 3 under the fair value hierarchy as they are either derived from unobservable inputs or have significant adjustments to the observable inputs 

restructuring actions and other charges 

in the fourth quarter of 2015 we announced and executed restructuring actions primarily in the form of professional voluntary and involuntary employee separation programs in response to the continued deterioration in our global markets in the second half of 2015 as well as expected reductions in orders in most us and global markets in 2016 we reduced our worldwide workforce by approximately 1900   employees  including approximately 370  employees accepting voluntary retirement packages with the remainder of the reductions being involuntary we incurred a charge of 90 million   61 million  aftertax in the fourth quarter of 2015 which included 86 million  for the severance costs related to both voluntary and involuntary terminations and 4 million  for asset impairments and other charges 

employee termination and severance costs were recorded based on approved plans developed by the businesses and corporate management which specified positions to be eliminated benefits to be paid under existing severance plans or statutory requirements and the expected timetable for completion of the plan estimates of restructuring costs and benefits were made based on information available at the time charges were recorded due to the inherent uncertainty involved actual amounts paid for such activities may differ from amounts initially recorded and we may need to revise previous estimates 

restructuring actions during 2015 included 



we expect to realize annualized savings from the restructuring actions of approximately 160 million  approximately 40 percent  of the savings from our restructuring actions will be realized in cost of sales 40 percent  in selling general and administrative expenses and 20 percent  in research development and engineering expenses we expect the severance to be paid in cash which will be funded from operations 

at december 31 2015 approximately 1700  of the 1900  employees affected by this plan  were terminated we expect to complete the substantial majority of this program by april of 2016 

restructuring actions and other charges were included in each segment in our operating results as follows

liquidity and capital resources 

key working capital and balance sheet data 

we fund our working capital with cash from operations and shortterm borrowings when necessary various assets and liabilities including shortterm debt can fluctuate significantly from month to month depending on shortterm liquidity needs as a result working capital is a prime focus of management attention  working capital and balance sheet measures are provided in the following table 



 

1 working capital includes cash and cash equivalents 

2 total capital is defined as total debt plus equity 

cash flows 

cash and cash equivalents were impacted as follows 



2015  vs 2014 

net cash provided by  operating activities decrease d 207 million  versus 2014  primarily due to lower consolidated net income of 266 million  and unfavorable working capital fluctuations of 328 million  partially offset by the impact of the noncash impairment of lightduty diesel assets of 211 million  during 2015  the higher  working capital requirements resulted in a cash outflow  of 260 million  compared to a cash inflow  of 68 million  in 2014  this change of 328 million  was primarily driven by a decrease in accrued expenses and accounts payable partially offset by a decrease in inventory and accounts and notes receivable 

net cash used in  investing activities decrease d 316 million  versus 2014  primarily due to lower cash investment for the acquisitions of businesses of 319 million 

net cash used in  financing activities increase d 301 million  versus 2014  primarily due to higher common stock repurchases of 230 million and higher dividend payments of 110 million 

2014  vs 2013 

net cash provided by operating activities increased 177 million versus 2013 primarily due to higher consolidated net income and favorable working capital fluctuations partially offset by unfavorable deferred income taxes and higher pension contributions in excess of expense during 2014 the lower working capital resulted in a cash inflow of 68 million compared to a cash outflow of 65 million in 2013 this change of 133 million was primarily driven by an increase in accrued expenses and accounts payable partially offset by an increase in other current assets and inventories in 2014 versus the comparable period in 2013 the increase in accrued expenses was primarily due to higher income taxes payable while the change in other current assets was largely due to the receipt of an income tax refund in 2013 

net cash used in investing activities increased 388 million versus 2013 primarily due to higher cash investment for the acquisition of businesses in 2014 of 289 million and higher capital expenditures of 67 million partially offset by reduced purchases of corporate owned life insurance of 40 million 

net cash used in financing activities increased 1395 million versus 2013 primarily due to lower proceeds from borrowings of 949 million in september 2013 we issued 1 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes consisting of 500 million aggregate principal amount of 365 senior unsecured notes due in 2023 and 500 million aggregate principal amount of 4875 senior unsecured notes due in 2043 net proceeds from the issuance were 979 million 

sources of liquidity 

we generate significant ongoing cash flow which has been used in part to fund working capital common stock repurchases capital expenditures dividends on our common stock acquisitions projected pension obligations debt service and restructuring actions and other charges cash provided by operations is our principal source of liquidity with 21 billion  provided in 2015  

at december 31 2015  our sources of liquidity included 

 cash cash equivalents and marketable securities 

a significant portion of our cash flow is generated outside the us at december 31 2015  the total of cash cash equivalents and marketable securities held by foreign subsidiaries was 13 billion  the vast majority of which was located in the uk china and singapore the geographic location of our cash and marketable securities aligns well with our ongoing investments we manage our worldwide cash requirements considering available funds among the many subsidiaries through which we conduct our business and the cost effectiveness with which those funds can be accessed as a result we do not anticipate any local liquidity restrictions to preclude us from funding our operating needs with local resources   

if we distribute our foreign cash balances to the us or to other foreign subsidiaries we could be required to accrue and pay us taxes for example we would be required to accrue and pay additional us taxes if we repatriated cash from certain foreign subsidiaries whose earnings we have asserted are permanently reinvested outside of the us foreign earnings for which we assert permanent reinvestment outside the us consist primarily of earnings of our china and uk domiciled subsidiaries at present we do not foresee a need to repatriate any earnings from these subsidiaries for which we have asserted permanent reinvestment however to help fund cash needs of the us or other international subsidiaries as they arise we repatriate available cash from certain foreign subsidiaries whose earnings are not permanently reinvested when it is cost effective to do so earnings generated after 2011 from our china operations are considered permanently reinvested while earnings generated prior to 2012 for which us deferred tax liabilities have been recorded are expected to be repatriated in future years 

debt facilities and other sources of liquidity 

on november 13 2015 we entered into an amended and restated five year revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of lenders the credit agreement provides us with a 175 billion  senior unsecured revolving credit facility the proceeds of which are to be used for working capital or other general corporate purposes  see note 11   debt  to our consolidated financial statements  for additional information the credit agreement includes one financial covenant a leverage ratio the required 

leverage ratio which measures the sum of total debt plus securitization financing to consolidated earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda as of the last day of any fiscal quarter for the four fiscal quarters ended on such date may not exceed 350 to 10 at december 31 2015  our leverage ratio was 057  to 10 

we have an automatic shelf registration filed with the securities and exchange commission under which we may offer from time to time debt securities common stock preferred and preference stock depositary shares warrants stock purchase contracts and stock purchase units our current shelf is scheduled to expire in september of 2016 we plan to file a new automatic shelf registration statement in the first quarter of 2016 

the maturity schedule of our existing longterm debt does not require significant cash outflows in the intermediate term   required annual principal payments range from 5 million  to 39 million  over each of the next five years 

uses of cash

total dividends paid to common shareholders in 2015  2014  and 2013  were 622 million  512 million  and 420 million  respectively declaration and payment of dividends in the future depends upon our income and liquidity position among other factors and is subject to declaration by our board of directors who meet quarterly to consider our dividend payment we expect to fund dividend payments with cash from operations 

in july 2015 our board of directors authorized an increase to our quarterly dividend of 25 percent from 078 per share to 0975 per share  in july 2014 the board of directors authorized a 25 percent increase to our quarterly cash dividend on our common stock from 0625 per share to 078 per share in july 2013 the board of directors authorized a 25 percent increase to our quarterly cash dividend on our common stock from 050 per share to 0625 per share cash dividends per share paid to common shareholders for the last three years were as follows 



capital expenditures 

capital expenditures and spending on internal use software were 799 million  in 2015  compared to 798 million  in 2014  despite the challenging international economies we continue to invest in new product lines and targeted capacity expansions we plan to spend between 600 million and 650 million in 2016 as we continue with product launches and facility improvements approximately 50 percent of our capital expenditures are expected to be invested outside of the us in 2016 

pensions 

the funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon a variety of variables and assumptions including return on invested assets market interest rates and levels of voluntary contributions to the plans  in 2015  the investment return on our us pension trust was negative 01 percent while our uk pension trust return was 13 percent   approximately 77 percent of our pension plan assets are held in highly liquid investments such as fixed income and equity securities the remaining 23 percent of our plan assets are held in less liquid but market valued investments including real estate private equity and insurance contracts 

we sponsor funded and unfunded domestic and foreign defined benefit pension plans contributions to these plans were as follows 

  

we anticipate making total contributions of approximately 150 million  to our defined benefit pension plans in 2016  expected contributions to our defined benefit pension plans in 2016  will meet or exceed the current funding requirements 

restructuring actions 

in the fourth quarter of 2015 we executed worldwide work force restructuring actions primarily in the form of professional voluntary and involuntary employee separation programs in response to lower demand for our products in the us and key markets around the world we incurred a fourth quarter charge of 90 million   61 million  aftertax for the headcount reductions of which 86 million  will be settled in cash in the fourth quarter of 2015 we announced that we expect to close or restructure several manufacturing facilities over time which could result in future charges as we evaluate the appropriate size and structure of our manufacturing capacity 

acquisitions 

during 2015 we paid 120 million   to acquire the remaining interest in three north american distributors  including the related debt retirements   and recognized a total gain of 18 million on the fair value adjustment resulting from the acquisition of the controlling interests in two of these previously unconsolidated entities  we plan to spend an additional 85 million to 110 million  on the north american distributor acquisitions and the related debt retirements in 2016 

credit ratings 

our ratings and outlook from each of the credit rating agencies as of the date of filing are shown in the table below   



 

1   credit ratings are not recommendations to buy are subject to change and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating in addition we undertake no obligation to update disclosures concerning our credit ratings whether as a result of new information future events or otherwise   

managements assessment of liquidity 

our financial condition and liquidity remain strong our solid balance sheet and credit ratings enable us to have ready access to credit and the capital markets we believe our liquidity provides us with the financial flexibility needed to fund working capital common stock repurchases capital expenditures dividend payments acquisitions of our north american distributors projected pension obligations debt service obligations and severance payments we continue to generate cash from operations in the us and maintain access to 17 billion  of our revolver as noted above 

contractual obligations and other commercial commitments 

a summary of payments due for our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december 31 2015  is as follows 



   

 the contractual obligations reported above exclude our unrecognized tax benefits of 135 million as of december 31 2015  we are not able to reasonably estimate the period in which cash outflows relating to uncertain tax contingencies could occur see note 5   income taxes  to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

our other commercial commitments as of december 31 2015  are as follows 



application of critical accounting estimates 

a summary of our significant accounting policies is included in note 1   summary of significant accounting policies  of our consolidated financial statements  which discusses accounting policies that we have selected from acceptable alternatives 

our consolidated financial statements  are prepared in accordance with gaap which often requires management to make judgments estimates and assumptions regarding uncertainties that affect the reported amounts presented and disclosed in the financial statements management reviews these estimates and assumptions based on historical experience changes in business conditions and other relevant factors they believe to be reasonable under the circumstances in any given reporting period our actual results may differ from the estimates and assumptions used in preparing our consolidated financial statements 

critical accounting estimates are defined as follows the estimate requires management to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the estimate was made different estimates reasonably could have been used or if changes in the estimate are reasonably likely to occur from period to period and the change would have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations our senior management has discussed the development and selection of our accounting policies related accounting estimates and the disclosures set forth below with the audit committee of our board of directors we believe our critical accounting estimates include those addressing the estimation of liabilities for warranty programs accounting for income taxes and pension benefits 

warranty programs 

we estimate and record a liability for base warranty programs at the time our products are sold our estimates are based on historical experience and reflect managements best estimates of expected costs at the time products are sold and subsequent adjustment to those expected costs when actual costs differ as a result of the uncertainty surrounding the nature and frequency of product recall programs the liability for such programs is recorded when we commit to a recall action or when a recall becomes probable and estimable which generally occurs when it is announced our warranty liability is generally affected by component failure rates repair costs and the point of failure within the product life cycle future events and circumstances related to these factors could materially change our estimates and require adjustments to our liability new product launches require a greater use of judgment in developing estimates until historical experience becomes available product specific experience is typically available four or five quarters after product launch with a clear experience trend evident eight quarters after launch we generally record warranty expense for new products upon shipment using a preceding products warranty history and a multiplicative factor based upon preceding similar product experience and new product assessment until sufficient new product data is available for warranty estimation we then use a blend of actual new product experience and preceding product historical experience for several subsequent quarters and new product specific experience thereafter note 12   product warranty liability  to our consolidated financial statements  contains a summary of the activity in our warranty liability account for 2015  and 2014  including adjustments to preexisting warranties 

accounting for income taxes 

we determine our income tax expense using the asset and liability method under this method deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax effects of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases future tax benefits of tax loss and credit carryforwards are also recognized as deferred tax assets we evaluate the recoverability of our deferred tax assets each quarter by assessing the likelihood of future profitability and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize our net deferred tax assets  at december 31 2015  we recorded net deferred tax assets of 356 million  these assets included 236 million  for the value of tax loss and credit carryforwards a valuation allowance of 209 million  was recorded to reduce the tax assets to the net value management believed was more likely than not to be realized in the event our operating performance deteriorates future assessments could conclude that a larger valuation allowance will be needed to further reduce the deferred tax assets in addition we operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and are subject to tax audits in these jurisdictions these audits can involve complex issues which may require an extended period of time to resolve we accrue for the estimated additional tax and interest that may result from tax authorities disputing uncertain tax positions we have taken and we believe we have made adequate provision for income taxes for all years that are subject to audit based upon the latest information available a more complete description of our income taxes and the future benefits of our tax loss and credit carryforwards is disclosed in  note 5   income taxes  to our consolidated financial statements  

pension benefits 

we sponsor a number of pension plans primarily in the us and the uk and to a lesser degree in various other countries in the us and the uk we have several major defined benefit plans that are separately funded we account for our pension programs in accordance with employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans under gaap gaap requires that amounts recognized in financial statements be determined using an actuarial basis as a result our pension benefit programs are based on a number of statistical and judgmental assumptions that attempt to anticipate future events and are used in calculating the expense and liability related to our plans each year at december 31 these assumptions include discount rates used to value liabilities assumed rates of return on plan assets future compensation increases employee turnover rates actuarial assumptions relating to retirement age mortality rates and participant withdrawals the actuarial assumptions we use may differ significantly from actual results due to changing economic conditions participant life span and withdrawal rates these differences may result in a material impact to the amount of net periodic pension cost to be recorded in our consolidated financial statements  in the future 

the expected longterm return on plan assets is used in calculating the net periodic pension cost we considered several factors in developing our expected rate of return on plan assets the longterm rate of return considers historical returns and expected returns on current and projected asset allocations and is generally applied to a fiveyear average market value of return projected returns are based primarily on broad publicly traded fixed income and equity indices and forwardlooking estimates of active portfolio and investment management at december 31 2015 based upon our target asset allocations it is anticipated that our us investment policy will generate an average annual return over the 10year projection period equal to or in excess of 75 percent approximately 18 percent of the time while returns of 80 percent or greater are anticipated 13 percent of the time  we expect additional positive returns from active investment management  despite the 2015  oneyear return of 01 percent  our plan assets have averaged 105 percent  returns since 2010 and resulted in approximately 272 million  of actuarial 

gains in accumulated other comprehensive income in the same period based on the historical returns and forwardlooking return expectations we believe an investment return assumption of 75 percent  per year in 2016  for us pension assets is reasonable 

the methodology used to determine the rate of return on pension plan assets in the uk was based on establishing an equityrisk premium over current longterm bond yields adjusted based on target asset allocations at december 31 2015 based upon our target asset allocations it is anticipated that our uk investment policy will generate an average annual return over the 20year projection period equal to or in excess of 44 percent approximately 50 percent of the time while returns of 51 percent or greater are anticipated 25 percent of the time  we expect additional positive returns from active investment management  the oneyear return for our uk plan was 13 percent  for 2015  and similar to our us plan the strong returns since 2010 have resulted in approximately 214 million  of actuarial gains in accumulated other comprehensive income our strategy with respect to our investments in pension plan assets is to be invested with a longterm outlook therefore the risk and return balance of our asset portfolio should reflect a longterm horizon based on the historical returns and forwardlooking return expectations we believe an investment return assumption of 47 percent  in 2016  for uk pension assets is reasonable our pension plan asset allocations at december 31 2015  and 2014  and target allocation for 2016  are as follows 



the differences between the actual return on plan assets and expected longterm return on plan assets are recognized in the asset value used to calculate net periodic cost over five years the table below sets forth the expected return assumptions used to develop our pension cost for the period 2013  2015  and our expected rate of return for 2016  



a lower expected rate of return will increase our net periodic pension cost and reduce profitability 

gaap for pensions offers various acceptable alternatives to account for the differences that eventually arise between the estimates used in the actuarial valuations and the actual results it is acceptable to delay or immediately recognize these differences under the delayed recognition alternative changes in pension obligation including those resulting from plan amendments and changes in the value of assets set aside to meet those obligations are not recognized in net periodic pension cost as they occur but are recognized initially in comprehensive income and subsequently amortized as components of net periodic pension cost systematically and gradually over future periods in addition to this approach gaap also allows immediate recognition of actuarial gains or losses immediate recognition introduces volatility in financial results we have chosen to delay recognition and amortize actuarial differences over future periods if we adopted the immediate recognition approach we would record a loss of 917 million   616 million  aftertax from cumulative actuarial net losses for our us and uk pension plans 

the difference between the expected return and the actual return on plan assets is deferred from recognition in our results of operations and under certain circumstances such as when the difference exceeds 10 percent  of the market value of plan assets or the projected benefit obligation amortized over future years of service this is also true of changes to actuarial assumptions under gaap the actuarial gains and losses are recognized and recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss at december 31 2015  we had net pension actuarial losses of 689 million  and 228 million  for the us and uk pension plans respectively as these amounts exceed 10 percent  of their respective plan assets the excess is amortized over the average remaining service lives of participating employees net actuarial losses decreased our shareholders equity by 63 million  aftertax in 2015  the loss is due to unfavorable asset performance in the us and uk partially offset by higher discount rates in both the us and uk 

the table below sets forth the net periodic pension cost for the period 2013  2015  and our expected cost for 2016  



we expect 2016  net periodic pension cost to decrease  when compared to 2015  due to reduced loss amortizations in the us and uk and higher discount rates partially offset by lower expected asset returns for the uk plan as we derisk plan trust assets the increase  in periodic pension cost in 2015  compared to 2014  was due to lower discount rates in the us and uk and unfavorable mortality demographics in the us partially offset by favorable expected return on asset performance in both the us and uk the decrease in periodic pension cost in 2014 compared to 2013 was due to reduced loss amortizations resulting from improved us asset performance and a higher discount rate in the us  another key assumption used in the development of the net periodic pension cost is the discount rate the weighted average discount rates used to develop our net periodic pension cost are set forth in the table below 



changes in the discount rate assumptions will impact the interest cost component of the net periodic pension cost calculation 

the discount rate enables us to state expected future cash payments for benefits as a present value on the measurement date the guidelines for setting this rate are discussed in gaap which suggests the use of a highquality corporate bond rate we used bond information provided by moodys investor services inc and standard  poors rating services all bonds used to develop our hypothetical portfolio in the us and uk were deemed highquality noncallable bonds aa or better at december 31 2015  by at least one of the bond rating agencies 

our model called for projected payments until near extinction for the us and the uk for both countries our model matches the present value of the plans projected benefit payments to the market value of the theoretical settlement bond portfolio a single equivalent discount rate is determined to align the present value of the required cash flow with the value of the bond portfolio the resulting discount rate is reflective of both the current interest rate environment and the plans distinct liability characteristics 

the table below sets forth the estimated impact on our 2016  net periodic pension cost relative to a change in the discount rate and a change in the expected rate of return on plan assets 



the above sensitivities reflect the impact of changing one assumption at a time a higher discount rate decreases the plan obligations and decreases our net periodic pension cost a lower discount rate increases the plan obligations and increases our net periodic pension cost it should be noted that economic factors and conditions often affect multiple assumptions simultaneously and the effects of changes in key assumptions are not necessarily linear note 10   pension and other postretirement benefits  to our consolidated financial statements  provides a summary of our pension benefit plan activity the funded status of our plans and the amounts recognized in our consolidated financial statements  

recently adopted and recently issued accounting pronouncements 

accounting pronouncements recently adopted 

in may 2015 the financial accounting standards board fasb amended its fair value standard related to the disclosure of investments in certain entities that calculate the net asset value per share nav or an equivalent measure this amendment 

provides the option to exclude investments measured using the nav to represent fair value from the fair value hierarchy the new rules will become effective for annual and interim periods beginning after december 15 2015 however early adoption is permitted and we have chosen to adopt this standard as of december 31 2015 this resulted in us pension plan assets of   1094 million  and   1186 million  and uk pension plan assets of   514 million  and   497 million  at december 31 2015 and 2014 respectively being removed from the threelevel valuation hierarchy  note 10 pension and other postretirement benefits to our consolidated financial statements  includes a summary of our pension plan assets our  consolidated financial statements  do not include any other investments for which nav is used to represent fair value 

in november 2015 the fasb amended its standards related to balance sheet classification of deferred taxes this amendment requires that all deferred tax assets and liabilities be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position the new rules will become effective for annual and interim periods beginning after december 15 2016 however early adoption is permitted and we have chosen to adopt the standard prospectively as of september 28 2015 as a result prior periods have not been adjusted to reflect this change 

in april 2015 the fasb amended its standards related to the balance sheet classification of debt issuance costs this amendment requires entities to present debt issuance costs related to a debt liability as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the debt and requires retrospective application the new rules will become effective for annual and interim periods beginning after december 15 2016 however early adoption is permitted and we have chosen to adopt this standard as of september 28 2015 this resulted in the reclassification of   12 million  from other assets in our december 31 2014  consolidated balance sheet  to a reduction of our longterm debt   

accounting pronouncements issued but not yet effective 

in january 2016 the fasb amended its standards related to the accounting of certain financial instruments this amendment addresses certain aspects of recognition measurement presentation and disclosure the new rules will become effective for annual and interim periods beginning after december 15 2017 early adoption is not permitted we are in the process of evaluating the impact the amendment will have on our  consolidated financial statements  

in may 2014 the fasb amended its standards related to revenue recognition this amendment replaces all existing revenue recognition guidance and provides a single comprehensive revenue recognition model for all contracts with customers the standard contains principles that we will apply to determine the measurement of revenue and timing of when it is recognized the underlying principle is that we will recognize revenue in a manner that depicts the transfer of goods or services to customers at an amount that we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services the guidance provides a fivestep analysis of transactions to determine when and how revenue is recognized other major provisions include capitalization of certain contract costs consideration of the time value of money in the transaction price and allowing estimates of variable consideration to be recognized before contingencies are resolved in certain circumstances the amendment also requires additional disclosure about the nature amount timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts including significant judgments and changes in judgments and assets recognized from costs incurred to fulfill a contract the standard allows either full or modified retrospective adoption effective for annual and interim periods beginning january 1 2018 we are in the process of evaluating the impact the amendment will have on our  consolidated financial statements   while a final decision has not been made we are currently planning to adopt the standard using the modified retrospective approach 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to financial risk resulting from volatility in foreign exchange rates commodity prices and interest rates this risk is closely monitored and managed through the use of financial derivative instruments including foreign currency forward contracts interest rate swaps and commodity zerocost collars these instruments as further described below are accounted for as cash flow or fair value hedges or as economic hedges not designated as hedges for accounting purposes financial derivatives are used expressly for hedging purposes and under no circumstances are they used for speculative purposes when material we adjust the estimated fair value of our derivative contracts for counterparty or our credit risk none of our derivative instruments are subject to collateral requirements substantially all of our derivative contracts are subject to master netting arrangements which provide us with the option to settle certain contracts on a net basis when they settle on the same day with the same currency in addition these arrangements provide for a net settlement of all contracts with a given counterparty in the event that the arrangement is terminated due to the occurrence of default or a termination event   

the following describes our risk exposures and provides the results of a sensitivity analysis performed at december 31 2015  the sensitivity analysis assumes instantaneous parallel shifts in foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices 

foreign exchange rates 

as a result of our international business presence we are exposed to foreign currency exchange risks we transact business in foreign currencies and as a result our income experiences some volatility related to movements in foreign currency exchange rates to help manage our exposure to exchange rate volatility we use foreign currency forward contracts on a regular basis to hedge forecasted intercompany and thirdparty sales and purchases denominated in nonfunctional currencies our internal policy allows for managing anticipated foreign currency cash flows for up to one year  these foreign currency forward contracts are designated and qualify as foreign currency cash flow hedges under gaap  for the years ended december 31 2015  and 2014  there were no circumstances that would have resulted in the discontinuance of a foreign currency cash flow hedge   

to minimize the income volatility resulting from the remeasurement of net monetary assets and payables denominated in a currency other than the functional currency we enter into foreign currency forward contracts which are considered economic hedges the objective is to offset the gain or loss from remeasurement with the gain or loss from the fair market valuation of the forward contract these derivative instruments are not designated as hedges under gaap   

at december 31 2015 the potential gain or loss in the fair value of our outstanding foreign currency contracts assuming a hypothetical 10  percent fluctuation in the currencies of such contracts would be approximately 20 million  the sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates assumes the notional value to remain constant for the next 12 months the analysis ignores the impact of foreign exchange movements on our competitive position and potential changes in sales levels any change in the value of the contracts real or hypothetical would be significantly offset by an inverse change in the value of the underlying hedged items  

interest rate risk   

we are exposed to market risk from fluctuations in interest rates we manage our exposure to interest rate fluctuations through the use of interest rate swaps the objective of the swaps is to more effectively balance our borrowing costs and interest rate risk   

in february 2014 we settled our november 2005 interest rate swap which previously converted our 250 million  debt issue due in 2028 from a fixed rate  of 7125 percent  to a floating rate based on libor   plus a spread   also in february 2014 we entered into a series of interest rate swaps to effectively convert our september 2013 500 million  debt issue due in 2023 from a fixed rate of 365 percent  to a floating rate equal to the onemonth libor   plus a spread  the terms of the swaps mirror those of the debt with interest paid semiannually the swaps were designated and will be accounted for as fair value hedges under gaap the gain or loss on these derivative instruments as well as the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in current income as “interest expense” the net swap settlements that accrue each period are also reported in interest expense 

the following table summarizes these gains and losses for the years presented below   



 

1   the difference between the gainloss on swaps and borrowings represents hedge ineffectiveness 

commodity price risk   

we are exposed to fluctuations in commodity prices due to contractual agreements with component suppliers in order to protect ourselves against future price volatility and consequently fluctuations in gross margins we periodically enter into commodity zerocost collar contracts with designated banks to fix the cost of certain raw material purchases with the objective of minimizing changes in inventory cost due to market price fluctuations we have commodity zerocost collar contracts that represent an economic hedge but are not designated for hedge accounting and are marked to market through earnings our internal policy allows for managing our cash flow hedges for up to three years 

at december 31 2015 the potential gain or loss related to the outstanding commodity zerocost collar contracts assuming a hypothetical 10  percent fluctuation in the price of such commodities was   1 million  the sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in commodity prices assumes the notional value to remain constant for the next 12 months the analysis ignores the impact of commodity price movements on our competitive position and potential changes in sales levels any change in the value of the zerocost collar contracts real or hypothetical would be significantly offset by an inverse change in the value of the underlying hedged items   

we also limit our exposure to commodity price risk by entering into purchasing arrangements to fix the price of certain volumes of platinum and palladium expected to be used in our products during 2014 we began entering into physical forward contracts with suppliers of platinum and palladium to purchase some volumes of the commodities at contractually stated prices for various periods generally not exceeding one year these arrangements enable us to fix the prices of a portion of our purchases of these commodities which otherwise are subject to market volatility

joint ventures alliances and nonwhollyowned subsidiaries 

we have entered into a number of joint venture agreements and alliances with business partners around the world our joint ventures are either distribution or manufacturing entities we also own controlling interests in nonwhollyowned manufacturing and distribution subsidiaries seven entities in which we own more than a 50 percent equity interest or have a controlling interest are consolidated in our distribution segment results as well as several manufacturing joint ventures in the other operating segments 

in the event of a change of control of either party to certain of these joint ventures and other strategic alliances certain consequences may result including automatic termination and liquidation of the venture exercise of put or call rights of ownership by the nonacquired partner termination or transfer of technology license rights to the nonacquired partner and increases in component transfer prices to the acquired partner we will continue to evaluate joint venture and partnership opportunities in order to penetrate new markets develop new products and generate manufacturing and operational efficiencies 

financial information about our investments in joint ventures and alliances is incorporated by reference from note 3   investments in equity investees  to the consolidated financial statements 

our equity income from these investees was as follows 



 

1  this total represents our share of net income of our equity investees and is exclusive of royalties and interest income from our equity investees to see how this amount reconciles to equity royalty and interest income from investees in the consolidated statements of income  see note 3   investments in equity investees  to our consolidated financial statements 

distribution entities 

 our distribution agreements with independent and partiallyowned distributors generally have a renewable   three year term and are restricted to specified territories our distributors develop and maintain a network of dealers with which we have no direct relationship our distributors are permitted to sell other noncompetitive products only with our consent we license all of our distributors to use our name and logo in connection with the sale and service of our products with no right to assign or sublicense the trademarks except to authorized dealers without our consent products are sold to the distributors at standard domestic or international distributor net prices as applicable net prices are wholesale prices we establish to permit our distributors an adequate margin on their sales subject to local laws we can generally refuse to renew these agreements upon expiration or terminate them upon written notice for inadequate sales change in principal ownership and certain other reasons distributors also have the right to terminate the agreements upon   60 day notice without cause or 30 day notice for cause upon termination or failure to renew we are required to purchase the distributor’s current inventory signage and special tools and may at our option purchase other assets of the distributor but are under no obligation to do so 

see further discussion of our distribution network under the distribution segment section above 

manufacturing entities 

our manufacturing joint ventures have generally been formed with customers and generally are intended to allow us to increase our market penetration in geographic regions reduce capital spending streamline our supply chain management and develop technologies our largest manufacturing joint ventures are based in china and are included in the list below our engine manufacturing joint ventures are supplied by our components segment in the same manner as it supplies our whollyowned engine segment and power generation segment manufacturing facilities our components segment joint ventures and wholly owned entities provide fuel systems filtration aftertreatment systems and turbocharger products that are used in our engines as well as some competitors products the results and investments in our joint ventures in which we have 50 percent  or less ownership interest are included in “equity royalty and interest income from investees” and “investments and advances related to equity method investees” in our consolidated statements of income   and   consolidated balance sheets  respectively

nonwhollyowned subsidiary 

we have a controlling interest in cummins india ltd cil which is a publicly listed company on various stock exchanges in india cil produces midrange heavyduty and highhorsepower engines generators for the indian and export markets and natural gas sparkignited engines for power generation automotive and industrial applications cil also has distribution and power generation operations 

supply 

the performance of the endtoend supply chain extending through to our suppliers is foundational to our ability to meet customers expectations and support longterm growth we are committed to having a robust strategy for how we select and manage our suppliers to enable a market focused supply chain this requires us to continuously evaluate and upgrade our supply base as necessary to ensure we are meeting the needs of our customers 

we have a strategic sourcing policy that guides decisions on what we make internally what we purchase externally and when we establish supplier partnerships to provide the lowest total cost and highest supply chain performance we design andor manufacture our strategic components used in or with our engines and power generation units including cylinder blocks and heads turbochargers connecting rods camshafts crankshafts filters alternators electronic and emissions controls and fuel systems we source externally purchased material and manufactured components from leading global suppliers many key suppliers are managed through longterm supply agreements that assure capacity delivery quality and cost requirements are met over an extended period approximately 55  percent of the direct material in our product designs are single sourced to external suppliers although we have elected to source a relatively high proportion of our total raw materials and components from single suppliers we have an established sourcing strategy and supplier management process to evaluate and mitigate risk these processes are leading us to determine our need for dual sourcing and increase our use of dual and parallel sources to minimize risk and increase supply chain responsiveness our current target for dual and parallel sourcing is approximately 64 percent  of our direct material spend as of december 31 2014  we have 45 percent  of direct material spend with dual or parallel sources or 72 percent  of the target 

other important elements of our sourcing strategy include 

 patents and trademarks 

we own or control a significant number of patents and trademarks relating to the products we manufacture these patents and trademarks were granted and registered over a period of years although these patents and trademarks are generally considered beneficial to our operations we do not believe any patent group of patents or trademark other than our leading brand house trademarks is significant to our business 

seasonality 

while individual product lines may experience modest seasonal variation in production there is no material effect on the demand for the majority of our products on a quarterly basis with the exception that our power generation segment normally experiences seasonal declines in the first quarter due to general declines in construction spending during this period and our distribution segment normally experiences seasonal declines in its first quarter business activity due to holiday periods in asia and australia 

largest customers 

we have thousands of customers around the world and have developed longstanding business relationships with many of them paccar is our largest customer accounting for approximately 14 percent of our consolidated net sales in 2014 compared to approximately 12 percent in 2013 and 13 percent in 2012 we have longterm supply agreements with paccar for our heavyduty isx 15 liter and isx 119 liter engines and our isl 9 liter midrange engine while a significant number of our sales to paccar are under longterm supply agreements these agreements provide for particular engine requirements for specific vehicle models and not a specific volume of engines paccar is our only customer accounting for more than 10 percent of our net sales in 2014 the loss of this customer or a significant decline in the production level of paccar vehicles that use our engines would have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition we have been an engine supplier to paccar for over 70 years a summary of principal customers for each operating segment is included in our segment discussion 

in addition to our agreement with paccar we have longterm heavyduty engine supply agreements with navistar volvo trucks north america and daimler trucks north america and longterm midrange supply agreements with daimler trucks north america navistar ford and man we also have an agreement with chrysler to supply engines for its ram trucks in our offhighway markets we have various engine and component supply agreements across our midrange and highhorsepower businesses with komatsu ltd as well as various joint ventures and other license agreements in our engine component and distribution segments  collectively our net sales to these eight customers including paccar were approximately 37 percent of our consolidated net sales in 2014  compared to approximately 36 percent in 2013 and 35 percent in 2012  excluding paccar net sales to any single customer were less than 8 percent of our consolidated net sales in 2014  compared to less than 7 percent in 2013 and less than 8 percent in 2012  these agreements contain standard purchase and sale agreement terms covering engine and engine parts pricing quality and delivery commitments as well as engineering product support obligations the basic nature of our agreements with oem customers is that they are longterm price and operations agreements that help assure the availability of our products to each customer through the duration of the respective agreements agreements with most oems contain bilateral termination provisions giving either party the right to terminate in the event of a material breach change of control or insolvency or bankruptcy of the other party   

backlog 

we have supply agreements with some truck and offhighway equipment oems however most of our business is transacted through open purchase orders these open orders are historically subject to monthtomonth releases and are subject to cancellation on reasonable notice without cancellation charges and therefore are not considered firm as of december 31 2014  we did not have any significant backlogs 

research and development 

in 2014  we increase d our research development and engineering expenses as we continued to invest in future critical technologies and products we will continue to make investments to improve our current technologies continue to meet the future emission requirements around the world and improve fuel economy 

our research and development program is focused on product improvements innovations and cost reductions for our customers research and development expenditures include salaries contractor fees building costs utilities administrative expenses and allocation of corporate costs and are expensed net of contract reimbursements when incurred from time to time we enter into agreements with customers to fund a portion of the research and development costs of a particular project we generally account for these reimbursements as an offset to the related research and development expenditure research and development expenses net of contract reimbursements were 737 million  in 2014   700 million  in 2013 and 721 million  in 2012  contract reimbursements were 121 million  in 2014   76 million  in 2013 and 86 million  in 2012   

for 2013 and 2012 approximately 15 million and 101 million or 2 percent and 14 percent respectively of our research and development expenditures were directly related to compliance with 2013 epa emission standards for 2014 and 2013 approximately 60 million and 32 million or 8 percent and 5 percent respectively of our research and development expenditures were directly related to compliance with 2017 epa emission standards 

environmental sustainability 

cummins adopted its firstever comprehensive environmental sustainability plan in 2014 that builds on the many years of good work already done to positively impact the environment through the products we make the use of our facilities management of our supply chain and improvement of the communities where we live and work we examined our entire environmental footprint focusing on the key areas of water waste energy and greenhouse gases we then identified the top four 

environmental sustainability priorities of products inuse materials and fuel efficiency transportation and facilities and operations we set initial goals in our facilities where we have the most data influence and experience those goals are to reduce energy use and greenhouse gas emissions by 25 and 27 respectively by 2015 against a 2005 baseline and adjusted for sales reduce direct water use by 33 adjusted for hours worked and achieve water neutrality at 15 sites by 2020 and increase our recycling rate from 88 to 95 and achieve zero disposal at 30 sites by 2020 we continue to invest significantly in our products to further reduce emissions and increase efficiency we endeavor to work collaboratively with customers to improve their fuel efficiency reduce their carbon footprints and conserve other resources our next efforts will be specifically focused on products both in design and in use as well as on how we use the best mode and method of transportation to reduce emissions in moving goods throughout the cummins network 

over the past four years we believe that we have reduced companywide water usage intensity by approximately 30 percent uswide processderived hazardous waste generation by approximately 41 percent and companywide disposal waste by approximately 28 percent all normalized to total work hours as part of the us department of energys better buildings better plants program we have pledged to achieve a 25 percent energy intensity energy use adjusted for sales reduction by 2015 at the end of 2013 we had achieved a 33 percent reduction we also have articulated our positions on key public policy issues and on a wide range of environmental issues we are actively engaged with regulatory industry and other stakeholder groups around the world as greenhouse gas and fuel efficiency standards become more prevalent globally for the ninth consecutive year we were named to the dow jones north american sustainability index and as well as a “natural capital decoupling leader” by green biz group and trucost for reductions in environmental footprint amid company growth our sustainability report for 20132014 and prior reports as well as an addendum of more detailed environmental data is available on our website at wwwcumminscom  although such report and addendum are not incorporated into this form 10k 

environmental compliance 

product environmental compliance 

our engines are subject to extensive statutory and regulatory requirements that directly or indirectly impose standards governing emission and noise we have substantially increased our global environmental compliance presence and expertise to better prepare for understand and ultimately meet emerging product environmental regulations around the world our products comply with current emission standards that the european union eu epa the california air resources board carb and other state and international regulatory agencies have established for heavyduty onhighway diesel and gas engines and offhighway engines our ability to comply with these and future emission standards is an essential element in maintaining our leadership position in regulated markets we have made and will continue to make significant capital and research expenditures to comply with these standards our failure to comply with these standards could result in adverse effects on our future financial results 

eu and epa engine certifications 

the current onhighway emission standards came into effect in the european union eu on january 1 2013 euro vi and on january 1 2010 for the epa to meet the more stringent heavyduty onhighway emission standards we used an evolution of our proven selective catalytic reduction scr and exhaust gas recirculation egr technology solutions and refined them for the eu and epa certified engines to maintain power and torque with substantial fuel economy improvement and maintenance intervals comparable with our previous compliant engines we offer a complete lineup of onhighway engines to meet the nearzero emission standards midrange and heavyduty engines for eu and epa require nox aftertreatment nox reduction is achieved by an integrated technology solution comprised of the xpi high pressure common rail fuel system scr technology nextgeneration cooled egr advanced electronic controls proven air handling and the cummins diesel particulate filter dpf the eu epa and carb have certified that our engines meet the current emission requirements emission standards in international markets including japan mexico australia brazil russia india and china are becoming more stringent we believe that our experience in meeting the eu and epa emission standards leaves us well positioned to take advantage of opportunities in these markets as the need for emission control capability grows 

we received certification from the epa that we met both the epa 2013 and 2014 greenhouse gas ghg regulations and rules the epa 2013 regulations add the requirement of onboard diagnostics which were introduced on the isx15 in 2010 across the full onhighway product line in 2013 in addition to maintaining the same nearzero emission levels of nox and particulate matter pm required in 2010 onboard diagnostics provide enhanced service capability with standardized diagnostic trouble codes service tool interface incab warning lamp and service information availability the new ghg and fuelefficiency regulations were required for all heavyduty diesel and natural gas engines beginning in january 2014 our ghg certification was the first engine certificate issued by the epa and uses the same proven base engine with the xpi fuel system variable geometry turbocharger vgt tm  cummins aftertreatment system with dpf and scr technology 

other environmental statutes and regulations 

expenditures for environmental control activities and environmental remediation projects at our facilities in the us have not been a substantial portion of our annual capital outlays and are not expected to be material in 2015 we believe we are in compliance in all material respects with laws and regulations applicable to our plants and operations 

in the us pursuant to notices received from federal and state agencies andor defendant parties in site environmental contribution actions we have been identified as a potentially responsible party under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of 1980 as amended or similar state laws at less than 20 waste disposal sites based upon our experiences at similar sites we believe that our aggregate future remediation costs will not be significant we have established accruals that we believe are adequate for our expected future liability with respect to these sites 

in addition we have several other sites where we are working with governmental authorities on remediation projects the costs for these remediation projects are not expected to be material 

employees 

as of december 31 2014 we employed approximately 54600 persons worldwide approximately 17680 of our employees worldwide are represented by various unions under collective bargaining agreements that expire between 2015 and 2019

 item 1a risk factors 

set forth below and elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k are some of the principal risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual business results to differ materially from any forwardlooking statements contained in this report and could individually or in combination have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows these risk factors should be considered in addition to our cautionary comments concerning forwardlooking statements in this report including statements related to markets for our products and trends in our business that involve a number of risks and uncertainties our separate section above cautionary statements regarding forwardlooking information should be considered in addition to the following statements 

a sustained slowdown or significant downturn in our markets could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial condition or cash flows 

the us economy began to improve in 2014 although many international markets continued to struggle if the global economy or some of our significant markets encounter a sustained slowdown depending upon the length duration and severity of such a slowdown our results of operations financial condition and cash flow would almost certainly be materially adversely affected specifically our revenues would likely decrease we may be forced to consider further restructuring actions we may need to increase our allowance for doubtful accounts our days sales outstanding may increase and we could experience impairments to assets of certain of our businesses   

a slowdown in infrastructure development could adversely affect our business   

infrastructure development has been a significant driver of our business in recent years especially in the emerging markets of china and brazil general weakness in economic growth or the perception that infrastructure has been overbuilt could lead to a decline in infrastructure spending any sustained downturns in infrastructure development that result from these or other circumstances could adversely affect our business 

unpredictability in the adoption implementation and enforcement of increasingly stringent emission standards by multiple jurisdictions around the world could adversely affect our business   

our engines are subject to extensive statutory and regulatory requirements governing emission and noise including standards imposed by the epa the european union state regulatory agencies such as the carb and other regulatory agencies around the world we have made and will be required to continue to make significant capital and research expenditures to comply with these emission standards developing engines to meet numerous changing government regulatory requirements with different implementation timelines and emission requirements makes developing engines efficiently for multiple markets complicated and could result in substantial additional costs that may be difficult to recover in certain markets in some cases we may be required to develop new products to comply with new regulations particularly those relating to air emissions while we have met previous deadlines our ability to comply with other existing and future regulatory standards will be essential for us to maintain our position in the engine markets we serve the successful development and introduction of new and enhanced products in order to comply with new regulatory requirements are subject to other risks such as delays in product development cost overruns and unanticipated technical and manufacturing difficulties in addition to these risks the nature and timing of government implementation and enforcement of increasingly stringent emission standards in emerging markets are unpredictable and subject to change or delays which could result in the products we developed or modified to comply with these standards becoming unnecessary or becoming necessary later than expected and in some cases negating our competitive advantage this in turn can delay diminish or eliminate the expected return on capital and research expenditures that we have invested in such products and may adversely affect our perceived competitive advantage in being an early advanced developer of compliant engines 

we derive significant income from investees that we do not directly control   

our net income includes significant equity royalty and interest income from investees that we do not directly control  for 2014 we recognized 370 million of equity royalty and interest income from investees compared to 361 million in 2013   the majority of our equity royalty and interest income from investees is from our    unconsolidated north american distributors and from two of our joint ventures in china dongfeng cummins engine company ltd dcec and chongqing cummins engine company ltd ccec at december 31 2014 our equity ownership interests in our unconsolidated north american distributors ranged from 49 percent to 50 percent at december 31 2014 we have 50 percent equity ownership interests in dcec and ccec   as a result although a significant percentage of our net income is derived from these unconsolidated entities we do not unilaterally control their management or their operations which puts a substantial portion of our net income at risk from the actions or inactions of these entities a significant reduction in the level of contribution by these entities to our net income would likely have a material adverse effect on our results of operations   

our truck manufacturers and original equipment manufacturers oems customers may not continue to outsource their engine supply needs 

several of our engine customers including paccar volvo ab navistar chrysler and dcec are truck manufacturers or oems that manufacture engines for some of their own products despite their own engine manufacturing abilities these customers have historically chosen to outsource certain types of engine production to us due to the quality of our engine products our emission capabilities our systems integration their customers preferences their desire for cost reductions their desire for eliminating production risks and their desire to maintain company focus however there can be no assurance that these customers will continue to outsource or outsource as much of their engine production in the future increased levels of oem vertical integration could result from a number of factors such as shifts in our customers business strategies acquisition by a customer of another engine manufacturer the inability of thirdparty suppliers to meet product specifications and the emergence of lowcost production opportunities in foreign countries any significant reduction in the level of engine production outsourcing from our truck manufacturer or oem customers could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations   

a downturn in the north american truck industry or other factors negatively affecting any of our truck oem customers could materially adversely impact our results of operations   

we make significant sales of engines and components to a few large truck oems in north america if the north american truck market suffers a significant downturn or if one of our large truck oem customers experienced financial distress or bankruptcy such circumstance would likely lead to significant reductions in our revenues and earnings commercial disputes receivable collection issues and other negative consequences that could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations   

the discovery of any significant problems with our recentlyintroduced engine platforms in north america could materially adversely impact our results of operations financial condition and cash flow   

the epa and carb have certified all of our 20122013 onhighway and offhighway engines which utilize scr technology to meet requisite emission levels we introduced scr technology into our engine platforms in 2010 the effective performance of scr technology and the overall performance of these engine platforms impact a number of our operating segments and remain crucial to our success in north america while these 2010 and 2013 engine platforms have performed well in the field the discovery of any significant problems in these platforms could result in recall campaigns increased warranty costs reputational risk and brand risk and could materially adversely impact our results of operations financial condition and cash flow   

we are vulnerable to supply shortages from singlesourced suppliers   

during 2014 we single sourced approximately 55 percent of the total types of parts in our product designs any delay in our suppliers deliveries may adversely affect our operations at multiple manufacturing locations forcing us to seek alternative supply sources to avoid serious disruptions delays may be caused by factors affecting our suppliers including capacity constraints labor disputes economic downturns availability of credit the impaired financial condition of a particular supplier suppliers allocations to other purchasers weather emergencies natural disasters or acts of war or terrorism any extended delay in receiving critical supplies could impair our ability to deliver products to our customers and our results of operations   

our products are exposed to variability in material and commodity costs   

our businesses establish prices with our customers in accordance with contractual time frames however the timing of material and commodity market price increases may prevent us from passing these additional costs on to our customers through timely pricing actions additionally higher material and commodity costs around the world may offset our efforts to reduce our cost structure while we customarily enter into financial transactions and contractual pricing adjustment provisions with our customers that attempt to address some of these risks notably with respect to copper platinum and palladium there can be no assurance that commodity price fluctuations will not adversely affect our results of operations in addition while the use of commodity price hedging instruments may provide us with some protection from adverse fluctuations in commodity prices by utilizing these instruments we potentially forego the benefits that might result from favorable fluctuations in price as a result higher material and commodity costs as well as hedging these commodity costs during periods of decreasing prices could result in declining margins   

our products are subject to recall for performance or safetyrelated issues   

our products may be subject to recall for performance or safetyrelated issues product recalls subject us to harm to our reputation loss of current and future customers reduced revenue and product recall costs product recall costs are incurred when we decide either voluntarily or involuntarily to recall a product through a formal campaign to solicit the return of specific products due to a known or suspected performance issue any significant product recalls could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows   

failure to successfully integrate the planned acquisitions of the equity we do not already own of our partiallyowned united states and canadian distributors could have an adverse impact on our realization of expected benefits to our financial condition and results of operations   

the completion of our plan to acquire all of the equity we do not already own of our partially owned united states and canadian distributors each an acquisition and collectively the acquisitions is subject to various risks including among other things our ability to realize the full extent of the incremental revenue earnings cash flow cost savings and other benefits that we expect to realize as a result of the completion of the acquisitions within the anticipated time frame or at all the costs that are expected to be incurred in connection with evaluating negotiating consummating and integrating the acquisitions the ability of management to focus adequate time and attention on evaluating negotiating consummating and integrating the acquisitions and diversion of managements attention from base strategies and objectives both during and after the acquisition process further as with all merger and acquisition activity there can be no assurance that we will be able to negotiate consummate and integrate the acquisitions in accordance with our plans those persons holding the thirdparty ownership of our partiallyowned united states and canadian distributors may not agree to our acquisition proposals including the terms and conditions thereof and may claim that our proposals to exercise certain contractual rights that we have with respect to acquiring such distributors may violate applicable state franchise and distributor laws which may prohibit delay or otherwise adversely affect the consummation of such acquisitions on terms and conditions that are less favorable to us than we currently anticipate or not at all   

after completion of the acquisitions we may fail to realize the expected enhanced revenue earnings cash flow cost savings and other benefits   

the financial success of the acquisitions will depend in substantial part on our ability to successfully combine our business with the businesses of our partiallyowned united states and canadian distributors transition operations and realize the expected enhanced revenue earnings cash flow cost savings and other benefits from such acquisitions while we currently believe that these enhanced revenue earnings cash flow cost savings and other benefits estimates are achievable it is possible that we will be unable to achieve these objectives within the anticipated time frame or at all our enhanced revenue earnings cash flow cost savings and other benefits estimates also depend on our ability to execute and integrate the acquisitions in a manner that permits those benefits to be realized if these estimates turn out to be incorrect or we are not able to execute our integration strategy successfully the anticipated enhanced revenue earnings cash flow cost savings and other benefits resulting from the acquisitions may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected   

specifically issues that must be addressed in integration in order to realize the anticipated benefits and costs savings of the acquisitions include among other things   

 19 

 delays encountered in the process of integrating the acquisitions could negatively impact our revenues expenses operating results cash flow and financial condition after completion of the acquisitions including through the loss of current customers or suppliers although significant benefits such as enhanced revenue earnings cash flow and cost savings are expected to result from the acquisitions there can be no assurance that we will realize any of these anticipated benefits after completion of any or all of the acquisitions   

additionally significant costs are expected to be incurred in connection with the integration of the acquisitions we continue to assess the magnitude of these costs and additional unanticipated costs may be incurred including costs associated with assuming our partiallyowned united states and canadian distributors exposure to outstanding and anticipated legal claims and other liabilities although we believe that the elimination of duplicative costs as well as the realization of other synergies and efficiencies related to the integration of the acquisitions will offset incremental integrationrelated costs over time no assurances can be given that this net benefit will be achieved in the near term or at all in addition the process of integrating the operations of our partially owned united states and canadian distributors may distract management and employees from delivering against base strategies and objectives which could negatively impact other segments of our business following the completion of the acquisitions   

furthermore the acquisitions and the related integration efforts could result in the departure of key managers and employees and we may fail to identify managerial resources to fill both executivelevel and lowerlevel managerial positions and replace key employees including those who oversee customer relationships any of which could have a negative impact on our business and prior to the completion of the acquisitions the businesses of our partiallyowned united states and canadian distributors   

the completion of the acquisitions may be subject to the receipt of certain required clearances or approvals from governmental entities that could prevent or delay their completion or impose conditions that could have an adverse effect on us   

completion of each of the acquisitions may be conditioned upon the receipt of certain governmental clearances or approvals including but not limited to the expiration or termination of any applicable waiting periods under us competition and trade laws with respect to such acquisitions as well as applicable state regulations and restrictions there can be no assurance that these clearances and approvals will be obtained and additionally government authorities from which these clearances and approvals are required may impose conditions on the completion of any or all of the acquisitions or require changes to their respective terms if in order to obtain any clearances or approvals required to complete any of the acquisitions we become subject to any material conditions after completion of any of such acquisitions our business and results of operations after completion of any of such acquisitions may be adversely affected   

we face significant competition in the markets we serve   

the markets in which we operate are highly competitive we compete worldwide with a number of other manufacturers and distributors that produce and sell similar products we primarily compete in the market with diesel engines and related diesel products however new technologies continue to be developed for gasoline natural gas and other technologies and we will continue to face new competition from these expanding technologies our products primarily compete on the basis of price performance fuel economy speed of delivery quality and customer support we also face competitors in some emerging markets who have established local practices and long standing relationships with participants in these markets there can be no assurance that our products will be able to compete successfully with the products of other companies and in other markets for a more complete discussion of the competitive environment in which each of our segments operates see “operating segments” in “item 1 business”   

increasing global competition among our customers may affect our existing customer relationships and restrict our ability to benefit from some of our customers growth   

as our customers in emerging markets continue to grow in size and scope they are increasingly seeking to export their products to other countries this has meant greater demand for our advanced engine technologies to help these customers meet the more stringent emissions requirements of developed markets as well as greater demand for access to our distribution systems for purposes of equipment servicing as these emerging market customers enter into and begin to compete in more developed markets they may increasingly begin to compete with our existing customers in these markets our further aid to emerging market customers could adversely affect our relationships with developed market customers and as a result we may be pressured to restrict sale or support of some of our products in the areas of increased competition in addition to the extent the competition does not correspond to overall growth in demand we may see little or no benefit from this type of expansion by our emerging market customers 

we are exposed to and may be adversely affected by information technology security threats and sophisticated cyber attacks   

we rely on our information technology systems and networks in connection with various of our business activities some of these networks and systems are managed by third party service providers and are not under our direct control our operations routinely involve receiving storing processing and transmitting sensitive information pertaining to our business customers dealers suppliers employees and other sensitive matters information technology security threats including security breaches computer malware and other “cyber attacks” are increasing in both frequency and sophistication these threats could create financial liability subject us to legal or regulatory sanctions or damage our reputation with customers dealers suppliers and other stakeholders we continuously seek to maintain a robust program of information security and controls but the impact of a material information technology event could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position reputation results of operations financial condition and cash flow 

we are exposed to political economic and other risks that arise from operating a multinational business   

approximately 48 percent of our net sales for 2014 and 52 percent in 2013 were attributable to customers outside the us   accordingly our business is subject to the political economic and other risks that are inherent in operating in numerous countries these risks include   

 as we continue to operate our business globally our success will depend in part on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these and other related risks there can be no assurance that the consequences of these and other factors relating to our multinational operations will not have a material adverse effect upon us   

unanticipated changes in our effective tax rate the adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could adversely affect our profitability 

we are subject to income taxes in the us and numerous international jurisdictions our income tax provision and cash tax liability in the future could be adversely affected by changes in the distribution of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities changes to our assertions regarding permanent reinvestment of our foreign earnings changes in tax laws and the discovery of new information in the course of our tax return preparation process the carrying value of deferred tax assets which are predominantly in the us is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income in the us we are also subject to ongoing tax audits these audits can involve complex issues which may require an extended period of time to resolve and can be highly judgmental tax authorities may disagree with certain tax reporting positions taken by us and as a result assess additional taxes against us we regularly assess the likely outcomes of these audits in order to determine the appropriateness of our tax provision the amounts ultimately paid upon resolution of these or subsequent tax audits could be materially different from the amounts previously included in our income tax provision and therefore could have a material impact on our tax provision   

our global operations are subject to laws and regulations that impose significant compliance costs and create reputational and legal risk   

due to the international scope of our operations we are subject to a complex system of commercial and trade regulations around the world recent years have seen an increase in the development and enforcement of laws regarding trade compliance and anticorruption such as the us foreign corrupt practices act and similar laws from other countries our numerous foreign subsidiaries affiliates and joint venture partners are governed by laws rules and business practices that differ from those of the us the activities of these entities may not comply with us laws or business practices or our code of business conduct violations of these laws may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions could disrupt our business and result in an adverse effect on our reputation business and results of operations or financial condition we cannot predict the nature scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our operations might be subject or the manner in which existing laws might be administered or interpreted   

we face the challenge of accurately aligning our capacity with our demand   

we can experience capacity constraints and longer lead times for certain products in times of growing demand while we can also experience idle capacity as economies slow or demand for certain products decline accurately forecasting our expected volumes and appropriately adjusting our capacity have been and will continue to be important factors in determining our results of operations we cannot guarantee that we will be able to increase manufacturing capacity to a level that meets demand for our products which could prevent us from meeting increased customer demand and could harm our business however if we overestimate our demand and overbuild our capacity we may have significantly underutilized assets and we may experience reduced margins if we do not accurately align our manufacturing capabilities with demand it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations   

our business is exposed to risks of product liability claims   

we face an inherent business risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that our products failure to perform to specification results or is alleged to result in property damage bodily injury andor death we may experience material product liability losses in the future while we maintain insurance coverage with respect to certain product liability claims we may not be able to obtain such insurance on acceptable terms in the future if at all and any such insurance may not provide adequate coverage against product liability claims in addition product liability claims can be expensive to defend and can divert the attention of management and other personnel for significant periods of time regardless of the ultimate outcome an unsuccessful defense of a significant product liability claim could have a material adverse effect upon us in addition even if we are successful in defending against a claim relating to our products claims of this nature could cause our customers to lose confidence in our products and us   

we may need to write off significant investments in our new north american lightduty diesel engine platform if customer commitments deteriorate   

we began development of a new north american lightduty diesel engine platform in july 2006 to be used in a variety of on and offhighway applications since that time and as of december 31 2014 we have capitalized investments of approximately 251 million market uncertainty due to the global recession resulted in some customers delaying or cancelling their vehicle programs while others remained active we reached an agreement to supply nissan motor co ltd with our lightduty diesel engine beginning in 2015 however if customer expectations or volume projections deteriorate from our current expected levels and we do not identify new customers we may need to recognize an impairment charge   

our operations are subject to increasingly stringent environmental laws and regulations   

our plants and operations are subject to increasingly stringent environmental laws and regulations in all of the countries in which we operate including laws and regulations governing air emission discharges to water and the generation handling storage transportation treatment and disposal of waste materials while we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with these environmental laws and regulations there can be no assurance that we will not be adversely impacted by costs liabilities or claims with respect to existing or subsequently acquired operations under either present laws and regulations or those that may be adopted or imposed in the future we are also subject to laws requiring the cleanup of contaminated property if a release of hazardous substances occurs at or from any of our current or former properties or at a landfill or another location where we have disposed of hazardous materials we may be held liable for the contamination and the amount of such liability could be material   

we are subject to foreign currency exchange rate and other related risks   

we conduct operations in many areas of the world involving transactions denominated in a variety of currencies we are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk to the extent that our costs are denominated in currencies other than those in which we earn revenues in addition since our financial statements are denominated in us dollars changes in foreign currency exchange rates between the us dollar and other currencies have had and will continue to have an impact on our results of operations while we customarily enter into financial transactions that attempt to address these risks and many of our supply agreements with customers include foreign currency exchange rate adjustment provisions there can be no assurance that foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations will not adversely affect our results of operations in addition while the use of currency hedging instruments may provide us with some protection from adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates by utilizing these instruments we potentially forego the benefits that might result from favorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates we also face risks arising from the imposition of foreign exchange controls and currency devaluations foreign exchange controls may limit our ability to convert foreign currencies into us dollars or to remit dividends and other payments by our foreign subsidiaries or businesses located in or conducted within a country imposing controls currency devaluations result in a diminished value of funds denominated in the currency of the country instituting the devaluation 

we are exposed to risks arising from the price and availability of energy   

the level of demand for our products and services is influenced in multiple ways by the price and availability of energy high energy costs generally drive greater demand for better fuel economy in almost all countries in which we operate some of our engine products have been developed with a primary purpose of offering fuel economy improvements and if energy costs decrease or increase less than expected demand for these products may likewise decrease the relative unavailability of electricity in some emerging market countries also influences demand for our electricity generating products such as our diesel generators if these countries add energy capacity by expanding their power grids at a rate equal to or faster than the growth in demand for energy the demand for our generating products could also decrease or increase less than would otherwise be the case 

significant declines in future financial and stock market conditions could diminish our pension plan asset performance and adversely impact our results of operations financial condition and cash flow   

we sponsor both funded and unfunded domestic and foreign defined benefit pension and other retirement plans our pension cost and the required contributions to our pension plans are directly affected by the value of plan assets the projected and actual rates of return on plan assets and the actuarial assumptions we use to measure our defined benefit pension plan obligations including the discount rate at which future projected and accumulated pension obligations are discounted to a present value we could experience increased pension cost due to a combination of factors including the decreased investment performance of pension plan assets decreases in the discount rate and changes in our assumptions relating to the expected return on plan assets significant declines in future financial and stock market conditions could cause material losses in our pension plan assets which could result in increased pension cost in future years and adversely impact our results of operations financial condition and cash flow depending upon the severity of market declines and government regulatory changes we may be legally obligated to make pension payments in the us and perhaps other countries and these contributions could be material   

we may be adversely impacted by work stoppages and other labor matters 

as of december 31 2014 we employed approximately 54600 persons worldwide approximately 17680 of our employees worldwide are represented by various unions under collective bargaining agreements that expire between 2015 and 2019  while we have no reason to believe that we will be materially impacted by work stoppages or other labor matters there can be no assurance that future issues with our labor unions will be resolved favorably or that we will not encounter future strikes work stoppages or other types of conflicts with labor unions or our employees any of these consequences may have an adverse effect on us or may limit our flexibility in dealing with our workforce in addition many of our customers and suppliers have unionized work forces work stoppages or slowdowns experienced by our customers or suppliers could result in slowdowns or closures that would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flow   

our financial statements are subject to changes in accounting standards that could adversely impact our profitability or financial position   

our financial statements are subject to the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap which are periodically revised andor expanded accordingly from time to time we are required to adopt new or revised accounting standards issued by recognized authoritative bodies including the financial accounting standards board recently accounting standard setters issued new guidance which further interprets or seeks to revise accounting pronouncements related to revenue recognition and lease accounting as well as to issue new standards expanding disclosures the impact of accounting pronouncements that have been issued but not yet implemented is disclosed in our annual and quarterly reports on form 10k and form 10q an assessment of proposed standards is not provided as such proposals are subject to change through the exposure process and therefore their effects on our financial statements cannot be meaningfully assessed it is possible that future accounting standards we are required to adopt could change the current accounting treatment that we apply to our consolidated financial statements and that such changes could have a material adverse effect on the reported results of operations and financial position

 item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

organization of information 

the following managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations mda was prepared to provide the reader with a view and perspective of our business through the eyes of management and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements  and the accompanying notes to those financial statements our mda is presented in the following sections 

 

executive summary and financial highlights 

we are a global power leader that designs manufactures distributes and services diesel and natural gas engines and enginerelated component products including filtration aftertreatment turbochargers fuel systems controls systems air handling systems and electric power generation systems we sell our products to original equipment manufacturers oems distributors and other customers worldwide   we have longstanding relationships with many of the leading manufacturers in the markets we serve including paccar inc daimler trucks north america chrysler group llc chrysler volvo ab komatsu navistar international corporation aggreko plc ford motor company and man nutzfahrzeuge ag   we serve our customers through a network of approximately   600  companyowned and independent distributor locations and approximately   7200   dealer locations in more than 190  countries and territories   

our reportable operating segments consist of the following engine distribution components and power generation this reporting structure is organized according to the products and markets each segment serves  the engine segment produces engines and parts for sale to customers in onhighway and various industrial markets our engines are used in trucks of all sizes buses and recreational vehicles as well as in various industrial applications including construction mining agriculture marine oil and gas rail and military equipment the distribution segment includes whollyowned and partiallyowned distributorships engaged in wholesaling engines generator sets and service parts as well as performing service and repair activities on our products and maintaining relationships with various oems throughout the world the components segment sells filtration products aftertreatment systems turbochargers and fuel systems the power generation segment is an integrated provider of power systems which sells engines generator sets and alternators   

our financial performance depends in large part on varying conditions in the markets we serve particularly the onhighway construction and general industrial markets demand in these markets tends to fluctuate in response to overall economic conditions our sales may also be impacted by oem inventory levels and production schedules and stoppages economic downturns in markets we serve generally result in reduced sales of our products and can result in price reductions in certain products andor markets as a worldwide business our operations are also affected by currency political economic and regulatory matters including adoption and enforcement of environmental and emission standards in the countries we serve as part of our growth strategy we invest in businesses in certain countries that carry high levels of these risks such as china brazil india mexico russia and countries in the middle east and africa at the same time our geographic diversity and broad product and service offerings have helped limit the impact from a drop in demand in any one industry or customer or the economy of any single country on our consolidated results   

worldwide revenues improved   11 percent  in 2014  compared to 2013  primarily due to the improvements in north american onhighway demand and the consolidation of partially owned north american distributors revenue in the us and canada improved  by 20 percent  primarily due to increased demand in the north american onhighway markets driving sales in both the engine and components segments as well as improved distribution segment sales related to the consolidation of partially 

owned north american distributors since december 31 2012 these increases were partially offset by the reduced demand in the north american power generation markets primarily due to lower military sales amid the continued international economic uncertainty in 2014 our international revenues remained flat compared to 2013 international revenues increased in the components segment especially the emission solutions business in western europe and china due to additional content as the result of new emission regulations while the distribution segment revenues improved due to demand growth in africa and asia pacific these increases were offset by decreased international onhighway demand with decreased shipments of 7 percent and 11 percent in the heavyduty and mediumduty truck markets respectively and decreased demand in international power generation markets

the provision for warranties issued excluding campaigns as a percentage of sales was 20 percent  in 2014  and 21 percent  in 2013  a more detailed discussion of margin by segment is presented in the operating segment results section 

selling general and administrative expenses 

selling general and administrative expenses increased  primarily due to higher compensation and related expenses of 118 million and increased consulting fees of 28 million these increases were significantly impacted by the acquisition of our partially owned north american distributors since december 31 2012 compensation and related expenses include salaries fringe benefits and variable compensation overall selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales increased  to 109 percent  in 2014  from 105 percent  in 2013  

research development and engineering expenses

equity royalty and interest income from investees 

equity royalty and interest income from investees increase d primarily due to the following 



the increase s above were primarily due to increased earnings at beijing foton cummins engine co ltd lightduty  komatsu cummins chile ltda  and dongfeng cummins engine company ltd  partially offset by the consolidation of the partiallyowned north american distributors since december 31 2012 and losses at beijing foton cummins engine co ltd heavyduty  as the result of increased expenses related to the production launch of the 2014 product in the second quarter of 2014 

as we execute our plan to acquire partiallyowned distributors we expect equity earnings for our north american distributors to decrease as the earnings will be included in our consolidated results see note 2  “ acquisitions ” to the consolidated financial statements  for further information 

other operating income expense net 

other operating income expense net was as follows 



interest income 

interest income decreased  in 2014  primarily due to an interest income recovery of a loan previously deemed unrecoverable in the second quarter of 2013

other income expense net 

other income expense net was as follows 



          

          1  see note 2  “ acquisitions  to the consolidated financial statements  for more details 

income tax expense 

our income tax rates are generally less than the 35 percent us statutory income tax rate primarily because of lower taxes on foreign earnings and research tax credits our effective tax rate for 2014 was 287 percent  compared to 251 percent  for 2013  the 36 percent  increase in the effective tax rate from 2013 to 2014 is partially due to a 12 percent  net tax benefit for onetime items in 2013 that did not repeat in 2014 these 2013 onetime items consisted primarily of the 2012 federal research tax credit that was reinstated during 2013 the additional 24 percent  increase in tax rate from 2013 to 2014 is attributable primarily to the following unfavorable items that occurred in 2014 a tax law change in the uk resulting in a higher limitation on the deductibility of interest unfavorable changes in the jurisdictional mix of pretax income and increases in state valuation allowances 

we evaluate the recoverability of our deferred tax assets each quarter by assessing the likelihood of future profitability and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize our net deferred tax assets at december 31 2014 we recorded net deferred tax assets of 184 million  these assets included 190 million  for the value of tax loss and credit carryforwards a valuation allowance of 144 million  was recorded to reduce the tax assets to the net value management believed was more likely than not to be realized in the event our operating performance deteriorates future assessments could conclude that a larger valuation allowance will be needed to further reduce the deferred tax assets 

we expect our 2015 effective tax rate to be 295 percent  excluding any discrete items that may arise the research tax credit expired december 31 2014 and has not yet been renewed by congress if the research credit is reinstated during 2015 we would anticipate the 2015 effective tax rate to be reduced to 285 percent consistent with the 2014 rate of 287 percent  

noncontrolling interests 

noncontrolling interests eliminate the income or loss attributable to noncummins ownership interests in our consolidated entities noncontrolling interests in income of consolidated subsidiaries decrease d primarily due to a 23 million decline from the acquisition of the remaining interest in previously consolidated north american distributors since december 31 2012  

net income attributable to cummins inc and diluted earnings per share attributable to cummins inc 

net income and diluted earnings per share attributable to cummins inc increase d primarily due to higher gross margin mainly driven by improved volumes and improved distribution segment sales related to the consolidation of partiallyowned north american distributors since december 31 2012 these increase s were partially offset by higher selling general and administrative expenses and a higher effective tax rate of 287 percent in 2014 versus 251 percent in 2013 diluted earnings per share for 2014 benefited 016 from lower shares outstanding primarily due to purchases under the stock repurchase program

gross margin decreased by 125 million and as a percentage of sales by 07 percentage points the decrease in gross margin as a percentage of sales was primarily due to a decline in demand for highhorsepower engines and gensets partially offset by improved price realization lower material and commodity costs and the absence of 2012 restructuring charges of 29 million 

the provision for warranties issued excluding campaigns as a percentage of sales was 21 percent in both 2013 and 2012 a more detailed discussion of margin by segment is presented in the operating segment results section 

selling general and administrative expenses 

selling general and administrative expenses increased primarily due to incremental costs in 2013 related to the acquisition of partially owned north american distributors since june 2012 these costs primarily contributed to increased compensation and related expenses of 57 million partially offset by lower consulting of 24 million the absence of 2012 restructuring charges of 20 million and reduced discretionary spending higher compensation expense was primarily due to increased headcount to support our strategic growth initiatives compensation and related expenses include salaries fringe benefits and variable compensation overall selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales increased to 111 percent in 2013 from 110 percent in 2012 

research development and engineering expenses

income tax expense 

our income tax rates are generally less than the 35 percent us statutory income tax rate primarily because of lower taxes on foreign earnings and research tax credits our effective tax rate for 2013 was 251 percent compared to 235 percent for 2012 as a result of a restructuring of our foreign operations in 2013 our 2013 effective tax rate was approximately 1 percent less than it would have been without restructuring on january 2 2013 the american taxpayer relief act of 2012 was signed into law and reinstated the research tax credit back to 2012 as tax law changes are accounted for in the period of enactment we recognized a 28 million discrete tax benefit in the first quarter of 2013 we also recognized a discrete tax expense of 17 million in the first quarter which primarily related to the writeoff of a deferred tax asset deemed unrecoverable also included in 2013 was a third quarter discrete net tax expense of 7 million primarily related to us federal tax return trueup adjustments and the third quarter enactment of uk tax law changes additionally our effective tax rate for 2013 also included a fourth quarter discrete net tax benefit of 21 million primarily due to the release of us deferred tax liabilities related to prior years unremitted income of certain indian and mexican subsidiaries now considered to be permanently reinvested as well as adjustments to our income tax accounts principally based on our 2012 state tax return filings our 2012 income tax provision included a onetime 134 million tax benefit which resulted from tax planning strategies and tax return elections made with respect to our uk operations 

we evaluate the recoverability of our deferred tax assets each quarter by assessing the likelihood of future profitability and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize our net deferred tax assets at december 31 2013 we recorded net deferred tax assets of 177 million these assets included 187 million for the value of tax loss and credit carryforwards a valuation allowance of 101 million was recorded to reduce the tax assets to the net value management believed was more likely than not to be realized in the event our operating performance deteriorates future assessments could conclude that a larger valuation allowance will be needed to further reduce the deferred tax assets 

noncontrolling interests 

noncontrolling interests in income of consolidated subsidiaries increased reflecting our minoritys share of higher profits of 7 million at cummins western canada lp 6 million at wuxi cummins turbo technologies co ltd and 4 million due to the acquisition of a majority interest in cummins central power llc central power in the third quarter of 2012 the increases were partially offset by a total decrease of 8 million at cummins india ltd 

net income attributable to cummins inc and diluted earnings per share attributable to cummins inc 

net income and diluted earnings per share attributable to cummins inc decreased primarily due to lower gross margin as a percentage of sales mainly driven by unfavorable product mix and lower volumes particularly in the engine segment and power generation segment a higher effective tax rate of 251 percent versus 235 percent in 2012 lower equity royalty and interest income from investees mainly due to the acquisition of the north american distributors and higher selling general and administrative expenses these decreases were partially offset by lower research development and engineering expenses diluted earnings per share for 2013 benefited 006 from lower shares outstanding primarily due to purchases under the stock repurchase program 

operating segment results 

our reportable operating segments which consist of the engine distribution components and power generation segments use segment ebit defined as earnings before interest expense taxes and noncontrolling interests as a primary basis for the chief operating decisionmaker to evaluate the performance of each of our operating segments segment amounts exclude certain expenses not specifically identifiable to segments 

the accounting policies of our operating segments are the same as those applied in our consolidated financial statements  we prepared the financial results of our operating segments on a basis that is consistent with the manner in which we internally disaggregate financial information to assist in making internal operating decisions we have allocated certain common costs and expenses primarily corporate functions among segments differently than we would for standalone financial information prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap these include certain costs and expenses of shared services such as information technology human resources legal and finance we also do not allocate debtrelated items actuarial gains or losses prior service costs or credits changes in cash surrender value of corporate owned life insurance or income taxes to individual segments segment ebit may not be consistent with measures used by other companies

liquidity and capital resources 

managements assessment of liquidity 

our financial condition and liquidity remain strong our solid balance sheet and credit ratings enable us to have ready access to credit and the capital markets 

we assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate adequate cash to fund our operating investing and financing activities we generate significant ongoing cash flow which has been used in part to fund repurchases of common stock capital expenditures dividends on our common stock and acquisitions cash provided by operations is our principal source of liquidity as of december 31 2014  other sources of liquidity included 

 

our revolving credit agreement provides us with a 175 billion  unsecured revolving credit facility the proceeds of which are to be used for our general corporate purposes in the fourth quarter of 2014 we exercised our option to extend the maturity date of our revolving credit agreement by one year from november 9 2017 to november 9 2018  see note 9   debt  to our consolidated financial statements  for further information the credit agreement includes one financial covenant a leverage ratio the required leverage ratio which measures the sum of total debt plus securitization financing to consolidated earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda for the four fiscal quarters may not exceed 325 to 10 at december 31 2014  our leverage ratio was 06 to 10 

we have a current shelf registration filed with the securities and exchange commission under which we may offer from time to time debt securities common stock preferred and preference stock depositary shares warrants stock purchase contracts and stock purchase units 

we believe our liquidity provides us with the financial flexibility needed to fund working capital common stock repurchases capital expenditures dividend payments acquisitions of our north american distributors projected pension obligations and debt service obligations we continue to generate cash from operations in the us and maintain access to 17 billion  of our revolver as noted above 

a significant portion of our cash flow is generated outside the us as of december 31 2014  the total of cash cash equivalents and marketable securities held by foreign subsidiaries was 14 billion  the vast majority of which was located in the uk china singapore belgium and india the geographic location of our cash and marketable securities aligns well with our business growth strategy we manage our worldwide cash requirements considering available funds among the many subsidiaries through which we conduct our business and the cost effectiveness with which those funds can be accessed as a result we do not anticipate any local liquidity restrictions to preclude us from funding our targeted expansion or operating needs with local resources   

if we distribute our foreign cash balances to the us or to other foreign subsidiaries we could be required to accrue and pay us taxes for example we would be required to accrue and pay additional us taxes if we repatriated cash from certain foreign subsidiaries whose earnings we have asserted are permanently reinvested outside of the us foreign earnings for which we assert permanent reinvestment outside the us consist primarily of earnings of our china and uk domiciled subsidiaries at present we do not foresee a need to repatriate any earnings from these subsidiaries for which we have asserted permanent reinvestment however to help fund cash needs of the us or other international subsidiaries as they arise we repatriate available cash from certain foreign subsidiaries whose earnings are not permanently reinvested when it is cost effective to do so earnings generated after 2011 from our china operations are considered permanently reinvested while earnings generated prior to 2012 for which us deferred tax liabilities have been recorded are expected to be repatriated in future years  

the maturity schedule of our existing longterm debt does not require significant cash outflows in the intermediate term   required annual principal payments range from 11 million  to 28 million  over each of the next five years 

working capital summary 

we fund our working capital with cash from operations and shortterm borrowings when necessary various assets and liabilities including shortterm debt can fluctuate significantly from month to month depending on shortterm liquidity needs as a result working capital is a prime focus of management attention 



current assets increase d 5 percent  compared to 2013  primarily due to increases in inventories and accounts and notes receivable principally due to the acquisitions of north american distributors in 2014  the increase s were partially offset by a decrease in cash and marketable securities primarily due to lower proceeds from borrowings and 670 million  of share repurchases in 2014  

current liabilities increase d 19 percent  compared to 2013  primarily due to an increase in trade accounts payable and an increase in other accrued expenses 

inventory turnover decrease d 01 turns  compared to 2013  the decrease  was primarily due to higher inventory balances related to the consolidation of six north american distributors in 2014  which added 379 million of inventory at december 31 2014  

cash flows 

cash and cash equivalents decrease d 398 million  during 2014  compared to an increase  of 1330 million  during the comparable period in 2013  the changes impacting cash and cash equivalents were as follows 

operating activities 



2014  vs 2013 

net cash provided by  operating activities increase d versus 2013  primarily due to higher consolidated net income and favorable working capital fluctuations partially offset by unfavorable deferred income taxes and higher pension contributions in excess of expense during 2014  the lower  working capital resulted in a cash inflow  of 68 million  compared to a cash outflow  of 65 million  in 2013  this change of 133 million  was primarily driven by an increase in accrued expenses and accounts payable partially offset by an increase in other current assets and inventories in 2014  versus the comparable period in 2013  the increase in accrued expenses was primarily due to higher income taxes payable while the change in other current assets was largely due to the receipt of an income tax refund in 2013  

pensions 

the funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon a variety of variables and assumptions including return on invested assets market interest rates and levels of voluntary contributions to the plans  in 2014  the investment return on our us pension trust was 133 percent while our uk pension trust return was 168 percent   approximately 78 percent of our pension plan assets are held in highly liquid investments such as fixed income and equity securities the remaining 22 percent of our plan assets are held in less liquid but market valued investments including real estate private equity and insurance contracts  we made 205 million  of pension contributions in 2014  including 111 million  of voluntary contributions claims and premiums for other postretirement benefits approximated 45 million  net of reimbursements in 2014  these contributions and payments include transfers from our funds either to increase pension plan assets or to make direct payments to plan participants  we anticipate making total contributions of 175 million  to our defined benefit pension plans in 2015  expected contributions to our defined benefit pension plans in 2015  will meet or exceed the current funding requirements 

2013  vs 2012   

net cash provided by operating activities increased versus 2012 primarily due to favorable working capital fluctuations partially offset by lower consolidated net income and lower dividends received from equity investees during 2013 the net increase in working capital resulted in a cash outflow of 65 million compared to a cash outflow of 775 million in 2012 this change of 710 million was primarily driven by an increase in accounts payable due to timing differences lower net tax payments of 311 million due to the receipt of income tax refunds in 2013 which were partially offset by tax payments and a smaller decrease in accrued expenses partially offset by an increase in accounts and notes receivable in 2013 as a result of higher sales in the fourth quarter of 2013 versus 2012 

investing activities 



2014  vs 2013   

net cash used in investing activities increase d versus 2013  primarily due to higher cash investment for the acquisition of businesses in 2014 and higher capital expenditures partially offset by reduced purchases of corporate owned life insurance 

in 2014  we spent 436 million  net of cash acquired on acquisitions of businesses in the distribution segment we plan to spend an additional 170 million to 210 million  on north american distributor acquisitions and related debt retirements in 2015 

capital expenditures were 743 million  in 2014  compared to 676 million  in 2013  despite the challenging international economies we continue to invest in new product lines and targeted capacity expansions we plan to spend between 750 million and 850 million in 2015 as we continue with product launches facility improvements and prepare for future emission standards approximately 50 percent of our capital expenditures are expected to be invested outside of the us in 2015 

2013  vs 2012   

net cash used in investing activities decreased versus 2012 primarily due to lower net investments in marketable securities lower cash investments in acquisitions of businesses and lower investments in and advances to equity investees partially offset by purchases of corporate owned life insurance 

financing activities

2013  vs 2012

our other commercial commitments as of december 31 2014  are as follows 



application of critical accounting estimates 

a summary of our significant accounting policies is included in note 1   summary of significant accounting policies  of our consolidated financial statements  which discusses accounting policies that we have selected from acceptable alternatives 

our consolidated financial statements  are prepared in accordance with gaap which often requires management to make judgments estimates and assumptions regarding uncertainties that affect the reported amounts presented and disclosed in the financial statements management reviews these estimates and assumptions based on historical experience changes in business conditions and other relevant factors they believe to be reasonable under the circumstances in any given reporting period our actual results may differ from the estimates and assumptions used in preparing our consolidated financial statements 

critical accounting estimates are defined as follows the estimate requires management to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the estimate was made different estimates reasonably could have been used or if changes in the estimate are reasonably likely to occur from period to period and the change would have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations our senior management has discussed the development and selection of our accounting policies related accounting estimates and the disclosures set forth below with the audit committee of our board of directors we believe our critical accounting estimates include those addressing the estimation of liabilities for warranty programs accounting for income taxes and pension benefits 

warranty programs 

we estimate and record a liability for base warranty programs at the time our products are sold our estimates are based on historical experience and reflect managements best estimates of expected costs at the time products are sold and subsequent adjustment to those expected costs when actual costs differ as a result of the uncertainty surrounding the nature and frequency of product recall programs the liability for such programs is recorded when we commit to a recall action or when a recall becomes probable and estimable which generally occurs when it is announced our warranty liability is generally affected by component failure rates repair costs and the point of failure within the product life cycle future events and circumstances related to these factors could materially change our estimates and require adjustments to our liability new product launches require a greater use of judgment in developing estimates until historical experience becomes available product specific experience is typically available four or five quarters after product launch with a clear experience trend evident eight quarters after launch we generally record warranty expense for new products upon shipment using a preceding products warranty history and a multiplicative factor based upon preceding similar product experience and new product assessment until sufficient new product data is available for warranty estimation we then use a blend of actual new product experience and preceding product historical experience for several subsequent quarters and new product specific experience thereafter note 10   product warranty liability  to our consolidated financial statements  contains a summary of the activity in our warranty liability account for 2014  and 2013  including adjustments to preexisting warranties 

accounting for income taxes 

we determine our income tax expense using the asset and liability method under this method deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax effects of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases future tax benefits of tax loss and credit carryforwards are also recognized as deferred tax assets we evaluate the recoverability of our deferred tax assets each quarter by assessing the likelihood of future profitability and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize our net deferred tax assets  at december 31 2014  we recorded net deferred tax assets of 184 million  these assets included 190 million  for the value of tax loss and credit carryforwards a valuation allowance of 144 million  was recorded to reduce the tax assets to the net value management believed was more likely than not to be realized in the event our operating performance deteriorates future assessments could conclude that a larger valuation allowance will be needed to further reduce the deferred tax assets in addition we operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and are subject to tax audits in these jurisdictions these audits can involve complex issues which may require an extended period of time to resolve we accrue for the estimated additional tax and interest that may result from tax authorities disputing uncertain tax positions we have taken and we believe we have made adequate provision for income taxes for all years that are subject to audit based upon the latest information available a more complete description of our income taxes and the future benefits of our tax loss and credit carryforwards is disclosed in  note 4   income taxes  to our consolidated financial statements  

pension benefits 

we sponsor a number of pension plans primarily in the us and the uk and to a lesser degree in various other countries in the us and the uk we have several major defined benefit plans that are separately funded we account for our pension programs in accordance with employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans under gaap gaap requires that amounts recognized in financial statements be determined using an actuarial basis as a result our pension benefit programs are based on a number of statistical and judgmental assumptions that attempt to anticipate future events and are used in calculating the expense and liability related to our plans each year at december 31 these assumptions include discount rates used to value liabilities assumed rates of return on plan assets future compensation increases employee turnover rates actuarial assumptions relating to retirement age mortality rates and participant withdrawals the actuarial assumptions we use may differ significantly from actual results due to changing economic conditions participant life span and withdrawal rates these differences may result in a material impact to the amount of net periodic pension cost to be recorded in our consolidated financial statements  in the future 

the expected longterm return on plan assets is used in calculating the net periodic pension cost we considered several factors in developing our expected rate of return on plan assets the longterm rate of return considers historical returns and expected returns on current and projected asset allocations and is generally applied to a fiveyear average market value of return projected returns are based primarily on broad publicly traded fixed income and equity indices and forwardlooking estimates of active portfolio and investment management as of december 31 2014 based upon our target asset allocations it is anticipated that our us investment policy will generate an average annual return over the 10year projection period equal to or in excess of 75 percent approximately 20 percent of the time while returns of 80 percent or greater are anticipated 15 percent of the time  we expect additional positive returns from active investment management  the 2014  oneyear return of 133 percent  combined with the very favorable returns since 2010 has resulted in approximately 470 million  of actuarial gains in accumulated other comprehensive income over the past five years based on the historical returns and forwardlooking return expectations we believe an investment return assumption of 75 percent  per year in 2015  for us pension assets is reasonable 

the methodology used to determine the rate of return on pension plan assets in the uk was based on establishing an equityrisk premium over current longterm bond yields adjusted based on target asset allocations as of december 31 2014 based upon our target asset allocations it is anticipated that our uk investment policy will generate an average annual return over the 20year projection period equal to or in excess of 52 percent approximately 50 percent of the time while returns of 61 percent or greater are anticipated 25 percent of the time  we expect additional positive returns from active investment management  the oneyear return for our uk plan was 168 percent  for 2014  and similar to our us plan the strong returns over the past five years have resulted in approximately 285 million  of actuarial gains in accumulated other comprehensive income our strategy with respect to our investments in pension plan assets is to be invested with a longterm outlook therefore the risk and return balance of our asset portfolio should reflect a longterm horizon based on the historical returns and forwardlooking return expectations we believe an investment return assumption of 58 percent  in 2015  for uk pension assets is reasonable our pension plan asset allocations at december 31 2014  and 2013  and target allocation for 2015  are as follows 



the differences between the actual return on plan assets and expected longterm return on plan assets are recognized in the asset value used to calculate net periodic cost over five years the table below sets forth the expected return assumptions used to develop our pension cost for the period 2012  2014  and our expected rate of return for 2015  



a lower expected rate of return will increase our net periodic pension cost and reduce profitability 

gaap for pensions offers various acceptable alternatives to account for the differences that eventually arise between the estimates used in the actuarial valuations and the actual results it is acceptable to delay or immediately recognize these differences under the delayed recognition alternative changes in pension obligation including those resulting from plan amendments and changes in the value of assets set aside to meet those obligations are not recognized in net periodic pension cost as they occur but are recognized initially in comprehensive income and subsequently amortized as components of net periodic pension cost systematically and gradually over future periods in addition to this approach gaap also allows immediate recognition of actuarial gains or losses immediate recognition introduces volatility in financial results we have chosen to delay recognition and amortize actuarial differences over future periods if we adopted the immediate recognition approach we would record a loss of 897 million 614 million aftertax from cumulative actuarial net losses for our us and uk pension plans 

the difference between the expected return and the actual return on plan assets is deferred from recognition in our results of operations and under certain circumstances such as when the difference exceeds 10 percent  of the market value of plan assets or the projected benefit obligation pbo amortized over future years of service this is also true of changes to actuarial assumptions as of december 31 2014  we had net pension actuarial losses of 611 million  and 286 million  for the us and uk pension plans respectively under gaap the actuarial gains and losses are recognized and recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss net actuarial losses decreased our shareholders equity by 78 million aftertax in 2014  the losses were due to liability losses from lower us and uk discount rates partially offset by improved plan asset performance for both the us and uk plans as these amounts exceed 10 percent  of our pbo the excess is amortized over the average remaining service lives of participating employees 

the table below sets forth the net periodic pension cost for the period 2012  2014  and our expected cost for 2015  



we expect 2015  net periodic pension cost to remain flat  when compared to 2014  due to lower discount rates in the us and uk and unfavorable mortality demographics in the us offset by favorable expected return on asset performance in both the us and uk the decrease  in periodic pension cost in 2014  compared to 2013  was due to reduced loss amortizations resulting from improved us asset performance and a higher discount rate the increase in periodic pension cost in 2013 compared to 2012 was due to unfavorable impacts of higher service cost due to increased headcount decreased discount rates and lower expected asset returns for our uk plan as we derisk plan trust assets moving toward more conservative investments  another key assumption used in the development of the net periodic pension cost is the discount rate the weighted average discount rates used to develop our net periodic pension cost are set forth in the table below 



changes in the discount rate assumptions will impact the interest cost component of the net periodic pension cost calculation 

the discount rate enables us to state expected future cash payments for benefits as a present value on the measurement date the guidelines for setting this rate are discussed in gaap which suggests the use of a highquality corporate bond rate we used bond information provided by moodys investor services inc and standard  poors rating services all bonds used to develop our hypothetical portfolio in the us and uk were deemed highquality noncallable bonds aa or better as of december 31 2014  by at least one of the bond rating agencies the average yield of this hypothetical bond portfolio was used as the benchmark for determining the discount rate to be used to value the obligations of the plans subject to gaap for pensions and other postretirement benefits 

our model called for projected payments until near extinction for the us and the uk for both countries our model matches the present value of the plans projected benefit payments to the market value of the theoretical settlement bond portfolio a single equivalent discount rate is determined to align the present value of the required cash flow with the value of the bond portfolio the resulting discount rate is reflective of both the current interest rate environment and the plans distinct liability characteristics 

the table below sets forth the estimated impact on our 2015  net periodic pension cost relative to a change in the discount rate and a change in the expected rate of return on plan assets 



the above sensitivities reflect the impact of changing one assumption at a time a higher discount rate decreases the plan obligations and decreases our net periodic pension cost a lower discount rate increases the plan obligations and increases our net periodic pension cost it should be noted that economic factors and conditions often affect multiple assumptions simultaneously and the effects of changes in key assumptions are not necessarily linear note 11   pension and other postretirement benefits  to our consolidated financial statements  provides a summary of our pension benefit plan activity the funded status of our plans and the amounts recognized in our consolidated financial statements  

recently adopted and recently issued accounting pronouncements 

accounting pronouncements recently adopted 

in february 2013 the financial accounting standards board fasb amended its standards on comprehensive income by requiring disclosure in the footnotes of information about amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component specifically the amendment requires disclosure of the line items on net income in which the item was reclassified only if it is reclassified to net income in its entirety in the same reporting period the new rules became effective for us beginning january 1 2013 and were adopted prospectively in accordance with the standard the standard resulted in new disclosures in   note 15   accumulated other comprehensive income loss  

accounting pronouncements issued but not yet effective 

in may 2014 the fasb amended its standards related to revenue recognition this amendment replaces all existing revenue recognition guidance and provides a single comprehensive revenue recognition model for all contracts with customers the standard contains principles that we will apply to determine the measurement of revenue and timing of when it is recognized the underlying principle is that we will recognize revenue in a manner that depicts the transfer of goods or services to customers at an amount that we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services the standard allows either full or modified retrospective adoption early adoption is not permitted the guidance provides a fivestep analysis of transactions to determine when and how revenue is recognized other major provisions include capitalization of certain contract costs consideration of time value of money in the transaction price and allowing estimates of variable consideration to be recognized before contingencies are resolved in certain circumstances the amendment also requires additional disclosure about the nature amount timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts including significant judgments and changes in judgments and assets recognized from costs incurred to fulfill a contract the new rules will become effective for annual and interim periods beginning january 1 2017 we are in the process of evaluating the impact the amendment will have on our  consolidated financial statements  and we are further considering the impact of each method of adoption 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to financial risk resulting from volatility in foreign exchange rates commodity prices and interest rates this risk is closely monitored and managed through the use of financial derivative instruments including foreign currency forward contracts commodity zerocost collars and interest rate swaps these instruments as further described below are accounted for as cash flow or fair value hedges or as economic hedges not designated as hedges for accounting purposes financial derivatives are used expressly for hedging purposes and under no circumstances are they used for speculative purposes when material we adjust the estimated fair value of our derivative contracts for counterparty or our credit risk none of our derivative instruments are subject to collateral requirements substantially all of our derivative contracts are subject to master netting arrangements which provide us with the option to settle certain contracts on a net basis when they settle on the same day with the same currency in addition these arrangements provide for a net settlement of all contracts with a given counterparty in the event that the arrangement is terminated due to the occurrence of default or a termination event   

the following describes our risk exposures and provides the results of a sensitivity analysis performed as of december 31 2014  the sensitivity analysis assumes instantaneous parallel shifts in foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices 

foreign exchange rates 

as a result of our international business presence we are exposed to foreign currency exchange risks we transact business in foreign currencies and as a result our income experiences some volatility related to movements in foreign currency exchange rates to help manage our exposure to exchange rate volatility we use foreign currency forward contracts on a regular basis to hedge forecasted intercompany and thirdparty sales and purchases denominated in nonfunctional currencies our internal policy allows for managing anticipated foreign currency cash flows for up to one year  these foreign currency forward contracts are designated and qualify as foreign currency cash flow hedges under gaap  for the years ended december 31 2014  and 2013  there were no circumstances that would have resulted in the discontinuance of a foreign currency cash flow hedge   

to minimize the income volatility resulting from the remeasurement of net monetary assets and payables denominated in a currency other than the functional currency we enter into foreign currency forward contracts which are considered economic hedges the objective is to offset the gain or loss from remeasurement with the gain or loss from the fair market valuation of the forward contract these derivative instruments are not designated as hedges under gaap   

as of december 31 2014 the potential gain or loss in the fair value of our outstanding foreign currency contracts assuming a hypothetical 10  percent fluctuation in the currencies of such contracts would be approximately 21 million  the sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates assumes the notional value to remain constant for the next 12 months the analysis ignores the impact of foreign exchange movements on our competitive position and potential changes in sales levels any change in the value of the contracts real or hypothetical would be significantly offset by an inverse change in the value of the underlying hedged items  

interest rate risk   

we are exposed to market risk from fluctuations in interest rates we manage our exposure to interest rate fluctuations through the use of interest rate swaps the objective of the swaps is to more effectively balance our borrowing costs and interest rate risk   

in february 2014 we settled our november 2005 interest rate swap which previously converted our 250 million  debt issue due in 2028 from a fixed rate  of 7125 percent  to a floating rate based on libor   plus a spread   also in february 2014 we entered into a series of interest rate swaps to effectively convert our september 2013 500 million  debt issue due in 2023 from a fixed rate of 365 percent  to a floating rate equal to the onemonth libor   plus a spread  the terms of the swaps mirror those of the debt with interest paid semiannually the swaps were designated and will be accounted for as fair value hedges under gaap the gain or loss on these derivative instruments as well as the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in current income as “interest expense” the net swap settlements that accrue each period are also reported in interest expense 

the following table summarizes these gains and losses for the years presented below   



 

1   the difference between the gainloss on swaps and borrowings represents hedge ineffectiveness 

commodity price risk   

we are exposed to fluctuations in commodity prices due to contractual agreements with component suppliers in order to protect ourselves against future price volatility and consequently fluctuations in gross margins we periodically enter into commodity zerocost collar contracts with designated banks to fix the cost of certain raw material purchases with the objective of minimizing changes in inventory cost due to market price fluctuations we have commodity zerocost collar contracts that represent an economic hedge but are not designated for hedge accounting and are marked to market through earnings our internal policy allows for managing our cash flow hedges for up to three years     

as of december 31 2014 the potential gain or loss related to the outstanding commodity zerocost collar contracts assuming a hypothetical 10  percent fluctuation in the price of such commodities was   2 million  the sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in commodity prices assumes the notional value to remain constant for the next 12 months the analysis ignores the impact of commodity price movements on our competitive position and potential changes in sales levels any change in the value of the zerocost collar contracts real or hypothetical would be significantly offset by an inverse change in the value of the underlying hedged items

 nonwhollyowned subsidiary 

we have a controlling interest in cummins india ltd cil which is a publicly listed company on various stock exchanges in india cil produces midrange heavyduty and highhorsepower engines generators for the indian and export markets and natural gas sparkignited engines for power generation automotive and industrial applications cil also has distribution and power generation operations 

supply 

the performance of the endtoend supply chain extending through to our suppliers is foundational to our ability to meet customers expectations and support longterm growth we are committed to having a robust strategy for how we select and manage our suppliers to enable a market focused supply chain this requires us to continuously evaluate and upgrade our supply base as necessary to ensure we are meeting the needs of our customers 

we have a strategic sourcing policy that guides decisions on what we make internally what we purchase externally and when we establish supplier partnerships to provide the lowest total cost and highest supply chain performance today we machine and assemble strategic components used in our engines and power generation units including blocks heads turbochargers connecting rods camshafts crankshafts filters alternators and fuel systems we source externally purchased material and manufactured components from global leading suppliers both domestically and internationally many key suppliers are managed through longterm supply agreements that assure capacity delivery quality and cost requirements are met over an extended period approximately 60  to 70 percent of the direct material in our product designs are single sourced to external suppliers although we elected to source a relatively high proportion of our total raw materials and components from single suppliers we have an established annual sourcing strategy process and risk assessment procedures to evaluate risk these processes are leading us to increase our use of dual and parallel sourcing to both minimize risk and increase supply chain responsiveness 

other important elements of our sourcing strategy include 

 patents and trademarks 

we own or control a significant number of patents and trademarks relating to the products we manufacture these patents and trademarks were granted and registered over a period of years although these patents and trademarks are generally considered beneficial to our operations we do not believe any patent group of patents or trademark other than our leading brand house trademarks is significant to our business 

seasonality 

while individual product lines may experience modest seasonal variation in production there is no material effect on the demand for the majority of our products on a quarterly basis with the exception that our power generation segment normally experiences seasonal declines in the first quarter due to general declines in construction spending during this period and our distribution segment normally experiences seasonal declines in its first quarter business activity due to holiday periods in asia and australia

we have thousands of customers around the world and have developed longstanding business relationships with many of them paccar is our largest customer accounting for approximately 12 percent of our consolidated net sales in 2013 compared to approximately 13 percent in 2012 and 12 percent in 2011 we have longterm supply agreements with paccar for our heavyduty isx 15 liter and isx 119 liter engines and our isl 9 liter midrange engine while a significant number of our sales to paccar are under longterm supply agreements these agreements provide for particular engine requirements for specific vehicle models and not a specific volume of engines paccar is our only customer accounting for more than 10 percent of our net sales in 2013 the loss of this customer or a significant decline in the production level of paccar vehicles that use our engines would have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition we have been an engine supplier to paccar for over 69 years a summary of principal customers for each operating segment is included in our segment discussion   

in addition to our agreement with paccar we have longterm heavyduty engine supply agreements with navistar and volvo trucks north america and longterm midrange supply agreements with daimler trucks north america navistar man and ford we also have an agreement with chrysler to supply engines for its ram trucks in our offhighway markets we have various engine and component supply agreements ranging across our midrange and highhorsepower businesses with komatsu ltd as well as various joint ventures and other license agreements in our engine component and distribution segments   collectively our net sales to these eight customers including paccar was approximately 36 percent of our consolidated net sales in 2013  compared to approximately 35 percent in 2012 and 33 percent in 2011   excluding paccar net sales to any single customer were less than 7 percent of our consolidated net sales in 2013  compared to less than 8 percent in 2012 and less than 6 percent in 2011   these agreements contain standard purchase and sale agreement terms covering engine and engine parts pricing quality and delivery commitments as well as engineering product support obligations the basic nature of our agreements with oem customers is that they are longterm price and operations agreements that help assure the availability of our products to each customer through the duration of the respective agreements agreements with most oems contain bilateral termination provisions giving either party the right to terminate in the event of a material breach change of control or insolvency or bankruptcy of the other party   

backlog 

our 2013 lead times for the majority of our businesses improved from their 2012 levels while we have supply agreements with some truck and offhighway equipment oems most of our business is transacted through open purchase orders these open orders are historically subject to monthtomonth releases and are subject to cancellation on reasonable notice without cancellation charges and therefore are not considered firm as of december 31 2013 we did not have any significant backlogs 

research and development expense 

in 2013  we decreased our research development and engineering expenses slightly as we continued to invest in future critical technologies and products we will continue to make investments to improve our current technologies continue to meet the future emission requirements around the world and improve fuel economy 

our research and development program is focused on product improvements innovations and cost reductions for our customers research and development expenditures include salaries contractor fees building costs utilities administrative expenses and allocation of corporate costs and are expensed net of contract reimbursements when incurred from time to time we enter into agreements with customers to fund a portion of the research and development costs of a particular project we generally account for these reimbursements as an offset to the related research and development expenditure research and development expenses net of contract reimbursements were 700 million  in 2013   721 million  in 2012 and 621 million  in 2011   contract reimbursements were 76 million  in 2013   86 million  in 2012 and 75 million  in 2011   

for 2011 approximately 1 million or less than 1 percent of our research and development expenditures were directly related to compliance with 2010 environmental protection agency epa emission standards for 2013 2012 and 2011 approximately 15 million 101 million and 104 million or 2 percent 14 percent and 17 percent respectively of our research and development expenditures were directly related to compliance with 2013 epa emission standards for 2013 approximately 32 million or 5 percent of our research and development expenditures was directly related to compliance with 2017 epa emission standards 

environmental sustainability 

our 10 environmental sustainability principles attempt to positively impact the environment through the products that we make how we use our facilities and manage our supply chain and how we improve the communities where we live and work using these guiding principles and with the input of key stakeholder areas our corporate action committee for environmental sustainability in 2013 developed the companys first global environmental sustainability plan to more fully integrate environmental stewardship across all of our businesses and functions we continue to invest significantly in our products to further reduce emissions and increase efficiency we attempt to work collaboratively with customers to improve their fuel economy reduce their carbon footprints and conserve other resources over the past five years we believe that we have reduced companywide water usage intensity by approximately 47 percent uswide processderived hazardous waste generation by approximately 56 percent and companywide landfill waste by approximately 21 percent all normalized to total work hours as part of the us department of energys better buildings better plants program we have pledged to achieve a 25 percent energy intensity energy use adjusted for sales reduction by 2015 at the end of 2012 we had achieved a 34 percent reduction we also have articulated our positions on key public policy issues and on a wide range of environmental issues we are actively engaged with regulatory industry and other stakeholder groups around the world as greenhouse gas and fuel efficiency standards become more prevalent globally for the ninth consecutive year we were named to the dow jones world sustainability index which recognizes the top 10 percent of the world’s largest 2500 companies in economic environmental and social leadership our sustainability report for 20122013 and prior reports as well as an addendum of more detailed environmental data is available on our website at wwwcumminscom  although such report and addendum are not incorporated into this form 10k 

environmental compliance 

product environmental compliance 

our engines are subject to extensive statutory and regulatory requirements that directly or indirectly impose standards governing emission and noise we have substantially increased our global environmental compliance presence and expertise to better prepare for understand and ultimately meet emerging product environmental regulations around the world our products comply with all current emission standards that the european union eu epa the california air resources board carb and other state and international regulatory agencies have established for heavyduty onhighway diesel and gas engines and offhighway engines our ability to comply with these and future emission standards is an essential element in maintaining our leadership position in regulated markets we have made and will continue to make significant capital and research expenditures to comply with these standards our failure to comply with these standards could result in adverse effects on our future financial results 

eu and epa engine certifications 

the current onhighway emission standards came into effect in the eu on january 1 2013 euro vi and on january 1 2010 for the epa to meet the more stringent heavyduty onhighway emission standards we used an evolution of our proven selective catalytic reduction scr and exhaust gas recirculation egr technology solutions and refined them for the eu and epa certified engines to maintain power and torque with substantial fuel economy improvement and maintenance intervals comparable with our previous compliant engines we offer a complete lineup of onhighway engines to meet the nearzero emission standards midrange and heavyduty engines for eu and epa require nox aftertreatment nox reduction is achieved by an integrated technology solution comprised of the xpi high pressure common rail fuel system scr technology nextgeneration cooled egr advanced electronic controls proven air handling and the cummins diesel particulate filter dpf the eu epa and carb have certified that our engines meet the current emission requirements emission standards in international markets including japan mexico australia brazil russia india and china are becoming more stringent we believe that our experience in meeting the eu and epa emission standards leaves us well positioned to take advantage of opportunities in these markets as the need for emission control capability grows 

we have received certification from the epa that we have met both the epa 2013 and 2014 ghg regulations and rules the epa 2013 regulations add the requirement of onboard diagnostics which were introduced on the isx15 in 2010 across the full onhighway product line in 2013 in addition to maintaining the same nearzero emission levels of nox and particulate matter pm required in 2010 onboard diagnostics provide enhanced service capability with standardized diagnostic trouble codes service tool interface incab warning lamp and service information availability the new ghg and fuelefficiency regulations will be required for all heavyduty diesel and natural gas engines beginning in january 2014 our ghg certification is the first engine certificate issued by the epa and uses the same proven base engine with the xpi fuel system variable geometry turbocharger vgt tm  cummins aftertreatment system with dpf and scr technology 

other environmental statutes and regulations 

expenditures for environmental control activities and environmental remediation projects at our facilities in the us have not been a substantial portion of our annual capital outlays and are not expected to be material in 2013 we believe we are in compliance in all material respects with laws and regulations applicable to our plants and operations 

in the us pursuant to notices received from federal and state agencies andor defendant parties in site environmental contribution actions we have been identified as a potentially responsible party prp under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of 1980 as amended or similar state laws at less than 20   waste disposal sites based upon our experiences at similar sites we believe that our aggregate future remediation costs will not be significant   we have established accruals that we believe are adequate for our expected future liability with respect to these sites 

in addition we have several other sites where we are working with governmental authorities on remediation projects the costs for these remediation projects are not expected to be material 

employees 

as of december 31 2013 we employed approximately 47900 persons worldwide approximately 15650 of our employees worldwide are represented by various unions under collective bargaining agreements that expire between 2014 and 2016

 item 1a risk factors 

set forth below and elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k are some of the principal risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual business results to differ materially from any forwardlooking statements contained in this report and could individually or in combination have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows these risk factors should be considered in addition to our cautionary comments concerning forwardlooking statements in this report including statements related to markets for our products and trends in our business that involve a number of risks and uncertainties our separate section above cautionary statements regarding forwardlooking information should be considered in addition to the following statements 

a sustained slowdown or significant downturn in our markets could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial condition or cash flows   

global economic uncertainty continued throughout 2013 as we experienced declining or relatively flat demand in many global markets if the global economy or some of our significant markets encounter a sustained slowdown depending upon the length duration and severity of such a slowdown our results of operations financial condition and cash flow would almost certainly be materially adversely affected specifically our revenues would likely decrease we may be forced to consider further restructuring actions we may need to increase our allowance for doubtful accounts our days sales outstanding may increase and we could experience impairments to assets of certain of our businesses   

a slowdown in infrastructure development could adversely affect our business   

infrastructure development has been a significant driver of our business in recent years especially in the emerging markets of china and brazil general weakness in economic growth or the perception that infrastructure has been overbuilt could lead to a decline in infrastructure spending any sustained downturns in infrastructure development that result from these or other circumstances could adversely affect our business 

unpredictability in the adoption implementation and enforcement of increasingly stringent emission standards by multiple jurisdictions around the world could adversely affect our business   

our engines are subject to extensive statutory and regulatory requirements governing emission and noise including standards imposed by the epa the european union state regulatory agencies such as the carb and other regulatory agencies around the world we have made and will be required to continue to make significant capital and research expenditures to comply with these emission standards developing engines to meet numerous changing government regulatory requirements with different implementation timelines and emission requirements makes developing engines efficiently for multiple markets complicated and could result in substantial additional costs that may be difficult to recover in certain markets in some cases we may be required to develop new products to comply with new regulations particularly those relating to air emission while we have met previous deadlines our ability to comply with other existing and future regulatory standards will be essential for us to maintain our position in the engine markets we serve the successful development and introduction of new and enhanced products in order to comply with new regulatory requirements are subject to other risks such as delays in product development cost overruns and unanticipated technical and manufacturing difficulties in addition to these risks the nature and timing of government implementation and enforcement of increasingly stringent emission standards in emerging markets are unpredictable and subject to change or delays which could result in the products we developed or modified to comply with these standards becoming unnecessary or becoming necessary later than expected and in some cases negating our competitive advantage this in turn can delay diminish or eliminate the expected return on capital and research expenditures that we have invested in such products and may adversely affect our perceived competitive advantage in being an early advanced developer of compliant engines   

we derive significant income from investees that we do not directly control   

our net income includes significant equity royalty and interest income from investees that we do not directly control  for 2013 we recognized 361 million of equity royalty and interest income from investees compared to 384 million in 2012   the majority of our equity royalty and interest income from investees is from our   nine  unconsolidated north american distributors and from two of our joint ventures in china dongfeng cummins engine company ltd dcec and chongqing cummins engine company ltd ccec our equity ownership interests in our unconsolidated north american distributors ranged from 50 percent to 50 percent at december 31 361 we have percent equity ownership interests in dcec and ccec    as a result although a significant percentage of our net income is derived from these unconsolidated entities we do not unilaterally control their management or their operations which puts a substantial portion of our net income at risk from the actions or inactions of these entities a significant reduction in the level of contribution by these entities to our net income would likely have a material adverse effect on our results of operations   

our truck manufacturers and original equipment manufacturers oems customers may not continue to outsource their engine supply needs   

several of our engine customers including paccar volvo ab navistar chrysler and dcec are truck manufacturers or oems that manufacture engines for some of their own products despite their own engine manufacturing abilities these customers have historically chosen to outsource certain types of engine production to us due to the quality of our engine products our emission capabilities our systems integration their customers preferences their desire for cost reductions their desire for eliminating production risks and their desire to maintain company focus however there can be no assurance that these customers will continue to outsource or outsource as much of their engine production in the future increased levels of oem vertical integration could result from a number of factors such as shifts in our customers business strategies acquisition by a customer of another engine manufacturer the inability of thirdparty suppliers to meet product specifications and the emergence of lowcost production opportunities in foreign countries any significant reduction in the level of engine production outsourcing from our truck manufacturer or oem customers could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations   

a downturn in the north american truck industry or other factors negatively affecting any of our truck oem customers could materially adversely impact our results of operations   

we make significant sales of engines and components to a few large truck oems in north america if the north american truck market suffers a significant downturn or if one of our large truck oem customers experienced financial distress or bankruptcy such circumstance would likely lead to significant reductions in our revenues and earnings commercial disputes receivable collection issues and other negative consequences that could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations   

the discovery of any significant problems with our recentlyintroduced engine platforms in north america could materially adversely impact our results of operations financial condition and cash flow   

the epa and carb have certified all of our 20122013 onhighway and offhighway engines which utilize scr technology to meet requisite emission levels we introduced scr technology into our engine platforms in 2010 the effective performance of scr technology and the overall performance of these engine platforms impact a number of our operating segments and remain crucial to our success in north america while these 2010 and 2013 engine platforms have performed well in the field the discovery of any significant problems in these platforms could result in recall campaigns increased warranty costs reputational risk and brand risk and could materially adversely impact our results of operations financial condition and cash flow   

we are vulnerable to supply shortages from singlesourced suppliers   

during 2013 we single sourced approximately 60 to 70 percent of the total types of parts in our product designs any delay in our suppliers deliveries may adversely affect our operations at multiple manufacturing locations forcing us to seek alternative supply sources to avoid serious disruptions delays may be caused by factors affecting our suppliers including capacity constraints labor disputes economic downturns availability of credit the impaired financial condition of a particular supplier suppliers allocations to other purchasers weather emergencies natural disasters or acts of war or terrorism any extended delay in receiving critical supplies could impair our ability to deliver products to our customers and our results of operations   

our products are exposed to variability in material and commodity costs   

our businesses establish prices with our customers in accordance with contractual time frames however the timing of material and commodity market price increases may prevent us from passing these additional costs on to our customers through timely pricing actions additionally higher material and commodity costs around the world may offset our efforts to reduce our cost structure while we customarily enter into financial transactions and contractual pricing adjustment provisions with our customers that attempt to address some of these risks notably with respect to copper platinum and palladium there can be no assurance that commodity price fluctuations will not adversely affect our results of operations in addition while the use of commodity price hedging instruments may provide us with some protection from adverse fluctuations in commodity prices by utilizing these instruments we potentially forego the benefits that might result from favorable fluctuations in price as a result higher material and commodity costs as well as hedging these commodity costs during periods of decreasing prices could result in declining margins   

our products are subject to recall for performance or safetyrelated issues   

our products may be subject to recall for performance or safetyrelated issues product recalls subject us to harm to our reputation loss of current and future customers reduced revenue and product recall costs product recall costs are incurred when we decide either voluntarily or involuntarily to recall a product through a formal campaign to solicit the return of specific products due to a known or suspected performance issue any significant product recalls could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows   

failure to successfully integrate the planned acquisitions of the equity we do not already own of our partiallyowned united states and canadian distributors could have an adverse impact on our realization of expected benefits to our financial condition and results of operations   

the completion of our plan to acquire all of the equity we do not already own of our partially owned united states and canadian distributors each an acquisition and collectively the acquisitions is subject to various risks including among other things our ability to realize the full extent of the incremental revenue earnings cash flow cost savings and other benefits that we expect to realize as a result of the completion of the acquisitions within the anticipated time frame or at all the costs that are expected to be incurred in connection with evaluating negotiating consummating and integrating the acquisitions the ability of management to focus adequate time and attention on evaluating negotiating consummating and integrating the acquisitions and diversion of managements attention from base strategies and objectives both during and after the acquisition process further as with all merger and acquisition activity there can be no assurance that we will be able to negotiate consummate and integrate the acquisitions in accordance with our plans those persons holding the thirdparty ownership of our partiallyowned united states and canadian distributors may not agree to our acquisition proposals including the terms and conditions thereof and may claim that our proposals to exercise certain contractual rights that we have with respect to acquiring such distributors may violate applicable state franchise and distributor laws which may prohibit delay or otherwise adversely affect the consummation of such acquisitions on terms and conditions that are less favorable to us than we currently anticipate or not at all   

after completion of the acquisitions we may fail to realize the expected enhanced revenue earnings cash flow cost savings and other benefits   

the financial success of the acquisitions will depend in substantial part on our ability to successfully combine our business with the businesses of our partiallyowned united states and canadian distributors transition operations and realize the expected enhanced revenue earnings cash flow cost savings and other benefits from such acquisitions while we currently believe that these enhanced revenue earnings cash flow cost savings and other benefits estimates are achievable it is possible that we will be unable to achieve these objectives within the anticipated time frame or at all our enhanced revenue earnings cash flow cost savings and other benefits estimates also depend on our ability to execute and integrate the acquisitions in a manner that permits those benefits to be realized if these estimates turn out to be incorrect or we are not able to execute our integration strategy successfully the anticipated enhanced revenue earnings cash flow cost savings and other benefits resulting from the acquisitions may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected   

specifically issues that must be addressed in integration in order to realize the anticipated benefits and costs savings of the acquisitions include among other things   

 19 

 delays encountered in the process of integrating the acquisitions could negatively impact our revenues expenses operating results cash flow and financial condition after completion of the acquisitions including through the loss of current customers or suppliers although significant benefits such as enhanced revenue earnings cash flow and cost savings are expected to result from the acquisitions there can be no assurance that we will realize any of these anticipated benefits after completion of any or all of the acquisitions   

additionally significant costs are expected to be incurred in connection with the integration of the acquisitions we continue to assess the magnitude of these costs and additional unanticipated costs may be incurred including costs associated with assuming our partiallyowned united states and canadian distributors exposure to outstanding and anticipated legal claims and other liabilities although we believe that the elimination of duplicative costs as well as the realization of other synergies and efficiencies related to the integration of the acquisitions will offset incremental integrationrelated costs over time no assurances can be given that this net benefit will be achieved in the near term or at all in addition the process of integrating the operations of our partially owned united states and canadian distributors may distract management and employees from delivering against base strategies and objectives which could negatively impact other segments of our business following the completion of the acquisitions   

furthermore the acquisitions and the related integration efforts could result in the departure of key managers and employees and we may fail to identify managerial resources to fill both executivelevel and lowerlevel managerial positions and replace key employees including those who oversee customer relationships any of which could have a negative impact on our business and prior to the completion of the acquisitions the businesses of our partiallyowned united states and canadian distributors   

the completion of the acquisitions may be subject to the receipt of certain required clearances or approvals from governmental entities that could prevent or delay their completion or impose conditions that could have an adverse effect on us   

completion of each of the acquisitions may be conditioned upon the receipt of certain governmental clearances or approvals including but not limited to the expiration or termination of any applicable waiting periods under us competition and trade laws with respect to such acquisitions as well as applicable state regulations and restrictions there can be no assurance that these clearances and approvals will be obtained and additionally government authorities from which these clearances and approvals are required may impose conditions on the completion of any or all of the acquisitions or require changes to their respective terms if in order to obtain any clearances or approvals required to complete any of the acquisitions we become subject to any material conditions after completion of any of such acquisitions our business and results of operations after completion of any of such acquisitions may be adversely affected   

we face significant competition in the markets we serve   

the markets in which we operate are highly competitive we compete worldwide with a number of other manufacturers and distributors that produce and sell similar products we primarily compete in the market with diesel engines and related diesel products however new technologies continue to be developed for gasoline natural gas and other technologies and we will continue to face new competition from these expanding technologies our products primarily compete on the basis of price performance fuel economy speed of delivery quality and customer support we also face competitors in some emerging markets who have established local practices and long standing relationships with participants in these markets there can be no assurance that our products will be able to compete successfully with the products of other companies and in other markets for a more complete discussion of the competitive environment in which each of our segments operates see “operating segments” in “item 1 business”   

increasing global competition among our customers may affect our existing customer relationships and restrict our ability to benefit from some of our customers growth   

as our customers in emerging markets continue to grow in size and scope they are increasingly seeking to export their products to other countries this has meant greater demand for our advanced engine technologies to help these customers meet the more stringent emissions requirements of developed markets as well as greater demand for access to our distribution systems for purposes of equipment servicing as these emerging market customers enter into and begin to compete in more developed markets they may increasingly begin to compete with our existing customers in these markets our further aid to emerging market customers could adversely affect our relationships with developed market customers and as a result we may be pressured to restrict sale or support of some of our products in the areas of increased competition in addition to the extent the competition does not correspond to overall growth in demand we may see little or no benefit from this type of expansion by our emerging market customers   

we are exposed to and may be adversely affected by information technology security threats and sophisticated cyber attacks   

we rely on our information technology systems and networks in connection with various of our business activities some of these networks and systems are managed by third party service providers and are not under our direct control our operations routinely involve receiving storing processing and transmitting sensitive information pertaining to our business customers dealers suppliers employees and other sensitive matters information technology security threats including security breaches computer malware and other “cyber attacks” are increasing in both frequency and sophistication these threats could create financial liability subject us to legal or regulatory sanctions or damage our reputation with customers dealers suppliers and other stakeholders we continuously seek to maintain a robust program of information security and controls but the impact of a material information technology event could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position reputation results of operations financial condition and cash flow 

we are exposed to political economic and other risks that arise from operating a multinational business   

approximately 52 percent of our net sales for 2013 and 53 percent in 2012 were attributable to customers outside the us     accordingly our business is subject to the political economic and other risks that are inherent in operating in numerous countries these risks include   

 as we continue to operate our business globally our success will depend in part on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these and other related risks there can be no assurance that the consequences of these and other factors relating to our multinational operations will not have a material adverse effect upon us   

unanticipated changes in our effective tax rate the adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could adversely affect our profitability   

we are subject to income taxes in the us and numerous international jurisdictions our income tax provision and cash tax liability in the future could be adversely affected by changes in the distribution of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities changes to our assertions regarding permanent reinvestment of our foreign earnings changes in tax laws and the discovery of new information in the course of our tax return preparation process the carrying value of deferred tax assets which are predominantly in the us is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income in the us we are also subject to ongoing tax audits these audits can involve complex issues which may require an extended period of time to resolve and can be highly judgmental tax authorities may disagree with certain tax reporting positions taken by us and as a result assess additional taxes against us we regularly assess the likely outcomes of these audits in order to determine the appropriateness of our tax provision the amounts ultimately paid upon resolution of these or subsequent tax audits could be materially different from the amounts previously included in our income tax provision and therefore could have a material impact on our tax provision   

our global operations are subject to laws and regulations that impose significant compliance costs and create reputational and legal risk   

due to the international scope of our operations we are subject to a complex system of commercial and trade regulations around the world recent years have seen an increase in the development and enforcement of laws regarding trade compliance and anticorruption such as the us foreign corrupt practices act and similar laws from other countries our numerous foreign subsidiaries affiliates and joint venture partners are governed by laws rules and business practices that differ from those of the us the activities of these entities may not comply with us laws or business practices or our code of business conduct violations of these laws may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions could disrupt our business and result in an adverse effect on our reputation business and results of operations or financial condition we cannot predict the nature scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our operations might be subject or the manner in which existing laws might be administered or interpreted   

we face the challenge of accurately aligning our capacity with our demand   

we can experience capacity constraints and longer lead times for certain products in times of growing demand while we can also experience idle capacity as economies slow or demand for certain products decline accurately forecasting our expected volumes and appropriately adjusting our capacity have been and will continue to be important factors in determining our results of operations we cannot guarantee that we will be able to increase manufacturing capacity to a level that meets demand for our products which could prevent us from meeting increased customer demand and could harm our business however if we overestimate our demand and overbuild our capacity we may have significantly underutilized assets and we may experience reduced margins if we do not accurately align our manufacturing capabilities with demand it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations   

our business is exposed to risks of product liability claims   

we face an inherent business risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that our products failure to perform to specification results or is alleged to result in property damage bodily injury andor death we may experience material product liability losses in the future while we maintain insurance coverage with respect to certain product liability claims we may not be able to obtain such insurance on acceptable terms in the future if at all and any such insurance may not provide adequate coverage against product liability claims in addition product liability claims can be expensive to defend and can divert the attention of management and other personnel for significant periods of time regardless of the ultimate outcome an unsuccessful defense of a significant product liability claim could have a material adverse effect upon us in addition even if we are successful in defending against a claim relating to our products claims of this nature could cause our customers to lose confidence in our products and us   

we may need to write off significant investments in our new north american lightduty diesel engine platform if customer commitments deteriorate   

we began development of a new north american lightduty diesel engine platform in july 2006 to be used in a variety of on and offhighway applications since that time and as of december 31 2013 we have capitalized investments of approximately 242 million market uncertainty due to the global recession resulted in some customers delaying or cancelling their vehicle programs while others remained active in august 2013 we reached an agreement to supply nissan motor co ltd with our lightduty diesel engine beginning in 2015 however if customer expectations or volume projections deteriorate from our current expected levels and we do not identify new customers we may need to recognize an impairment charge and write the assets down to net realizable value   

our operations are subject to increasingly stringent environmental laws and regulations   

our plants and operations are subject to increasingly stringent environmental laws and regulations in all of the countries in which we operate including laws and regulations governing air emission discharges to water and the generation handling storage transportation treatment and disposal of waste materials while we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with these environmental laws and regulations there can be no assurance that we will not be adversely impacted by costs liabilities or claims with respect to existing or subsequently acquired operations under either present laws and regulations or those that may be adopted or imposed in the future we are also subject to laws requiring the cleanup of contaminated property if a release of hazardous substances occurs at or from any of our current or former properties or at a landfill or another location where we have disposed of hazardous materials we may be held liable for the contamination and the amount of such liability could be material   

we are subject to foreign currency exchange rate and other related risks   

we conduct operations in many areas of the world involving transactions denominated in a variety of currencies we are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk to the extent that our costs are denominated in currencies other than those in which we earn revenues in addition since our financial statements are denominated in us dollars changes in foreign currency exchange rates between the us dollar and other currencies have had and will continue to have an impact on our results of operations while we customarily enter into financial transactions that attempt to address these risks and many of our supply agreements with customers include foreign currency exchange rate adjustment provisions there can be no assurance that foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations will not adversely affect our results of operations in addition while the use of currency hedging instruments may provide us with some protection from adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates by utilizing these instruments we potentially forego the benefits that might result from favorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates we also face risks arising from the imposition of foreign exchange controls and currency devaluations foreign exchange controls may limit our ability to convert foreign currencies into us dollars or to remit dividends and other payments by our foreign subsidiaries or businesses located in or conducted within a country imposing controls currency devaluations result in a diminished value of funds denominated in the currency of the country instituting the devaluation 

we are exposed to risks arising from the price and availability of energy   

the level of demand for our products and services is influenced in multiple ways by the price and availability of energy high energy costs generally drive greater demand for better fuel economy in almost all countries in which we operate some of our engine products have been developed with a primary purpose of offering fuel economy improvements and if energy costs decrease or increase less than expected demand for these products may likewise decrease the relative unavailability of electricity in some emerging market countries also influences demand for our electricity generating products such as our diesel generators if these countries add energy capacity by expanding their power grids at a rate equal to or faster than the growth in demand for energy the demand for our generating products could also decrease or increase less than would otherwise be the case 

significant declines in future financial and stock market conditions could diminish our pension plan asset performance and adversely impact our results of operations financial condition and cash flow   

we sponsor both funded and unfunded domestic and foreign defined benefit pension and other retirement plans our pension cost and the required contributions to our pension plans are directly affected by the value of plan assets the projected and actual rates of return on plan assets and the actuarial assumptions we use to measure our defined benefit pension plan obligations including the discount rate at which future projected and accumulated pension obligations are discounted to a present value we could experience increased pension cost due to a combination of factors including the decreased investment performance of pension plan assets decreases in the discount rate and changes in our assumptions relating to the expected return on plan assets significant declines in future financial and stock market conditions could cause material losses in our pension plan assets which could result in increased pension cost in future years and adversely impact our results of operations financial condition and cash flow depending upon the severity of market declines and government regulatory changes we may be legally obligated to make pension payments in the us and perhaps other countries and these contributions could be material   

we may be adversely impacted by work stoppages and other labor matters   

as of december 31 2013 we employed approximately 47900 persons worldwide approximately 15650 of our employees worldwide are represented by various unions under collective bargaining agreements that expire between 2014 and 2016   while we have no reason to believe that we will be materially impacted by work stoppages or other labor matters there can be no assurance that future issues with our labor unions will be resolved favorably or that we will not encounter future strikes work stoppages or other types of conflicts with labor unions or our employees any of these consequences may have an adverse effect on us or may limit our flexibility in dealing with our workforce in addition many of our customers and suppliers have unionized work forces work stoppages or slowdowns experienced by our customers or suppliers could result in slowdowns or closures that would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flow   

our financial statements are subject to changes in accounting standards that could adversely impact our profitability or financial position   

our financial statements are subject to the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap which are periodically revised andor expanded accordingly from time to time we are required to adopt new or revised accounting standards issued by recognized authoritative bodies including the financial accounting standards board recently accounting standard setters issued new guidance which further interprets or seeks to revise accounting pronouncements related to revenue recognition and lease accounting as well as to issue new standards expanding disclosures the impact of accounting pronouncements that have been issued but not yet implemented is disclosed in our annual and quarterly reports on form 10k and form 10q an assessment of proposed standards is not provided as such proposals are subject to change through the exposure process and therefore their effects on our financial statements cannot be meaningfully assessed it is possible that future accounting standards we are required to adopt could change the current accounting treatment that we apply to our consolidated financial statements and that such changes could have a material adverse effect on the reported results of operations and financial position

 item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

organization of information 

the following managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations mda was prepared to provide the reader with a view and perspective of our business through the eyes of management and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements  and the accompanying notes to those financial statements our mda is presented in the following sections 

 

executive summary and financial highlights 

we are a global power leader that designs manufactures distributes and services diesel and natural gas engines and enginerelated component products including filtration aftertreatment turbochargers fuel systems controls systems air handling systems and electric power generation systems we sell our products to original equipment manufacturers oems distributors and other customers worldwide    we have longstanding relationships with many of the leading manufacturers in the markets we serve including paccar inc daimler trucks north america chrysler group llc chrysler volvo ab komatsu navistar international corporation aggreko plc ford motor company and man nutzfahrzeuge ag    we serve our customers through a network of over   600  companyowned and independent distributor locations and over   6800   dealer locations in more than 190  countries and territories   

our reportable operating segments consist of the following engine components power generation and distribution this reporting structure is organized according to the products and markets each segment serves  and allows management to focus its efforts on providing enhanced service to a wide range of customers the engine segment produces engines and parts for sale to customers in onhighway and various industrial markets our engines are used in trucks of all sizes buses and recreational vehicles as well as in various industrial applications including construction mining agriculture marine oil and gas rail and military equipment the components segment sells filtration products aftertreatment systems turbochargers and fuel systems the power generation segment is an integrated provider of power systems which sells engines generator sets and alternators the distribution segment includes whollyowned and partiallyowned distributorships engaged in wholesaling engines generator sets and service parts as well as performing service and repair activities on our products and maintaining relationships with various oems throughout the world   

our financial performance depends in large part on varying conditions in the markets we serve particularly the onhighway construction and general industrial markets demand in these markets tends to fluctuate in response to overall economic conditions our sales may also be impacted by oem inventory levels and production schedules and stoppages economic downturns in markets we serve generally result in reductions in sales and pricing of our products as a worldwide business our operations are also affected by currency political economic and regulatory matters including adoption and enforcement of environmental and emission standards in the countries we serve as part of our growth strategy we invest in businesses in certain countries that carry high levels of these risks such as china brazil india mexico russia and countries in the middle east and africa at the same time our geographic diversity and broad product and service offerings have helped limit the impact from a drop in demand in any one industry or customer or the economy of any single country on our consolidated results   

worldwide revenues in 2013  were down slightly compared to 2012  as global economic uncertainty continued during the period international revenues declined  by 4 percent  with sales down or relatively flat in most international markets primarily due to declines in the offhighway mining market with reduced unit shipments of 37 percent reduced demand in the international power generation markets and unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations these declines were partially offset by an increase in components segment sales reflecting a full year of sales from hilite germany gmbh hilite which was acquired in the third quarter of 2012 and growth in the construction and mediumduty brazilian truck markets resulting in higher engine and component demand revenue in the us and canada improved  by 3 percent  which reflected the consolidation of three partiallyowned north american distributors since june 2012 and improved demand within the components segment emission solutions business from onhighway oem and aftermarket products and mediumduty truck customers revenues also increased in the power generation segment power products business as the result of increased demand in north america these increases were mostly offset by reduced demand in the onhighway heavyduty truck and mediumduty bus markets as well as the offhighway mining and oil and gas markets to which unit shipments declined 15 percent 25 percent 30 percent and 37 percent respectively compared to last year 

slow growth in the us economy continued to suppress business capital expenditures in 2013 thus impacting demand for truck and power generation equipment the governments of china and india have tried to control inflation through tight monetary policies in the form of rising interest rates and tightening access to credit brazil began to tighten its monetary policies in the second half of 2013 tightening monetary policies could create headwinds in our end markets the european economy remains stagnant and uncertain however demand for engines and components in euro zone countries stabilized somewhat during 2013 although we do not have any significant direct exposure to european sovereign debt we generated approximately 8 percent  of our net sales from euro zone countries in both 2013  and 2012

2014  outlook 

nearterm 

the global economy continued to experience uncertainty throughout 2013  negatively impacting many international and some north american markets these impacts were partially offset by improvements in north america primarily due to distribution segment sales related to the consolidation of three partiallyowned north american distributors since june 2012 and improved demand within the components segment emission solutions business for onhighway oem and aftermarket products economies in emerging markets including china and india slowed during 2013 which negatively impacted a number of our end markets especially the offhighway mining market and the power generation markets 

we currently expect the following positive trends in 2014  

 we currently expect the following challenges to our business that may reduce our revenue and earnings potential in 2014

 longterm 

we believe that over the longer term there will be economic improvements in most of our current markets and that our opportunities for longterm profitable growth will continue in the future as the result of the following four macroeconomic trends that will benefit our businesses

gross margin 

gross margin decreased  by 125 million  and as a percentage of sales decrease d by 07 percentage points  the decrease  in gross margin as a percentage of sales was primarily due to a decline in demand for highhorsepower engines and gensets partially offset by improved price realization lower material and commodity costs and the absence of 2012 restructuring charges of 29 million 

the provision for warranties issued excluding campaigns as a percentage of sales was 21 percent  in both 2013  and 2012  a more detailed discussion of margin by segment is presented in the operating segment results section 

selling general and administrative expenses 

selling general and administrative expenses increased  primarily due to incremental costs in 2013 related to the acquisition of partially owned north american distributors since june 2012 these costs primarily contributed to increased compensation and related expenses of 52 million and increased variable compensation of 5 million partially offset by lower consulting of 24 million the absence of 2012 restructuring charges of 20 million and reduced discretionary spending higher compensation expense was primarily due to increased headcount to support our strategic growth initiatives compensation and related expenses include salaries and fringe benefits overall selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales increased  to 111 percent  in 2013  from 110 percent  in 2012  

research development and engineering expenses

equity royalty and interest income from investees 

equity royalty and interest income from investees decrease d primarily due to the following 



the decrease s above were primarily due to the consolidation of the partiallyowned north american distributors acquired in 2013 unfavorable warranty accruals at cummins westport inc an impairment charge of an equity investment within the power generation segment and additional startup costs at beijing foton cummins engine co ltd heavyduty partially offset by increased demand at beijing foton cummins engine co ltd lightduty and dongfeng cummins engine company ltd 

as we execute our plan to acquire partiallyowned distributors over the next three to five years equity earnings for our north american distributors will continue to decrease see note 2  “ acquisitions and divestitures ” to the consolidated financial statements  for further information 

gain on sale of businesses 

in the second quarter of 2012 we recorded an additional 6 million gain 4 million aftertax related to final purchase price adjustments for our 2011 divestitures the gain was excluded from segment results as it was not considered in our evaluation of operating results for the year ended december 31 2012 

other operating income expense net 

other operating income expense net was as follows 



interest income 

interest income was relatively flat compared to 2012  

interest expense 

interest expense increased  primarily due to the 1 billion debt issuance in september 2013 interest expense will increase in future periods as a result of this issuance 

other income expense net 

other income expense net was as follows 



 

 

income tax expense 

our income tax rates are generally less than the 35 percent us statutory income tax rate primarily because of lower taxes on foreign earnings and research tax credits our effective tax rate for 2013 was 251 percent  compared to 235 percent  for 2012  as a result of a restructuring of our foreign operations in 2013 our 2013 effective tax rate was approximately 1  less than it would have been without restructuring on january 2 2013 the american taxpayer relief act of 2012 was signed into law and reinstated the research tax credit back to 2012 as tax law changes are accounted for in the period of enactment we recognized a 28 million  discrete tax benefit in the first quarter of 2013 we also recognized a discrete tax expense of 17 million  in the first quarter which primarily related to the writeoff of a deferred tax asset deemed unrecoverable also included in 2013 is a third quarter discrete net tax expense of 7 million primarily related to us federal tax return trueup adjustments and third quarter enactment of uk tax law changes additionally our effective tax rate for 2013 also included a fourth quarter discrete net tax benefit of 21 million  primarily due to the release of us deferred tax liabilities related to prior years unremitted income of certain indian and mexican subsidiaries now considered to be permanently reinvested as well as adjustments to our income tax accounts principally based on our 2012 state tax return filings our 2012 income tax provision included a onetime 134 million  tax benefit which resulted from tax planning strateges and tax return elections made with respect to our uk operations 

we evaluate the recoverability of our deferred tax assets each quarter by assessing the likelihood of future profitability and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize our net deferred tax assets at december 31 2013 we recorded net deferred tax assets of 177 million  these assets included 187 million  for the value of tax loss and credit carryforwards a valuation allowance of 101 million  was recorded to reduce the tax assets to the net value management believed was more likely than not to be realized in the event our operating performance deteriorates future assessments could conclude that a larger valuation allowance will be needed to further reduce the deferred tax assets 

we expect our 2014 effective tax rate to be 285 percent  excluding any discrete items that may arise the research tax credit expired december 31 2013 and has not yet been renewed by congress if the research credit is reinstated during 2014 we would anticipate the 2014 effective tax rate to be reduced to 27 percent the increase in the effective tax rate from 2013 to 2014 is attributable primarily to onetime tax benefits in 2013 that will not repeat in 2014 as well as other changes in tax legislation in the us and proposed changes in the uk that will unfavorably impact our 2014 effective tax rate 

  

in september 2013 the internal revenue service released final tangible personal property regulations regarding the deduction and capitalization of expenditures related to tangible property the new rules will become effective for taxable years beginning on or after january 1 2014 while we are still finalizing our analysis we do not believe that these regulations will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements

noncontrolling interests eliminate the income or loss attributable to noncummins ownership interests in our consolidated entities noncontrolling interests in income of consolidated subsidiaries increase d reflecting our minoritys share of higher profits of 7 million at cummins western canada lp 6 million at wuxi cummins turbo technologies co ltd and 4 million due to the acquisition of a majority interest in cummins central power llc central power in the third quarter of 2012 the increase s were partially offset by a total decrease of 8 million at cummins india ltd 

net income attributable to cummins inc and diluted earnings per share attributable to cummins inc 

net income and diluted earnings per share attributable to cummins inc decrease d primarily due to lower gross margin as a percentage of sales mainly driven by unfavorable product mix and lower volumes particularly in the engine segment and power generation segment a higher effective tax rate of 251 percent  versus 235 percent  in 2012  lower equity royalty and interest income from investees mainly due to the acquisition of the north american distributors and higher selling general and administrative expenses these decrease s were partially offset by lower research development and engineering expenses diluted earnings per share for 2013 benefited 006 from lower shares outstanding primarily due to purchases under the stock repurchase program 

2012 vs 2011   

net sales 

net sales decreased versus 2011 and was primarily driven by the following 

 the decreases above were partially offset as distribution segment sales excluding acquisitions increased by 2 percent due to higher demand for parts and filtration products especially in north and central america increased power generation growth in east asia increased demand in the south pacific and higher service demand from south pacific mining customers which were partially offset by lower engine product sales due to a slowdown in the north american oil and gas markets 

a more detailed discussion of sales by segment is presented in the operating segment results section

noncontrolling interests in income of consolidated subsidiaries decreased primarily due to a decline of 5 million at wuxi cummins turbo technologies co ltd 3 million at cummins western canada lp and 3 million at power systems india the decreases were partially offset by an increase of 6 million at cummins power solutions ltd and 2 million at cummins central power llc 

net income attributable to cummins inc and diluted earnings per share attributable to cummins inc 

net income and diluted earnings per share attributable to cummins inc decreased primarily due to lower volumes particularly in the international construction and mediumduty truck markets higher research development and engineering expenses higher selling general and administrative expenses and lower equity royalty and interest income from investees these decreases were partially offset by improved gross margin as a percentage of sales and a lower effective tax rate of 235 percent versus 271 percent in 2011 in addition the significant gains we recorded in 2011 for the disposition of certain asset and liabilities of our exhaust business and lightduty filtration business and flood damage recoveries from the insurance settlement regarding a june 2008 flood in southern indiana did not repeat in 2012 diluted earnings per share for 2012 also benefited 006 from lower shares primarily due to the stock repurchase program 

restructuring and other charges 

we executed restructuring actions primarily in the form of involuntary separation programs in the fourth quarter of 2012 these actions were in response to reduced demand in our us businesses and most key markets around the world in the second half of 2012 as well as a reduction in orders in most us and global markets for 2013 we reduced our worldwide professional workforce by approximately 650   employees or 3 percent  we also reduced our hourly workforce by approximately 650   employees during 2012 we incurred a pretax charge related to the professional and hourly workforce reductions of approximately 49 million  

employee termination and severance costs were recorded based on approved plans developed by the businesses and corporate management which specified positions to be eliminated benefits to be paid under existing severance plans or statutory requirements and the expected timetable for completion of the plan estimates of restructuring were made based on information available at the time charges were recorded 

we incurred a 1 million  charge for lease terminations and a 2 million  charge for asset impairments and other noncash charges during 2012 we recorded restructuring and other charges of 52 million   35 million  aftertax these restructuring actions included

reconciliation of segment ebit to income before income taxes 

the table below reconciles the segment information to the corresponding amounts in the consolidated statements of income 



 

 

liquidity and capital resources 

managements assessment of liquidity 

our financial condition and liquidity remain strong our solid balance sheet and credit ratings enable us to have ready access to credit and the capital markets 

as a wellknown seasoned issuer we filed an automatic shelf registration for an undetermined amount of debt and equity securities with the securities and exchange commission on september 16 2013 under this shelf registration we may offer from time to time debt securities common stock preferred and preference stock depositary shares warrants stock purchase contracts and stock purchase units   

in september 2013 we issued 1 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes consisting of 500 million aggregate principal amount of 365 senior unsecured notes due in 2023 and 500 million aggregate principal amount of 4875 senior unsecured notes due in 2043    we received net proceeds of   979 million  the senior notes pay interest semiannually on april 1 and october 1 commencing on april 1 2014 the indenture governing the senior notes contains covenants that among other matters limit i our ability to consolidate or merge into or sell assign convey lease transfer or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our and our subsidiaries assets to another person ii our and certain of our subsidiaries ability to create or assume liens and iii our and certain of our subsidiaries ability to engage in sale and leaseback transactions   we currently anticipate using a portion of the net proceeds from the sale of the notes for the planned acquisitions of the equity that we do not already own in our partiallyowned united states and canadian distributors as well as for general corporate purposes   we plan to spend approximately 400 million to 500 million on distributor acquisitions and refinancings in 2014 

we assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate adequate cash to fund our operating investing and financing activities we generate significant ongoing cash flow which has been used in part to fund capital expenditures pay dividends on our common stock fund repurchases of common stock and make acquisitions cash provided by operations is our principal source of liquidity as of december 31 2013  other sources of liquidity included 

 we believe our liquidity provides us with the financial flexibility needed to fund working capital capital expenditures projected pension obligations dividend payments common stock repurchases acquisitions and debt service obligations we continue to generate cash from operations in the us and maintain access to 17 billion  of our revolver as noted above 

our revolving credit agreement provides us with a 175 billion  unsecured revolving credit facility the proceeds of which are to be used for our general corporate purposes see note 10   debt  to our consolidated financial statements  for further information the credit agreement includes one financial covenant a leverage ratio the required leverage ratio which measures the sum of total debt plus securitization financing to consolidated earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda for the four fiscal quarters may not exceed 325 to 10 at december 31 2013  our leverage ratio was 070 to 10 

a significant portion of our cash flows is generated outside the us as of december 31 2013  the total of cash cash equivalents and marketable securities held by foreign subsidiaries was 14 billion  the vast majority of which was located in the uk china singapore and india the geographic location of our cash and marketable securities aligns well with our business growth strategy we manage our worldwide cash requirements considering available funds among the many subsidiaries through which we conduct our business and the cost effectiveness with which those funds can be accessed as a result we do not anticipate any local liquidity restrictions to preclude us from funding our targeted expansion or operating needs with local resources   

if we distribute our foreign cash balances to the us or to other foreign subsidiaries we could be required to accrue and pay us taxes for example we would be required to accrue and pay additional us taxes if we repatriated cash from certain foreign subsidiaries whose earnings we have asserted are permanently reinvested outside of the us foreign earnings for which we assert permanent reinvestment outside the us consist primarily of earnings of our china and uk domiciled subsidiaries at present we do not foresee a need to repatriate any earnings from these subsidiaries for which we have asserted 

permanent reinvestment however to help fund cash needs of the us or other international subsidiaries as they arise we repatriate available cash from certain foreign subsidiaries whose earnings are not permanently reinvested when it is cost effective to do so earnings generated after 2011 from our china operations are considered permanently reinvested while earnings generated prior to 2012 for which us deferred tax liabilities have been recorded are expected to be repatriated in future years  

the maturity schedule of our existing longterm debt does not require significant cash outflows in the intermediate term   required annual principal payments range from 8 million  to 82 million  over each of the next five years 

working capital summary 

we fund our working capital with cash from operations and shortterm borrowings when necessary various assets and liabilities including shortterm debt can fluctuate significantly from month to month depending on shortterm liquidity needs as a result working capital is a prime focus of management attention 



current assets increase d 21 percent  compared to 2012  primarily due to increases in cash and cash equivalents as a result of the 1 billion debt issuance in september 2013 accounts and notes receivable and inventories partially offset by a decline in marketable securities and a decline in other current assets primarily related to refundable income taxes received in the first quarter of 2013 

current liabilities increase d 7 percent  compared to 2012  primarily due to an increase in accounts payable trade and an increase in other accrued expenses partially offset by a decrease in taxes payable 

inventory turnover decrease d 03 turns  compared to 2012  the decrease  was primarily due to inventory acquired as part of the acquisitions of rocky mountain and northwest in 2013 

cash flows 

cash and cash equivalents increase d 1330 million  during the year ended december 31 2013  compared to a decrease  of 115 million  during the comparable period in 2012  the change in cash and cash equivalents was as follows 

operating activities 



2013  vs 2012 

net cash provided by operating activities increase d versus 2012  primarily due to favorable working capital fluctuations partially offset by lower consolidated net income and lower dividends received from equity investees during 2013  the net increase in working capital resulted in a cash outflow  of 65 million  compared to a cash outflow  of 775 million  in 2012  this change of 710 million  was primarily driven by an increase in accounts payable due to timing differences lower net tax payments of 311 million due to the receipt of income tax refunds in 2013 which were partially offset by tax payments and a smaller decrease in accrued expenses partially offset by an increase in accounts and notes receivable in 2013  as a result of higher sales in the fourth quarter of 2013 versus 2012 

pensions 

the funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon a variety of variables and assumptions including return on invested assets market interest rates and levels of voluntary contributions to the plans   in 2013  the investment return on our us pension trust was 76 percent while our uk pension trust return was 109 percent   approximately 77 percent of our pension plan assets are invested in highly liquid investments such as fixed income and equity securities the remaining 23 percent of our plan assets are invested in less liquid but market valued investments including real estate private equity and insurance contracts   we made 169 million  of pension contributions in 2013  including 112 million  of voluntary contributions claims and premiums for other postretirement benefits approximated 48 million  net of reimbursements in 2013  these contributions and payments include payments from our funds either to increase pension plan assets or to make direct payments to plan participants   we anticipate making total contributions of 205 million  to our defined benefit pension plans in 2014  expected contributions to our defined benefit pension plans in 2014  will meet or exceed the current funding requirements 

2012  vs 2011   

net cash provided by operating activities decreased versus 2011 primarily due to unfavorable working capital fluctuations and lower consolidated net income which were partially offset by a lower noncash gain on disposition of certain assets and liabilities of our exhaust business and our lightduty filtration business in 2012 during 2012 the net increase in working capital resulted in a cash outflow of 775 million compared to a cash outflow of 154 million in 2011 this change of 621 million was primarily driven by lower accrued expenses and a decrease in accounts payable as volumes dropped in the second half of the year and higher cash tax payments of approximately 159 million these were partially offset by a decrease in accounts and notes receivable and a smaller increase in inventory in 2012 

investing activities 



2013  vs 2012   

net cash used in investing activities decrease d versus 2012  primarily due to lower net investments in marketable securities lower cash investments in acquisitions of businesses and lower investments in and advances to equity investees partially offset by purchases of corporate owned life insurance 

on september 17 2013 we announced our intention to acquire the equity that we do not already own in most of our partiallyowned united states and canadian distributors over the next three  to five years  we plan to spend approximately 400 million to 500 million on distributor acquisitions and refinancing in 2014 

capital expenditures were 676 million  in 2013  compared to 690 million  in 2012  despite the challenging economies around the world we continue to invest in new product lines and targeted capacity expansions we plan to spend between 700 million and 800 million in 2014 as we continue with product launches and facility improvements and prepare for future emission standards over 50 percent of our capital expenditures are expected to be invested outside of the us in 2014   as of december 31 2013  we have committed to invest an additional 52 million  in existing joint ventures of which the entire amount is expected to be funded in 2014 

2012  vs 2011   

net cash used in investing activities increased versus 2011 primarily due to cash investments for the acquisitions of hilite and central power proceeds from the 2011 disposition of certain assets and liabilities of our exhaust business and lightduty filtration business which did not repeat in 2012 and increased capital expenditures 

financing activities 



2013  vs 2012

2012  vs 2011

credit ratings are not recommendations to buy are subject to change and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating in addition we undertake no obligation to update disclosures concerning our credit ratings whether as a result of new information future events or otherwise our ratings and outlook from each of the credit rating agencies as of the date of filing are shown in the table below   



contractual obligations and other commercial commitments 

a summary of payments due for our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december 31 2013  is shown in the tables below 



      

 the contractual obligations reported above exclude our unrecognized tax benefits of 169 million as of december 31 2013  we are not able to reasonably estimate the period in which cash outflows relating to uncertain tax contingencies could occur see note 4   income taxes  to the consolidated financial statements for further details 

our other commercial commitments as of december 31 2013  are as follows 



application of critical accounting estimates 

a summary of our significant accounting policies is included in note 1   summary of significant accounting policies  of our consolidated financial statements  which discusses accounting policies that we have selected from acceptable alternatives 

our consolidated financial statements  are prepared in accordance with gaap which often requires management to make judgments estimates and assumptions regarding uncertainties that affect the reported amounts presented and disclosed in the financial statements management reviews these estimates and assumptions based on historical experience changes in business conditions and other relevant factors they believe to be reasonable under the circumstances in any given reporting period our actual results may differ from the estimates and assumptions used in preparing our consolidated financial statements 

critical accounting estimates are defined as follows the estimate requires management to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the estimate was made different estimates reasonably could have been used or if changes in the estimate are reasonably likely to occur from period to period and the change would have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations our senior management has discussed the development and selection of our accounting policies related accounting estimates and the disclosures set forth below with the audit committee of our board of directors we believe our critical accounting estimates include those addressing the estimation of liabilities for warranty programs accounting for income taxes and pension benefits 

warranty programs 

we estimate and record a liability for base warranty programs at the time our products are sold our estimates are based on historical experience and reflect managements best estimates of expected costs at the time products are sold and subsequent adjustment to those expected costs when actual costs differ as a result of the uncertainty surrounding the nature and frequency of product recall programs the liability for such programs is recorded when we commit to a recall action or when a recall becomes probable and estimable which generally occurs when it is announced our warranty liability is generally affected by component failure rates repair costs and the point of failure within the product life cycle future events and circumstances related to these factors could materially change our estimates and require adjustments to our liability new product launches require a greater use of judgment in developing estimates until historical experience becomes available product specific experience is typically available four or five quarters after product launch with a clear experience trend evident eight quarters after launch we generally record warranty expense for new products upon shipment using a preceding products warranty history and a multiplicative factor based upon preceding similar product experience and new product assessment until sufficient new product data is available for warranty estimation we then use a blend of actual new product experience and preceding product historical experience for several subsequent quarters and new product specific experience thereafter note 11   product warranty liability  to our consolidated financial statements  contains a summary of the activity in our warranty liability account for 2013  and 2012  including adjustments to preexisting warranties 

accounting for income taxes 

we determine our income tax expense using the asset and liability method under this method deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax effects of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases future tax benefits of tax loss and credit carryforwards are also recognized as deferred tax assets we evaluate the recoverability of our deferred tax assets each quarter by assessing the likelihood of future profitability and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize our net deferred tax assets at december 31 2013  we recorded net deferred tax assets of 177 million  these assets included 187 million  for the value of tax loss and credit carryforwards a valuation allowance of 101 million  was recorded to reduce the tax assets to the net value management believed was more likely than not to be realized in the event our operating performance deteriorates future assessments could conclude that a larger valuation allowance will be needed to further reduce the deferred tax assets in addition we operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and are subject to tax audits in these jurisdictions these audits can involve complex issues which may require an extended period of time to resolve we reduce our net tax assets for the estimated additional tax and interest that may result from tax authorities disputing uncertain tax positions we have taken and we believe we have made adequate provision for income taxes for all years that are subject to audit based upon the latest information available a more complete description of our income taxes and the future benefits of our tax loss and credit carryforwards is disclosed in note 4   income taxes  to our consolidated financial statements  

pension benefits 

we sponsor a number of pension plans primarily in the us and the uk and to a lesser degree in various other countries in the us and the uk we have several major defined benefit plans that are separately funded we account for our pension programs in accordance with employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans under gaap gaap requires that amounts recognized in financial statements be determined using an actuarial basis as a result our pension benefit programs are based on a number of statistical and judgmental assumptions that attempt to anticipate future events and are used in calculating the expense and liability related to our plans each year at december 31 these assumptions include discount rates used to value liabilities assumed rates of return on plan assets future compensation increases employee turnover rates actuarial assumptions relating to retirement age mortality rates and participant withdrawals the actuarial assumptions we use may differ significantly from actual results due to changing economic conditions participant life span and withdrawal rates these differences may result in a material impact to the amount of net periodic pension cost to be recorded in our consolidated financial statements  in the future 

the expected longterm return on plan assets is used in calculating the net periodic pension cost we considered several factors in developing our expected rate of return on plan assets the longterm rate of return considers historical returns and expected returns on current and projected asset allocations and is generally applied to a fiveyear average market value of return projected returns are based primarily on broad publicly traded fixed income and equity indices and forwardlooking estimates of active portfolio and investment management as of december 31 2013 based upon our target asset allocations it is anticipated that our us investment policy will generate an average annual return over the 10year projection period equal to or in excess of 75 percent approximately 30 percent of the time while returns of 80 percent or greater are anticipated 25 percent of the time   we expect additional positive returns from active investment management   the 2013  oneyear return of 76 percent  combined with the very favorable returns in 2012 has eliminated the significant deterioration in pension assets 

experienced in 2008 as a result of the credit crisis and related market recession based on the historical returns and forwardlooking return expectations we believe an investment return assumption of 75 percent  per year in 2014  for us pension assets is reasonable 

the methodology used to determine the rate of return on pension plan assets in the uk was based on establishing an equityrisk premium over current longterm bond yields adjusted based on target asset allocations as of december 31 2013 based upon our target asset allocations it is anticipated that our uk investment policy will generate an average annual return over the 20year projection period equal to or in excess of 56 percent approximately 50 percent of the time while returns of 65 percent or greater are anticipated 25 percent of the time   we expect additional positive returns from active investment management   the oneyear return for our uk plan was 109 percent  for 2013  and similar to our us plan the 2008 market related deterioration in our plan assets has been eliminated our strategy with respect to our investments in pension plan assets is to be invested with a longterm outlook therefore the risk and return balance of our asset portfolio should reflect a longterm horizon based on the historical returns and forwardlooking return expectations we believe an investment return assumption of 58 percent  in 2014  for uk pension assets is reasonable our pension plan asset allocations at december 31 2013  and 2012  and target allocation for 2014  are as follows 



the differences between the actual return on plan assets and expected longterm return on plan assets are recognized in the asset value used to calculate net periodic expense over five years the table below sets forth the expected return assumptions used to develop our pension cost for the period 2011  2013  and our expected rate of return for 2014  



a lower expected rate of return will increase our net periodic pension cost and reduce profitability 

gaap for pensions offers various acceptable alternatives to account for the differences that eventually arise between the estimates used in the actuarial valuations and the actual results it is acceptable to delay or immediately recognize these differences under the delayed recognition alternative changes in pension obligation including those resulting from plan amendments and changes in the value of assets set aside to meet those obligations are not recognized in net periodic pension cost as they occur but are recognized initially in comprehensive income and subsequently amortized as components of net periodic pension cost systematically and gradually over future periods in addition to this approach gaap also allows immediate recognition of actuarial gains or losses immediate recognition introduces volatility in financial results we have chosen to delay recognition and amortize actuarial differences over future periods if we adopted the immediate recognition approach we would record a loss of 838 million 579 million aftertax from cumulative actuarial net losses for our us and uk pension plans 

the difference between the expected return and the actual return on plan assets is deferred from recognition in our results of operations and under certain circumstances such as when the difference exceeds 10 percent  of the market value of plan assets or the projected benefit obligation pbo amortized over future years of service this is also true of changes to actuarial assumptions as of december 31 2013  we had net pension actuarial losses of 478 million  and 361 million  for the us and uk pension plans respectively under gaap the actuarial gains and losses are recognized and recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss net actuarial gains increased our shareholders equity by 102 million aftertax in 2013  the gains were due to a liability gain from a higher us discount rate and improved plan asset performance for the uk plan partially offset by uk liability losses from a higher inflation assumption and a lower discount rate as these amounts exceed 10 percent  of our pbo the excess is amortized over the average remaining service lives of participating employees 

the table below sets forth the net periodic pension cost for the period 2011  2013  and our expected cost for 2014  



we expect 2014  net periodic pension cost to decrease  significantly over 2013  due to reduced loss amortizations resulting from improved us asset performance and a higher discount rate the increase  in periodic pension cost in 2013  compared to 2012  was due to unfavorable impacts of higher service cost due to increased headcount decreased discount rates and lower expected asset returns for our uk plan as we derisk plan trust assets moving toward more conservative investments   the decrease in periodic pension cost in 2012 compared to 2011 was due to improved returns on assets and strong contributions in 2011  another key assumption used in the development of the net periodic pension cost the discount rate the weighted average discount rates used to develop our net periodic pension cost are set forth in the table below 



changes in the discount rate assumptions will impact the interest cost component of the net periodic pension cost calculation 

the discount rate enables us to state expected future cash payments for benefits as a present value on the measurement date the guidelines for setting this rate are discussed in gaap which suggests the use of a highquality corporate bond rate we used bond information provided by moodys investor service inc standard  poors rating services fitch ratings and dominion bond rating all bonds used to develop our hypothetical portfolio in the us and uk were highquality noncallable bonds aa or better as of december 31 2013  by at least two of the bond rating agencies the average yield of this hypothetical bond portfolio was used as the benchmark for determining the discount rate to be used to value the obligations of the plans subject to gaap for pensions and other postretirement benefits 

our model called for projected payments until current participants have received payment of benefits over a period of approximately 80 years in the us and uk for both countries our model matches the present value of the plans projected benefit payments to the market value of the theoretical settlement bond portfolio a single equivalent discount rate is determined to align the present value of the required cash flow with the value of the bond portfolio the resulting discount rate is reflective of both the current interest rate environment and the plans distinct liability characteristics 

the table below sets forth the estimated impact on our 2014  net periodic pension cost relative to a change in the discount rate and a change in the expected rate of return on plan assets 



the above sensitivities reflect the impact of changing one assumption at a time a higher discount rate decreases the plan obligations and decreases our net periodic pension cost a lower discount rate increases the plan obligations and increases our net periodic pension cost it should be noted that economic factors and conditions often affect multiple assumptions simultaneously and the effects of changes in key assumptions are not necessarily linear note 12   pension and other postretirement benefits  to our consolidated financial statements  provides a summary of our pension benefit plan activity the funded status of our plans and the amounts recognized in our consolidated financial statements  

recently adopted accounting pronouncements 

in february 2013 the financial accounting standards board fasb amended its standards on comprehensive income by requiring disclosure in the footnotes of information about amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component specifically the amendment requires disclosure of the line items on net income in which the item was reclassified only if it is reclassified to net income in its entirety in the same reporting period it also requires cross reference to other disclosures for amounts that are not reclassified in their entirety in the same reporting period the new rules became effective for us beginning january 1 2013 and were adopted prospectively in accordance with the standard the standard resulted in new disclosures in note 16 other comprehensive income loss   

in december 2011 the fasb amended its standards related to offsetting assets and liabilities this amendment requires entities to disclose both gross and net information about certain instruments and transactions eligible for offset in the statement of financial position and certain instruments and transactions subject to an agreement similar to a master netting agreement this information enables users of the financial statements to understand the effect of those arrangements on our financial position the new rules became effective on january 1 2013 in january 2013 the fasb further amended this standard to limit its scope to derivatives repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements securities borrowings and lending transactions this standard resulted in new disclosures in note 21 derivatives   




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to financial risk resulting from volatility in foreign exchange rates commodity prices and interest rates this risk is closely monitored and managed through the use of financial derivative instruments including foreign currency forward contracts commodity swap contracts commodity zerocost collars and interest rate swaps as stated in our policies and procedures financial derivatives are used expressly for hedging purposes and under no circumstances are they used for speculative purposes when material we adjust the value of our derivative contracts for counterparty or our credit risk none of our derivative instruments are subject to collateral requirements substantially all of our derivative contracts are subject to master netting arrangements which provide us with the option to settle certain contracts on a net basis when they settle on the same day with the same currency in addition these arrangements provide for a net settlement of all contracts with a given counterparty in the event that the arrangement is terminated due to the occurrence of default or a termination event   

further information regarding financial instruments and risk management is contained in note 21   derivatives  to our consolidated financial statements  

the following describes our risk exposures and provides the results of a sensitivity analysis performed as of december 31 2013  the sensitivity analysis assumes instantaneous parallel shifts in foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices 

foreign exchange rates   

as a result of our international business presence we are exposed to foreign currency exchange risks we transact business in foreign currencies and as a result our income experiences some volatility related to movements in foreign currency exchange rates to help manage our exposure to exchange rate volatility we use foreign currency forward contracts on a regular basis to hedge forecasted intercompany and thirdparty sales and purchases denominated in nonfunctional currencies our internal policy allows for managing anticipated foreign currency cash flows for up to one year    these foreign currency forward contracts are designated and qualify as foreign currency cash flow hedges under gaap the effective portion of the unrealized gain or loss on the forward contract is deferred and reported as a component of “accumulated other comprehensive loss” aocl when the hedged forecasted transaction sale or purchase occurs the unrealized gain or loss is reclassified into income in the same line item associated with the hedged transaction in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects income the ineffective portion of the hedge if any is recognized in current income during the period of change   as of december 31 2013 the amount we expect to reclassify from aocl to income over the next year is an unrealized net gain of 4 million  for the years ended december 31 2013  and 2012  there were no circumstances that would have resulted in the discontinuance of a foreign currency cash flow hedge   

to minimize the income volatility resulting from the remeasurement of net monetary assets and payables denominated in a currency other than the functional currency we enter into foreign currency forward contracts which are considered economic hedges the objective is to offset the gain or loss from remeasurement with the gain or loss from the fair market valuation of the forward contract these derivative instruments are not designated as hedges under gaap   

as of december 31 2013 the potential gain or loss in the fair value of our outstanding foreign currency contracts assuming a hypothetical 10  percent fluctuation in the currencies of such contracts would be approximately 35 million  the sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates assumes the notional value to remain constant for the next 12 months the analysis ignores the impact of foreign exchange movements on our competitive position and potential changes in sales levels it should be noted that any change in the value of the contracts real or hypothetical would be significantly offset by an inverse change in the value of the underlying hedged items  see note 21   derivatives  to our consolidated financial statements  

interest rate risk   

we are exposed to market risk from fluctuations in interest rates we manage our exposure to interest rate fluctuations through the use of interest rate swaps the objective of the swaps is to more effectively balance our borrowing costs and interest rate risk   

in november 2005 we entered into an interest rate swap to effectively convert our 250 million  debt issue due in 2028 from a fixed rate of 7125 percent  to a floating rate based on a libor   spread the terms of the swap mirror those of the debt with interest paid semiannually this swap qualifies as a fair value hedge under gaap the gain or loss on this derivative instrument as well as the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in current income as “interest expense” the following table summarizes these gains and losses for the years presented below   



commodity price risk   

we are exposed to fluctuations in commodity prices due to contractual agreements with component suppliers in order to protect ourselves against future price volatility and consequently fluctuations in gross margins we periodically enter into commodity swap contracts with designated banks to fix the cost of certain raw material purchases with the objective of minimizing changes in inventory cost due to market price fluctuations certain commodity swap contracts are derivative contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges under gaap we also have commodity swap contracts that represent an economic hedge but are not designated for hedge accounting and are marked to market through earnings for those contracts that qualify for hedge accounting the effective portion of the unrealized gain or loss is deferred and reported as a component of aocl when the hedged forecasted transaction purchase occurs the unrealized gain or loss is reclassified into income in the same line item associated with the hedged transaction in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects income the ineffective portion of the hedge if any is recognized in current income in the period in which the ineffectiveness occurs as of december 31 2013 we expect to reclassify an unrealized net  loss of 4 million   from aocl to income over the next year our internal policy allows for managing these cash flow hedges for up to three years  

as of december 31 2013 the potential gain or loss related to the outstanding commodity swap contracts assuming a hypothetical 10  percent fluctuation in the price of such commodities was   9 million  the sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in commodity prices assumes the notional value to remain constant for the next 12 months the analysis ignores the impact of commodity price movements on our competitive position and potential changes in sales levels it should be noted that any change in the value of the swap contracts real or hypothetical would be significantly offset by an inverse change in the value of the underlying hedged items see note 21   derivatives  to the consolidated financial statements

our distribution segment consists of 23 companyowned and 18 joint venture distributors that service and distribute the full range of our products and services to endusers at approximately 400 locations in approximately 80 distribution territories our companyowned distributors are located in key markets including north america australia europe the middle east india china africa russia japan brazil singapore and central america while our joint venture distributors are located in north america south america africa china thailand singapore and vietnam 

the distribution segment consists of the following businesses which service andor distribute the full range of our products and services 

• parts and filtration • power generation 9 

• engines and • service the distribution segment is organized into five primary geographic regions 

• asia pacific • europe and the middle east eme • north and central america • africa and • south america asia pacific and eme are composed of six smaller regional distributor organizations south pacific greater europe the middle east china india and northeastsoutheast asia which allow us to better manage these vast geographic territories 

north and central america are mostly comprised of a network of partiallyowned distributors internationally our network consists of independent partiallyowned and whollyowned distributors through these networks we provide parts and service to our customers these fullservice solutions include maintenance contracts engineering services and integrated products where we customize our products to cater to specific needs of endusers our distributors also serve and develop dealers predominantly oem dealers in their territories by providing new products technical support tools training parts and product information 

in addition to managing our involvement with our whollyowned and partiallyowned distributors our distribution segment is responsible for managing the performance and capabilities of our independent distributors our distribution segment serves a highly diverse customer base with approximately 45 percent of its 2012 sales being generated from new engines and power generation equipment compared to 47 percent in 2011 with its remaining sales generated by parts and filtration and service revenue 

financial information about our distributors accounted for under the equity method are incorporated by reference from note 3 investments in equity investees to our consolidated financial statements  

our distributors compete with distributors or dealers that offer similar products in many cases these competing distributors or dealers are owned by or affiliated with the companies that are listed above as competitors of our engine components or power generation segments these competitors vary by geographical location 

in july 2012 we acquired an additional 45 percent interest in cummins central power from the former principal for consideration of approximately 20 million the acquisition was accounted for as a business combination with the results of the acquired entity included in the distribution operating segment in the third quarter of 2012 distribution segment results also included a 7 million gain as we were required to remeasure our preexisting 35 percent ownership interest in cummins central power to fair value in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united state of america gaap see note 2 acquisitions and divestitures to our consolidated financial statements for additional detail 

joint ventures alliances and nonwhollyowned subsidiaries 

we have entered into a number of joint venture agreements and alliances with business partners around the world our joint ventures are either distribution or manufacturing entities we also own controlling interests in nonwhollyowned manufacturing and distribution subsidiaries seven entities in 

which we own more than a 50 percent equity interest are consolidated in our distribution segment results as well as several manufacturing joint ventures in the other operating segments 

in the event of a change of control of either party to certain of these joint ventures and other strategic alliances certain consequences may result including automatic termination and liquidation of the venture exercise of put or call rights of ownership by the nonacquired partner termination or transfer of technology license rights to the nonacquired partner and increases in component transfer prices to the acquired partner we will continue to evaluate joint venture and partnership opportunities in order to penetrate new markets develop new products and generate manufacturing and operational efficiencies 

financial information about our investments in joint ventures and alliances is incorporated by reference from note 3 investments in equity investees to the consolidated financial statements 

our equity income from these investees was as follows 



1 this total represents our share of net income of our equity investees and is exclusive of royalties and interest income from our equity investees to see how this amount reconciles to equity royalty and interest income from investees in the consolidated statements of income  see note 3 investments in equity investees to our consolidated financial statements 

distribution entities 

• north american distributors —our distribution channel in north america includes 11 unconsolidated partiallyowned distributors our equity interests in these nonconsolidated entities range from 30 percent to 50 percent we also have more than a 50 percent ownership interest in four partially owned distributors which we consolidate while each distributor is a separate legal entity the business of each is substantially the same as that of our whollyowned distributors based in other parts of the world all of our distributors irrespective of their legal structure or ownership offer the full range of our products and services to customers and endusers in their respective markets • komatsu cummins chile ltda —komatsu cummins chile ltda is a joint venture with komatsu america corporation the joint venture is a distributor that offers the full range of our products and services to customers and endusers in the chilean and peruvian markets 11

supply 

the performance of the endtoend supply chain extending through to our suppliers is foundational to our ability to meet customers expectations and support longterm growth in order to ensure we meet the needs of our customers we are committed to having a robust strategy for how we select and manage our suppliers 

we have a strategic sourcing policy that guides decisions on what we make when we establish supplier partnerships and what we purchase today we machine and assemble strategic components used in our engines and power generation units including blocks heads turbochargers connecting rods camshafts crankshafts filters alternators and fuel systems we source externally purchased material and manufactured components from leading suppliers both domestically and internationally many suppliers are managed though longterm agreements that assure capacity delivery quality and cost requirements are met over an extended period we have a take or pay contract with an emission solutions business supplier requiring us to purchase approximately 73 million annually through 2018 approximately 60 to 70 percent of the total types of parts in our product designs are single sourced although we elect to source a relatively high proportion of our total raw materials and components from sole suppliers we have an established annual sourcing strategy process that evaluates risk this annual review process has led us to begin increasing our use of dual sourcing to both minimize risk and increase supply chain responsiveness 

other important elements of our sourcing strategy include 

• working with suppliers to measure and improve their environmental footprint • selecting and managing suppliers to comply with our supplier code of conduct and • assuring our suppliers do not use restricted or prohibited materials in our products patents and trademarks 

we own or control a significant number of patents and trademarks relating to the products we manufacture these patents and trademarks were granted and registered over a period of years although these patents and trademarks are generally considered beneficial to our operations we do not believe any patent group of patents or trademark other than our leading brand house trademarks is significant to our business 

seasonality 

while individual product lines may experience modest seasonal variation in production there is no material effect on the demand for the majority of our products on a quarterly basis with the exception that our power generation segment normally experiences seasonal declines in the first quarter due to general declines in construction spending during this period and our distribution segment normally experiences seasonal declines in its first quarter business activity due to holiday periods in asia and australia 

largest customers 

we have thousands of customers around the world and have developed longstanding business relationships with many of them paccar is our largest customer accounting for approximately 13 percent of our consolidated net sales in 2012 compared to approximately 12 percent in 2011 and 7 percent in 2010 we have longterm supply agreements with paccar for our heavyduty isx 15 liter 

and isx 119 liter engines and our isl 9 liter midrange engine while a significant number of our sales to paccar are under longterm supply agreements these agreements provide for particular engine requirements for specific vehicle models and not a specific volume of engines paccar is our only customer accounting for more than 10 percent of our net sales in 2012 the loss of this customer or a significant decline in the production level of paccar vehicles that use our engines would have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition we have been an engine supplier to paccar for over 68 years a summary of principal customers for each operating segment is included in our segment discussion 

in addition to our agreement with paccar we have longterm heavyduty engine supply agreements with volvo trucks north america and navistar international corporation and longterm midrange supply agreements with daimler trucks north america ford and man we also have an agreement with chrysler to supply engines for its ram trucks in our offhighway markets we have various engine and component supply agreements ranging across our midrange and highhorsepower businesses with komatsu ltd as well as various joint ventures and other license agreements in our engine component and distribution segments collectively our net sales to these seven customers including paccar was approximately 33 percent of our consolidated net sales in 2012 compared to approximately 31 percent in 2011 and 25 percent in 2010 excluding paccar net sales to individual customers were less than 8 percent of our consolidated net sales to any single customer in 2012 compared to less than 6 percent in 2011 and less than 4 percent in 2010 these agreements contain standard purchase and sale agreement terms covering engine and engine parts pricing quality and delivery commitments as well as engineering product support obligations the basic nature of our agreements with oem customers is that they are longterm price and operations agreements that help assure the availability of our products to each customer through the duration of the respective agreements agreements with most oems contain bilateral termination provisions giving either party the right to terminate in the event of a material breach change of control or insolvency or bankruptcy of the other party 

backlog 

our 2012 lead times for the majority of our businesses improved from their 2011 levels while we have supply agreements with some truck and offhighway equipment oems most of our business is transacted through open purchase orders these open orders are historically subject to monthtomonth releases and are subject to cancellation on reasonable notice without cancellation charges and therefore are not considered firm 

research and development expense 

in 2012 we increased our research development and engineering expenses as we continued to invest in future critical technologies and products we will continue to make investments to improve our current technologies continue to meet the future emission requirements around the world and improve fuel economy 

our research and development program is focused on product improvements innovations and cost reductions for our customers research and development expenditures include salaries contractor fees building costs utilities administrative expenses and allocation of corporate costs and are expensed net of contract reimbursements when incurred research and development expenses net of contract reimbursements were 721 million in 2012 621 million in 2011 and 402 million in 2010 contract reimbursements were 86 million in 2012 75 million in 2011 and 68 million in 2010 

for 2011 and 2010 approximately 1 million and 38 million or less than 1 percent and 9 percent respectively of our research and development expenditures were directly related to compliance with 2010 environmental protection agency epa emission standards for 2012 2011 and 2010 

approximately 101 million 104 million and 36 million or 14 percent 17 percent and 9 percent of our research and development expenditures were directly related to compliance with 2013 epa emission standards 

environmental sustainability 

our environmental sustainability principles attempt to positively impact the environment through the products that we make how we use our facilities and how we impact communities where we live and work our newly formed corporate action committee for environmental sustainability is developing a global plan to more fully integrate environmental stewardship across all of our businesses and functions we continue to invest significantly to further reduce emissions from and increase the efficiency of our products we attempt to work collaboratively with customers to improve their fuel economy reduce their carbon footprints and conserve other resources over the past four years we believe that we have reduced companywide water usage intensity by approximately 45 percent uswide processderived hazardous waste generation by approximately 52 percent and companywide landfill waste by approximately 28 percent all normalized to total work hours we also have articulated our positions on key public policy issues and on a wide range of environmental issues we are actively engaged with regulatory industry and other stakeholder groups around the world as ghg and fuel efficiency standards become more prevalent globally for the eighth consecutive year we were named to the dow jones world sustainability index which recognizes the top 10 percent of the worlds largest 2500 companies in economic environmental and social leadership we were also named the top environmentally conscious industrial company in the us in newsweeks green rankings our sustainability report for 20112012 as well as an addendum of more detailed environmental data is available on our website at wwwcumminscom although such report and addendum are not incorporated into this form 10k 

environmental compliance 

product environmental compliance 

our engines are subject to extensive statutory and regulatory requirements that directly or indirectly impose standards governing emission and noise we have substantially increased our global environmental compliance presence and expertise to better prepare for understand and ultimately meet emerging product environmental regulations around the world our products comply with all current emission standards that the european union eu epa the california air resources board carb and other state and international regulatory agencies have established for heavyduty onhighway diesel and gas engines and offhighway engines our ability to comply with these and future emission standards is an essential element in maintaining our leadership position in regulated markets we have made and will continue to make significant capital and research expenditures to comply with these standards our failure to comply with these standards could result in adverse effects on our future financial results 

eu and epa engine certifications 

the current onhighway emission standards came into effect in the eu on october 1 2008 euro v and on january 1 2010 for the epa to meet the more stringent heavyduty onhighway emission standards we used an evolution of our proven selective catalytic reduction scr and exhaust gas recirculation egr technology solutions and refined them for the eu and epa certified engines to maintain power and torque with substantial fuel economy improvement and maintenance intervals comparable with our previous compliant engines we offer a complete lineup of onhighway engines to meet the nearzero emission standards midrange and heavyduty engines for eu and epa require nox aftertreatment nox reduction is achieved by an integrated technology solution comprised of the xpi high pressure common rail fuel system scr technology nextgeneration cooled egr advanced 

electronic controls proven air handling and the cummins diesel particulate filter dpf the eu epa and carb have certified that our engines meet the current emission requirements emission standards in international markets including japan mexico australia brazil russia india and china are becoming more stringent we believe that our experience in meeting the eu and epa emission standards leaves us well positioned to take advantage of opportunities in these markets as the need for emission control capability grows 

we have received certification from the epa that we have met both the epa 2013 and 2014 ghg regulations and rules the epa 2013 regulations add the requirement of onboard diagnostics which were introduced on the isx15 in 2010 across the full onhighway product line in 2013 in addition to maintaining the same nearzero emission levels of nox and particulate matter pm required in 2010 onboard diagnostics provide enhanced service capability with standardized diagnostic trouble codes service tool interface incab warning lamp and service information availability the new ghg and fuelefficiency regulations will be required for all heavyduty diesel and natural gas engines beginning in january 2014 our ghg certification is the first engine certificate issued by the epa and uses the same proven base engine with the xpi fuel system variable geometry turbocharger vgt™ cummins aftertreatment system with dpf and scr technology and fully integrated electronics 

other environmental statutes and regulations 

expenditures for environmental control activities and environmental remediation projects at our facilities in the us have not been a substantial portion of our annual capital outlays and are not expected to be material in 2013 we believe we are in compliance in all material respects with laws and regulations applicable to our plants and operations 

in the us pursuant to notices received from federal and state agencies andor defendant parties in site environmental contribution actions we have been identified as a potentially responsible party prp under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of 1980 as amended or similar state laws at approximately 20 waste disposal sites based upon our experiences at similar sites we believe that our aggregate future remediation costs will not be significant we have established accruals that we believe are adequate for our expected future liability with respect to these sites 

in addition we have several other sites where we are working with governmental authorities on remediation projects the costs for these remediation projects are not expected to be material 

employees 

as of december 31 2012 we employed approximately 46000 persons worldwide approximately 15750 of our employees worldwide are represented by various unions under collective bargaining agreements that expire between 2013 and 2015

 item 1a risk factors 

set forth below and elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k are some of the principal risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual business results to differ materially from any forwardlooking statements contained in this report and could individually or in combination have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows these risk factors should be considered in addition to our cautionary comments concerning forwardlooking statements in this report including statements related to markets for our products and trends in our business that involve a number of risks and uncertainties our separate section above cautionary statements regarding forwardlooking information should be considered in addition to the following statements 

a sustained slowdown or significant downturn in our markets could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial condition or cash flows 

the global economy continued to slow throughout 2012 as we experienced declining demand in emerging markets including brazil and china and a decline in india as the result of foreign currency fluctuations the developed economies including the us economy experienced slowing demand as the year progressed and continued to experience economic uncertainty driven by unresolved federal tax and budget issues while europe continued to struggle as the result of lingering high unemployment concerns over european sovereign debt issues and the tightening of government budgets if the global economy or some of our significant markets encounter a sustained slowdown or our emerging markets particularly china and brazil dont recover to stronger growth rates depending upon the length duration and severity of such a slowdown our results of operations financial condition and cash flow would almost certainly be materially adversely affected specifically our revenues would likely decrease we may be forced to consider further restructuring actions we may need to increase our allowance for doubtful accounts our days sales outstanding may increase and we could experience impairments to assets of certain of our businesses 

a slowdown in infrastructure development could adversely affect our business 

infrastructure development has been a significant driver of our business in recent years especially in the emerging markets of china and brazil in 2012 infrastructure spending in emerging markets steadily declined throughout the year general weakness in economic growth or the perception that infrastructure has been overbuilt could lead to a further decline in infrastructure spending any sustained downturns in infrastructure development that result from these or other circumstances could adversely affect our business 

unpredictability in the adoption implementation and enforcement of increasingly stringent emission standards by multiple jurisdictions around the world could adversely affect our business 

our engines are subject to extensive statutory and regulatory requirements governing emission and noise including standards imposed by the epa the european union state regulatory agencies such as the carb and other regulatory agencies around the world we have made and will be required to continue to make significant capital and research expenditures to comply with these emission standards developing engines to meet numerous changing government regulatory requirements with different implementation timelines and emission requirements makes developing engines efficiently for multiple markets complicated and could result in substantial additional costs that may be difficult to recover in certain markets in some cases we may be required to develop new products to comply with new regulations particularly those relating to air emission while we have met previous deadlines our ability to comply with other existing and future regulatory standards will be essential for us to maintain our position in the engine markets we serve the successful development and introduction of new and enhanced products in order to comply with new regulatory requirements are subject to other risks such 

as delays in product development cost overruns and unanticipated technical and manufacturing difficulties 

in addition to these risks the nature and timing of government implementation and enforcement of increasingly stringent emission standards around the world is unpredictable and subject to change or delays which could result in the products we developed or modified to comply with these standards becoming unnecessary or becoming necessary later than expected and in some cases negating our competitive advantage this in turn can delay diminish or eliminate the expected return on capital and research expenditures that we have invested in such products and may adversely affect our perceived competitive advantage in being an early advanced developer of compliant engines 

we derive significant income from investees that we do not directly control 

our net income includes significant equity royalty and interest income from investees that we do not directly control for 2012 we recognized 384 million of equity royalty and interest income from investees compared to 416 million in 2011 the majority of our equity royalty and interest income from investees is from our 11 unconsolidated north american distributors and from two of our joint ventures in china dongfeng cummins engine company ltd dcec and chongqing cummins engine company ltd ccec our equity ownership interests in our unconsolidated north american distributors generally range from 30 percent to 50 percent we have 50 percent equity ownership interests in dcec and ccec as a result although a significant percentage of our net income is derived from these unconsolidated entities we do not unilaterally control their management or their operations which puts a substantial portion of our net income at risk from the actions or inactions of these other entities a significant reduction in the level of contribution by these entities to our net income would likely have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

our truck manufacturers and original equipment manufacturers oems customers may not continue to outsource their engine supply needs 

several of our engine customers including paccar volvo ab navistar international corporation and chrysler are truck manufacturers or oems that manufacture engines for some of their own products despite their own engine manufacturing abilities these customers have historically chosen to outsource certain types of engine production to us due to the quality of our engine products our emission capabilities our systems integration their customers preferences their desire for cost reductions their desire for eliminating production risks and their desire to maintain company focus however there can be no assurance that these customers will continue to outsource or outsource as much of their engine production in the future increased levels of oem vertical integration could result from a number of factors such as shifts in our customers business strategies acquisition by a customer of another engine manufacturer the inability of thirdparty suppliers to meet product specifications and the emergence of lowcost production opportunities in foreign countries any significant reduction in the level of engine production outsourcing from our truck manufacturer or oem customers could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

a downturn in the north american truck industry or other factors negatively affecting any of our truck oem customers could materially adversely impact our results of operations 

we make significant sales of engines and components to a few large truck oems in north america if the north american truck market suffers a significant downturn or if one of our large truck oem customers experienced financial distress or bankruptcy such circumstance would likely lead to significant reductions in our revenues and earnings commercial disputes receivable collection issues and other negative consequences that could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

the discovery of any significant problems with our new engine platforms in north america could materially adversely impact our results of operations financial condition and cash flow 

the epa and carb have certified all of our 20122013 onhighway and offhighway engines which utilize scr technology to meet requisite emission levels we introduced scr technology into our engine platforms in 2010 the effective performance of scr technology and the overall performance of these engine platforms impact a number of our operating segments and remain crucial to our success in north america while these 2010 engine platforms have performed well in the field the discovery of any significant problems in these platforms could result in recall campaigns increased warranty costs reputational risk and brand risk and could materially adversely impact our results of operations financial condition and cash flow 

we are subject to currency exchange rate and other related risks 

we conduct operations in many areas of the world involving transactions denominated in a variety of currencies we are subject to currency exchange rate risk to the extent that our costs are denominated in currencies other than those in which we earn revenues in addition since our financial statements are denominated in us dollars changes in currency exchange rates between the us dollar and other currencies have had and will continue to have an impact on our results of operations while we customarily enter into financial transactions that attempt to address these risks and many of our supply agreements with customers include currency exchange rate adjustment provisions there can be no assurance that currency exchange rate fluctuations will not adversely affect our results of operations in addition while the use of currency hedging instruments may provide us with some protection from adverse fluctuations in currency exchange rates by utilizing these instruments we potentially forego the benefits that might result from favorable fluctuations in currency exchange rates 

we also face risks arising from the imposition of exchange controls and currency devaluations exchange controls may limit our ability to convert foreign currencies into us dollars or to remit dividends and other payments by our foreign subsidiaries or businesses located in or conducted within a country imposing controls currency devaluations result in a diminished value of funds denominated in the currency of the country instituting the devaluation 

we are vulnerable to supply shortages from singlesourced suppliers 

during 2012 we single sourced approximately 60 to 70 percent of the total types of parts in our product designs any delay in our suppliers deliveries may adversely affect our operations at multiple manufacturing locations forcing us to seek alternative supply sources to avoid serious disruptions delays may be caused by factors affecting our suppliers including capacity constraints labor disputes economic downturns availability of credit the impaired financial condition of a particular supplier suppliers allocations to other purchasers weather emergencies natural disasters or acts of war or terrorism any extended delay in receiving critical supplies could impair our ability to deliver products to our customers and our results of operations 

our products are exposed to variability in material and commodity costs 

our businesses establish prices with our customers in accordance with contractual time frames however the timing of material and commodity market price increases may prevent us from passing these additional costs on to our customers through timely pricing actions additionally higher material and commodity costs around the world may offset our efforts to reduce our cost structure while we customarily enter into financial transactions and contractual pricing adjustment provisions with our customers that attempt to address some of these risks notably with respect to copper platinum and palladium there can be no assurance that commodity price fluctuations will not adversely affect our results of operations in addition while the use of commodity price hedging instruments may provide 

us with some protection from adverse fluctuations in commodity prices by utilizing these instruments we potentially forego the benefits that might result from favorable fluctuations in price as a result higher material and commodity costs as well as hedging these commodity costs during periods of decreasing prices could result in declining margins 

our products are subject to recall for performance or safetyrelated issues 

our products may be subject to recall for performance or safetyrelated issues product recalls subject us to harm to our reputation loss of current and future customers reduced revenue and product recall costs product recall costs are incurred when we decide either voluntarily or involuntarily to recall a product through a formal campaign to solicit the return of specific products due to a known or suspected performance issue any significant product recalls could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

we face significant competition in the markets we serve 

the markets in which we operate are highly competitive we compete worldwide with a number of other manufacturers and distributors that produce and sell similar products we primarily compete in the market with diesel engines and related diesel products however new technologies continue to be developed for gasoline natural gas and other technologies and we will continue to face new competition from these expanding technologies our products primarily compete on the basis of price performance fuel economy speed of delivery quality and customer support we also face competitors in some emerging markets who have established local practices and long standing relationships with participants in these markets there can be no assurance that our products will be able to compete successfully with the products of other companies and in other markets for a more complete discussion of the competitive environment in which each of our segments operates see operating segments in item 1 business 

increasing global competition among our customers may affect our existing customer relationships and restrict our ability to benefit from some of our customers growth 

as our customers in emerging markets continue to grow in size and scope they are increasingly seeking to export their products to other countries this has meant greater demand for our advanced engine technologies to help these customers meet the more stringent emissions requirements of developed markets as well as greater demand for access to our distribution systems for purposes of equipment servicing as these emerging market customers enter into and begin to compete in more developed markets they may increasingly begin to compete with our existing customers in these markets our further aid to emerging market customers could adversely affect our relationships with developed market customers and as a result we may be pressured to restrict sale or support of some of our products in the areas of increased competition in addition to the extent the competition does not correspond to overall growth in demand we may see little or no benefit from this type of expansion by our emerging market customers 

we are exposed to political economic and other risks that arise from operating a multinational business 

approximately 53 percent of our net sales for 2012 and 59 percent in 2011 were attributable to customers outside the us accordingly our business is subject to the political economic and other risks that are inherent in operating in numerous countries these risks include 

• the difficulty of enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through foreign legal systems • trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements 23 

• the imposition of taxes on foreign income and tax rates in certain foreign countries that exceed those in the us • the imposition of tariffs exchange controls or other restrictions • difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations and the application of foreign labor regulations • required compliance with a variety of foreign laws and regulations and • changes in general economic and political conditions in countries where we operate particularly in emerging markets as we continue to operate our business globally our success will depend in part on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these and other related risks there can be no assurance that the consequences of these and other factors relating to our multinational operations will not have a material adverse effect upon us 

unanticipated changes in our effective tax rate the adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could adversely affect our profitability 

we are subject to income taxes in the us and numerous international jurisdictions our income tax provision and cash tax liability in the future could be adversely affected by changes in the distribution of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities changes to our assertions regarding permanent reinvestment of our foreign earnings changes in tax laws and the discovery of new information in the course of our tax return preparation process the carrying value of deferred tax assets which are predominantly in the us is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income in the us we are also subject to ongoing tax audits these audits can involve complex issues which may require an extended period of time to resolve and can be highly judgmental tax authorities may disagree with certain tax reporting positions taken by us and as a result assess additional taxes against us we regularly assess the likely outcomes of these audits in order to determine the appropriateness of our tax provision the amounts ultimately paid upon resolution of these or subsequent tax audits could be materially different from the amounts previously included in our income tax provision and therefore could have a material impact on our tax provision 

we are exposed to risks arising from the price and availability of energy 

the level of demand for our products and services is influenced in multiple ways by the price and availability of energy high energy costs generally drive greater demand for better fuel economy in almost all countries in which we operate some of our engine products have been developed with a primary purpose of offering fuel economy improvements and if energy costs decrease or increase less than expected demand for these products may likewise decrease the relative unavailability of electricity in some emerging market countries also influences demand for our electricity generating products such as our diesel generators if these countries add energy capacity by expanding their power grids at a rate equal to or faster than the growth in demand for energy the demand for our generating products could also decrease or increase less than would otherwise be the case 

our global operations are subject to laws and regulations that impose significant compliance costs and create reputational and legal risk 

due to the international scope of our operations we are subject to a complex system of commercial and trade regulations around the world recent years have seen an increase in the development and enforcement of laws regarding trade compliance and anticorruption such as the us foreign corrupt practices act and similar laws from other countries our numerous foreign subsidiaries affiliates and joint venture partners are governed by laws rules and business practices that 

differ from those of the us the activities of these entities may not comply with us laws or business practices or our code of business conduct violations of these laws may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions could disrupt our business and result in an adverse effect on our reputation business and results of operations or financial condition we cannot predict the nature scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our operations might be subject or the manner in which existing laws might be administered or interpreted 

we face the challenge of accurately aligning our capacity with our demand 

we can experience capacity constraints and longer lead times for certain products in times of growing demand while we can also experience idle capacity as economies slow or demand for certain products decline accurately forecasting our expected volumes and appropriately adjusting our capacity have been and will continue to be important factors in determining our results of operations we cannot guarantee that we will be able to increase manufacturing capacity to a level that meets demand for our products which could prevent us from meeting increased customer demand and could harm our business however if we overestimate our demand and overbuild our capacity we may have significantly underutilized assets and we may experience reduced margins if we do not accurately align our manufacturing capabilities with demand it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

our business is exposed to risks of product liability claims 

we face an inherent business risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that our products failure to perform to specification results or is alleged to result in property damage bodily injury andor death we may experience material product liability losses in the future while we maintain insurance coverage with respect to certain product liability claims we may not be able to obtain such insurance on acceptable terms in the future if at all and any such insurance may not provide adequate coverage against product liability claims in addition product liability claims can be expensive to defend and can divert the attention of management and other personnel for significant periods of time regardless of the ultimate outcome an unsuccessful defense of a significant product liability claim could have a material adverse effect upon us in addition even if we are successful in defending against a claim relating to our products claims of this nature could cause our customers to lose confidence in our products and us 

we may need to write off significant investments in our new north american lightduty diesel engine platform if customer commitments further deteriorate 

we began development of a new north american lightduty diesel engine platform in july 2006 to be used in a variety of on and offhighway applications since that time and as of december 31 2012 we have capitalized investments of approximately 233 million market uncertainty due to the global recession resulted in some customers delaying or cancelling their vehicle programs while others remain active if customer expectations or volume projections further deteriorate from our current expected levels and we do not identify new customers we may need to recognize an impairment charge and write the assets down to net realizable value 

our operations are subject to increasingly stringent environmental laws and regulations 

our plants and operations are subject to increasingly stringent environmental laws and regulations in all of the countries in which we operate including laws and regulations governing air emission discharges to water and the generation handling storage transportation treatment and disposal of waste materials while we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with these environmental laws and regulations there can be no assurance that we will not be adversely impacted by costs liabilities or claims with respect to existing or subsequently acquired operations under either 

present laws and regulations or those that may be adopted or imposed in the future we are also subject to laws requiring the cleanup of contaminated property if a release of hazardous substances occurs at or from any of our current or former properties or at a landfill or another location where we have disposed of hazardous materials we may be held liable for the contamination and the amount of such liability could be material 

significant declines in future financial and stock market conditions could diminish our pension plan asset performance and adversely impact our results of operations financial condition and cash flow 

we sponsor both funded and unfunded domestic and foreign defined benefit pension and other retirement plans our pension expense and the required contributions to our pension plans are directly affected by the value of plan assets the projected and actual rates of return on plan assets and the actuarial assumptions we use to measure our defined benefit pension plan obligations including the discount rate at which future projected and accumulated pension obligations are discounted to a present value we could experience increased pension expense due to a combination of factors including the decreased investment performance of pension plan assets decreases in the discount rate and changes in our assumptions relating to the expected return on plan assets 

significant declines in future financial and stock market conditions could cause material losses in our pension plan assets which could result in increased pension expense in future years and adversely impact our results of operations financial condition and cash flow depending upon the severity of market declines and government regulatory changes we may be legally obligated to make pension payments in the us and perhaps other countries and these contributions could be material 

we may be adversely impacted by work stoppages and other labor matters 

as of december 31 2012 we employed approximately 46000 persons worldwide approximately 15750 of our employees worldwide are represented by various unions under collective bargaining agreements that expire between 2013 and 2015 while we have no reason to believe that we will be materially impacted by work stoppages or other labor matters there can be no assurance that future issues with our labor unions will be resolved favorably or that we will not encounter future strikes work stoppages or other types of conflicts with labor unions or our employees any of these consequences may have an adverse effect on us or may limit our flexibility in dealing with our workforce in addition many of our customers and suppliers have unionized work forces work stoppages or slowdowns experienced by our customers or suppliers could result in slowdowns or closures that would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flow 

our financial statements are subject to changes in accounting standards that could adversely impact our profitability or financial position 

our financial statements are subject to the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap which are periodically revised andor expanded accordingly from time to time we are required to adopt new or revised accounting standards issued by recognized authoritative bodies including the financial accounting standards board recently accounting standard setters issued new guidance which further interprets or seeks to revise accounting pronouncements related to revenue recognition and lease accounting as well as to issue new standards expanding disclosures the impact of accounting pronouncements that have been issued but not yet implemented is disclosed in our annual and quarterly reports on form 10k and form 10q an assessment of proposed standards is not provided as such proposals are subject to change through the exposure process and therefore their effects on our financial statements cannot be meaningfully assessed it is possible that future accounting standards we are required to adopt could change the current accounting treatment that we apply to our consolidated financial statements and that such changes could have a material adverse effect on the reported results of operations and financial position

 item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

organization of information 

the following managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations mda was prepared to provide the reader with a view and perspective of our business through the eyes of management and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes to those financial statements our mda is presented in the following sections 

• executive summary and financial highlights • 2013 outlook • results of operations • restructuring and other charges • operating segment results • liquidity and capital resources • contractual obligations and other commercial commitments • application of critical accounting estimates • recently adopted and recently issued accounting pronouncements executive summary and financial highlights 

we are a global power leader that designs manufactures distributes and services diesel and natural gas engines and enginerelated component products including filtration aftertreatment turbochargers fuel systems controls systems air handling systems and electric power generation systems we sell our products to original equipment manufacturers oems distributors and other customers worldwide we have longstanding relationships with many of the leading manufacturers in the markets we serve including paccar inc daimler trucks north america chrysler group llc volvo ab komatsu navistar international corporation aggreko plc ford motor company and man nutzfahrzeuge ag we serve our customers through a network of approximately 600 companyowned and independent distributor locations and approximately 6500 dealer locations in more than 190 countries and territories 

our reportable operating segments consist of the following engine components power generation and distribution this reporting structure is organized according to the products and markets each segment serves and allows management to focus its efforts on providing enhanced service to a wide range of customers the engine segment produces engines and parts for sale to customers in onhighway and various industrial markets our engines are used in trucks of all sizes buses and recreational vehicles as well as in various industrial applications including construction mining agriculture marine oil and gas rail and military equipment the components segment sells filtration products aftertreatment turbochargers and fuel systems the power generation segment is an integrated provider of power systems which sells engines generator sets and alternators the distribution segment includes whollyowned and partiallyowned distributorships engaged in wholesaling engines generator sets and service parts as well as performing service and repair activities on our products and maintaining relationships with various oems throughout the world 

our financial performance depends in large part on varying conditions in the markets we serve particularly the onhighway construction and general industrial markets demand in these markets tends to fluctuate in response to overall economic conditions our sales may also be impacted by oem inventory levels and production schedules and stoppages economic downturns in markets we serve 

generally result in reductions in sales and pricing of our products as a worldwide business our operations are also affected by currency political economic and regulatory matters including adoption and enforcement of environmental and emission standards in the countries we serve as part of our growth strategy we invest in businesses in certain countries that carry high levels of these risks such as china brazil india mexico russia and countries in the middle east and africa at the same time our geographic diversity and broad product and service offerings have helped limit the impact from a drop in demand in any one industry or customer or the economy of any single country on our consolidated results 

the global economy continued to slow throughout 2012 although the impacts were partially offset by strong demand across several end markets in the us and canada north america in the first half of the year however these markets weakened in the second half of the year particularly the heavyduty truck market economies in emerging markets including china and brazil experienced challenges throughout the year in most markets especially the offhighway construction market in china and the mediumduty truck market in brazil demand in india remained strong for power generation equipment however improved volumes were more than offset by unfavorable currency impacts international excludes the us and canada offhighway construction markets have continued to deteriorate with engine shipments down 53 percent including a 72 percent decline in china the onhighway mediumduty truck market in brazil declined as the result of the 2011 prebuy ahead of the new 2012 emission requirements and one of our customers replacing our b67 engine with a proprietary engine in 2012 contributing to international mediumduty truck shipments being down 19 percent north american demand for heavyduty onhighway products increased 3 percent while mediumduty truck shipments increased 15 percent in 2012 compared to 2011 although demand in both of these markets declined in the second half of 2012 north american lightduty onhighway demand also improved with an increase in shipments to chrysler of 37 percent in 2012 compared to 2011 

slow growth in the us economy and uncertainty driven by unresolved federal tax and budget issues caused businesses to hold back on capital expenditures in 2012 thus impacting demand for truck and power generation equipment the governments of china and india have controlled inflation through tight monetary policies in the form of rising interest rates and tightening access to credit although both countries began easing these policies in response to reduced inflationary concerns in 2012 brazil also began easing their monetary policies in the second half of 2012 easing monetary policies could enhance our end markets however there likely will be a delay between when these policies are implemented and when our end markets respond the european economy remains uncertain with continued volatility in the euro countries although we do not have any significant direct exposure to european sovereign debt we generated approximately 8 percent of our net sales from euro zone countries in 2012 as a result of a number of markets unexpectedly slowing in mid2012 continued weak economic data in a number of regions and increasing levels of uncertainty regarding the direction of the global economy we implemented a number of cost reduction initiatives in the second half of 2012 in october 2012 we announced strategic actions necessary to respond to the current environment by cutting costs while maintaining investments in key growth programs actions include a number of measures to reduce costs including planned work week reductions shutdowns at some manufacturing facilities and some targeted workforce reductions we reduced our workforce by 1300 people in the fourth quarter and incurred total restructuring charges of 52 million 35 million aftertax or 018 per diluted share

2013 outlook 

nearterm 

the global economy continued to slow throughout 2012 although the impacts were partially offset by strong demand across several end markets in north america in the first half of the year however these markets weakened in the second half of the year particularly the heavyduty truck market economies in emerging markets including china and brazil experienced challenges throughout the year in most markets especially the offhighway construction market in china and the mediumduty truck market in brazil demand in india remained strong for power generation equipment however improved volumes were more than offset by unfavorable currency impacts 

we currently expect the following positive trends in 2013 

• the brazilian economy is expected to experience stronger growth in 2013 which is anticipated to result in improving demand in both truck and industrial markets over 2012 levels • demand in some of our markets is expected to improve in the second half of 2013 following a slower start in the first half of the year • the new heavyduty supply agreement with navistar international corporation is expected to have a positive impact on our heavyduty truck engine and component sales we currently expect the following challenges to our business that may reduce our earnings potential in 2013 

• political decisions in the us regarding federal tax and budget issues could continue to create economic uncertainty that may limit capital investments and negatively impact the overall north american economy in the first half of 2013 • we expect most of our markets to be weak in the first quarter of 2013 but should begin to improve in the second quarter although remaining below 2012 levels in the first half of 2013 • demand in certain european markets could continue to decline due to economic uncertainty • growth in international markets could be negatively impacted if emission regulations are not strictly enforced • demand for our products in certain industrial markets in china could remain low due to high equipment inventory levels 36 

• currency volatility could continue to put pressure on earnings • north american oil and gas markets could continue to remain weak • domestic and international mining markets could continue to deteriorate if commodity prices weaken longterm 

we believe that over the longer term there will be economic improvements in most of our current markets and that our opportunities for longterm profitable growth will continue in the future as the result of the following four macroeconomic trends that will benefit our businesses 

• tightening emissions controls across the world • infrastructure needs in emerging markets • energy availability and cost issues and • globalization of industries like ours results of operations 





2012 vs 2011 

net sales 

net sales decreased versus 2011 and was primarily driven by the following 

• engine segment sales decreased by 5 percent due to weakness in industrial demand especially in international construction markets and lower volumes in the brazilian mediumduty truck market which were partially offset by growth in the north american onhighway markets in the first half of the year led by the heavyduty business • foreign currency fluctuations unfavorably impacted sales by 2 percent • power generation segment sales decreased by 7 percent due to lower demand in the generator technologies power solutions and power systems businesses which were partially offset by growing demand in the power product business especially in north america • components segment sales excluding acquisitions decreased by 2 percent due to 126 million of sales in 2011 related to assets sold in 2011 and lower demand in the turbo technologies filtration and fuel systems businesses which were partially offset by higher demand in the emission solutions business primarily in north america and brazil the decreases above were partially offset as distribution segment sales excluding acquisitions increased by 2 percent due to higher demand for parts and filtration products especially in north and central america increased power generation growth in east asia increased demand in the south pacific and higher service demand from south pacific mining customers which were partially offset by lower engine product sales due to a slowdown in the north american oil and gas markets 

a more detailed discussion of sales by segment is presented in the operating segment results section 

sales to international markets were 49 percent of total net sales in 2012 compared with 56 percent of total net sales in 2011 

gross margin 

gross margin decreased by 81 million and as a percentage of sales increased by 06 percentage points the increase in gross margin as a percentage of sales was primarily due to lower material costs improved price realization lower warranty costs and favorable product mix which were partially offset by lower volumes unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations and restructuring charges of 29 million 

the provision for warranties issued as a percentage of sales was 21 percent in both 2012 and 2011 a more detailed discussion of margin by segment is presented in the operating segment results section 

selling general and administrative expenses 

selling general and administrative expenses increased primarily due to higher consulting of 45 million restructuring and other charges of 20 million and an increase of 19 million in compensation and related expenses which were partially offset by reduced discretionary spending in the 

second half of the year higher compensation expense was primarily due to increased headcount to support our strategic growth initiatives launched prior to a number of markets unexpectedly slowing in mid2012 compensation and related expenses include salaries fringe benefits and variable compensation variable compensation related to 2012 performance decreased 87 million over variable compensation related to 2011 performance in the third quarter of 2012 we implemented a number of cost reduction initiatives to align our cost structure with the slowdown in demand at several of our key markets in the second half of the year overall selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales increased to 110 percent in 2012 from 102 percent in 2011 

research development and engineering expenses 

research development and engineering expenses increased primarily due to an increase of 54 million in compensation and related expenses and increased consulting of 32 million higher compensation expense was primarily due to increased headcount to support our strategic growth initiatives compensation and related expenses include salaries fringe benefits and variable compensation variable compensation related to 2012 performance decreased 25 million over variable compensation related to 2011 performance research development and engineering expenses in 2012 also included restructuring and other charges of 3 million overall research development and engineering expenses as a percentage of sales increased to 42 percent in 2012 from 35 percent in 2011 research activities continue to focus on development of new products to meet future emission standards around the world and improvements in fuel economy performance 

equity royalty and interest income from investees 

equity royalty and interest income from investees decreased primarily due to the following 



the decreases above were primarily due to lower sales in china at dcec and ccec which were partially offset by growth in north american distributors and higher sales at bfcec

gross margin 

gross margin increased by 1421 million and as a percentage of sales increased by 14 percentage points the significant improvement was led by increases in volume improved price realization higher product content on certain products and favorable currency impacts partially offset by higher material costs higher commodity costs and higher base warranty costs due to increased volumes and increasing 

mix of epa 2010 products gross margin in 2010 also benefited from a onetime 32 million tax recovery in brazil see note 14 commitments and contingencies in our consolidated financial statements for more information 

the provision for warranties issued as a percentage of sales in 2011 was 21 percent compared to 30 percent in 2010 accrual rates for engines sold this year were generally lower than the rates charged in prior years as our warranty costs for epa 2010 products have been lower than expected a more detailed discussion of margin by segment is presented in the operating segment results section

2012 vs 2011 

sales 

engine segment sales decreased versus 2011 due to lower demand in the industrial and mediumduty truck and bus businesses partially offset by growth in the heavyduty truck and lightduty automotive and rv businesses the following are the primary drivers by market 

• industrial market sales decreased primarily due to a 53 percent decline in construction engine shipments in international markets including a 72 percent decline in china and a 44 percent decline in engine shipments to the north american oil and gas markets due to weakened natural gas prices which were partially offset by a 4 percent increase in engine shipments in the north american construction market • mediumduty truck and bus sales decreased primarily due to lower demand in the brazilian truck market due to prebuy activity in the second half of 2011 ahead of the implementation of euro v emission regulations in the first quarter of 2012 and one of our customers replacing our b67 engine with a proprietary engine in 2012 the b67 engine replacement was partially offset by the 2012 launch of our isf and 9 liter engines in new lightduty onhighway and mediumduty truck applications respectively with this same customer the decrease was further offset by improved demand in north american markets the decreases above were partially offset by the following 

• heavyduty truck engine sales increased due to growth in the north american onhighway markets in the first half of the year primarily as a result of the replacement of aging fleets • lightduty automotive and rv sales increased primarily due to a 37 percent improvement in units shipped to chrysler 49

the decrease in gross margin versus 2011 was primarily due to lower volumes and restructuring and other charges which was partially offset by improved price realization lower material costs favorable product mix and improved product coverage the increase in selling general and administrative expenses was primarily due to increased headcount to support our strategic growth initiatives launched prior to a number of markets unexpectedly slowing in mid2012 partially offset by decreased variable compensation expense the increase in research development and engineering expenses was primarily due to new product development spending and increased headcount to support our strategic growth initiatives the decrease in equity royalty and interest income from investees was primarily due to weaker demand for onhighway products at dcec 

2011 vs 2010 

sales 

engine segment sales increased in all businesses versus 2010 as demand improved in most markets including a significant rebound in north american onhighway markets improvements in international construction markets increased demand in global mining markets and significant increases in oil and gas markets the following are the primary drivers by market 

• heavyduty truck engine sales increased due to recovery in north american onhighway markets as oem customers replaced their aging fleets and the depletion of transition engine inventory purchased in 2009 in advance of the epas 2010 emission standard changes • industrial market sales increased primarily due to a 26 percent improvement in international construction engine shipments driven by the economic recovery and infrastructure improvements in certain emerging markets increased demand in advance of offhighway emission regulations in the us and europe a 46 percent increase in units sold in the global mining engine markets due to increased coal and commodity demands and more than double the number of oil and gas engine shipments in north america • mediumduty truck and bus sales increased primarily due to the recovery in north american onhighway markets the depletion of transition engine inventory purchased in 2009 in advance of the epas 2010 emissions change and higher demand in the brazilian truck engine market driven by a growing economy 50 

total onhighwayrelated sales for 2011 were 56 percent of total engine segment sales compared to 50 percent in 2010

• engine product sales increased primarily due to growth in the oil and gas markets in north and central america improved demand in certain markets in europe partially driven by prebuy activity ahead of the 2012 emissions change and higher demand in africa • power generation product sales increased primarily due to improved projectbased business across north and central america south pacific middle east and europe increased demand from japans earthquake recovery and the acquisition of a previously independent distributor in 2010 • parts and filtration product sales increased primarily due to higher demand in north and central america the acquisition of a previously independent distributor in 2010 higher demand from mining customers in the south pacific improved sales in east asia as the result of overall market recovery and increasing engine populations and higher demand driven by economic recovery in europe • foreign currency fluctuations also favorably impacted sales segment ebit 

distribution segment ebit increased versus 2010 primarily due to improved gross margin and equity royalty and interest income from investees which was partially offset by increased selling general and administrative expenses segment ebit was also unfavorably impacted by the absence of a onetime gain of 12 million from the acquisition of cummins western canada in 2010 changes in distribution segment ebit and ebit as a percentage of sales were as follows 



the increase in gross margin versus 2010 was primarily due to higher volumes in most products favorable foreign currency impacts and the acquisition of a previously independent distributor in 2010 the increase in selling general and administrative expenses was mainly due to higher headcount to support our strategic growth initiatives and unfavorable foreign currency impacts the increase in equity royalty and interest income from investees was primarily due to higher income from north american distributors especially in the oil and gas markets and increased parts sales 

reconciliation of segment ebit to income before income taxes 

the table below reconciles the segment information to the corresponding amounts in the consolidated statements of income 



1 includes intersegment sales and profit in inventory eliminations and unallocated corporate expenses the year ended december 31 2012 includes a 6 million gain 4 million aftertax related to adjustments from our 2011 divestitures and a 20 million reserve 12 million aftertax related to legal matters the year ended december 31 2011 includes a 68 million gain 37 million aftertax related to the sale of certain assets and liabilities of our exhaust business and a 53 million gain 33 million aftertax recorded for the sale of certain assets and liabilities of our lightduty filtration business both from the components segment and a 38 million gain 24 million aftertax related to flood damage recoveries from the insurance settlement regarding a june 2008 flood in southern indiana for the year ended december 31 2010 unallocated corporate expenses include 32 million in brazil tax recoveries 21 million aftertax and 2 million in flood damage expenses the gains and losses have been excluded from segment results as they were not considered in our evaluation of operating results for the years ended december 31 2012 2011 and 2010 

liquidity and capital resources 

managements assessment of liquidity 

our financial condition and liquidity remain strong our solid balance sheet and credit ratings enable us to have ready access to credit 

we assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate adequate cash to fund our operating investing and financing activities we generate significant ongoing cash flow which has been used in part to fund capital expenditures pay dividends on our common stock fund repurchases of common stock and make acquisitions cash provided by operations is our principal source of liquidity as of december 31 2012 other sources of liquidity included 

• cash and cash equivalents of 14 billion of which approximately 24 percent was located in the us and 76 percent was located primarily in the uk china singapore india and brazil • marketable securities of 247 million which were located primarily in india and brazil and the majority of which could be liquidated into cash within a few days • revolving credit facility with 17 billion available net of outstanding letters of credit and • international and other domestic shortterm credit facilities with 301 million available we believe our liquidity provides us with the financial flexibility needed to fund working capital capital expenditures projected pension obligations dividend payments common stock repurchases acquisitions restructuring actions and debt service obligations 

our new revolving credit agreement completed in the fourth quarter of 2012 provides us with a 175 billion unsecured revolving credit facility the proceeds of which are to be used for our general corporate purposes see note 10 debt to our consolidated financial statements for further information the credit agreement includes one financial covenant a leverage ratio the required leverage ratio which measures the sum of total debt plus securitization financing to consolidated earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda for the four fiscal quarters may not exceed 325 to 10 at december 31 2012 our leverage ratio was 030 to 10 

a significant portion of our cash flows is generated outside the us as of december 31 2012 the total of cash cash equivalents and marketable securities held by foreign subsidiaries was 13 billion the vast majority of which was located in the uk china india singapore and brazil the geographic location of our cash and marketable securities aligns well with our business growth strategy we manage our worldwide cash requirements considering available funds among the many subsidiaries through which we conduct our business and the cost effectiveness with which those funds can be accessed as a result we do not anticipate any local liquidity restrictions to preclude us from funding our targeted expansion or operating needs with local resources 

if we distribute our foreign cash balances to the us or to other foreign subsidiaries we could be required to accrue and pay us taxes for example we would be required to accrue and pay additional us taxes if we repatriated cash from certain foreign subsidiaries whose earnings we have asserted are permanently reinvested outside of the us foreign earnings for which we assert permanent reinvestment outside the us consist primarily of earnings of our uk domiciled subsidiaries at present we do not foresee a need to repatriate any earnings from these subsidiaries for which we have asserted permanent reinvestment however to help fund cash needs of the us or other international subsidiaries as they arise we repatriate available cash from certain foreign subsidiaries whose earnings are not permanently reinvested when it is cost effective to do so our 2012 and subsequent earnings from our china operations are considered permanently reinvested while earnings generated prior to 2012 for which us deferred tax liabilities have been recorded are expected to be repatriated in future years 

we continuously monitor our pension assets and believe that we have limited exposure to the european debt crisis no sovereign debt instruments of crisis countries are held in the trusts while any equities are held with large welldiversified multinational firms or are de minimis amounts in large index funds our pension plans have not experienced any significant impact on liquidity or counterparty exposure due to the volatility in the credit markets 

the maturity schedule of our existing longterm debt does not require significant cash outflows in the intermediate term required annual principal payments range from 13 million to 72 million over each of the next five years 

working capital summary 

we fund our working capital with cash from operations and shortterm borrowings when necessary various assets and liabilities including shortterm debt can fluctuate significantly from month to month 

depending on shortterm liquidity needs as a result working capital is a prime focus of management attention 



current assets increased 1 percent as increases in other current assets primarily related to refundable income taxes and higher inventory levels due to the unexpected decline in demand were mostly offset by decreased cash and cash equivalents lower accounts and notes receivable and lower marketable securities 

current liabilities decreased 14 percent primarily due to lower accounts payable as a result of reduced purchasing volumes a decrease in accrued compensation benefits and retirement costs due to lower variable compensation expense for 2012 and a decrease in taxes payable caused by lower earnings and higher estimated tax payments in 2012 compared to 2011 

days sales in receivables increased five days compared to 2011 the increase was due to higher average receivable balances throughout 2012 on lower sales due to the decline in volume over the second half of the year 

inventory turnover decreased 06 turns compared to 2011 the decrease was due to higher average inventory balances throughout 2012 on lower sales due to the decline in volume over the second half of the year 

cash flows 

cash and cash equivalents decreased 115 million during the year ended december 31 2012 compared to an increase of 461 million during the comparable period in 2011 the change in cash and cash equivalents was as follows 

operating activities 



2012 vs 2011 

net cash provided by operating activities decreased versus 2011 primarily due to unfavorable working capital fluctuations and lower consolidated net income which were partially offset by a lower noncash gain on disposition of certain assets and liabilities of our exhaust business and our lightduty filtration business in 2012 during 2012 the net increase in working capital resulted in a cash outflow of 775 million compared to a cash outflow of 154 million in 2011 this change of 621 million was primarily driven by lower accrued expenses and a decrease in accounts payable as volumes dropped in the second half of the year and higher cash tax payments of approximately 159 million these were partially offset by a decrease in accounts and notes receivable and a smaller increase in inventory in 2012 

pensions 

the funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon a variety of variables and assumptions including return on invested assets market interest rates and levels of voluntary contributions to the plans in 2012 the return for our us plan was 14 percent while our uk plan return exceeded 7 percent approximately 76 percent of our pension plan assets are held in highly liquid investments such as equity and fixed income securities the remaining 24 percent of our plan assets are held in less liquid but market valued investments including real estate private equity and insurance contracts we made 132 million of pension contributions in 2012 claims and premiums for other postretirement benefits approximated 41 million net of reimbursements in 2012 the 132 million of pension contributions in 2012 included voluntary contributions of 110 million these contributions and payments include payments from our funds either to increase pension plan assets or to make direct payments to plan participants we anticipate making total contributions of 170 million to our defined benefit pension plans in 2013 expected contributions to our defined benefit pension plans in 2013 will meet or exceed the current funding requirements 

2011 vs 2010 

net cash provided by operating activities increased versus 2010 primarily due to significantly higher consolidated net income excluding the gain on the sale of certain assets and liabilities of our exhaust business and our lightduty filtration business as a result of higher sales volumes higher dividends from equity investees and favorable working capital fluctuations during 2011 the net increase in working capital resulted in a cash outflow of 154 million compared to a cash outflow of 245 million in 2010 this decrease of 91 million was primarily driven by a smaller increase in inventory in 2011 as we significantly increased inventory levels in 2010 to meet anticipated postrecession demand 

investing activities 



2012 vs 2011 

net cash used in investing activities increased versus 2011 primarily due to cash investments for the acquisitions of hilite and cummins central power proceeds from the 2011 disposition of certain 

assets and liabilities of our exhaust business and lightduty filtration business which did not repeat in 2012 and increased capital expenditures 

capital expenditures were 690 million in 2012 compared to 622 million in 2011 despite the challenging economies around the world we continue to invest in new product lines and targeted capacity expansions we plan to spend approximately 850 million in 2013 as we continue with product launches and facility improvements and prepare for future emission standards over onehalf of our capital expenditures will be invested outside of the us in 2013 

2011 vs 2010 

net cash used in investing activities decreased versus 2010 primarily due to proceeds received from the sale of certain assets and liabilities of our exhaust business and our lightduty filtration business see note 2 acquisitions and divestitures to our consolidated financial statements  decreased acquisitions and increased liquidations of marketable securities the acquisition of cummins western canada in 2010 and decreased purchases of other investments these drivers were partially offset by increased capital expenditures additional investments in and advances to equity investees and lower proceeds from dispositions of property plant and equipment 

financing activities 



2012 vs 2011 

net cash used in financing activities decreased versus 2011 primarily due to significantly lower repurchases of common stock and decreased payments on borrowings and capital lease obligations which were partially offset by higher dividend payments and decreased proceeds from borrowings 

our total debt was 775 million as of december 31 2012 compared with 783 million as of december 31 2011 total debt as a percent of our total capital including total longterm debt was 100 percent at december 31 2012 compared with 118 percent at december 31 2011 

2011 vs 2010 

net cash used in financing activities increased versus 2010 primarily due to significantly higher repurchases of common stock increased payments on borrowings and capital lease obligations decreased proceeds from borrowings and higher dividend payments 

our total debt was 783 million as of december 31 2011 compared with 843 million as of december 31 2010 total debt as a percent of our total capital including total longterm debt was 118 percent at december 31 2011 compared with 144 percent at december 31 2010 

repurchase of common stock 

in december 2007 the board of directors authorized the acquisition of up to 500 million of our common stock which was completed in february 2011 repurchases under this plan by year were as follows 



in february 2011 the board of directors approved a new share repurchase program and authorized the acquisition of up to 1 billion of our common stock upon completion of the 500 million program in 2011 we repurchased 518 million of shares under this authorization in 2012 we made the following quarterly purchases under this plan 



in december 2012 the board of directors authorized the acquisition of up to 1 billion of our common stock upon completion of the 2011 repurchase program 

quarterly dividends 

in july 2012 the board of directors authorized a 25 percent increase to our quarterly cash dividend on our common stock from 040 per share to 050 per share in july 2011 the board of directors approved a 52 percent increase to our quarterly cash dividend on our common stock from 02625 per share to 040 per share in july 2010 our board of directors approved a 50 percent 

increase in our quarterly cash dividend on our common stock from 0175 per share to 02625 per share cash dividends per share paid to common shareholders for the last three years were as follows 



total dividends paid to common shareholders in 2012 2011 and 2010 were 340 million 255 million and 172 million respectively declaration and payment of dividends in the future depends upon our income and liquidity position among other factors and is subject to declaration by our board of directors who meet quarterly to consider our dividend payment we expect to fund dividend payments with cash from operations 

credit ratings 

a number of our contractual obligations and financing agreements such as our revolving credit facility have restrictive covenants andor pricing modifications that may be triggered in the event of downward revisions to our corporate credit rating there were no downgrades of our credit ratings in 2012 that have impacted these covenants or pricing modifications in september 2011 standard  poors rating services upgraded our rating to a and changed our outlook to stable in november 2011 moodys investors service inc raised our rating to baa1 and changed our outlook to positive in october 2012 fitch ratings upgraded our ratings to a and changed our outlook to stable 

credit ratings are not recommendations to buy are subject to change and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating in addition we undertake no obligation to update disclosures concerning our credit ratings whether as a result of new information future events or otherwise our ratings and outlook from each of the credit rating agencies as of the date of filing are shown in the table below 



contractual obligations and other commercial commitments 

a summary of payments due for our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december 31 2012 is shown in the tables below 



1 includes principal payments and expected interest payments based on the terms of the obligations 2 we are contractually obligated in the uk to fund 37 million in 2013 and 149 million from 2014 to 2015 however our expected total pension contributions for 2013 including the uk is approximately 170 million 

the contractual obligations reported above exclude our unrecognized tax benefits of 145 million as of december 31 2012 we are not able to reasonably estimate the period in which cash outflows relating to uncertain tax contingencies could occur see note 4 income taxes to the consolidated financial statements for further details 

our other commercial commitments as of december 31 2012 are as follows 



application of critical accounting estimates 

a summary of our significant accounting policies is included in note 1 summary of significant accounting policies of our consolidated financial statements which discusses accounting policies that we have selected from acceptable alternatives 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap which often requires management to make judgments estimates and assumptions regarding uncertainties that affect the reported amounts presented and disclosed in the financial statements management reviews these estimates and assumptions based on historical experience changes in business conditions and other relevant factors they believe to be reasonable under the circumstances in any given reporting period our actual results may differ from the estimates and assumptions used in preparing our consolidated financial statements 

critical accounting estimates are defined as follows the estimate requires management to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the estimate was made different estimates reasonably could have been used or if changes in the estimate are reasonably likely to occur from period to period and the change would have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations our senior management has discussed the development and selection of our accounting policies related accounting estimates and the disclosures set forth below with the audit committee of our board of directors we believe our critical accounting estimates include those addressing the estimation of liabilities for warranty programs recoverability of investment related to new products accounting for income taxes and pension benefits 

warranty programs 

we estimate and record a liability for base warranty programs at the time our products are sold our estimates are based on historical experience and reflect managements best estimates of expected costs at the time products are sold and subsequent adjustment to those expected costs when actual costs differ as a result of the uncertainty surrounding the nature and frequency of product recall programs the liability for such programs is recorded when we commit to a recall action or when a recall becomes probable and estimable which generally occurs when it is announced our warranty liability is generally affected by component failure rates repair costs and the point of failure within the product life cycle future events and circumstances related to these factors could materially change our estimates and require adjustments to our liability new product launches require a greater use of judgment in developing estimates until historical experience becomes available product specific experience is typically available four or five quarters after product launch with a clear experience trend evident eight quarters after launch we generally record warranty expense for new products upon shipment using a preceding products warranty history and a multiplicative factor based upon preceding similar product experience and new product assessment until sufficient new product data is available for warranty estimation we then use a blend of actual new product experience and preceding product historical experience for several subsequent quarters and new product specific experience thereafter note 11 product warranty liability to our consolidated financial statements contains a summary of the activity in our warranty liability account for 2012 and 2011 including adjustments to preexisting warranties 

recoverability of investment related to new products 

at december 31 2012 we have capitalized 233 million associated with the future launch of our new lightduty diesel engine product development of this product began in 2006 market uncertainty related to the global recession that began in 2008 resulted in some customers delaying or cancelling their vehicle programs at december 31 2009 we reviewed our investment of 216 million for possible impairment we used projections to assess whether future cash flows on an undiscounted basis related to the assets are likely to exceed the related carrying amount to determine if a writedown was appropriate these projections required estimates about product volume and the size of the market for vehicles that are not yet developed we used input from our customers in developing alternative cash flow scenarios our analysis indicated that the assets were recoverable customers that are expected to purchase sufficient quantities to recover our investment in the new lightduty diesel engine products remained active with the development of this product through 2012 and there were no significant changes to the assumptions used in 2009 if customer expectations or projected volumes deteriorate and we do not identify alternative customers andor product applications we could be required to writedown these assets to net realizable value 

accounting for income taxes 

we determine our income tax expense using the asset and liability method under this method deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax effects of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases future tax benefits of tax loss and credit carryforwards are also recognized as deferred tax assets we evaluate the recoverability of our deferred tax assets each quarter by assessing the likelihood of future profitability and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize our net deferred tax assets at december 31 2012 we recorded net deferred tax assets of 396 million these assets included 165 million for the value of tax loss and credit carryforwards a valuation allowance of 95 million was recorded to reduce the tax assets to the net value management believed was more likely than not to be realized in the event our operating performance deteriorates future assessments could conclude that a larger valuation allowance will be needed to further reduce the deferred tax assets in addition we operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and are subject to tax audits in these jurisdictions these audits can involve complex issues which may require an extended period of time to resolve we reduce our net tax assets for the estimated additional tax and interest that may result from tax authorities disputing uncertain tax positions we have taken and we believe we have made adequate provision for income taxes for all years that are subject to audit based upon the latest information available a more complete description of our income taxes and the future benefits of our tax loss and credit carryforwards is disclosed in note 4 income taxes to our consolidated financial statements  

pension benefits 

we sponsor a number of pension plans primarily in the us and the uk and to a lesser degree in various other countries in the us and the uk we have several major defined benefit plans that are separately funded we account for our pension programs in accordance with employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans under gaap gaap requires that amounts recognized in financial statements be determined using an actuarial basis as a result our pension benefit programs are based on a number of statistical and judgmental assumptions that attempt to anticipate future events and are used in calculating the expense and liability related to our plans each year at december 31 these assumptions include discount rates used to value liabilities assumed rates of return on plan assets future compensation increases employee turnover rates actuarial assumptions relating to retirement age mortality rates and participant withdrawals the actuarial assumptions we use may differ significantly from actual results due to changing economic conditions participant life span and withdrawal rates these differences may result in a material impact to the amount of net periodic pension expense to be recorded in our consolidated financial statements in the future 

the expected longterm return on plan assets is used in calculating the net periodic pension expense we considered several factors in developing our expected rate of return on plan assets the longterm rate of return considers historical returns and expected returns on current and projected asset allocations and is generally applied to a fiveyear average market value of return projected returns are based primarily on broad publicly traded equity and fixed income indices and forwardlooking estimates of active portfolio and investment management as of december 31 2012 based upon our target asset allocations it is anticipated that our us investment policy will generate an average annual return over the 10year projection period equal to or in excess of 75 percent approximately 40 percent of the time while returns of 90 percent or greater are anticipated 25 percent of the time we expect additional positive returns from active investment management the 2012 one year return was 14 percent combined with the very favorable returns in 2011 has eliminated the significant deterioration in pension assets experienced in 2008 as a result of the credit crisis and related market recession based on the historical returns and forwardlooking return expectations we believe an investment return assumption of 80 percent per year in 2013 for us pension assets is reasonable 

the methodology used to determine the rate of return on pension plan assets in the uk was based on establishing an equityrisk premium over current longterm bond yields adjusted based on target asset allocations as of december 31 2012 based upon our target asset allocations it is anticipated that our uk investment policy will generate an average annual return over the 20year projection period equal to or in excess of 56 percent approximately 50 percent of the time while returns of 65 percent or greater are anticipated 25 percent of the time we expect additional positive returns from active investment management the one year return for our uk plan exceeded 7 percent for 2012 and similar to our us plan the 2008 market related deterioration in our plan assets has been eliminated our strategy with respect to our investments in pension plan assets is to be invested with a longterm outlook therefore the risk and return balance of our asset portfolio should reflect a longterm horizon based on the historical returns and forwardlooking return expectations we believe an investment return assumption of 58 percent in 2013 for uk pension assets is reasonable our pension plan asset allocation at december 31 2012 and 2011 and target allocation for 2013 are as follows 



the differences between the actual return on plan assets and expected longterm return on plan assets are recognized in the asset value used to calculate net periodic expense over five years the table below sets forth the expected return assumptions used to develop our pension expense for the period 20102012 and our expected rate of return for 2013 



a lower expected rate of return will increase our net periodic pension expense and reduce profitability 

gaap for pensions offers various acceptable alternatives to account for the differences that eventually arise between the estimates used in the actuarial valuations and the actual results it is acceptable to delay or immediately recognize these differences under the delayed recognition alternative changes in pension obligation including those resulting from plan amendments and changes in the value of assets set aside to meet those obligations are not recognized in net periodic pension cost as they occur but are recognized initially in comprehensive income and subsequently amortized as components of net periodic pension cost systematically and gradually over future periods in addition to this approach gaap also allows immediate recognition of actuarial gains or losses immediate recognition introduces volatility in financial results we have chosen to delay recognition and amortize actuarial differences over future periods if we adopted the immediate recognition approach we would record a loss of 1082 million 724 million aftertax for our us and uk pension plans 

the difference between the expected return and the actual return on plan assets is deferred from recognition in our results of operations and under certain circumstances such as when the difference 

exceeds 10 percent of the market value of plan assets or the projected benefit obligation pbo amortized over future years of service this is also true of changes to actuarial assumptions as of december 31 2012 we had net pension actuarial losses of 734 million and 349 million for the us and uk pension plans respectively under gaap the actuarial gains and losses are recognized and recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss increases in actuarial losses decreased our shareholders equity by 83 million aftertax in 2012 the increases were due to liability losses from reduced discount rates partially offset by improved plan asset performance in 2012 as these amounts exceed 10 percent of our pbo the excess is amortized over the average remaining service lives of participating employees 

the table below sets forth the net periodic pension expense for the period 2010 through 2012 and our expected expense for 2013 



we expect 2013 pension expense to be increased significantly over 2012 due to the unfavorable impacts of higher service cost due to increased headcount decreased discount rates and lower expected asset returns for our uk plan as we derisk plan trust assets moving toward more conservative investments the decrease in periodic pension expense in 2012 compared to 2011 was due to improved returns on assets and strong contributions in 2011 the decrease in periodic pension expense in 2011 compared to 2010 was due to improved returns on assets as the capital markets began to recover and strong contributions in 2010 another key assumption used in the development of the net periodic pension expense is the discount rate the weighted average discount rates used to develop our net periodic pension expense are set forth in the table below 



changes in the discount rate assumptions will impact the interest cost component of the net periodic pension expense calculation 

the discount rate enables us to state expected future cash payments for benefits as a present value on the measurement date the guidelines for setting this rate are discussed in gaap which suggests the use of a highquality corporate bond rate we used bond information provided by moodys investor service inc standard  poors rating services fitch ratings and dominion bond rating all bonds used to develop our hypothetical portfolio in the us and uk were highquality noncallable bonds aa or better as of december 31 2012 by at least two of the bond rating agencies the average yield of this hypothetical bond portfolio was used as the benchmark for determining the discount rate to be used to value the obligations of the plans subject to gaap for pensions and other postretirement benefits 

our model called for 80 years of benefit payments for the us plans and 60 years of payments for the uk for both countries our model matches the present value of the plans projected benefit payments to the market value of the theoretical settlement bond portfolio a single equivalent discount rate is determined to align the present value of the required cash flow with the value of the bond portfolio the resulting discount rate is reflective of both the current interest rate environment and the plans distinct liability characteristics 

the table below sets forth the estimated impact on our 2013 net periodic pension expense relative to a change in the discount rate and a change in the expected rate of return on plan assets 



the above sensitivities reflect the impact of changing one assumption at a time a higher discount rate decreases the plan obligations and decreases our net periodic pension expense a lower discount rate increases the plan obligations and increases our net periodic pension expense it should be noted that economic factors and conditions often affect multiple assumptions simultaneously and the effects of changes in key assumptions are not necessarily linear 

note 12 pension and other postretirement benefits to our consolidated financial statements provides a summary of our pension benefit plan activity the funded status of our plans and the amounts recognized in our consolidated financial statements  

recently adopted and recently issued accounting pronouncements 

accounting pronouncements recently adopted 

in june 2011 the financial accounting standards board fasb amended its rules regarding the presentation of comprehensive income the objective of this amendment was to improve the comparability consistency and transparency of financial reporting and to increase the prominence of items reported in other comprehensive income specifically this amendment requires that all nonowner changes in shareholders equity be presented either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements in addition the standard also requires disclosure of the location of reclassification adjustments between other comprehensive income and net income on the face of the financial statements the new rules became effective for us beginning january 1 2012 in december 2011 the fasb deferred certain aspects of this standard beyond the current effective date specifically the provisions dealing with reclassification adjustments because the standard only impacts the display of comprehensive income and does not impact what is included in comprehensive income the standard did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements  

in may 2011 the fasb amended its standards related to fair value measurements and disclosures the objective of the amendment was to improve the comparability of fair value measurements presented and disclosed in financial statements prepared in accordance with us gaap and international financial reporting standards primarily this amendment changed the wording used to describe many of the requirements in us gaap for measuring fair value and for disclosing information about fair value measurements in addition to clarifying the boards intent about the application of existing fair value measurement requirements the new standard also requires additional disclosures related to fair value measurements categorized within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy and requires disclosure of the categorization in the hierarchy for items which are not recorded at fair value but fair value is required to be disclosed the new rules were effective for us beginning january 1 2012 as of december 31 2012 we had no fair value measurements categorized within level 3 outside of our pension plans the only impact for us is the disclosure of the categorization in the fair value hierarchy for those items where fair value is only disclosed primarily our debt 

obligations our disclosure related to the new standard is included in note 6 fair value of financial instruments to the consolidated financial statements  

accounting pronouncements issued but not yet effective 

in december 2011 the fasb amended its standards related to offsetting assets and liabilities this amendment requires entities to disclose both gross and net information about certain instruments and transactions eligible for offset in the statement of financial position and certain instruments and transactions subject to an agreement similar to a master netting agreement this information will enable users of the financial statements to understand the effect of those arrangements on its financial position the new rules will become effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after january 1 2013 and interim periods within those annual periods it is also required that the new disclosures are applied for all comparative periods presented in january 2013 the fasb further amended this standard to limit its scope to derivatives repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements securities borrowings and lending transactions we do not believe this amendment will have a significant effect on our consolidated financial statements  while we are still finalizing our analysis due to the scope limitation we also do not expect any significant changes to our footnote disclosures 

in february 2013 the fasb amended its standards on comprehensive income by requiring disclosure in the footnotes of information about amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component specifically the amendment will require disclosure of the line items of net income in which the item was reclassified only if it is reclassified to net income in its entirety in the same reporting period it will also require cross reference to other disclosures for amounts that are not reclassified in their entirety in the same reporting period the new disclosures will be required for us prospectively only for annual periods beginning january 1 2013 and interim periods within those annual periods 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to financial risk resulting from volatility in foreign exchange rates commodity prices and interest rates this risk is closely monitored and managed through the use of financial derivative instruments including foreign currency forward contracts commodity swap contracts commodity zerocost collars and interest rate swaps as stated in our policies and procedures financial derivatives are used expressly for hedging purposes and under no circumstances are they used for speculative purposes when material we adjust the value of our derivative contracts for counterparty or our credit risk 

further information regarding financial instruments and risk management is contained in note 21 derivatives to our consolidated financial statements  

the following describes our risk exposures and provides results of sensitivity analysis performed as of december 31 2012 the sensitivity analysis assumes instantaneous parallel shifts in foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices 

foreign exchange rates 

as a result of our international business presence we are exposed to foreign currency exchange risks we transact business in foreign currencies and as a result our income experiences some volatility related to movements in foreign currency exchange rates to help manage our exposure to exchange rate volatility we use foreign exchange forward contracts on a regular basis to hedge forecasted intercompany and thirdparty sales and purchases denominated in nonfunctional currencies our internal policy allows for managing anticipated foreign currency cash flows for up to one year these foreign currency forward contracts are designated and qualify as foreign currency cash flow hedges under gaap the effective portion of the unrealized gain or loss on the forward contract is deferred 

and reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss aocl when the hedged forecasted transaction sale or purchase occurs the unrealized gain or loss is reclassified into income in the same line item associated with the hedged transaction in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects income the ineffective portion of the hedge unrealized gain or loss if any is recognized in current income during the period of change as of december 31 2012 the amount we expect to reclassify from aocl to income over the next year is an unrealized net gain of 1 million for the years ended december 31 2012 and 2011 there were no circumstances that would have resulted in the discontinuance of a foreign currency cash flow hedge 

to minimize the income volatility resulting from the remeasurement of net monetary assets and payables denominated in a currency other than the functional currency we enter into foreign currency forward contracts which are considered economic hedges the objective is to offset the gain or loss from remeasurement with the gain or loss from the fair market valuation of the forward contract these derivative instruments are not designated as hedges under gaap 

as of december 31 2012 the potential gain or loss in the fair value of our outstanding foreign currency contracts assuming a hypothetical 10 percent fluctuation in the currencies of such contracts would be approximately 45 million the sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates assumes the notional value to remain constant for the next 12 months the analysis ignores the impact of foreign exchange movements on our competitive position and potential changes in sales levels it should be noted that any change in the value of the contracts real or hypothetical would be significantly offset by an inverse change in the value of the underlying hedged items see note 21 derivatives to our consolidated financial statements  

interest rate risk 

we are exposed to market risk from fluctuations in interest rates we manage our exposure to interest rate fluctuations through the use of interest rate swaps the objective of the swaps is to more effectively balance our borrowing costs and interest rate risk 

in november 2005 we entered into an interest rate swap to effectively convert our 250 million debt issue due in 2028 from a fixed rate of 7125 percent to a floating rate based on a libor spread the terms of the swap mirror those of the debt with interest paid semiannually this swap qualifies as a fair value hedge under gaap the gain or loss on this derivative instrument as well as the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in current income as interest expense the following table summarizes these gains and losses for the years presented below 



commodity price risk 

we are exposed to fluctuations in commodity prices due to contractual agreements with component suppliers in order to protect ourselves against future price volatility and consequently fluctuations in gross margins we periodically enter into commodity swap contracts with designated banks to fix the cost of certain raw material purchases with the objective of minimizing changes in inventory cost due to market price fluctuations certain commodity swap contracts are derivative contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges under gaap we also have commodity swap contracts that represent an economic hedge but are not designated for hedge accounting and are marked to market through earnings for those contracts that qualify for hedge accounting the effective 

portion of the unrealized gain or loss is deferred and reported as a component of aocl when the hedged forecasted transaction purchase occurs the unrealized gain or loss is reclassified into income in the same line item associated with the hedged transaction in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects income the ineffective portion of the hedge if any is recognized in current income in the period in which the ineffectiveness occurs as of december 31 2012 we expect to reclassify an unrealized net loss of less than 1 million from aocl to income over the next year our internal policy allows for managing these cash flow hedges for up to three years 

as of december 31 2012 the potential gain or loss related to the outstanding commodity swap contracts assuming a hypothetical 10 percent fluctuation in the price of such commodities was 11 million the sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in commodity prices assumes the notional value to remain constant for the next 12 months the analysis ignores the impact of commodity price movements on our competitive position and potential changes in sales levels it should be noted that any change in the value of the swap contracts real or hypothetical would be significantly offset by an inverse change in the value of the underlying hedged items see note 21 derivatives to the consolidated financial statements

supply 

we source our materials and manufactured components from leading suppliers both domestically and internationally we machine and assemble some of the components used in our engines and power generation units including blocks heads turbochargers connecting rods camshafts crankshafts filters exhaust systems alternators and fuel systems we single source approximately 60 to 70 percent of the 

total types of parts in our product designs we have longterm agreements with critical suppliers to help assure our capacity delivery and quality requirements including one take or pay contract with an emission solutions business supplier requiring us to purchase approximately 73 million annually from 2012 through 2018 although we elect to source a relatively high proportion of our total raw materials and component requirements from sole suppliers we have established a process to annually review our sourcing strategies with a focus on the reduction of risk which has led us to dual source critical components where possible and establish programs to proactively detect suppliers with potential risks we are also developing suppliers in many global or emerging markets to serve our businesses across the globe and provide alternative sources in the event of disruption from existing suppliers 

patents and trademarks 

we own or control a significant number of patents and trademarks relating to the products we manufacture these patents and trademarks were granted and registered over a period of years although these patents and trademarks are generally considered beneficial to our operations we do not believe any patent group of patents or trademark other than our leading brand house trademarks is significant to our business 

seasonality 

while individual product lines may experience modest seasonal declines in production there is no material effect on the demand for the majority of our products on a quarterly basis with the exception that our power generation segment normally experiences seasonal declines in the first quarter due to general declines in construction spending during this period and our distribution segment normally experiences seasonal declines in its first quarter business activity due to holiday periods in asia and australia 

largest customers 

we have thousands of customers around the world and have developed longstanding business relationships with many of them paccar is our largest customer accounting for approximately 12 percent of our consolidated net sales in 2011 compared to approximately seven percent in 2010 and nine percent in 2009 we have longterm supply agreements with paccar for our heavyduty isx 15 liter and isx 119 liter engines and our isl 9 liter midrange engine while a significant number of our sales to paccar are under longterm supply agreements these agreements provide for particular engine requirements for specific vehicle models and not a specific volume of engines paccar is our only customer accounting for more than ten percent of our net sales in 2011 the loss of this customer or a significant decline in the production level of paccar vehicles that use our engines would have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition we have been an engine supplier to paccar for over 67 years a summary of principal customers for each operating segment is included in our segment discussion 

in addition to our agreement with paccar we have longterm heavyduty engine supply agreements with volvo trucks north america and longterm midrange supply agreements with daimler trucks north america ford and man we also have an agreement with chrysler for supplying the engine for its ram trucks in our offhighway markets we have various engine and component supply agreements ranging across our midrange and highhorsepower businesses with komatsu ltd as well as various joint ventures and other license agreements in our engine component and distribution segments collectively our net sales to these seven customers including paccar was approximately 31 percent of our consolidated net sales in 2011 compared to approximately 25 percent in 2010 and 23 percent in 2009 excluding paccar net sales to individual customers were less than six percent of our consolidated net sales to any single customer in 2011 compared to less than four percent in 2010 and 2009 these agreements contain standard purchase and 

sale agreement terms covering engine and engine parts pricing quality and delivery commitments as well as engineering product support obligations the basic nature of our agreements with oem customers is that they are longterm price and operations agreements that help assure the availability of our products to each customer through the duration of the respective agreements agreements with most oems contain bilateral termination provisions giving either party the right to terminate in the event of a material breach change of control or insolvency or bankruptcy of the other party 

backlog 

our 2011 lead times for the majority of our businesses remained consistent or improved from their 2010 levels while we have supply agreements with some truck and offhighway equipment oems most of our business is transacted through open purchase orders these open orders are historically subject to monthtomonth releases and are subject to cancellation on reasonable notice without cancellation charges and therefore are not considered firm 

research and development expense 

our research and development program is focused on product improvements innovations and cost reductions for our customers research and development expenditures include salaries contractor fees building costs utilities administrative expenses and allocation of corporate costs and are expensed net of contract reimbursements when incurred research and development expenses net of contract reimbursements were 621 million in 2011 402 million in 2010 and 362 million in 2009 contract reimbursements were 75 million in 2011 68 million in 2010 and 92 million in 2009 

for 2011 2010 and 2009 approximately 1 million 38 million and 151 million or less than one percent nine percent and 42 percent respectively of our research and development expenditures were directly related to compliance with 2010 environmental protection agency epa emission standards for 2011 and 2010 approximately 104 million and 36 million or 17 percent and nine percent of our research and development expenditures were directly related to compliance with 2013 epa emission standards in 2011 we increased our research development and engineering expenses as we continued to invest in future critical technologies and products we will continue to make investments to improve our current technologies continue to meet the future emission requirements around the world and improve fuel economy 

environmental compliance 

sustainability 

we continue to be a leader in sustainable business development and practices we have invested significantly to further lower emissions from and increase the efficiency of our products our ten climate change principles direct our actions to address this environmental challenge across our products businesses employees and communities we have worked collaboratively with customers to improve their fuel economy and reduce their carbon footprint we have significantly reduced greenhouse gas ghg emissions from our facilities and exceeded our 2010 goal of 25 percent intensity reduction by achieving a 28 percent reduction resulting in a savings of approximately 20 million annually we will continue these efforts through our new facility goal to expand this reduction to 40 percent ghg intensity reduction by 2015 over the past three years we have reduced water usage by 22 percent reduced hazardous waste produced during manufacturing by 26 percent and landfill waste by 11 percent normalized to employee hours we have articulated our positions on key public policy issues surrounding a wide range of environmental issues and were actively engaged in developing the firstever ghg and fuel efficiency standards for commercial vehicles that were finalized in the us in 2010 for the seventh consecutive year we were named to the dow jones world sustainability index which recognizes the top 10 percent of the worlds largest 2500 companies in economic 

environmental and social leadership our sustainability report for 20102011 as well as a supplement of more detailed environmental data is available on our website at wwwcumminscom 

product environmental compliance 

our engines are subject to extensive statutory and regulatory requirements that directly or indirectly impose standards governing emission and noise our products comply with all current emission standards that the epa the california air resources board carb and other state and international regulatory agencies have established for heavyduty onhighway diesel and gas engines and offhighway engines our ability to comply with these and future emission standards is an essential element in maintaining our leadership position in regulated markets we have made and will continue to make significant capital and research expenditures to comply with these standards our failure to comply with these standards could result in adverse effects on our future financial results 

epa engine certifications 

the current onhighway emission standards came into effect in the us on january 1 2010 to meet the 2010 us epa heavyduty onhighway emission standards we used an evolution of our proven 2007 technology solution to maintain power and torque with substantial fuel economy improvement and maintenance intervals comparable with our 2007 compliant engines we offer a complete lineup of onhighway engines to meet the nearzero emission standards midrange and heavyduty engines for epa 2010 require nox aftertreatment nox reduction is achieved by an integrated technology solution comprised of the xpi high pressure common rail fuel system selective catalytic reduction scr technology nextgeneration cooled exhaust gas recirculation egr advanced electronic controls proven air handling and the cummins particulate filter for model year 2011 we made changes to the engine control module in response to epas and carbs evolving scr guidance the epa and carb have certified that our engines meet the 2011 emission requirements emission standards in international markets including europe japan mexico australia brazil india and china are becoming more stringent we believe that our experience in meeting us emission standards leaves us well positioned to take advantage of opportunities in these markets as the need for emission control capability grows 

federal and california regulations require manufacturers to report failures of emissionrelated components to the epa and carb when the failure rate reaches a specified level at higher failure rates a product recall may be required in 2011 we submitted five reports to the epa relating to software corrections in our engine control module these software corrections related to the engine control module necessitated the campaigns of approximately 1250 engines at a cost of less than 1 million 

other environmental statutes and regulations 

expenditures for environmental control activities and environmental remediation projects at our facilities in the us have not been a substantial portion of our annual capital outlays and are not expected to be material in 2012 except as follows we believe we are in compliance in all material respects with laws and regulations applicable to our plants and operations 

in the us pursuant to notices received from federal and state agencies andor defendant parties in site environmental contribution actions we have been identified as a potentially responsible party prp under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of 1980 as amended or similar state laws at approximately 20 waste disposal sites based upon our experiences at similar sites we believe that our aggregate future remediation costs will not be significant we have established accruals that we believe are adequate for our expected future liability with respect to these sites 

in addition we have two other sites where we are working with governmental authorities on remediation projects the costs for these remediation projects are not expected to be material 

employees 

as of december 31 2011 we employed approximately 43900 persons worldwide approximately 15700 of our employees worldwide are represented by various unions under collective bargaining agreements that expire between 2012 and 2015

 item 1a risk factors 

set forth below and elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k are some of the principal risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual business results to differ materially from any forwardlooking statements contained in this report and could individually or in combination have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position or cash flows these risk factors should be considered in addition to our cautionary comments concerning forwardlooking statements in this report including statements related to markets for our products and trends in our business that involve a number of risks and uncertainties our separate section above cautionary statements regarding forwardlooking information should be considered in addition to the following statements 

another sustained slowdown or significant downturn in our markets could materially and adversely affect our results of operations financial condition or cash flows again 

although emerging markets notably china india and brazil experienced strong growth and certain domestic markets showed more robust recoveries in 2011 the global economy remains fragile growth rates in certain emerging markets including china and india began to slow in the second half of 2011 as governments looked to control inflation through tight monetary policies while in the developed economies particularly in europe the recovery remains sluggish due to the unwinding of fiscal stimuli lingering high unemployment concerns over european sovereign debt issues and the tightening of government budgets as a result further disruptions in europe or in other economies could affect our revenues or liquidity continued inflationary pressures in emerging market countries could cause their governments to further tighten credit and raise interest rates resulting in slowing economic growth if the global economy or some of our significant markets were to undergo a sustained slowdown or another significant downturn depending upon the length duration and severity of such a slowdown or downturn our results of operations financial condition and cash flow would almost certainly be materially adversely affected again specifically our revenues would likely decrease we may be forced to consider further restructuring actions we may need to increase our allowance for doubtful accounts our days sales outstanding may increase and we could experience impairments to assets of certain of our businesses 

a slowdown in infrastructure development could adversely affect our business 

infrastructure development has been a significant driver of our business in recent years some governments and financial institutions have tightened credit availability and made the terms of available credit more onerous which may lead to a slowdown in economic growth and infrastructure spending concern over inflationary or other economic pressures may cause governments or financial institutions to take similar measures in the future general weakness in economic growth or the perception that infrastructure has been overbuilt also may lead to a decrease in infrastructure spending any significant declines in infrastructure development that result from these circumstances could adversely affect our business 

unpredictability in the adoption implementation and enforcement of increasingly stringent emission standards could adversely affect our business 

our engines are subject to extensive statutory and regulatory requirements governing emission and noise including standards imposed by the epa the european union state regulatory agencies such as the carb and other regulatory agencies around the world we have made and will be required to continue to make significant capital and research expenditures to comply with these emission standards developing engines to meet changing government regulatory requirements with different implementation timelines and emission requirements makes developing engines efficiently for multiple markets complicated and could result in substantial additional costs that may be difficult to recover in 

certain markets in some cases we may be required to develop new products to comply with new regulations particularly those relating to air emission for example we were required to develop new engines to comply with stringent emission standards in the us by january 1 2010 including the reduction of nox emission to near zero levels among other requirements while we were able to meet this and previous deadlines our ability to comply with other existing and future regulatory standards will be essential for us to maintain our position in the engine markets we serve the successful development and introduction of new and enhanced products in order to comply with new regulatory requirements are subject to other risks such as delays in product development cost overruns and unanticipated technical and manufacturing difficulties in addition to these risks the nature and timing of government implementation and enforcement of increasingly stringent emission standards around the world is unpredictable and subject to change delays and reversals that can result in new or modified products that we have developed to comply with the standards becoming unnecessary or becoming necessary later than expected and in some cases negating our competitive advantage this in turn can delay diminish or eliminate the expected return on capital and research expenditures that we have invested in such products and may adversely affect our perceived competitive advantage in being an early advanced developer of compliant engines 

we rely on income from investees that we do not directly control 

our net income includes significant equity royalty and interest income from investees that we do not directly control for 2011 we recognized  416 million of equity royalty and interest income from investees compared to  351 million in 2010 the majority of our equity royalty and interest income from investees comes from our 12 unconsolidated north american distributors and from two of our joint ventures in china dongfeng cummins engine company ltd dcec and chongqing cummins engine company ltd ccec our equity ownership interests in our unconsolidated north american distributors generally range from 30 percent to 50 percent we have 50 percent equity ownership interests in dcec and ccec as a result although a significant percentage of our net income is derived from these unconsolidated entities we do not unilaterally control their management or operations which puts a substantial portion of our net income at risk from the actions or inactions of these other entities a significant reduction in the level of contribution by these entities to our net income would likely have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

our truck manufacturers and oem customers may not continue to outsource their engine supply needs 

several of our engine customers including paccar volvo ab and chrysler are truck manufacturers or oems that manufacture engines for some of their own products despite their own engine manufacturing abilities these customers have historically chosen to outsource certain types of engine production to us due to the quality of our engine products our emission capabilities our systems integration their customers preferences their desire for cost reductions their desire for eliminating production risks and their desire to maintain company focus however there can be no assurance that these customers will continue to outsource or outsource as much of their engine production in the future increased levels of oem vertical integration could result from a number of factors such as shifts in our customers business strategies acquisition by a customer of another engine manufacturer the inability of thirdparty suppliers to meet product specifications and the emergence of lowcost production opportunities in foreign countries any significant reduction in the level of engine production outsourcing from our truck manufacturer or oem customers could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

the discovery of any significant problems with our new engine platforms in north america could materially adversely impact our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

the environmental protection agency epa and california air resources board carb have certified all of our 2011 onhighway and offhighway engines which utilize selective catalytic reduction scr technology to meet requisite emission levels we introduced scr technology into our engine platforms in 2010 the effective performance of scr technology and the overall performance of these engine platforms impact a number of our operating segments and remain crucial to our success in north america while these 2010 engine platforms have performed well in the field the discovery of any significant problems in these platforms could result in recall campaigns increased warranty costs reputational risk and brand risk 

we are subject to currency exchange rate and other related risks 

we conduct operations in many areas of the world involving transactions denominated in a variety of currencies we are subject to currency exchange rate risk to the extent that our costs are denominated in currencies other than those in which we earn revenues in addition since our financial statements are denominated in us dollars changes in currency exchange rates between the us dollar and other currencies have had and will continue to have an impact on our results of operations while we customarily enter into financial transactions that attempt to address these risks there can be no assurance that currency exchange rate fluctuations will not adversely affect our results of operations financial condition and cash flows in addition while the use of currency hedging instruments may provide us with some protection from adverse fluctuations in currency exchange rates by utilizing these instruments we potentially forego the benefits that might result from favorable fluctuations in currency exchange rates 

we also face risks arising from the imposition of exchange controls and currency devaluations exchange controls may limit our ability to convert foreign currencies into us dollars or to remit dividends and other payments by our foreign subsidiaries or businesses located in or conducted within a country imposing controls currency devaluations result in a diminished value of funds denominated in the currency of the country instituting the devaluation 

another downturn in the north american and european automotive industries could adversely impact our business 

during the recession lower production levels for some of our key suppliers increases in certain raw material commodity and energy costs and the global credit market crisis resulted in severe financial distress among many companies within the automotive supply base a return to financial distress within the automotive industry and our shared supply base andor the subsequent bankruptcy of one or more automakers may lead to further supplier bankruptcies commercial disputes supply chain interruptions supplier requests for company sponsored capital support or a collapse of the supply chain 

we are vulnerable to supply shortages from singlesourced suppliers 

during 2011 we single sourced approximately 60 to 70 percent of the total types of parts in our product designs any delay in our suppliers deliveries may adversely affect our operations at multiple manufacturing locations forcing us to seek alternative supply sources to avoid serious disruptions delays may be caused by factors affecting our suppliers including capacity constraints labor disputes economic downturns availability of credit the impaired financial condition of a particular supplier suppliers allocations to other purchasers weather emergencies natural disasters or acts of war or terrorism any extended delay in receiving critical supplies could impair our ability to deliver products to our customers 

our products are exposed to variability in material and commodity costs 

our businesses establish prices with our customers in accordance with contractual time frames however the timing of material and commodity market price increases may prevent us from passing these additional costs on to our customers through timely pricing actions additionally higher material and commodity costs around the world may offset our efforts to reduce our cost structure while we customarily enter into financial transactions that attempt to address some of these risks notably with respect to copper platinum and palladium there can be no assurance that commodity price fluctuations will not adversely affect our results of operations financial condition or cash flows in addition while the use of commodity price hedging instruments may provide us with some protection from adverse fluctuations in commodity prices by utilizing these instruments we potentially forego the benefits that might result from favorable fluctuations in price as a result higher material and commodity costs as well as hedging these commodity costs during periods of decreasing prices could result in declining margins 

our products are subject to recall for performance or safetyrelated issues 

our products may be subject to recall for performance or safetyrelated issues product recalls subject us to harm to our reputation loss of current and future customers reduced revenue and product recall costs product recall costs are incurred when we decide either voluntarily or involuntarily to recall a product through a formal campaign to solicit the return of specific products due to a known or suspected performance issue any significant product recalls could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

we face significant competition in the markets we serve 

the markets in which we operate are highly competitive we compete worldwide with a number of other manufacturers and distributors that produce and sell similar products we primarily compete in the market with diesel engines and related diesel products however new technologies continue to be developed for gasoline and other technologies and we will continue to face new competition from these expanding technologies our products primarily compete on the basis of price performance fuel economy speed of delivery quality and customer support we also face competitors in some emerging markets who have established local practices and long standing relationships with participants in these markets there can be no assurance that our products will be able to compete successfully with the products of other companies and in other markets for a more complete discussion of the competitive environment in which each of our segments operates see operating segments in item 1 business 

increasing global competition among our customers may affect our existing customer relationships and restrict our ability to benefit from some of our customers growth 

as our customers in emerging markets continue to grow in size and scope they are increasingly seeking to export their products to other countries this has meant greater demand for our advanced engine technologies to help these customers meet the more stringent emissions requirements of developed markets as well as greater demand for access to our distribution systems for purposes of equipment servicing as these emerging market customers enter into and begin to compete in more developed markets they may increasingly begin to compete with our existing customers in these markets our further aid to emerging market customers could affect our relationships with developed market customers and as a result we may feel pressure to restrict some of our activities in areas of competition in addition to the extent the competition does not correspond to overall growth in demand we may see little or no benefit from this type of expansion by our emerging market customers 

we are exposed to political economic and other risks that arise from operating a multinational business 

approximately 59 percent of our net sales for 2011 were attributable to customers outside the us compared to 64 percent in 2010 accordingly our business is subject to the political economic and other risks that are inherent in operating in numerous countries these risks include 

• the difficulty of enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through foreign legal systems • trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements • the imposition of taxes on foreign income and tax rates in certain foreign countries that exceed those in the us • the imposition of tariffs exchange controls or other restrictions • difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations and the application of foreign labor regulations • required compliance with a variety of foreign laws and regulations and • changes in general economic and political conditions in countries where we operate particularly in emerging markets as we continue to operate our business globally our success will depend in part on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these and other related risks there can be no assurance that the consequences of these and other factors relating to our multinational operations will not have a material adverse effect upon us 

unanticipated changes in our effective tax rate the adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could adversely affect our profitability 

we are subject to income taxes in the us and numerous international jurisdictions our income tax provision and cash tax liability in the future could be adversely affected by changes in the distribution of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities changes in tax laws and the discovery of new information in the course of our tax return preparation process the carrying value of deferred tax assets which are predominantly in the us is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income in the us we are also subject to ongoing tax audits these audits can involve complex issues which may require an extended period of time to resolve and can be highly judgmental tax authorities may disagree with certain tax reporting positions taken by us and as a result assess additional taxes against us we regularly assess the likely outcomes of these audits in order to determine the appropriateness of our tax provision the amounts ultimately paid upon resolution of these or subsequent tax audits could be materially different from the amounts previously included in our income tax provision and therefore could have a material impact on our tax provision 

we are exposed to risks arising from the price and availability of energy 

the level of demand for our products and services is influenced in multiple ways by the price and availability of energy high energy costs generally drive greater demand for better fuel economy in almost all countries in which we operate some of our engine products have been developed with a primary purpose of offering fuel economy improvements and if energy costs decrease or increase less than expected demand for these products may likewise decrease the relative unavailability of electricity in some emerging market countries also influences demand for our electricity generating products such as our diesel generators if these countries add energy capacity by expanding their power grids at a rate equal to or faster than the growth in demand for energy the demand for our generating products could also decrease or increase less than would otherwise be the case 

we face reputational and legal risk from operations outside the us and affiliations with joint venture partners 

several of our foreign subsidiaries affiliates and joint venture partners are located outside the us with laws rules and business practices that differ from those of the us the activities of these entities may not comply with us laws or customs or our code of business conduct and actions by these entities may cause us legal or reputational risk if they violate applicable laws rules or business practices 

we face the challenge of increasing our capacity and ramping up our production at the appropriate pace 

we experience capacity constraints and longer lead times for certain products accurately forecasting our expected volumes and appropriately adjusting our capacity have been and will continue to be important factors in determining our results of operations we cannot guarantee that we will be able to increase manufacturing capacity to a level that meets demand for our products which could prevent us from meeting increased customer demand and could harm our business however if we overestimate our demand and overbuild our capacity we may have significantly underutilized assets and we may experience reduced margins if we do not accurately align our manufacturing capabilities with demand it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

our business is exposed to risks of product liability claims 

we face an inherent business risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that our products failure to perform to specification results or is alleged to result in property damage bodily injury andor death we may experience material product liability losses in the future while we maintain insurance coverage with respect to certain product liability claims we may not be able to obtain such insurance on acceptable terms in the future if at all and any such insurance may not provide adequate coverage against product liability claims in addition product liability claims can be expensive to defend and can divert the attention of management and other personnel for significant periods of time regardless of the ultimate outcome an unsuccessful defense of a significant product liability claim could have a material adverse effect upon us in addition even if we are successful in defending against a claim relating to our products claims of this nature could cause our customers to lose confidence in our products and us 

we may need to write off significant investments in our new north american lightduty diesel engine platform if customer commitments further deteriorate 

we began development of a north american lightduty diesel engine platform in july 2006 to be used in a variety of on and offhighway applications since that time and as of december 31 2011 we have capitalized investments of approximately 221 million market uncertainty due to the global recession resulted in some customers delaying or cancelling their vehicle programs while others remain active if customer expectations or volume projections further deteriorate from our current expected levels and we do not identify new customers we may need to recognize an impairment charge and write the assets down to net realizable value 

our operations are subject to increasingly stringent environmental laws and regulations 

our plants and operations are subject to increasingly stringent environmental laws and regulations in all of the countries in which we operate including laws and regulations governing air emission discharges to water and the generation handling storage transportation treatment and disposal of waste materials while we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with these environmental laws and regulations there can be no assurance that we will not be adversely impacted by costs liabilities or claims with respect to existing or subsequently acquired operations under either 

present laws and regulations or those that may be adopted or imposed in the future we are also subject to laws requiring the cleanup of contaminated property if a release of hazardous substances occurs at or from any of our current or former properties or at a landfill or another location where we have disposed of hazardous materials we may be held liable for the contamination and the amount of such liability could be material 

significant declines in future financial and stock market conditions could diminish our pension plan asset performance and adversely impact our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

we sponsor both funded and unfunded domestic and foreign defined benefit pension and other retirement plans our pension expense and the required contributions to our pension plans are directly affected by the value of plan assets the projected and actual rates of return on plan assets and the actuarial assumptions we use to measure our defined benefit pension plan obligations including the discount rate at which future projected and accumulated pension obligations are discounted to a present value we could experience increased pension expense due to a combination of factors including the decreased investment performance of pension plan assets decreases in the discount rate and changes in our assumptions relating to the expected return on plan assets 

significant declines in future financial and stock market conditions could cause material losses in our pension plan assets which could result in increased pension expense in future years and adverse changes to our financial condition depending upon the severity of market declines and government regulatory changes we may be legally obligated to make pension payments in the us and perhaps other countries and these contributions could be material 

we may be adversely impacted by work stoppages and other labor matters 

as of december 31 2011 we employed approximately 43900 persons worldwide approximately 15700 of our employees worldwide are represented by various unions under collective bargaining agreements that expire between 2012 and 2015 while we have no reason to believe that we will be materially impacted by work stoppages or other labor matters there can be no assurance that future issues with our labor unions will be resolved favorably or that we will not encounter future strikes work stoppages or other types of conflicts with labor unions or our employees any of these consequences may have an adverse effect on us or may limit our flexibility in dealing with our workforce in addition many of our customers and suppliers have unionized work forces work stoppages or slowdowns experienced by our customers or suppliers could result in slowdowns or closures that would have a material adverse effect on our operations 

our financial statements are subject to changes in accounting standards that could adversely impact our profitability or financial position 

our financial statements are subject to the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap which are periodically revised andor expanded accordingly from time to time we are required to adopt new or revised accounting standards issued by recognized authoritative bodies including the financial accounting standards board recently accounting standard setters issued new guidance which further interprets or seeks to revise accounting pronouncements related to revenue recognition and lease accounting as well as to issue new standards expanding disclosures the impact of accounting pronouncements that have been issued but not yet implemented is disclosed in our annual and quarterly reports on form 10k and form 10q an assessment of proposed standards is not provided as such proposals are subject to change through the exposure process and therefore their effects on our financial statements cannot be meaningfully assessed it is possible that future accounting standards we are required to adopt could change the current accounting treatment that we apply to our consolidated financial statements and that such changes could have a material adverse effect on the reported results of operations and financial position

we conduct significant business operations in brazil that are subject to the brazilian federal state and local labor social security tax and customs laws while we believe we comply with such laws they 

are complex subject to varying interpretations and we are often engaged in litigation regarding the application of these laws to particular circumstances

we are a global power leader that designs manufactures distributes and services diesel and natural gas engines and enginerelated component products including filtration exhaust aftertreatment fuel systems controls systems air handling systems and electric power generation systems we sell our products to original equipment manufacturers oems distributors and other customers worldwide we have longstanding relationships with many of the leading manufacturers in the markets we serve including paccar inc chrysler group llc daimler trucks north america man nutzfahrzeuge ag ford motor company komatsu volvo ab and case new holland we serve our customers through a network of more than 600 companyowned and independent distributor locations and approximately 6500 dealer locations in more than 190 countries and territories 

our reportable operating segments consist of the following engine components power generation and distribution this reporting structure is organized according to the products and markets each segment serves and allows management to focus its efforts on providing enhanced service to a wide range of customers the engine segment produces engines and parts for sale to customers in onhighway and various industrial markets our engines are used in trucks of all sizes buses and recreational vehicles as well as in various industrial applications including construction mining agriculture marine oil and gas rail and military equipment the components segment sells filtration products exhaust aftertreatment systems turbochargers and fuel systems the power generation segment is an integrated provider of power systems which sells engines generator sets and alternators the distribution segment includes whollyowned and partiallyowned distributorships engaged in wholesaling engines generator sets and service parts as well as performing service and repair activities on our products and maintaining relationships with various oems throughout the world 

our financial performance depends in large part on varying conditions in the markets we serve particularly the onhighway construction and general industrial markets demand in these markets tends to fluctuate in response to overall economic conditions and is particularly sensitive to changes in interest rate levels and our customers access to credit our sales may also be impacted by oem inventory levels and production schedules and stoppages economic downturns in markets we serve generally result in reductions in sales and pricing of our products as a worldwide business our operations are also affected by currency political economic and regulatory matters including adoption and enforcement of environmental and emission standards in the countries we serve as part of our growth strategy we invest in businesses in certain countries that carry high levels of these risks such as china brazil india mexico south africa russia and countries in the middle east at the same time our geographic diversity and broad product and service offerings have helped limit the impact from a drop in demand in any one industry or customer or the economy of any single country on our consolidated results 

in 2011 certain north american markets experienced robust recoveries especially the north american onhighway markets which was enhanced by the depletion of transition engine inventory purchased in 2009 in advance of the epas 2010 emission change demand for heavyduty onhighway products in north america was three times higher in 2011 compared to 2010 and mediumduty truck and bus shipments in north america were two times higher north american oil and gas markets and global mining markets also continued to experience strong growth in 2011 emerging markets continued to experience strong growth in 2011 especially in the international construction markets emerging market growth was particularly strong in china india and brazil although the growth rates began to soften in the second half of the year especially in the onhighway truck and offhighway construction markets in china and power generation markets in india growth rates are slowing in certain emerging markets like china and india as governments look to control inflation through tight monetary policies in the form of rising interest rates and tightening access to credit currently inflation concerns appear to be declining in china and there is a growing expectation that the government will start to ease monetary policy which would enhance our end markets inflation concerns in india also appear to be 

declining the european economy remains an uncertainty as we enter 2012 with continued volatility in the euro countries although we do not have any significant direct exposure to european sovereign debt we do generate approximately nine percent of our net sales from euro zone countries therefore continued economic decline in europe could have an adverse impact on our financial results

2012 outlook 

nearterm 

in 2011 north america experienced a robust recovery in demand in heavy medium and lightduty onhighway truck markets economies in emerging markets including china india and brazil experienced strong growth although demand began to soften in the second half of the year especially in onhighway truck and offhighway construction markets in china and power generation markets in india 

we currently expect the following positive trends in 2012 

• the north american onhighway truck markets are expected to remain strong • global oil and gas and mining markets are expected to remain strong • indias power generation markets are expected to improve and truck orders are expected to remain strong • brazil is expected to continue experiencing growth in the power generation business and is anticipating growth in the aftertreatment business as the result of the 2012 emissions change • components sales in brazil are expected to increase following the implementation of euro v emission regulations 35 

we currently expect the following challenges to our business that may reduce our earnings potential in 2012 

• in china and india demand in certain industrial markets could remain low in the first half of 2012 although improvements are expected in the second half of the year • our engine sales in brazil in 2012 could be negatively impacted by prebuy activity in the second half of 2011 ahead of the implementation of euro v emission regulations as well as one of our customers replacing our b67 engine with their own proprietary engine • demand in certain european markets could decline in 2012 • we will increase our investment in new product development • currency volatility could put pressure on earnings in 2012 longterm 

we believe that over the longer term there will be economic improvements in most of our current markets and that our opportunities for longterm profitable growth will continue in the future

2011 vs 2010 

sales 

engine segment sales increased in all businesses versus 2010 as demand improved in most markets including a significant rebound in north american onhighway markets improvements in international construction markets increased demand in global mining markets and significant increases in oil and gas markets the following are the primary drivers by market 

• heavyduty truck engine sales increased due to recovery in north american onhighway markets as oem customers replace their aging fleets and the depletion of transition engine inventory purchased in 2009 in advance of the epas 2010 emission standard changes • industrial market sales increased primarily due to a 26 percent improvement in international construction engine shipments driven by the economic recovery and infrastructure improvements in certain emerging markets increased demand in advance of offhighway emission regulations in the us and europe a 46 percent increase in units sold in the global mining engine markets due to increased coal and commodity demands and more than double the number of oil and gas engine shipments in north america • mediumduty truck and bus sales increased primarily due to the recovery in north american onhighway markets the depletion of transition engine inventory purchased in 2009 in advance of the epas 2010 emissions change and higher demand in the brazilian truck engine market driven by a growing economy total onhighwayrelated sales for 2011 were 56 percent of total engine segment sales compared to 50 percent in 2010 

segment ebit

the increase in gross margin versus 2010 was primarily due to higher volumes improved price realization and favorable mix partially offset by higher commodity costs and higher base warranty costs due to increased volumes and increasing mix of epa 2010 products although our warranty costs increased our warranty cost as a percentage of sales decreased as actual accrual rates for engines sold this year were generally lower than rates charged in prior years as our warranty costs for epa 2010 engines have been lower than expected the increases in selling general and administrative expenses and research development and engineering expenses were primarily due to new product development spending and increased headcount to support our strategic growth initiatives the increase in equity royalty and interest income from investees was primarily due to strong demand for power generation and mining products in china with ccec and strong export sales to russia and brazil in the midrange onhighway market with beijing foton cummins engine co ltd which was partially offset by lower sales at dcec due to weaker demand in the onhighway heavyduty and mediumduty truck market in china 

2010 vs 2009 

sales 

engine segment sales increased versus 2009 due to improved sales in most markets especially the industrial stationary power lightduty automotive and mediumduty truck markets which were partially offset by decreases in the north american heavyduty truck market the following are the primary drivers by market 

• industrial market sales increased primarily due to a 154 percent improvement in international construction engine shipments driven by the economic recovery and infrastructure investment in emerging markets and a 123 percent improvement in units sold in the international mining markets due to increased coal and commodity demands • stationary power engine sales increased primarily due to higher demand in power generation markets particularly for highhorse power engines • lightduty automotive sales increased significantly due to a 77 percent improvement in units sold to chrysler as the result of shutdowns in 2009 as part of its reorganization efforts • mediumduty truck engine sales increased due to a 78 percent increase in international units sold primarily due to higher demand in the brazilian truck market driven by a growing economy and government incentives these increases were partially offset by a decline in heavyduty truck engine sales consistent with prior emission standards changes north american includes the us and canada and excludes mexico unit sales declined 61 percent due to higher engine purchases by oems in late 2009 ahead of the environmental protection agencys epas 2010 emission standards change as part of the oems transition plan 

total onhighwayrelated sales for 2010 were 50 percent of total engine segment sales compared to 61 percent in 2009 

segment ebit 

engine segment ebit increased significantly versus 2009 primarily due to higher gross margin and equity royalty and interest income from investees which were partially offset by increased selling general and administrative expenses and research development and engineering expenses changes in engine segment ebit and ebit as a percentage of sales were as follows 



the increase in gross margin versus 2009 was primarily due to higher volumes improved price realization decreased warranty expense and cost structure improvements from actions taken in late 2008 and early 2009 partially offset by an unfavorable mix the increase in selling general and administrative expenses was primarily due to higher variable compensation which resulted from the segments strong performance equity royalty and interest income from investees increased in most 

unconsolidated joint ventures the increase was led by higher demand in emerging markets especially at dcec and komatsucummins engine company kcec

liquidity and capital resources 

managements assessment of liquidity 

our financial condition and liquidity continue to strengthen our solid balance sheet and credit ratings enable us to have ready access to credit 

we assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate adequate cash to fund our operating investing and financing activities we generate significant ongoing cash flow which has been used in part to fund repurchases of common stock capital expenditures and pay dividends on our common stock our cash flow from operations in 2011 more than doubled the 2010 cash flow from operations cash provided by operations is our principal source of liquidity as of december 31 2011 other sources of liquidity included 

• cash and cash equivalents of 15 billion of which approximately 32 percent was located in the us and 59 percent was located primarily in the uk china brazil and india 57 

• marketable securities of 277 million which were located primarily in india and brazil and the majority of which could be liquidated into cash within a few days • revolving credit facility with 12 billion available net of outstanding letters of credit • international and other domestic credit facilities with 300 million available and • accounts receivable sales program with 209 million available based on eligible receivables we believe our liquidity provides us with the financial flexibility needed to fund working capital capital expenditures projected pension obligations dividend payments common stock repurchases and debt service obligations 

our revolving credit agreement provides us with a 124 billion unsecured revolving credit facility the proceeds of which are to be used for our general corporate purposes see note 10 debt to our consolidated financial statements for further information the credit agreement includes two financial covenants a leverage ratio and an interest coverage ratio the required leverage ratio which measures the sum of total debt plus securitization financing to consolidated earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda for the four fiscal quarters may not exceed 30 to 1 at december 31 2011 our leverage ratio was 026 to 1 the required interest coverage ratio which is consolidated ebitda minus capital expenditures to consolidated interest expense in each case for the prior four quarters may not be less than 150 to 1 at december 31 2011 our interest coverage ratio was 5362 to 1 

a significant portion of our cash flows is generated outside the us as of december 31 2011 the total of cash cash equivalents and marketable securities held by foreign subsidiaries was 13 billion the vast majority of which was located in the uk china india brazil and singapore the geographic location of our cash and marketable securities aligns well with our business growth strategy we manage our worldwide cash requirements considering available funds among the many subsidiaries through which we conduct our business and the cost effectiveness with which those funds can be accessed as a result we do not anticipate any local liquidity restrictions to preclude us from funding our expansion or operating needs with local resources if the foreign cash balances were repatriated to the us we could be required to accrue and pay us taxes for earnings primarily from our uk domiciled subsidiaries as we have asserted that these earnings are permanently reinvested outside of the us at present we do not foresee an immediate need to repatriate any earnings from these subsidiaries in the near future however we do anticipate repatriating available cash from foreign subsidiaries to help fund us cash needs as they arise and we have transferred and will continue to transfer cash from these subsidiaries to the us and to other international subsidiaries when it is cost effective to do so earnings from our china operations will be considered permanently reinvested beginning in 2012 while earnings generated prior to 2012 for which us deferred tax liabilities have already been recorded will be repatriated in future years 

we continuously monitor our pension assets and believe that we have limited exposure to the european debt crisis no sovereign debt instruments of crisis countries are held in the trusts while any equities are held with large welldiversified multinational firms or are de minimis amounts in large index funds in addition we rebalanced our asset portfolios in the us and the uk in 2010 with equities representing a smaller segment of the total portfolios and we continue to rebalance as necessary to maintain our target range our pension plans have not experienced any significant impact on liquidity or counterparty exposure due to the volatility in the credit markets 

the maturity schedule of our existing longterm debt does not require significant cash outflows in the intermediate term required annual principal payments range from 17 million to 97 million over each of the next five years 

working capital summary 

we fund our working capital with cash from operations and shortterm borrowings when necessary various assets and liabilities including shortterm debt can fluctuate significantly from month to month depending on shortterm liquidity needs as a result working capital is a prime focus of management attention 



current assets increased 13 percent primarily due to an increase in cash and cash equivalents an increase in accounts receivable due to higher sales and an increase in inventory levels to meet anticipated demand despite the increases in accounts receivable and inventories we were able to lower days sales in receivables in a challenging environment by 11 days through improved collections and we increased our inventory turns by 05 through higher demand 

current liabilities increased 12 percent primarily due to higher accounts and loans payable increased taxes payable due to higher income and higher other accrued expenses which was the result of increased purchasing requirements to support higher sales volume in the businesses 

cash flows 

cash and cash equivalents increased 461 million during the year ended december 31 2011 compared to a 93 million increase in cash and cash equivalents during the comparable period in 2010 the change in cash and cash equivalents was as follows 

operating activities 



2011 vs 2010 

net cash provided by operating activities increased versus 2010 primarily due to significantly higher consolidated net income excluding the gain on the sale of certain assets and liabilities of our exhaust business and our lightduty filtration business as a result of higher sales volumes higher dividends from equity investees and favorable working capital fluctuations during 2011 the net increase in working capital resulted in a cash outflow of 154 million compared to a cash outflow of 245 million in 2010 this decrease of 91 million was primarily driven by a smaller increase in inventory in 2011 as we significantly increased inventory levels in 2010 to meet anticipated postrecession demand 

pensions 

the funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon a variety of variables and assumptions including return on invested assets market interest rates and levels of voluntary contributions to the 

plans in the second half of 2011 financial markets in europe declined significantly reversing the prior quarters gains in our uk trust investments while the us trusts liability driven fixed income investments were able to maintain the return trends from the first half of the year as a result for 2011 the return for our us plan was 13 percent while our uk plan return was approximately six percent our uk pension plan remains in an over funded position approximately 94 percent of our pension plan assets are invested in highly liquid investments such as equity and fixed income securities the remaining six percent of our plan assets are invested in less liquid but market valued investments including real estate and private equity we made 199 million of pension contributions in 2011 including voluntary contributions of 108 million we anticipate making total contributions of 130 million to our defined benefit pension plans in 2012 expected contributions to our defined benefit pension plans in 2012 will meet or exceed the current funding requirements 

2010 vs 2009 

net cash provided by operating activities decreased versus 2009 primarily due to significantly higher inventory levels to meet anticipated demand increased equity in income of investees net of dividends and higher pension contributions made in the year this was partially offset by significantly higher consolidated net income and increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses as the result of increased purchasing to support higher sales volumes 

investing activities 



2011 vs 2010 

net cash used in investing activities decreased versus 2010 primarily due to proceeds received from the sale of certain assets and liabilities of our exhaust business and our lightduty filtration business see note 2 divestitures and acquisitions to our consolidated financial statements  decreased acquisitions and increased liquidations of marketable securities the acquisition of cwc in 2010 and decreased purchases of other investments these drivers were partially offset by increased capital expenditures additional investments in and advances to equity investees and lower proceeds from dispositions of property plant and equipment 

capital expenditures were 622 million compared to 364 million in the comparable period in 2010 we continue to invest in the development of new products and we plan to spend approximately 

800 million to 850 million in 2012 as we continue with product launches and facility improvements and prepare for future emission standards approximately 50 percent of our capital expenditures will be invested outside of the us in 2012 

2010 vs 2009 

net cash used in investing activities increased versus 2009 primarily due to acquisitions see note 2 divestitures and acquisitions to our consolidated financial statements  higher capital expenditures and increased investments in marketable securities which were partially offset by higher proceeds from the disposal of property plant and equipment capital expenditures were 364 million compared to 310 million in 2009 

financing activities 



2011 vs 2010 

net cash used in financing activities increased versus 2010 primarily due to significantly higher repurchases of common stock increased payments on borrowings and capital lease obligations decreased proceeds from borrowings and higher dividend payments 

our total debt was 783 million as of december 31 2011 compared with 843 million as of december 31 2010 total debt as a percent of our total capital including total longterm debt was 118 percent at december 31 2011 compared with 144 percent at december 31 2010 

2010 vs 2009 

net cash used in financing activities increased versus 2009 primarily due to increased repurchases of common stock which was partially offset by higher proceeds from borrowings primarily related to the acquisition of cwc and borrowings in brazil 

our total debt was 843 million as of december 31 2010 compared with 703 million at december 31 2009 total debt as a percent of our total capital including total longterm debt was 144 percent at december 31 2010 compared to 149 percent at december 31 2009 the increase in total debt was principally due to acquisitions and borrowings in brazil which were subsequently invested in marketable securities 

repurchase of common stock

repurchases under this plan by year were as follows 



in february 2011 the board of directors approved a new share repurchase program and authorized the acquisition of up to 1 billion of our common stock upon completion of the 500 million program in 2011 we made the following quarterly purchases under the repurchase programs as indicated 



quarterly dividends

total dividends paid to common shareholders in 2011 2010 and 2009 were 255 million 172 million and 141 million respectively declaration and payment of dividends in the future 

depends upon our income and liquidity position among other factors and is subject to declaration by our board of directors who meet quarterly to consider our dividend payment we expect to fund dividend payments with cash from operations 

credit ratings 

a number of our contractual obligations and financing agreements such as our revolving credit facility have restrictive covenants andor pricing modifications that may be triggered in the event of downward revisions to our corporate credit rating there were no downgrades of our credit ratings in 2011 in september 2011 standard  poors rating services upgraded our rating to a and changed our outlook to stable in june 2011 fitch ratings upgraded our rating and changed our outlook to stable in november 2011 fitch ratings affirmed our rating and revised our outlook to positive in november 2011 moodys investors service inc raised our rating to baa1 and changed our outlook to positive 

credit ratings are not recommendations to buy are subject to change and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating in addition we undertake no obligation to update disclosures concerning our credit ratings whether as a result of new information future events or otherwise our ratings and outlook from each of the credit rating agencies as of the date of filing are shown in the table below 



contractual obligations and other commercial commitments 

a summary of payments due for our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december 31 2011 is shown in the tables below 



1 includes principal payments and expected interest payments based on the terms of the obligations 2 we are contractually obligated in the uk to fund 62 million per year from 2013 to 2015 however our expected total pension contributions for 2012 is approximately 130 million 

the contractual obligations reported above exclude our unrecognized tax benefits of 86 million as of december 31 2011 we are not able to reasonably estimate the period in which cash outflows relating to uncertain tax contingencies could occur see note 4 income taxes to the consolidated financial statements for further details 

our other commercial commitments as of december 31 2011 are as follows 



application of critical accounting estimates 

a summary of our significant accounting policies is included in note 1 summary of significant accounting policies of our consolidated financial statements which discusses accounting policies that we have selected from acceptable alternatives 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap which often requires management to make judgments estimates and assumptions regarding uncertainties that affect the reported amounts presented and disclosed in the financial statements management reviews these estimates and assumptions based on historical experience changes in business conditions and other relevant factors they believe to be reasonable under the circumstances in any given reporting period our actual results may differ from the estimates and assumptions used in preparing our consolidated financial statements 

critical accounting estimates are defined as follows the estimate requires management to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the estimate was made different estimates reasonably could have been used or if changes in the estimate are reasonably likely to occur from period to period and the change would have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations our senior management has discussed the development and selection of our accounting policies related accounting estimates and the disclosures set forth below with the audit committee of our board of directors we believe our critical accounting estimates include those addressing the estimation of liabilities for warranty programs recoverability of investment related to new products accounting for income taxes and pension benefits 

warranty programs 

we estimate and record a liability for base warranty programs at the time our products are sold our estimates are based on historical experience and reflect managements best estimates of expected costs at the time products are sold and subsequent adjustment to those expected costs when actual costs differ as a result of the uncertainty surrounding the nature and frequency of product recall programs the liability for such programs is recorded when we commit to a recall action or when a recall becomes probable and estimable which generally occurs when it is announced our warranty liability is generally affected by component failure rates repair costs and the point of failure within the product life cycle future events and circumstances related to these factors could materially change our estimates and require adjustments to our liability new product launches require a greater use of judgment in developing estimates until historical experience becomes available product specific experience is typically available four or five quarters after product launch with a clear experience trend evident eight quarters after launch we generally record warranty expense for new products upon shipment using a preceding products warranty history and a multiplicative factor based upon preceding similar product experience and new product assessment until sufficient new product data is available for warranty estimation we then use a blend of actual new product experience and preceding product 

historical experience for several subsequent quarters and new product specific experience thereafter note 11 product warranty liability to our consolidated financial statements contains a summary of the activity in our warranty liability account for 2011 and 2010 including adjustments to preexisting warranties 

recoverability of investment related to new products 

at december 31 2011 we have capitalized 221 million associated with the future launch of our lightduty diesel engine product development of this product began in 2006 market uncertainty related to the global recession that began in 2008 resulted in some customers delaying or cancelling their vehicle programs at december 31 2009 we reviewed our investment of 216 million for possible impairment we used projections to assess whether future cash flows on an undiscounted basis related to the assets are likely to exceed the related carrying amount to determine if a writedown is appropriate these projections required estimates about product volume and the size of the market for vehicles that are not yet developed we used input from our customers in developing alternative cash flow scenarios our analysis indicated that the assets were recoverable customers that are expected to purchase sufficient quantities to recover our investment in the lightduty diesel engine products remained active with the development of this product through 2011 and there were no significant changes to the assumptions used in 2009 if customer expectations or projected volumes deteriorate and we do not identify alternative customers andor product applications we could be required to writedown these assets to net realizable value 

accounting for income taxes 

we determine our income tax expense using the asset and liability method under this method deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax effects of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases future tax benefits of tax loss and credit carryforwards are also recognized as deferred tax assets we evaluate the recoverability of our deferred tax assets each quarter by assessing the likelihood of future profitability and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize our net deferred tax assets at december 31 2011 we recorded net deferred tax assets of 417 million these assets included 128 million for the value of tax loss and credit carryforwards a valuation allowance of 71 million was recorded to reduce the tax assets to the net value management believed was more likely than not to be realized in the event our operating performance deteriorates future assessments could conclude that a larger valuation allowance will be needed to further reduce the deferred tax assets in addition we operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and are subject to tax audits in these jurisdictions these audits can involve complex issues which may require an extended period of time to resolve we reduce our net tax assets for the estimated additional tax and interest that may result from tax authorities disputing uncertain tax positions we have taken and we believe we have made adequate provision for income taxes for all years that are subject to audit based upon the latest information available a more complete description of our income taxes and the future benefits of our tax loss and credit carryforwards is disclosed in note 4 income taxes to our consolidated financial statements  

pension benefits 

we sponsor a number of pension plans primarily in the us and the uk and to a lesser degree in various other countries in the us and the uk we have several major defined benefit plans that are separately funded we account for our pension programs in accordance with employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans under gaap gaap requires that amounts recognized in financial statements be determined using an actuarial basis as a result our pension benefit programs are based on a number of statistical and judgmental assumptions that attempt to 

anticipate future events and are used in calculating the expense and liability related to our plans each year at december 31 these assumptions include discount rates used to value liabilities assumed rates of return on plan assets future compensation increases employee turnover rates actuarial assumptions relating to retirement age mortality rates and participant withdrawals the actuarial assumptions we use may differ significantly from actual results due to changing economic conditions participant life span and withdrawal rates these differences may result in a material impact to the amount of net periodic pension expense to be recorded in our consolidated financial statements in the future 

the expected longterm return on plan assets is used in calculating the net periodic pension expense we considered several factors in developing our expected rate of return on plan assets the longterm rate of return considers historical returns and expected returns on current and projected asset allocations and is generally applied to a 5year average market value of return projected returns are based primarily on broad publicly traded equity and fixed income indices and forwardlooking estimates of active portfolio and investment management as of december 31 2011 based upon our target asset allocations it is anticipated that our us investment policy will generate an average annual return over the 10year projection period equal to or in excess of 75 percent approximately 50 percent of the time while returns of 100 percent or greater are anticipated 25 percent of the time we expect additional positive returns from active investment management the 2011 one year return was 13 percent combined with the very favorable returns in 2010 has eliminated the significant deterioration in pension assets experienced in 2008 as a result of the credit crisis and related market recession based on the historical returns and forwardlooking return expectations we believe an investment return assumption of 80 percent per year in 2012 for us pension assets is reasonable the methodology used to determine the rate of return on pension plan assets in the uk was based on establishing an equityrisk premium over current longterm bond yields adjusted based on target asset allocations as of december 31 2011 based upon our target asset allocations it is anticipated that our uk investment policy will generate an average annual return over the 20year projection period equal to or in excess of 60 percent approximately 50 percent of the time while returns of 69 percent or greater are anticipated 25 percent of the time we expect additional positive returns from active investment management the one year return for our uk plan was approximately six percent for 2011 and similar to our us plan the 2008 market related deterioration in our plan assets has been eliminated our strategy with respect to our investments in pension plan assets is to be invested with a longterm outlook therefore the risk and return balance of our asset portfolio should reflect a longterm horizon based on the historical returns and forwardlooking return expectations we believe an investment return assumption of 65 percent in 2012 for uk pension assets is reasonable our pension plan asset allocation at december 31 2011 and 2010 and target allocation for 2012 are as follows 



the differences between the actual return on plan assets and expected longterm return on plan assets are recognized in the asset value used to calculate net periodic expense over five years the table below sets forth the expected return assumptions used to develop our pension expense for the period 20092011 and our expected rate for 2012 



a lower expected rate of return will increase our net periodic pension expense and reduce profitability 

gaap for pensions offers various acceptable alternatives to account for the differences that eventually arise between the estimates used in the actuarial valuations and the actual results it is acceptable to delay or immediately recognize these differences under the delayed recognition alternative changes in pension obligation including those resulting from plan amendments and changes in the value of assets set aside to meet those obligation are not recognized in net periodic pension cost as they occur but are recognized initially in comprehensive income and subsequently amortized as components of net periodic pension cost systematically and gradually over future periods in addition to this approach gaap also allows immediate recognition of gains or losses immediate recognition introduces volatility in financial results we have chosen to delay recognition and amortize actuarial differences over future periods if we adopted the immediate recognition approach we would record a loss of 1003 million 669 million aftertax for our us and uk pension plans 

the difference between the expected return and the actual return on plan assets is deferred from recognition in our results of operations and under certain circumstances such as when the difference exceeds 10 percent of the market value of plan assets or the projected benefit obligation pbo amortized over future years of service this is also true of changes to actuarial assumptions as of december 31 2011 we had net pension actuarial losses of 700 million and 305 million for the us and nonus pension plans respectively under gaap the actuarial gains and losses are recognized and recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss increases in actuarial losses decreased our shareholders equity by 96 million aftertax in 2011 the increases were due to liability losses from reduced discount rates partially offset by improved us plan asset performance in 2011 as these amounts exceed 10 percent of our pbo the excess is amortized over the average remaining service lives of participating employees 

the table below sets forth the net periodic pension expense for the period 2009 through 2011 and our expected expense for 2012 



we expect 2012 pension expense to be approximately the same as 2011 the favorable impacts of investment returns and higher asset values are offset by higher service cost due to increased headcount and a decrease in discount rate the decrease in periodic pension expense in 2011 was due to improved returns on assets as the capital markets began to recover strong contributions in 2010 and the absence of any curtailment charges the decrease in periodic pension expense in 2010 was due to improved returns on assets as the capital markets began to recover strong contributions in 2009 and the absence of any curtailment charges another key assumption used in the development of the net 

periodic pension expense is the discount rate the weighted average discount rates used to develop our net periodic pension expense are set forth in the table below 



changes in the discount rate assumptions will impact the interest cost component of the net periodic pension expense calculation 

the discount rate enables us to state expected future cash payments for benefits as a present value on the measurement date the guidelines for setting this rate are discussed in gaap which suggests the use of a highquality corporate bond rate we used bond information provided by moodys investor service inc standard  poors rating services fitch ratings and dominion bond rating all bonds used to develop our hypothetical portfolio in the us and uk were highquality noncallable bonds aa or better as of december 31 2011 by at least two of the bond rating agencies the average yield of this hypothetical bond portfolio was used as the benchmark for determining the discount rate to be used to value the obligations of the plans subject to gaap for pensions and other postretirement benefits 

our model called for 80 years of benefit payments for the us plans and 60 years of payments for the uk for both countries our model matches the present value of the plans projected benefit payments to the market value of the theoretical settlement bond portfolio a single equivalent discount rate is determined to align the present value of the required cash flow with the value of the bond portfolio the resulting discount rate is reflective of both the current interest rate environment and the plans distinct liability characteristics 

the table below sets forth the estimated impact on our 2012 net periodic pension expense relative to a change in the discount rate and a change in the expected rate of return on plan assets 



the above sensitivities reflect the impact of changing one assumption at a time a higher discount rate decreases the plan obligations and decreases our net periodic pension expense a lower discount rate increases the plan obligations and increases our net periodic pension expense it should be noted that economic factors and conditions often affect multiple assumptions simultaneously and the effects of changes in key assumptions are not necessarily linear

recently adopted and recently issued accounting pronouncements 

accounting pronouncements recently adopted 

in september 2011 the financial accounting standards board fasb amended its standards related to the testing of goodwill for impairment the objective of this amendment is to simplify the annual goodwill impairment evaluation process the amendment provides entities the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the twostep goodwill impairment test the twostep impairment test is now only required if an entity determines through this qualitative analysis that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value the new rules become effective during interim and annual periods beginning after december 15 2011 however entities are permitted to early adopt the standard we elected to early adopt the standard and applied the qualitative analysis to certain reporting units in our 2011 goodwill impairment testing process because the measurement of a potential impairment loss has not changed the standard did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements  

in october 2009 the fasb amended its rules regarding the accounting for multiple element revenue arrangements the objective of the amendment is to allow vendors to account for revenue for different deliverables separately as opposed to part of a combined unit when those deliverables are provided at different times specifically this amendment addresses how to separate deliverables and simplifies the process of allocating revenue to the different deliverables when more than one deliverable exists the new rules were effective for us beginning january 1 2011 this amendment did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements as multiple element arrangements are not material to our business 

in june 2009 the fasb amended its existing standards related to the consolidation of variable interest entities which was effective for interim and annual fiscal periods beginning after november 15 2009 the new standard requires entities to analyze whether their variable interests give it a controlling financial interest of a variable interest entity vie and outlines what defines a primary beneficiary the new standard amends gaap by a changing certain rules for determining whether an entity is a vie b replacing the quantitative approach previously required for determining the primary beneficiary with a more qualitative approach and c requiring entities to continuously analyze whether they are the primary beneficiary of a vie among other amendments the new standard also requires enhanced disclosures regarding an entitys involvement in a vie the only significant impact of the adoption of this standard was to deconsolidate cummins komatsu engine corporation ckec as of january 1 2010 and to account for ckec under gaap for equity method investees ckec is an engine manufacturing entity jointly owned and operated by us and our equity partner prior to january 1 2010 we were deemed the primary beneficiary of this vie due to the pricing arrangements of purchases and the substantial volume of purchases we made from the vie the impact of the deconsolidation on our consolidated statements of income was minimal as all sales were eliminated in consolidation in the past the most significant impacts on our consolidated balance sheets were to decrease current assets by 9 million decrease longterm assets by 10 million increase investments and advances related to equity method investees by 11 million and decrease noncontrolling interest by 11 million in 2010 

accounting pronouncements issued but not yet effective 

in december 2011 the fasb amended its standards related to offsetting assets and liabilities this amendment requires entities to disclose both gross and net information about instruments and transactions eligible for offset in the statement of financial position and instruments and transactions subject to an agreement similar to a master netting agreement this information will enable users of 

the financial statements to understand the effect of those arrangements on its financial position the new rules will become effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after january 1 2013 and interim periods within those annual periods it is also required that the new disclosures are applied retrospectively for all comparative periods presented we do not believe this amendment will have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements  however we are currently evaluating the potential impacts to our footnote disclosures 

in june 2011 the fasb amended its rules regarding the presentation of comprehensive income the objective of this amendment is to improve the comparability consistency and transparency of financial reporting and to increase the prominence of items reported in other comprehensive income specifically this amendment requires that all nonowner changes in shareholders equity be presented either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements in addition the standard also requires disclosure of the location of reclassification adjustments between other comprehensive income and net income on the face of the financial statements the new rules are scheduled to become effective during interim and annual periods beginning after december 15 2011 in december 2011 the fasb deferred certain aspects of this standard beyond the current effective date specifically the provisions dealing with reclassification adjustments because the standard only impacts the display of comprehensive income and does not impact what is included in comprehensive income the standard will not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements  

in may 2011 the fasb amended its standards related to fair value measurements and disclosures the objective of the amendment is to improve the comparability of fair value measurements presented and disclosed in financial statements prepared in accordance with us gaap and international financial reporting standards primarily this amendment changed the wording used to describe many of the requirements in us gaap for measuring fair value and for disclosing information about fair value measurements in addition to clarifying the boards intent about the application of existing fair value measurement requirements the new standard also requires additional disclosures related to fair value measurements categorized within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy and requires disclosure of the categorization in the hierarchy for items which are not recorded at fair value but fair value is required to be disclosed the new rules will become effective during interim and annual periods beginning after december 15 2011 as of december 31 2011 we had no fair value measurements categorized within level 3 the only impact for us is expected to be the disclosure of the categorization in the fair value hierarchy for those items where fair value is only disclosed primarily our debt obligations 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to financial risk resulting from volatility in foreign exchange rates commodity prices and interest rates this risk is closely monitored and managed through the use of financial derivative instruments including foreign currency forward contracts commodity swap contracts and interest rate swaps as stated in our policies and procedures financial derivatives are used expressly for hedging purposes and under no circumstances are they used for speculative purposes when material we adjust the value of our derivative contracts for counterparty or our credit risk 

further information regarding financial instruments and risk management is contained in note 20 derivatives to our consolidated financial statements  

the following describes our risk exposures and provides results of sensitivity analysis performed as of december 31 2011 the sensitivity analysis assumes instantaneous parallel shifts in foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices 

foreign exchange rates 

as a result of our international business presence we are exposed to foreign currency exchange risks we transact business in foreign currencies and as a result our income experiences some volatility related to movements in foreign currency exchange rates to help manage our exposure to exchange rate volatility we use foreign exchange forward contracts on a regular basis to hedge forecasted intercompany and thirdparty sales and purchases denominated in nonfunctional currencies our internal policy allows for managing anticipated foreign currency cash flows for up to one year these foreign currency forward contracts are designated and qualify as foreign currency cash flow hedges under gaap the effective portion of the unrealized gain or loss on the forward contract is deferred and reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss aocl when the hedged forecasted transaction sale or purchase occurs the unrealized gain or loss is reclassified into income in the same line item associated with the hedged transaction in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects income the ineffective portion of the hedge unrealized gain or loss if any is recognized in current income during the period of change as of december 31 2011 the amount we expect to reclassify from aocl to income over the next year is an unrealized net loss of 6 million for the years ended december 31 2011 and 2010 there were no circumstances that would have resulted in the discontinuance of a foreign currency cash flow hedge 

to minimize the income volatility resulting from the remeasurement of net monetary assets and payables denominated in a currency other than the functional currency we enter into foreign currency forward contracts which are considered economic hedges the objective is to offset the gain or loss from remeasurement with the gain or loss from the fair market valuation of the forward contract these derivative instruments are not designated as hedges under gaap 

as of december 31 2011 the potential gain or loss in the fair value of our outstanding foreign currency contracts assuming a hypothetical 10 percent fluctuation in the currencies of such contracts would be approximately 67 million the sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates assumes the notional value to remain constant for the next 12 months the analysis ignores the impact of foreign exchange movements on our competitive position and potential changes in sales levels it should be noted that any change in the value of the contracts real or hypothetical would be significantly offset by an inverse change in the value of the underlying hedged items see note 20 derivatives to our consolidated financial statements  

interest rate risk 

we are exposed to market risk from fluctuations in interest rates we manage our exposure to interest rate fluctuations through the use of interest rate swaps the objective of the swaps is to more effectively balance our borrowing costs and interest rate risk 

in november 2005 we entered into an interest rate swap to effectively convert our 250 million debt issue due in 2028 from a fixed rate of 7125 percent to a floating rate based on a libor spread the terms of the swap mirror those of the debt with interest paid semiannually this swap qualifies as a fair value hedge under gaap the gain or loss on this derivative instrument as well as the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in current income as interest expense the following table summarizes these gains and losses for the years presented below 



commodity price risk 

we are exposed to fluctuations in commodity prices due to contractual agreements with component suppliers in order to protect ourselves against future price volatility and consequently fluctuations in gross margins we periodically enter into commodity swap contracts with designated banks to fix the cost of certain raw material purchases with the objective of minimizing changes in inventory cost due to market price fluctuations certain commodity swap contracts are derivative contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges under gaap we also have commodity swap contracts that represent an economic hedge however do not qualify for hedge accounting and are marked to market through earnings for those contracts that qualify for hedge accounting the effective portion of the unrealized gain or loss is deferred and reported as a component of aocl when the hedged forecasted transaction purchase occurs the unrealized gain or loss is reclassified into income in the same line item associated with the hedged transaction in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects income the ineffective portion of the hedge if any is recognized in current income in the period in which the ineffectiveness occurs as of december 31 2011 we expect to reclassify an unrealized net loss of 11 million from aocl to income over the next year our internal policy allows for managing these cash flow hedges for up to three years 

as of december 31 2011 the potential gain or loss related to the outstanding commodity swap contracts assuming a hypothetical 10 percent fluctuation in the price of such commodities was 13 million the sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in commodity prices assumes the notional value to remain constant for the next 12 months the analysis ignores the impact of commodity price movements on our competitive position and potential changes in sales levels it should be noted that any change in the value of the swap contracts real or hypothetical would be significantly offset by an inverse change in the value of the underlying hedged items see note 20 derivatives to the consolidated financial statements

supply 

we source our materials and manufactured components from leading suppliers both domestically and internationally we machine and assemble some of the components used in our engines and power generation units including blocks heads turbochargers connecting rods camshafts crankshafts filters exhaust systems alternators and fuel systems we single source approximately 60 to 70 percent of the total types of parts in our product designs we have longterm agreements with critical suppliers to assure the right capacity delivery and quality although we elect to source a relatively high proportion of our total raw materials and component requirements from sole suppliers we have established a process to annually review our sourcing strategies with a focus on the reduction of risk which has led us to dual source critical components where possible we are also developing suppliers in many global or emerging markets to serve our businesses across the globe and provide alternative sources in the event of disruption from existing suppliers 

patents and trademarks 

we own or control a significant number of patents and trademarks relating to the products we manufacture these patents and trademarks were granted and registered over a period of years although these patents and trademarks are generally considered beneficial to our operations we do not believe any patent group of patents or trademark other than our leading brand house trademarks is considered significant to our business 

seasonality 

while individual product lines may experience modest seasonal declines in production there is no material effect on the demand for the majority of our products on a quarterly basis with the exception that our power generation segment normally experiences seasonal declines in the first quarter due to general declines in construction spending during this period and our distribution segment normally experiences seasonal declines in first quarter business activity due to holiday periods in asia and australia 

largest customers 

we have thousands of customers around the world and have developed longstanding business relationships with many of them we have longterm heavyduty engine supply agreements with paccar and volvo trucks north america we have midrange supply agreements with paccar as 

its exclusive engine supplier as well as with daimler trucks north america formerly freightliner llc ford and man formerly volkswagen we also have an agreement with chrysler for supplying the engine for use in dodge ram trucks in our offhighway markets cummins has various engine and component supply agreements ranging across our midrange and highhorsepower businesses with komatsu ltd as well as various joint ventures and other license agreements in our engine component and distribution segments collectively our net sales to these seven customers was approximately 25 percent of consolidated net sales in 2010 compared to approximately 23 percent in 2009 and 22 percent in 2008 and individually was less than eight percent of consolidated net sales to any single customer in 2010 compared to less than nine percent and less than eight percent in 2009 and 2008 respectively these agreements contain standard purchase and sale agreement terms covering engine and engine parts pricing quality and delivery commitments as well as engineering product support obligations the basic nature of our agreements with oem customers is that they are longterm price and operations agreements that assure the availability of our products to each customer through the duration of the respective agreements agreements with most oems contain bilateral termination provisions giving either party the right to terminate in the event of a material breach change of control or insolvency or bankruptcy of the other party 

backlog 

as a result of the improving economy in 2010 our lead times increased from their lower levels during the recession while we have supply agreements with some truck and offhighway equipment oems most of our business is transacted through open purchase orders these open orders are historically subject to monthtomonth releases and are subject to cancellation on reasonable notice without cancellation charges and therefore are not considered firm 

research and development expense 

our research and development program is focused on product improvements innovations and cost reductions for our customers we expense research and development expenditures net of contract reimbursements when incurred research and development expenses net of contract reimbursements were 402 million in 2010 362 million in 2009 and 422 million in 2008 contract reimbursements were 68 million in 2010 92 million in 2009 and 61 million in 2008 

for 2010 2009 and 2008 approximately 38 million 151 million and 116 million or 9 percent 42 percent and 27 percent respectively were directly related to compliance with 2010 environmental protection agency epa emission standards for 2010 approximately 36 million or 9 percent was directly related to compliance with 2013 epa emission standards in 2010 we increased research development and engineering expenses as we continued to invest in future critical technologies and products we will continue to make investments to improve our current technologies to continue to meet the future emission requirements around the world and improve fuel economy 

environmental compliance 

sustainability 

we continue to be a leader in sustainable business development and practices we have invested significantly in new products and technologies designed to further lower emission and increase fuel efficiency from our products we have increased our commitment to addressing the global impact of climate change through the structured approach of our 10 climate change principles developed last year that address ways we are becoming a greater part of the solution we have worked collaboratively with customers to improve their fuel economy and reduce their carbon footprint we have significantly reduced greenhouse gas ghg emission from our facilities through a strong energy efficiency program and we met our publically stated goal of 25 percent intensity reduction after complete 2010 goalyear 

environmental data was verified we have taken leadership positions on climate change by articulating our positions on key public policy issues surrounding climate change for the sixth consecutive year we were named to the dow jones world sustainability index which recognizes the top 10 percent of the worlds largest 2500 companies in economic environmental and social leadership our sustainability report for 2010 is available on our website at wwwcumminscom 

product environmental compliance 

our engines are subject to extensive statutory and regulatory requirements that directly or indirectly impose standards governing emission and noise our products comply with all current emission standards that the epa the california air resources board carb and other state and international regulatory agencies have established for heavyduty onhighway diesel and gas engines and offhighway engines our ability to comply with these and future emission standards is an essential element in maintaining our leadership position in regulated markets we have made and will continue to make significant capital and research expenditures to comply with these standards failure to comply with these standards could result in adverse effects on our future financial results 

epa engine certifications 

the current onhighway emission standards came into effect in the us on january 1 2010 to meet the 2010 us epa heavyduty onhighway emission standards we used an evolution of our proven 2007 technology solution to maintain power and torque with substantial fuel economy improvement and maintenance intervals comparable with our 2007 compliant engines we offer a complete lineup of onhighway engines to meet the nearzero emission standards midrange and heavyduty engines for epa 2010 require nitrogen oxide nox aftertreatment nox reduction is achieved by an integrated technology solution comprised of the xpi high pressure common rail fuel system selective catalytic reduction scr technology nextgeneration cooled exhaust gas recirculation egr advanced electronic controls proven air handling and the cummins particulate filter the epa and carb have certified that our engines meet the 2010 emission requirements emission standards in international markets including europe japan mexico australia brazil india and china are becoming more stringent we believe that our experience in meeting us emission standards leaves us well positioned to take advantage of opportunities in these markets as the need for emission control capability grows 

federal and california regulations require manufacturers to report failures of emissionrelated components to the epa and carb when the failure rate reaches a specified level at higher failure rates a product recall may be required in 2010 we submitted eleven reports to the epa relating to software corrections in the engine control module and to the exhaust aftertreatment system the software corrections related to the engine control module and exhaust aftertreatment system necessitated the campaigns of approximately 11400 and 6310 engines respectively 

other environmental statutes and regulations 

expenditures for environmental control activities and environmental remediation projects at our facilities in the us have not been a substantial portion of our annual capital outlays and are not expected to be material in 2011 except as follows we believe we are in compliance in all material respects with laws and regulations applicable to our plants and operations 

in the us pursuant to notices received from federal and state agencies andor defendant parties in site environmental contribution actions we have been identified as a potentially responsible party prp under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of 1980 as amended or similar state laws at approximately 20 waste disposal sites based upon our experiences at similar sites we believe that our aggregate future remediation costs will not be significant we have 

established accruals that we believe are adequate for our expected future liability with respect to these sites 

in addition we have four other sites where we are working with governmental authorities on remediation projects the costs for these remediation projects are not expected to be material

 item 1a risk factors 

set forth below and elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k are some of the principal risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual business results to differ materially from any forwardlooking statements contained in this report and could individually or combined have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows these risk factors should be considered in addition to our cautionary comments concerning forwardlooking statements in this report including statements related to markets for our products and trends in our business that involve a number of risks and uncertainties our separate section above cautionary statements regarding forwardlooking information should be considered in addition to the following statements 

the discovery of any significant problems with our new engine platforms in north america could materially adversely impact our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

the environmental protection agency epa and california air resources board carb have certified all of our 2011 onhighway and offhighway engines which utilize selective catalytic reduction scr technology to meet requisite emission levels we introduced scr technology into our engine platforms in 2010 the effective performance of scr technology and the overall performance of these engine platforms impact a number of our operating segments and remain crucial to our success in north america while the model year 2010 engine platforms have performed well in the field and the 2011 model year engines have undergone extensive testing the discovery of any significant problems in these platforms could result in recall campaigns increased warranty costs reputational risk and brand risk 

another downturn in our markets could materially adversely affect our results of operations financial condition and cash flows again 

although the emerging markets including china india and brazil recovered in 2010 the global economy remains fragile with north america and other developed countries continuing to experience sluggish results and certain countries in europe experiencing a debt crisis if the global economy were to take another significant downturn depending upon the length duration and severity of such a downturn our results of operations financial condition and cash flow would almost certainly be materially adversely affected again specifically our revenues would likely decrease we may be forced to consider further restructuring actions we may need to increase our allowance for doubtful accounts our days sales outstanding may increase and we could experience impairments to assets of certain of our businesses 

another downturn in the north american and european automotive industries could adversely impact our business 

a number of companies in the global automotive industry have experienced significant financial difficulties in recent years in north america general motors corporation gm ford motor company and chrysler group llc chrysler experienced declining markets furthermore gm and chrysler previously filed for and then exited bankruptcy under chapter 11 of the us bankruptcy code and accepted substantial monetary infusions from the us government automakers across europe and japan also experienced difficulties from a weakened economy and tightening credit 

markets because many of our suppliers also supply automotive industry participants the difficult automotive industry conditions also adversely affected our supply base during the recession lower production levels for some of our key suppliers increases in certain raw material commodity and energy costs and the global credit market crisis resulted in severe financial distress among many companies within the automotive supply base a return to financial distress within the automotive industry and our shared supply base andor the subsequent bankruptcy of one or more additional automakers may lead to further supplier bankruptcies commercial disputes supply chain interruptions supplier requests for company sponsored capital support or a collapse of the supply chain 

we rely on income from investees that we do not directly control 

our net income includes significant equity royalty and interest income from investees that we do not directly control for 2010 we recognized 351 million of equity royalty and interest income from investees compared to 214 million in 2009 the majority of our equity royalty and interest income from investees comes from our 12 unconsolidated north american distributors and from two of our joint ventures in china dongfeng cummins engine company ltd dcec and chongqing cummins engine company ltd ccec our equity ownership interests in our unconsolidated north american distributors generally range from 30 percent to 50 percent we have 50 percent equity ownership interests in dcec and ccec as a result although a significant percentage of our net income is derived from these unconsolidated entities we do not unilaterally control their management or operations which puts a substantial portion of our net income at risk from the actions or inactions of these other entities a significant reduction in the level of contribution by these entities to our net income would likely have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

government regulation could adversely affect our business 

our engines are subject to extensive statutory and regulatory requirements governing emission and noise including standards imposed by the epa the european union state regulatory agencies such as the carb and other regulatory agencies around the world we have made and will be required to continue to make significant capital and research expenditures to comply with these regulatory standards developing engines to meet changing government regulatory requirements with different implementation timelines and emission requirements makes developing engines efficiently for multiple markets complicated and could result in substantial additional costs that may be difficult to recover in certain markets in some cases we may be required to develop new products to comply with new regulations particularly those relating to air emission for example we were required to develop new engines to comply with stringent emission standards in the us by january 1 2010 including the reduction of nox emission to near zero levels among other requirements while we were able to meet this and previous deadlines our ability to comply with other existing and future regulatory standards will be essential for us to maintain our position in the engine markets we serve further the successful development and introduction of new and enhanced products in order to comply with new regulatory requirements are subject to other risks such as delays in product development cost overruns and unanticipated technical and manufacturing difficulties 

our truck manufacturers and oem customers may not continue to outsource their engine supply needs 

several of our engine customers including paccar inc volvo ab and chrysler are truck manufacturers or oems that manufacture engines for some of their own products despite their engine manufacturing abilities these customers have historically chosen to outsource certain types of engine production to us due to the quality of our engine products our emission capability our systems integration their customers preferences their desire for cost reductions their desire for eliminating production risks and their desire to maintain company focus however there can be no assurance that these customers will continue to outsource or outsource as much of their engine production in the 

future increased levels of oem vertical integration could result from a number of factors such as shifts in our customers business strategies acquisition by a customer of another engine manufacturer the inability of thirdparty suppliers to meet product specifications and the emergence of lowcost production opportunities in foreign countries any significant reduction in the level of engine production outsourcing from our truck manufacturer or oem customers could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

our products are exposed to variability in material and commodity costs 

our businesses establish prices with our customers in accordance with contractual time frames however the timing of market price increases may prevent us from passing these additional costs on to our customers through timely pricing actions additionally higher material and commodity costs around the world may offset our efforts to reduce our cost structure while we customarily enter into financial transactions to address some of these risks ie copper platinum and palladium there can be no assurance that commodity price fluctuations will not adversely affect our results of operations financial condition and cash flows in addition while the use of commodity price hedging instruments may provide us with protection from adverse fluctuations in commodity prices by utilizing these instruments we potentially forego the benefits that might result from favorable fluctuations in price as a result higher material and commodity costs as well as hedging these commodity costs during periods of decreasing prices could result in declining margins 

we are subject to currency exchange rate and other related risks 

we conduct operations in many areas of the world involving transactions denominated in a variety of currencies we are subject to currency exchange rate risk to the extent that our costs are denominated in currencies other than those in which we earn revenues in addition since our financial statements are denominated in us dollars changes in currency exchange rates between the us dollar and other currencies have had and will continue to have an impact on our results of operations while we customarily enter into financial transactions to address these risks there can be no assurance that currency exchange rate fluctuations will not adversely affect our results of operations financial condition and cash flows in addition while the use of currency hedging instruments may provide us with protection from adverse fluctuations in currency exchange rates by utilizing these instruments we potentially forego the benefits that might result from favorable fluctuations in currency exchange rates 

we also face risks arising from the imposition of exchange controls and currency devaluations exchange controls may limit our ability to convert foreign currencies into us dollars or to remit dividends and other payments by our foreign subsidiaries or businesses located in or conducted within a country imposing controls currency devaluations result in a diminished value of funds denominated in the currency of the country instituting the devaluation 

we are vulnerable to supply shortages from singlesourced suppliers 

during 2010 we single sourced approximately 60 to 70 percent of the total types of parts in our product designs any delay in our suppliers deliveries may adversely affect our operations at multiple manufacturing locations forcing us to seek alternative supply sources to avoid serious disruptions delays may be caused by factors affecting our suppliers including capacity constraints labor disputes economic downturns availability of credit the impaired financial condition of a particular supplier suppliers allocations to other purchasers weather emergencies or acts of war or terrorism any extended delay in receiving critical supplies could impair our ability to deliver products to our customers 

our products are subject to recall for performance or safetyrelated issues 

our products may be subject to recall for performance or safetyrelated issues product recalls subject us to harm to our reputation loss of current and future customers reduced revenue and product recall costs product recall costs are incurred when we decide either voluntarily or involuntarily to recall a product through a formal campaign to solicit the return of specific products due to a known or suspected performance issue 

we face significant competition in the markets we serve 

the markets in which we operate are highly competitive we compete worldwide with a number of other manufacturers and distributors that produce and sell similar products we primarily compete in the market with diesel engines and related diesel products however new technologies continue to be developed for gasoline and other technologies and we will continue to face new competition from these expanding technologies our products primarily compete on the basis of price performance fuel economy speed of delivery quality and customer support we also face competitors in some emerging markets who have established local practices and long standing relationships with participants in these markets there can be no assurance that our products will be able to compete successfully with the products of other companies and in other markets for a more complete discussion of the competitive environment in which each of our segments operates see operating segments in item 1 business 

we are exposed to political economic and other risks that arise from operating a multinational business 

approximately 64 percent of our net sales for 2010 were attributable to customers outside the us compared to 52 percent in 2009 accordingly our business is subject to the political economic and other risks that are inherent in operating in numerous countries these risks include 

• the difficulty of enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through foreign legal systems • trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements • the imposition of taxes on foreign income and tax rates in certain foreign countries that exceed those in the us • the imposition of tariffs exchange controls or other restrictions • difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations and the application of foreign labor regulations • required compliance with a variety of foreign laws and regulations and • changes in general economic and political conditions in countries where we operate particularly in emerging markets as we continue to operate our business globally our success will depend in part on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these and other related risks there can be no assurance that the consequences of these and other factors relating to our multinational operations will not have a material adverse effect upon us 

significant declines in future financial and stock market conditions could diminish our pension plan asset performance and adversely impact our results of operations financial condition and cash flows 

we sponsor both funded and unfunded domestic and foreign defined benefit pension and other retirement plans our pension expense and the required contributions to our pension plans are directly affected by the value of plan assets the projected and actual rates of return on plan assets and the actuarial assumptions we use to measure our defined benefit pension plan obligations including the discount rate at which future projected and accumulated pension obligations are discounted to a 

present value we could experience increased pension expense due to a combination of factors including the decreased investment performance of pension plan assets decreases in the discount rate and changes in our assumptions relating to the expected return on plan assets 

significant declines in future financial and stock market conditions could cause material losses in our pension plan assets which could result in increased pension expense in future years and adverse changes to our financial condition depending upon the severity of market declines and government regulatory changes we may be legally obligated to make pension payments in the us and perhaps other countries and these contributions could be material 

we face reputational and legal risk from operation outside the us and affiliations with joint venture partners 

several of our foreign subsidiaries affiliates and joint venture partners are located outside the us with laws rules and business practices that differ from those of the us the activities of these entities may not comply with us laws or customs or our code of business conduct and actions by these entities may cause us legal or reputational risk if they violate applicable laws rules or business practices 

we face the challenge of increasing our capacity and ramping up our production at the appropriate pace as we exit the downturn 

prior to the recession we experienced capacity constraints and longer lead times for certain products accurately forecasting our expected volumes and appropriately adjusting our capacity as we exit the downturn have been and will continue to be important factors in determining our results of operations we cannot guarantee that we will be able to increase manufacturing capacity to a level that meets demand for our products which could prevent us from meeting increased customer demand and could harm our business however if we overestimate our demand and overbuild our capacity we may have significantly underutilized assets and we may experience reduced margins if we do not accurately align our manufacturing capabilities with demand it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

our business is exposed to risks of product liability claims 

we face an inherent business risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that our products failure to perform to specification results or is alleged to result in property damage bodily injury andor death we may experience material product liability losses in the future while we maintain insurance coverage with respect to certain product liability claims we may not be able to obtain such insurance on acceptable terms in the future if at all and any such insurance may not provide adequate coverage against product liability claims in addition product liability claims can be expensive to defend and can divert the attention of management and other personnel for significant periods of time regardless of the ultimate outcome an unsuccessful defense of a significant product liability claim could have a material adverse effect upon us in addition even if we are successful in defending against a claim relating to our products claims of this nature could cause our customers to lose confidence in our products and us 

we may need to write off significant investments in our new lightduty diesel engine platforms if customer commitments further deteriorate 

we began development of a new lightduty diesel engine platform in july 2006 to be used in a variety of on and offhighway applications since that time and as of december 31 2010 we have capitalized investments of approximately 218 million market uncertainty due to the global recession resulted in some customers delaying or cancelling their vehicle programs while others remain active if customer expectations or volume projections further deteriorate from our current levels and we do not 

identify new customers we may need to recognize an impairment charge and write the assets down to net realizable value 

our operations are subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations 

our plants and operations are subject to increasingly stringent environmental laws and regulations in all of the countries in which we operate including laws and regulations governing air emission discharges to water and the generation handling storage transportation treatment and disposal of waste materials while we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with these environmental laws and regulations there can be no assurance that we will not be adversely impacted by costs liabilities or claims with respect to existing or subsequently acquired operations under either present laws and regulations or those that may be adopted or imposed in the future we are also subject to laws requiring the cleanup of contaminated property if a release of hazardous substances occurs at or from any of our current or former properties or at a landfill or another location where we have disposed of hazardous materials we may be held liable for the contamination and the amount of such liability could be material 

unanticipated changes in our effective tax rate the adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could adversely affect our profitability 

we are subject to income taxes in the us and numerous international jurisdictions our income tax provision and cash tax liability in the future could be adversely affected by changes in the distribution of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities changes in tax laws and the discovery of new information in the course of our tax return preparation process the carrying value of deferred tax assets which are predominantly in the us is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income in the us we are also subject to ongoing tax audits these audits can involve complex issues which may require an extended period of time to resolve and can be highly judgmental tax authorities may disagree with certain tax reporting positions taken by us and as a result assess additional taxes against us we regularly assess the likely outcomes of these audits in order to determine the appropriateness of our tax provision the amounts ultimately paid upon resolution of these or subsequent tax audits could be materially different from the amounts previously included in our income tax provision and therefore could have a material impact on our tax provision 

we may be adversely impacted by work stoppages and other labor matters 

as of december 31 2010 we employed approximately 39200 persons worldwide approximately 15500 of our employees worldwide are represented by various unions under collective bargaining agreements that expire between 2011 and 2015 while we have no reason to believe that we will be impacted by work stoppages and other labor matters there can be no assurance that future issues with our labor unions will be resolved favorably or that we will not encounter future strikes work stoppages or other types of conflicts with labor unions or our employees any of these consequences may have an adverse effect on us or may limit our flexibility in dealing with our workforce in addition many of our customers and suppliers have unionized work forces work stoppages or slowdowns experienced by our customers or suppliers could result in slowdowns or closures that would have a material adverse effect on our operations 

our financial statements are subject to changes in accounting standards that could adversely impact our profitability or financial position 

our financial statements are subject to the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap which are periodically revised andor expanded accordingly from time to time we are required to adopt new or revised accounting standards issued by recognized authoritative bodies including the financial accounting standards board recently accounting standard setters issued new guidance which further interprets or seeks to revise accounting pronouncements related to revenue recognition and lease accounting as well as to issue new standards expanding disclosures the impact of accounting pronouncements that have been issued but not yet implemented is disclosed in our annual and quarterly reports on form 10k and form 10q an assessment of proposed standards is not provided as such proposals are subject to change through the exposure process and therefore their effects on our financial statements cannot be meaningfully assessed it is possible that future accounting standards we are required to adopt could change the current accounting treatment that we apply to our consolidated financial statements and that such changes could have a material adverse effect on the reported results of operations and financial position

organization of information 

the following managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations mda was prepared to provide the reader with a view and perspective of our business through the eyes of management and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes to those financial statements our mda is presented in the following sections 

• executive summary and financial highlights • 2011 outlook • results of operations • restructuring and other charges • operating segment results • liquidity and capital resources • contractual obligations and other commercial commitments • off balance sheet arrangements • application of critical accounting estimates • recently adopted and recently issued accounting pronouncements 29 

executive summary and financial highlights 

we are a global power leader that designs manufactures distributes and services diesel and natural gas engines electric power generation systems and enginerelated component products including filtration exhaust aftertreatment fuel systems controls and air handling systems we sell our products to original equipment manufacturers oems distributors and other customers worldwide we have longstanding relationships with many of the leading manufacturers in the markets we serve including paccar inc chrysler group llc daimler trucks north america man nutzfahrzeuge ag ford motor company komatsu volvo ab and case new holland we serve our customers through a network of more than 600 companyowned and independent distributor locations and approximately 6000 dealer locations in more than 190 countries and territories 

our reportable operating segments consist of the following engine power generation components and distribution this reporting structure is organized according to the products and markets each segment serves and allows management to focus its efforts on providing enhanced service to a wide range of customers the engine segment produces engines and parts for sale to customers in onhighway and various industrial markets the engines are used in trucks of all sizes buses and recreational vehicles as well as various industrial applications including construction mining agriculture marine oil and gas rail and military the power generation segment is an integrated provider of power systems which sells engines generator sets and alternators the components segment sells filtration products exhaust aftertreatment systems turbochargers and fuel systems the distribution segment includes whollyowned and partiallyowned distributorships engaged in wholesaling engines generator sets and service parts as well as performing service and repair activities on our products and maintaining relationships with various oems throughout the world 

our financial performance depends in large part on varying conditions in the markets we serve particularly the onhighway construction and general industrial markets demand in these markets tends to fluctuate in response to overall economic conditions and is particularly sensitive to changes in interest rate levels and our customers access to credit our sales may also be impacted by oem inventory levels and production schedules and stoppages economic downturns in markets we serve generally result in reductions in sales and pricing of our products as a worldwide business our operations are also affected by political economic and regulatory matters including environmental and emission standards in the countries we serve at the same time our geographic diversity and broad product and service offerings have helped limit the impact from a drop in demand in any one industry or customer or the economy of any single country on our consolidated results 

in 2010 emerging markets recovered with stronger demand in china india and brazil while we started to see modest but uneven signs of recovery in developed markets as we expected after the strong demand in the second half of 2009 in advance of the 2010 united states us emission change demand for heavyduty onhighway products in north america decreased approximately 61 percent in 2010 versus 2009 in addition mediumduty truck shipments in north america decreased 34 percent in 2010 versus 2009 excluding north american onhighway markets overall order trends improved and were consistent with our expectations of organic revenue growth in 2010 in recognition of the global economic challenges we launched significant restructuring initiatives in late 2008 and 2009 that were designed to reduce structural and overhead costs across all of our businesses improve operational performance strengthen our position in emerging markets and prepare to capitalize on the eventual recovery in north america and europe these initiatives helped to mitigate the adverse volume impacts that certain markets experienced and they better position us for when a more robust economic recovery extends beyond the emerging markets despite the slow recovery in the us markets and europe we were able to operate much more efficiently and as a result recorded the most profitable results in our history in 2010 

the following table contains sales and earnings before interest and taxes ebit results by operating segment for the years ended december 31 2010 and 2009 refer to the section titled operating segment results later in mda for a more detailed discussion of net sales and ebit by operating segment including the reconciliation of segment ebit to income before taxes

2011 outlook 

nearterm 

in 2010 economies in emerging markets including china india and brazil recovered and we started to see signs of economic recovery in developed markets we expect the following positive trends in 2011 

• markets for the majority of our products in china india and brazil should continue to grow but at a slower pace than experienced in 2010 and we are expanding our capacity in china and india to meet the expected demand • our markets in north america are expected to improve especially with the anticipated strong recovery of onhighway truck markets and a significant improvement in our power generation markets • other markets for our products will continue to expand including mexico the middle east and europe • we expect most of our other markets to continue to grow we expect the following challenges to our business that will put pressure on earnings in 2011 

• a higher mix of epa 2010 compliant engines will likely increase our product warranty • we will increase our investment in new product development • our joint ventures will likely experience slower growth as we invest in capacity • increasing commodity costs could continue to put downward pressure on earnings longterm 

we see improvements in most of our current markets and we are confident that opportunities for longterm profitable growth will continue in the future

engine segment sales by market were as follows 



unit shipments by engine classification including unit shipments to power generation were as follows 



2010 vs 2009 

sales 

engine segment sales increased versus 2009 due to improved sales in most markets especially the industrial stationary power lightduty automotive and mediumduty truck markets which were partially offset by decreases in the north american heavyduty truck market the following are the primary drivers by market 

• industrial market sales increased primarily due to a 154 percent improvement in international construction engine shipments driven by the economic recovery and infrastructure investment in emerging markets and a 123 percent improvement in units sold in the international mining markets due to increased coal and commodity demands • stationary power engine sales increased primarily due to higher demand in power generation markets particularly for highhorse power engines • lightduty automotive sales increased significantly due to a 77 percent improvement in units sold to chrysler as the result of shutdowns in 2009 as part of its reorganization efforts • mediumduty truck engine sales increased due to a 78 percent increase in international units sold primarily due to higher demand in the brazilian truck market driven by a growing economy and government incentives these increases were partially offset by a decline in heavyduty truck engine sales consistent with prior emission standards changes north american includes the us and canada and excludes mexico unit sales declined 61 percent due to higher engine purchases by oems in late 2009 ahead of the environmental protection agencys epas 2010 emission standards change as part of the oems transition plan 

total onhighwayrelated sales for 2010 were 50 percent of total engine segment sales compared to 61 percent in 2009 

segment ebit

the increase in gross margin versus 2009 was primarily due to higher volumes improved price realization decreased warranty expense and cost structure improvements from actions taken in late 2008 and early 2009 partially offset by an unfavorable mix equity royalty and interest income from investees increased in most unconsolidated joint ventures the increase was led by higher demand in emerging markets especially at dcec and komatsucummins engine company kcec the increase 

in selling general and administrative expenses was primarily due to higher variable compensation which resulted from the segments strong performance 

2009 vs 2008 

sales 

engine segment sales experienced deterioration across all major markets versus 2008 as a result of the global economic downturn the following are the primary drivers by market 

• industrial market sales decreased due to deterioration in units sold in the construction marine and mining markets by 63 percent 45 percent and 50 percent respectively • stationary power market sales declined due to decreased sales to the power generation segment as it used existing inventory to meet declining customer demand • mediumduty truck engine sales decreased significantly due to a 35 percent decline in international truck units sold as a result of the global economic downturn the us market was impacted by the economic downturn however this was partially offset by increased sales ahead of the january 1 2010 emission standards change and improving market share • heavyduty truck engine sales declined as international units sold were down 64 percent we experienced a decline in mexican heavyduty sales due to an increase in heavyduty truck sales in the first six months of 2008 resulting from the increased activity ahead of mexicos july 1 2008 new emission requirements appreciation of the us dollar and an influx of used trucks into the market from the us and canada permitted under a new law although us truck fleets experienced financial challenges due to a lack of freight and limited access to credit our us heavyduty engine sales ended the year flat as a result of increased sales in the fourth quarter of 2009 ahead of the january 1 2010 emission standards change and improving market share total onhighwayrelated sales were 61 percent of total engine segment sales compared to 53 percent in 2008 

segment ebit

power generation segment sales improved in most businesses versus 2009 primarily due to increased demand the following are the primary drivers by business 

• commercial products sales increased due to higher demand in the uk latin america india and east asia which was partially offset by decreased demand in north america • consumer sales increased primarily due to signs of recovery in the north american rv market • commercial projects sales increased due to higher demand in the south pacific and africa partially offset by reduced demand in the middle east 47 

• generator technologies sales increased due to higher demand in east asia the uk and india partially offset by a decline in demand in north america east europe and the middle east segment ebit 

power generation segment ebit increased versus 2009 primarily due to higher gross margins and equity royalty and interest income from investees which were partially offset by increased selling general and administrative expenses changes in power generation segment ebit and ebit as a percentage of sales were as follows 



the increase in gross margin was due to higher volumes partially offset by increased warranty expenses and increased variable compensation the increase in selling general and administrative expenses was primarily due to higher variable compensation expense which resulted from the strong improvement over 2009 equity royalty and interest income from investees increased due to higher demand especially at cummins olayan energy and ccec 

2009 vs 2008 

sales 

power generation segment sales decreased in most businesses versus 2008 as the result of the global economic downturn the following are the primary drivers by business 

• commercial products sales decreased due to lower demand across most regions especially in north america the uk the middle east latin america and india • generator technologies sales decreased due to lower oem demand in western europe north america and india • commercial projects sales decreased due to lower demand in most regions especially in north america western europe and the uk segment ebit 

power generation segment ebit decreased primarily due to a lower gross margin which was partially offset by decreases in selling general and administrative expenses and research development 

and engineering expenses changes in power generation segment ebit and ebit as a percentage of sales were as follows 



the decrease in gross margin was primarily due to lower volumes unfavorable sales mix and increased material and commodity costs which were partially offset by improved pricing and favorable foreign currency translation the decrease in selling general and administrative expenses and research development and engineering expenses was primarily due to favorable foreign currency translation lower variable compensation costs implementation of severance programs and decreased discretionary spending 

components segment results 

financial data for the components segment was as follows 



  



sales for our components segment by business were as follows 



1 beginning january 1 2009 we reorganized the reporting structure of two businesses and moved a portion of our filtration business into the emission solutions business for the year ended 2009 the sales for the portion of the business included in emission solutions were 86 million sales for the portion of the business included in filtration for the year ended 2008 was 136 million the 2008 balances were not reclassified 

2010 vs 2009 

sales 

components segment sales increased in all businesses versus 2009 the following are the primary regional drivers by business 

• emission solutions business sales increased due to higher technology content and increased sales of north american epa 2010 aftertreatment systems and higher european demand for aftertreatment systems for the first fit market which was partially offset by decreased sales of our epa 2007 aftertreatment systems • turbo technologies business sales increased due to improved original equipment demand in europe and china and significant global aftermarket recovery • filtration business sales increased in all regions primarily due to global aftermarket recovery and improved global original equipment sales • fuel systems business sales increased primarily due to improved oem first fit sales in china and the aftermarket recovery in north america which was partially offset by decreased first fit sales in north america segment ebit 

components segment ebit almost tripled versus 2009 primarily due to the improved gross margin which was partially offset by increased selling general and administrative expenses and research 

development and engineering expenses changes in components segment ebit and ebit as a percentage of sales were as follows 



the increase in gross margin was due to higher volumes for all businesses increased aftertreatment content on 2010 north american truck engines and efficiencies gained from restructuring actions partially offset by higher commodity costs and warranty expenses the increase in selling general and administrative expenses and research development and engineering expenses were primarily due to increased variable compensation which resulted from the segments strong performance other people costs and new product development program spending 

2009 vs 2008 

sales 

components segment sales decreased in all businesses versus 2008 as the result of the global economic downturn the following are the primary drivers by business 

• filtration business sales decreased significantly due to falling global aftermarket and oem demand especially in north america and europe and the transfer of a portion of the business to emission solutions in 2009 • turbo technologies business sales decreased significantly due to falling oem demand in europe and north america • fuel systems business sales decreased primarily due to falling oem demand in north america and europe • emission solutions business sales decreased due to falling oem demand across europe and north america these decreases were partially offset by the transfer of a portion of the filtration business into emission solutions in 2009 51 

segment ebit 

components segment ebit decreased versus 2008 primarily due to a lower gross margin which was partially offset by decreased selling general and administrative expenses and research development and engineering expenses changes in components segment ebit and ebit as a percentage of sales were as follows 



the decrease in gross margin was due to lower volumes for most markets partially offset by implementation of severance programs the decrease in selling general and administrative expenses and research development and engineering expenses was primarily due to implementation of severance programs closing certain facilities decreased discretionary spending and decreased research and development spending 

distribution segment results 

financial data for the distribution segment was as follows 



  



sales for our distribution segment by region were as follows 



2010 vs 2009 

excluding acquisitions 

selected financial information for our distribution segment excluding the impact of acquisitions was as follows 



1 the acquisitions represent the purchase of the majority interest in cummins western canada cwc an equity investee in the first quarter of 2010 and the purchase of a majority interest in a previously independent north american distributorship as explained in note 21 acquisitions and divestitures to the consolidated financial statements  the acquisition of cwc and the majority interest in the distributorship increased sales by 286 million and ebit by 30 million in 2010 the 2009 data does not exclude the acquisition which occurred in 2009 2 this amount includes 13 million of equity earnings which would have been our share of cwcs income for 2010 if we had not consolidated them 

sales 

distribution segment sales excluding the acquisitions increased versus 2009 due to increased parts and service revenues increased engine sales driven by sales in europe and the south pacific and favorable foreign currency impacts in most regions 

segment ebit 

distribution segment ebit increased versus 2009 primarily due to increased gross margin and a onetime gain from an acquisition that occurred in the first quarter partially offset by increased selling general and administrative expenses changes in distribution segment ebit and ebit as a percentage of sales were as follows 



1 the primary increase in other income represents the purchase of the majority interest in an equity investee in the first quarter of 2010 which resulted in a gain of 12 million as 

explained in note 21 acquisitions and divestitures to the consolidated financial statements 

excluding acquisitions the increase in gross margin versus 2009 was primarily due to higher volumes and favorable foreign currency impacts excluding effects from acquisitions the increase in selling general and administrative expenses was mainly due to higher salaries and unfavorable foreign currency impacts 

2009 vs 2008 

excluding acquisition 

selected financial information for our distribution segment excluding the impact of the acquisition was as follows 



1 the acquisition primarily represents the purchase of one distributor in 2009 this acquisition of the distributor increased sales by 38 million and ebit by 11 million in 2009 the 2008 data does not exclude acquisitions which occurred in 2008 

sales 

distribution sales excluding the acquisition decreased versus 2008 primarily due to the decline in power generation equipment and engine sales as a result of the global economic downturn and unfavorable foreign currency translation decreased sales were led by lower sales volumes primarily in power generation and engines and unfavorable foreign currency impacts 

segment ebit 

distribution ebit decreased primarily due to lower gross margin partially offset by decreased selling general and administrative expenses and higher equity royalty and interest income from investees changes in distribution segment ebit and ebit as a percentage of sales were as follows 



1 primarily represents the acquisition of one distributor in 2009 the 2008 data does not exclude acquisitions which occurred in 2008 

the decrease in gross margin was primarily due to lower sales volumes as a result of the global economic downturn and unfavorable foreign currency translation selling general and administrative expenses decreased primarily due to favorable foreign currency translation lower sales volumes and decreased discretionary spending 

reconciliation of segment ebit to income before income taxes 

the table below reconciles the segment information to the corresponding amounts in the consolidated statements of income 



1 includes intersegment sales and profit in inventory eliminations and unallocated corporate expenses for the year ended december 31 2010 unallocated corporate expenses include 32 million in brazil tax recoveries 21 million aftertax and 2 million in flood damage expenses the brazil tax recovery has been excluded from segment results as it was not considered by management in its evaluation of operating results for the year ended december 31 2010 for the year ended december 31 2009 unallocated corporate expenses included 99 million in restructuring and other charges and a gain of 12 million related to flood damage recoveries for the year ended december 31 2008 unallocated corporate expenses included 37 million of restructuring charges a 36 million decrease in cash surrender value in corporate owned life insurance and 5 million of losses related to flood damage recoveries 

liquidity and capital resources 

managements assessment of liquidity 

our financial condition and liquidity remain strong our solid balance sheet and credit ratings enable us to have ready access to credit as we terminated our three year credit facility a year early and entered into a new four year credit facility during 2010 

we assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate adequate cash to fund our operating investing and financing activities cash provided by operations is our principal source of liquidity as of december 31 2010 other sources of liquidity include 

• cash and cash equivalents of 1023 million of which approximately 33 percent is located in the us and 67 percent is located in the united kingdom uk china singapore brazil and india • marketable securities of 339 million which are located primarily in india and brazil and the majority of which could be liquidated into cash within a few days • revolving credit facility with 121 billion available net of outstanding letters of credit • international and other domestic credit facilities with 278 million available and 55 

• accounts receivable sales program with 122 million available based on eligible receivables we believe our liquidity provides us with the financial flexibility needed to fund working capital capital expenditures projected pension obligations dividend payments common stock repurchases and debt service obligations 

on july 16 2010 we entered into a new four year revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of lenders which provides us with a 124 billion unsecured revolving credit facility the proceeds of which are to be used for the general corporate purposes of cummins see note 9 debt to the consolidated financial statements for further information the credit agreement includes two financial covenants a leverage ratio and an interest coverage ratio at december 31 2010 we were in compliance with both financial covenants 

the required leverage ratio which measures the sum of total debt plus securitization financing to consolidated earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda for the four fiscal quarters should not exceed 30 to 1 at december 31 2010 our leverage using this measure was 046 to 1 the required interest coverage ratio which is consolidated ebitda minus capital expenditures to consolidated interest expense in each case for the four consecutive fiscal quarters should not be less than 150 to 1 at december 31 2010 our interest coverage ratio using this measure was 3668 to 1 

we continuously monitor our pension assets and believe that we have limited exposure to the european debt crisis no sovereign debt instruments of crisis countries are held in the trusts while any equities held are with large welldiversified multinational firms or are de minimus amounts in large index funds in addition we have rebalanced our asset portfolios in the us and uk with equities representing a smaller segment of the total portfolios our pension plans have not experienced any significant impact on liquidity or counterparty exposure due to the volatility in the credit markets 

a significant portion of our cash flows is generated outside the us more than half of our cash and cash equivalents and most of our marketable securities at december 31 2010 are denominated in foreign currencies we manage our worldwide cash requirements considering available funds among the many subsidiaries through which we conduct our business and the cost effectiveness with which those funds can be accessed the repatriation of cash balances from certain subsidiaries could have adverse tax consequences however those balances are generally available without legal restrictions to fund ordinary business operations at the local level we have and will continue to transfer cash from these subsidiaries to us and to other international subsidiaries when it is cost effective to do so 

the maturity schedule of our existing longterm debt does not require significant cash outflows in the intermediate term required annual principal payments range from 8 million to 116 million over each of the next five years 

working capital summary 

we fund our working capital with cash from operations and shortterm borrowings when necessary various assets and liabilities including shortterm debt can fluctuate significantly from month to month 

depending on shortterm liquidity needs as a result working capital is a prime focus of management attention 



current assets increased 26 percent primarily due to an increase of 47 percent in inventory levels to meet anticipated demand increased accounts and notes receivables due to higher sales volumes and increased investment in marketable securities 

current liabilities increased 34 percent primarily due to an increase of 45 percent in accounts and loans payable which was the result of increased purchasing to support higher sales volume in the businesses and the acquisition of the majority interest in cwc 

cash flows 

cash and cash equivalents increased 93 million during the year ended december 31 2010 compared to a 504 million increase in cash and cash equivalents during the comparable period in 2009 the change in cash and cash equivalents was as follows 

operating activities 



2010 vs 2009 

net cash provided by operating activities decreased versus 2009 primarily due to significantly higher inventory levels to meet anticipated demand increased equity in income of investees net of dividends and higher pension contributions made in the year this was partially offset by significantly higher consolidated net income and increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses as the result of increased purchasing to support higher sales volumes 

pensions 

the funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon a variety of variables and assumptions including return on invested assets and market interest rate levels we made 221 million of pension contributions in 2010 including voluntary contributions of 108 million these contributions include payments from our funds either to increase pension plan assets or to make direct payments to plan participants we expect to contribute 130 million of cash to our global pension plans in 2011 

2009 vs 2008 

net cash provided by operating activities increased versus 2008 primarily due to favorable working capital fluctuations principally inventories as a result of managements response to the challenging global economy and increased dividends from our equity investees which were partially offset by 

decreased income as the result of declining sales managements priorities included reducing inventory aligning our cost and capacity with the real demand for our products and managing the business to generate positive cash flows by improving our working capital 

investing activities 



2010 vs 2009 

net cash used in investing activities increased versus 2009 primarily due to acquisitions see note 21 acquisitions to our consolidated financial statements  higher capital expenditures and increased investments in marketable securities which were partially offset by higher proceeds from the disposal of property plant and equipment 

capital expenditures were 364 million compared to 310 million in the comparable period in 2009 we continue to invest in the development of new products and we plan to spend approximately 600 million to 650 million in 2011 as we continue with product launches facility improvements and prepare for future onhighway emission standards and product launches 

2009 vs 2008 

net cash used in investing activities decreased versus 2008 primarily due to decreased capital expenditures and lower investments in the acquisition of businesses which were partially offset by increased net cash paid for investments in marketable securities and lower cash proceeds from the sale of a business these decreases primarily occurred as a result of managements decision to conserve cash and maintain liquidity during the recession 

capital expenditures decreased as management tightened capital spending substantially across all business by limiting expenditures to critical projects and investments in development of new products 

financing activities 



2010 vs 2009 

net cash used in financing activities increased versus 2009 primarily due to increased repurchases of common stock which was partially offset by higher proceeds from borrowings primarily related to the acquisition of cwc and borrowings in brazil 

our total debt was 843 million as of december 31 2010 compared with 703 million as of december 31 2009 total debt as a percent of our total capital including total longterm debt was 144 percent at december 31 2010 compared with 149 percent at december 31 2009 the increase in total debt was principally due to acquisitions and borrowings in brazil which were subsequently invested in marketable securities 

2009 vs 2008 

net cash used in financing activities declined versus 2008 primarily due to the decrease in repurchases of common stock and lower payments on borrowings which was partially offset by a decrease in proceeds from borrowings and higher dividend payments 

our total debt was 703 million as of december 31 2009 compared with 698 million at december 31 2008 total debt as a percent of our total capital including total longterm debt was 149 percent at december 31 2009 compared to 167 percent at december 31 2008 

repurchase of common stock 

in december 2007 the board of directors authorized the acquisition of up to 500 million of cummins common stock we began making purchases under the plan in march 2008 and purchased 128 million of stock during 2008 at an average cost of 5549 per share 

in february 2009 we temporarily suspended our stock repurchase program to conserve cash in the fourth quarter of 2009 we lifted the suspension and purchased 20 million of common stock at an average cost of 4652 per common share 

in 2010 we purchased 241 million of common stock through the following quarterly purchases 



in february 2011 the board of directors approved a new share repurchase program and authorized the acquisition of up to 1 billion of cummins common stock upon the completion of the 500 million program we purchased 111 million of our common stock in february 2011 and completed the 500 million program as of this filing date 

quarterly dividends 

in july 2010 our board of directors approved a 50 percent increase in the quarterly dividends on our common stock from 0175 per common share to 02625 per common share in july 2008 our board of directors approved a 40 percent increase in the quarterly dividends on our common stock from 0125 per common share to 0175 per common share cash dividends per share paid to common shareholders for the last three years were as follows 



total dividends paid to common shareholders in 2010 2009 and 2008 were 172 million 141 million and 122 million respectively declaration and payment of dividends in the future depends upon income and liquidity position among other factors and is subject to declaration by our board of directors who meet quarterly to consider the dividend payment we expect to fund dividend payments with cash from operations 

credit ratings 

a number of our contractual obligations and financing agreements such as our revolving credit facility have restrictive covenants andor pricing modifications that may be triggered in the event of downward revisions to our corporate credit rating there were no downgrades of our credit ratings in 2010 that have impacted these covenants or pricing modifications 

in january 2011 fitch affirmed our ratings and upgraded our outlook to positive in september 2010 standard and poors raised our senior unsecured debt ratings to bbb and changed our outlook to stable in july 2010 moodys investors service inc raised our senior unsecured debt ratings to baa2 

credit ratings are not recommendations to buy are subject to change and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating in addition we undertake no obligation to update disclosures concerning our credit ratings whether as a result of new information future events or otherwise our ratings and outlook from each of the credit rating agencies as of the date of filing are shown in the table below 



contractual obligations and other commercial commitments 

a summary of payments due for our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december 31 2010 is shown in the tables below 



1 includes principal payments and expected interest payments based on the terms of the obligations in february of 2009 we renegotiated our sale and leaseback transaction to extend the term for an additional two years and removed the requirement to provide residual insurance the lease obligations are included in this line item see note 13 commitments and contingencies to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on our sale and leaseback transaction 2 we are contractually obligated in the uk to fund 16 million in 2011 however our expected total pension contributions for 2011 is approximately 130 million after 2011 our contractual agreement in the uk is 62 million per year through 2015 

the contractual obligations reported above exclude our unrecognized tax benefits of 85 million as of december 31 2010 we are not able to reasonably estimate the period in which cash outflows relating to uncertain tax contingencies could occur see note 6 income taxes to the consolidated financial statements for further details 

our other commercial commitments as of december 31 2010 are as follows 



off balance sheet arrangements 

financing arrangements for affiliated parties 

in accordance with the provisions of various joint venture agreements we may purchase andor sell products and components fromto the joint ventures and the joint ventures may sell products and components to unrelated parties the transfer price of products purchased from the joint ventures may differ from normal selling prices certain joint venture agreements transfer product to us at cost some transfer product to us on a costplus basis and other agreements provide for the transfer of products at market value 

application of critical accounting estimates 

a summary of our significant accounting policies is included in note 1 summary of significant accounting policies of our consolidated financial statements which discusses accounting policies that we have selected from acceptable alternatives 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap which often requires management to make judgments estimates and assumptions regarding uncertainties that affect the reported amounts presented and disclosed in the financial statements management reviews these estimates and assumptions based on historical experience changes in business conditions and other relevant factors they believe to be reasonable under the circumstances in any given reporting period our actual results may differ from the estimates and assumptions used in preparing our consolidated financial statements 

critical accounting estimates are defined as follows the estimate requires management to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the estimate was made different estimates reasonably could have been used or if changes in the estimate are reasonably likely to occur from period to period and the change would have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations our senior management has discussed the development and selection of our accounting policies related accounting estimates and the disclosures set forth below with the audit committee of our board of directors we believe our critical accounting estimates include those addressing the estimation of liabilities for warranty programs recoverability of investment related to new products accounting for income taxes pension benefits and annual assessment of recoverability of goodwill 

warranty programs 

we estimate and record a liability for base warranty programs at the time our products are sold our estimates are based on historical experience and reflect managements best estimates of expected costs at the time products are sold and subsequent adjustment to those expected costs when actual costs differ as a result of the uncertainty surrounding the nature and frequency of product recall 

programs the liability for such programs is recorded when we commit to a recall action which generally occurs when it is announced our warranty liability is generally affected by component failure rates repair costs and the point of failure within the product life cycle future events and circumstances related to these factors could materially change our estimates and require adjustments to our liability new product launches require a greater use of judgment in developing estimates until historical experience becomes available product specific experience is typically available four or five quarters after product launch with a clear experience trend evident eight quarters after launch we generally record warranty expense for new products upon shipment using a preceding products warranty history and a multiplicative factor based upon preceding similar product experience and new product assessment until sufficient new product data is available for warranty estimation we then use a blend of actual new product experience and preceding product historical experience for several subsequent quarters and new product specific experience thereafter note 10 product warranty liability to our consolidated financial statements contains a summary of the activity in our warranty liability account for 2010 and 2009 including adjustments to preexisting warranties 

recoverability of investment related to new products 

at december 31 2010 we have capitalized 218 million associated with the future launch of our lightduty diesel engine product development of this product began in 2006 market uncertainty related to the global recession that began in 2008 resulted in some customers delaying or cancelling their vehicle programs at december 31 2009 we reviewed our investment of 216 million for possible impairment we used projections to assess whether future cash flows on an undiscounted basis related to the assets are likely to exceed the related carrying amount to determine if a writedown is appropriate these projections required estimates about product volume and the size of the market for vehicles that are not yet developed we used input from our customers in developing alternative cash flow scenarios our analysis indicated that the assets were recoverable customers that are expected to purchase sufficient quantities to recover our investment in the lightduty diesel engine products remained active with the development of this product through 2010 and there were no significant changes to the assumptions used in 2009 if customer expectations or projected volumes deteriorate and we do not identify alternative customers andor product applications we could be required to writedown these assets to net realizable value 

accounting for income taxes 

we determine our income tax expense using the asset and liability method under this method deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax effects of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases future tax benefits of tax loss and credit carryforwards are also recognized as deferred tax assets we evaluate the recoverability of our deferred tax assets each quarter by assessing the likelihood of future profitability and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize our net deferred tax assets at december 31 2010 we recorded net deferred tax assets of 511 million these assets included 139 million for the value of tax loss and credit carryforwards a valuation allowance of 50 million was recorded to reduce the tax assets to the net value management believed was more likely than not to be realized in the event our operating performance deteriorates future assessments could conclude that a larger valuation allowance will be needed to further reduce the deferred tax assets in addition we operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and are subject to tax audits in these jurisdictions these audits can involve complex issues which may require an extended period of time to resolve we reduce our net tax assets for the estimated additional tax and interest that may result from tax authorities disputing uncertain tax positions we have taken and we believe we have made adequate provision for income taxes for all years that are subject to audit based upon the latest information available a more complete description of our income taxes and the future benefits of our tax loss and 

credit carryforwards is disclosed in note 6 income taxes to our consolidated financial statements  

pension benefits 

we sponsor a number of pension plans primarily in the us and the uk and to a lesser degree in various other countries in the us and the uk we have several major defined benefit plans that are separately funded we account for our pension programs in accordance with employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans under gaap gaap requires that amounts recognized in financial statements be determined using an actuarial basis as a result our pension benefit programs are based on a number of statistical and judgmental assumptions that attempt to anticipate future events and are used in calculating the expense and liability related to our plans each year at december 31 these assumptions include discount rates used to value liabilities assumed rates of return on plan assets future compensation increases employee turnover rates actuarial assumptions relating to retirement age mortality rates and participant withdrawals the actuarial assumptions we use may differ significantly from actual results due to changing economic conditions participant life span and withdrawal rates these differences may result in a material impact to the amount of net periodic pension expense to be recorded in our consolidated financial statements in the future 

the expected longterm return on plan assets is used in calculating the net periodic pension expense we considered several factors in developing our expected rate of return on plan assets the longterm rate of return considers historical returns and expected returns on current and projected asset allocations and is generally applied to a 5year average market value of return projected returns are based primarily on broad publicly traded equity and fixed income indices and forwardlooking estimates of active portfolio and investment management as of december 31 2010 based upon our target asset allocations it is anticipated that our us investment policy will generate an average annual return over the 20year projection period equal to or in excess of 75 percent approximately 40 percent of the time while returns of 84 percent or greater are anticipated 25 percent of the time we expect additional positive returns from active investment management the 2010 one year return exceeded 15 percent combined with the very favorable returns in 2009 has eliminated the significant deterioration in pension assets experienced in 2008 as a result of the credit crisis and related market recession based on the historical returns and forwardlooking return expectations we believe an investment return assumption of 80 percent per year in 2011 for us pension assets is reasonable the methodology used to determine the rate of return on pension plan assets in the uk was based on establishing an equityrisk premium over current longterm bond yields adjusted based on target asset allocations as of december 31 2010 based upon our target asset allocations it is anticipated that our uk investment policy will generate an average annual return over the 20year projection period equal to or in excess of 65 percent approximately 50 percent of the time while returns of 93 percent or greater are anticipated 25 percent of the time we expect additional positive returns from active investment management the one year return for our uk plan was 13 percent for 2010 and similar to our us plan the 2008 market related deterioration in our plan assets has been eliminated our strategy with respect to our investments in pension plan assets is to be invested with a longterm outlook therefore the risk and return balance of our asset portfolio should reflect a longterm horizon based on the historical returns and forwardlooking return expectations we believe an investment return 

assumption of 70 percent in 2011 for uk pension assets is reasonable our pension plan asset allocation at december 31 2010 and 2009 and target allocation for 2011 are as follows 



the differences between the actual return on plan assets and expected longterm return on plan assets are recognized in the asset value used to calculate net periodic expense over five years the table below sets forth the expected return assumptions used to develop our pension expense for the period 20082010 and our expected rate for 2011 



a lower expected rate of return will increase our net periodic pension expense and reduce profitability 

the difference between the expected return and the actual return on plan assets is deferred from recognition in our results of operations and under certain circumstances such as when the difference exceeds 10 percent of the market value of plan assets or the projected benefit obligation pbo amortized over future years of service this is also true of changes to actuarial assumptions as of december 31 2010 we had net pension actuarial losses of 692 million and 227 million for the us and nonus pension plans respectively under gaap the actuarial gains and losses are recognized and recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss decreases in actuarial losses increased our shareholders equity by 125 million aftertax in 2010 the decreases resulted from improved plan asset performance in 2010 as these amounts exceed 10 percent of our pbo the excess is amortized over the average remaining service lives of participating employees 

the table below sets forth the net periodic pension expense for the period 2008 through 2010 and our expected expense for 2011 



we expect 2011 pension expense to be slightly under 2010 due to strong returns and higher assets partially offset by a decrease in the discount rate the decrease in periodic pension expense in 2010 was due to improved returns on assets as the capital markets began to recover strong contributions in 2009 and the absence of any curtailment charges the increase in periodic pension expense in 2009 was due to lower than historical returns on assets driven by the global economic recession another key assumption used in the development of the net periodic pension expense is the discount rate the 

weighted average discount rates used to develop our net periodic pension expense are set forth in the table below 



changes in the discount rate assumptions will impact the interest cost component of the net periodic pension expense calculation 

the discount rate enables us to state expected future cash payments for benefits as a present value on the measurement date the guidelines for setting this rate are discussed in gaap which suggests the use of a highquality corporate bond rate we used bond information provided by moodys standard  poors fitch and dominion bond rating all bonds used to develop our hypothetical portfolio in the us and uk were highquality noncallable bonds aa or better as of december 31 2010 the average yield of this hypothetical bond portfolio was used as the benchmark for determining the discount rate to be used to value the obligations of the plans subject to gaap for pensions and other postretirement benefits 

our model called for 80 years of benefit payments for the us plans and 60 years of payments for the uk for both countries our model matches the present value of the plans projected benefit payments to the market value of the theoretical settlement bond portfolio a single equivalent discount rate is determined to align the present value of the required cash flow with the value of the bond portfolio the resulting discount rate is reflective of both the current interest rate environment and the plans distinct liability characteristics 

the table below sets forth the estimated impact on our 2011 net periodic pension expense relative to a change in the discount rate and a change in the expected rate of return on plan assets 



the above sensitivities reflect the impact of changing one assumption at a time a higher discount rate decreases the plan obligations and decreases our net periodic pension expense a lower discount rate increases the plan obligations and increases our net periodic pension expense it should be noted that economic factors and conditions often affect multiple assumptions simultaneously and the effects of changes in key assumptions are not necessarily linear 

note 11 pension and other postretirement benefits to our consolidated financial statements provides a summary of our pension benefit plan activity the funded status of our plans and the amounts recognized in our consolidated financial statements  

annual assessment for recoverability of goodwill 

under gaap for goodwill and other intangible assets the carrying value of goodwill must be tested for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests in certain circumstances where impairment may be indicated the fair value of each reporting unit was estimated by discounting the future cash flows less requirements for working capital and fixed asset additions in accordance with gaap our reporting units are generally defined as one level below an operating segment however there were two situations where we have aggregated two or more components which share similar economic characteristics and thus are aggregated into a single reporting unit for testing purposes these two situations are described further below this analysis has resulted in the following reporting units for our goodwill testing 

• within our components segment emission solutions and filtration have been aggregated into a single reporting unit this reporting unit accounts for almost 90 percent of our total goodwill balance at december 31 2010 • also within our components segment our turbo technologies business is considered a separate reporting unit • within our power generation segment our generator technologies business is considered a separate reporting unit • within our engine segment our new and recon parts business is considered a separate reporting unit this reporting unit is in the business of selling new parts and remanufacturing and reconditioning engines and certain engine components • our distribution segment is considered a single reporting unit as it is managed geographically and all regions share similar economic characteristics and provide similar products and services no other reporting units have goodwill our valuation method requires us to make projections of revenue operating expenses working capital investment and fixed asset additions for the reporting units over a multiyear period additionally management must estimate a weightedaverage cost of capital which reflects a market rate for each reporting unit for use as a discount rate the discounted cash flows are compared to the carrying value of the reporting unit and if less than the carrying value a separate valuation of the goodwill is required to determine if an impairment loss has occurred in addition we also perform a sensitivity analysis to determine how much our forecasts can fluctuate before the fair value of a reporting unit would be lower than its carrying amount as of the end of the third quarter in 2010 we performed the annual impairment assessment required by gaap and determined that our goodwill was not impaired at december 31 2010 our recorded goodwill was 367 million approximately 90 percent of which resided in the emission solutions plus filtration reporting unit for this reporting unit the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by a substantial margin changes in our projections or estimates a deterioration of our operating results and the related cash flow effect or a significant increase in the discount rate could decrease the estimated fair value of our reporting units and result in a future impairment of goodwill 

recently adopted and recently issued accounting pronouncements 

accounting pronouncements recently adopted 

in july 2010 the financial accounting standards board fasb amended its standards regarding the disclosures for credit quality of financing receivables and the allowance for credit losses the objective of the amendment is to provide a greater level of disaggregated information about the credit quality of financing receivables the allowance for credit losses and timely recognition of such losses specifically the amendment requires an entity to disclose credit quality indicators past due information and modifications of its financing receivables the new rules are effective for us beginning december 31 2010 our level of receivables that qualify as financing receivables as defined by the standard are not material for disclosure 

in january 2010 the fasb amended its standards related to fair value measurements and disclosures which are effective for interim and annual fiscal periods beginning after december 15 2009 except for disclosures about certain level 3 activity which will not become effective until interim and annual periods beginning after december 15 2010 the new standard requires us to disclose transfers in and out of level 1 and level 2 fair value measurements and describe the reasons for the transfers as well as activity in level 3 fair value measurements the new standard also requires a more detailed level of disaggregation of the assets and liabilities being measured as well as increased disclosures regarding inputs and valuation techniques of the fair value measurements our disclosures related to the new standard are included in note 4 fair value of financial instruments to the consolidated financial statements  

in june 2009 the fasb amended its standards for accounting for transfers of financial assets which was effective for interim and annual fiscal periods beginning after november 15 2009 the new standard removes the concept of a qualifying specialpurpose entity from gaap the new standard modifies the financial components approach used in previous standards and limits the circumstances in which a financial asset or portion of a financial asset should be derecognized the new standard also requires enhanced disclosure regarding transfers of financial interests and a transferors continuing involvement with transferred assets the new standard requires us to report any activity under our receivable sales program as secured borrowings as of december 31 2010 there were no outstanding amounts under our receivable sales program and there was no significant activity during the year 

in june 2009 the fasb amended its existing standards related to the consolidation of variable interest entities which was effective for interim and annual fiscal periods beginning after november 15 2009 the new standard requires entities to analyze whether their variable interests give it a controlling financial interest of a variable interest entity vie and outlines what defines a primary beneficiary the new standard amends gaap by a changing certain rules for determining whether an entity is a vie b replacing the quantitative approach previously required for determining the primary beneficiary with a more qualitative approach and c requiring entities to continuously analyze whether they are the primary beneficiary of a vie among other amendments the new standard also requires enhanced disclosures regarding an entitys involvement in a vie the only significant impact of the adoption of this standard was to deconsolidate cummins komatsu engine corporation ckec as of january 1 2010 and to account for ckec under gaap for equity method investees ckec is an engine manufacturing entity jointly owned and operated by us and our equity partner prior to january 1 2010 we were deemed the primary beneficiary of this vie due to the pricing arrangements of purchases and the substantial volume of purchases we made from the vie the impact of the deconsolidation on our consolidated statements of income was minimal as all sales were eliminated in consolidation in the past the most significant impacts on our consolidated balance sheets were to decrease current assets by 9 million decrease longterm assets by 10 million increase investments and advances related to equity method investees by 11 million and decrease noncontrolling interest by 11 million 

accounting pronouncements issued but not yet effective 

in october 2009 the fasb amended its rules regarding the accounting for multiple element revenue arrangements the objective of the amendment is to allow vendors to account for revenue for different deliverables separately as opposed to part of a combined unit when those deliverables are provided at different times specifically this amendment addresses how to separate deliverables and simplifies the process of allocating revenue to the different deliverables when more than one deliverable exists the new rules are effective for us beginning january 1 2011 we do not believe this amendment will have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to financial risk resulting from volatility in foreign exchange rates commodity prices and interest rates this risk is closely monitored and managed through the use of financial derivative instruments including foreign currency forward contracts commodity swap contracts and interest rate swaps as stated in our policies and procedures financial derivatives are used expressly for hedging purposes and under no circumstances are they used for speculative purposes when material we adjust the value of our derivative contracts for counterparty or our credit risk the results and status of our hedging transactions are reported to senior management on a monthly and quarterly basis 

further information regarding financial instruments and risk management is contained in note 19 derivatives to our consolidated financial statements  

the following describes our risk exposures and provides results of sensitivity analysis performed as of december 31 2010 the sensitivity analysis assumes instantaneous parallel shifts in foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices 

foreign exchange rates 

as a result of our international business presence we are exposed to foreign currency exchange risks we transact business in foreign currencies and as a result our income experiences some volatility related to movements in foreign currency exchange rates to help manage our exposure to exchange rate volatility we use foreign exchange forward contracts on a regular basis to hedge forecasted intercompany and thirdparty sales and purchases denominated in nonfunctional currencies our internal policy allows for managing anticipated foreign currency cash flows for up to one year these foreign currency forward contracts are designated and qualify as foreign currency cash flow hedges under gaap the effective portion of the unrealized gain or loss on the forward contract is deferred and reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss aocl when the hedged forecasted transaction sale or purchase occurs the unrealized gain or loss is reclassified into income in the same line item associated with the hedged transaction in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects income the ineffective portion of the hedge unrealized gain or loss if any is recognized in current income during the period of change as of december 31 2010 the amount we expect to reclassify from aocl to income over the next year is a net unrealized loss of 1 million for the years ended december 31 2010 and 2009 there were no circumstances that would have resulted in the discontinuance of a foreign currency cash flow hedge 

to minimize the income volatility resulting from the remeasurement of net monetary assets and payables denominated in a currency other than the functional currency we enter into foreign currency forward contracts which are considered economic hedges the objective is to offset the gain or loss from remeasurement with the gain or loss from the fair market valuation of the forward contract these derivative instruments are not designated as hedges under gaap 

as of december 31 2010 the potential gain or loss in the fair value of our outstanding foreign currency contracts assuming a hypothetical 10 percent fluctuation in the currencies of such contracts 

would be approximately 52 million the sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates assumes the notional value to remain constant for the next 12 months the analysis ignores the impact of foreign exchange movements on our competitive position and potential changes in sales levels it should be noted that any change in the value of the contracts real or hypothetical would be significantly offset by an inverse change in the value of the underlying hedged items see note 19 derivatives to our consolidated financial statements  

interest rate risk 

we are exposed to market risk from fluctuations in interest rates we manage our exposure to interest rate fluctuations through the use of interest rate swaps the objective of the swaps is to more effectively balance our borrowing costs and interest rate risk 

in november 2005 we entered into an interest rate swap to effectively convert our 250 million debt issue due in 2028 from a fixed rate of 7125 to a floating rate based on a libor spread the terms of the swap mirror those of the debt with interest paid semiannually this swap qualifies as a fair value hedge under gaap the gain or loss on this derivative instrument as well as the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in current income as interest expense the following table summarizes these gains and losses for the years presented below 



commodity price risk 

we are exposed to fluctuations in commodity prices due to contractual agreements with component suppliers in order to protect ourselves against future price volatility and consequently fluctuations in gross margins we periodically enter into commodity swap contracts with designated banks to fix the cost of certain raw material purchases with the objective of minimizing changes in inventory cost due to market price fluctuations the swap contracts are derivative contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges under gaap the effective portion of the unrealized gain or loss is deferred and reported as a component of aocl when the hedged forecasted transaction purchase occurs the unrealized gain or loss is reclassified into income in the same line item associated with the hedged transaction in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects income the ineffective portion of the hedge if any is recognized in current income in the period in which the ineffectiveness occurs as of december 31 2010 we expect to reclassify an unrealized net gain of 15 million from aocl to income over the next year for the year ended december 31 2010 there were no material circumstances that would have resulted in the discontinuance of a cash flow hedge for the year ended december 31 2009 we discontinued hedge accounting on certain contracts where the forecasted transactions were no longer probable the amount reclassified to income as a result of this action was a loss of 4 million our internal policy allows for managing these cash flow hedges for up to three years 

as of december 31 2010 the potential gain or loss related to the outstanding commodity swap contracts assuming a hypothetical 10 percent fluctuation in the price of such commodities was 8 million the sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in commodity prices assumes the notional value to remain constant for the next 12 months the analysis ignores the impact of commodity price movements on our competitive position and potential changes in sales levels it should be noted that any change in the value of the swap contracts real or hypothetical would be significantly offset by an inverse change in the value of the underlying hedged items see note 19 derivatives to the consolidated financial statements

patents and trademarks 

we own or control a significant number of patents and trademarks relating to the products we manufacture these patents and trademarks have been granted and registered over a period of years although these patents and trademarks are generally considered beneficial to our operations we do not believe any patent group of patents or trademark other than our leading brand house trademarks is considered significant to our business 

seasonality 

while individual product lines may experience modest seasonal declines in production there is no material effect on the demand for the majority of our products on a quarterly basis with the exception that our power generation segment normally experiences seasonal declines in the first quarter due to general declines in construction spending during this period and our distribution segment normally experiences seasonal declines in first quarter business activity due to holiday periods in asia and australia

we have thousands of customers around the world and have developed longstanding business relationships with many of them we have longterm heavyduty engine supply agreements with paccar and volvo trucks north america we have midrange supply agreements with paccar as its exclusive engine supplier as well as with daimler trucks north america formerly freightliner llc ford and man formerly volkswagen we also have an agreement with chrysler for supplying the engine for use in dodge ram trucks collectively our net sales to these six customers was approximately 22 percent of consolidated net sales in 2009 compared to approximately 21 percent in 2008 and 27 percent in 2007 and individually was less than nine percent of consolidated net sales to any single customer in 2009 compared to less than eight percent in both 2008 and 2007 these agreements contain standard purchase and sale agreement terms covering engine and engine parts pricing quality and delivery commitments as well as engineering product support obligations the basic nature of our agreements with oem customers is that they are longterm price and operations agreements that assure the availability of our products to each customer through the duration of the respective agreements agreements with most oems contain bilateral termination provisions giving either party the right to terminate in the event of a material breach change of control or insolvency or bankruptcy of the other party 

backlog 

as a result of the current recessed economic conditions many of our order lead times have decreased significantly from lead times in prior years while we have supply agreements with some truck and offhighway equipment oems most of our business is transacted through open purchase orders these open orders are historically subject to monthtomonth releases and are subject to cancellation on reasonable notice without cancellation charges and therefore are not considered firm 

research and development expense 

our research and development program is focused on product improvements innovations and cost reductions for our customers we expense research and development expenditures net of contract reimbursements when incurred research and development expenses net of contract reimbursements were 362 million in 2009 422 million in 2008 and 318 million in 2007 contract reimbursements were 92 million in 2009 61 million in 2008 and 52 million in 2007 for 2009 and 2008 approximately 42 percent or 151 million and approximately 27 percent or 116 million respectively were directly related to compliance with 2010 epa emissions standards for 2007 17 percent or 55 million was related to compliance with 2010 epa emissions standards in 2009 we reduced research development and engineering expenses but continued to invest in critical technologies and products for 2010 and beyond we will continue to make investments to improve our current technologies to continue to meet the future emissions requirements around the world and improve fuel economy 

environmental compliance 

sustainability 

in 2009 we continued to be a leader in sustainable business development we have invested significantly in new products and technologies designed to further lower exhaust emissions from our products we have increased our commitment to addressing the global impact of climate change and have introduced our first set of 10 climate change principles that address ways that we plan to become a greater part of the solution and also articulated our positions on key public policy issues surrounding climate change for the fourth consecutive year we were named to the dow jones world sustainability index which recognizes the top 10 percent of the worlds largest 2500 companies in economic environmental and social leadership our sustainability report for 2009 is available on our website at wwwcumminscom 

product environmental compliance 

our engines are subject to extensive statutory and regulatory requirements that directly or indirectly impose standards governing emissions and noise our products comply with all current emissions standards that the environmental protection agency epa the california air resources board carb and other state and international regulatory agencies have established for heavyduty onhighway diesel and gas engines and offhighway engines our ability to comply with these and future emissions standards is an essential element in maintaining our leadership position in regulated markets we have made and will continue to make significant capital and research expenditures to comply with these standards failure to comply with these standards could result in adverse effects on our future financial results 

epa engine certifications 

the current onhighway emissions standards came into effect in the us on january 1 2010 to meet the 2010 us epa heavyduty onhighway emissions standards we are using an evolution of our proven 2007 technology solution to maintain power and torque with substantial fuel economy improvement and maintenance intervals comparable with our 2007 compliant engines we will offer a complete lineup of onhighway engines to meet the nearzero emissions standards midrange and heavyduty engines for epa 2010 require nitrogen oxide nox aftertreatment nox reduction is achieved by an integrated technology solution comprised of the xpi high pressure common rail fuel system selective catalytic reduction scr technology nextgeneration cooled exhaust gas recirculation egr advanced electronic controls proven air handling and the cummins particulate filter the epa and carb have certified that our engines meet the 2010 emission requirements emissions standards in international markets including europe japan mexico australia brazil india and china are becoming more stringent we believe that our experience in meeting us emissions standards leaves us well positioned to take advantage of opportunities in these markets as the need for emissions control capability grows 

federal and california regulations require manufacturers to report failures of emissionsrelated components to the epa and carb when the failure rate reaches a specified level at higher failure rates a product recall may be required in 2009 we submitted three reports to the epa relating to two different defects affecting oxidation catalysts and vehicle labels the oxidation catalyst defect necessitated the campaign of approximately 360 engines 

other environmental statutes and regulations 

expenditures for environmental control activities and environmental remediation projects at our facilities in the us have not been a substantial portion of our annual capital outlays and are not 

expected to be material in 2010 except as follows we believe we are in compliance in all material respects with laws and regulations applicable to our plants and operations 

in the us pursuant to notices received from federal and state agencies andor defendant parties in site environmental contribution actions we have been identified as a potentially responsible party prp under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of 1980 as amended or similar state laws at approximately 19 waste disposal sites based upon our experiences at similar sites we believe that our aggregate future remediation costs will not be significant we have established accruals that we believe are adequate for our expected future liability with respect to these sites 

in addition we have four other sites where we are working with governmental authorities on remediation projects the costs for these remediation projects are not expected to be material

 item 1a risk factors 

set forth below and elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k are some of the principal risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual business results to differ materially from any forwardlooking statements contained in this report and could individually or combined have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial position and cash flows in addition future results could be materially affected by general industry and market conditions changes in laws or accounting rules general us and nonus economic and political conditions including a global economic slowdown fluctuation of interest rates or currency exchange rates terrorism political unrest or international conflicts political instability major health concerns natural disasters commodity prices or other disruptions of expected economic and business conditions these risk factors should be considered in addition to our cautionary comments concerning forwardlooking statements in this report including statements related to markets for our products and trends in our business that involve a number of risks and uncertainties our separate section above cautionary statements regarding forwardlooking information should be considered in addition to the following statements 

although the global economy showed mild signs of recovery in late 2009 a further downturn could materially adversely affect our results of operations financial condition and cash flows again  

although we began to see some signs of improvement in late 2009 the global economy remains fragile the global economic recession that began in late 2008 and continued through 2009 had a significant adverse impact on our business customers and suppliers if the global economy were to take another significant downturn depending upon the length duration and severity of such a socalled doubledip recession our results of operations financial condition and cash flow would almost certainly be materially adversely affected again specifically our revenues would likely decrease we may be forced to consider further restructuring actions we may need to increase our allowance for doubtful accounts our days sales outstanding may increase and we could experience impairments to assets of certain of our businesses 

the discovery of any significant problems with our new epa compliant engine platforms in north america could materially adversely impact our results of operations financial condition and cash flows  

we have received epa and carb certification for our heavyduty isx15 and midrange isb67 isc83 and isl9 engines which went into commercial production in early 2010 certification of these engines confirms that our 2010 engine lineup for onhighway applications meets the near zero emissions levels required for all engines manufactured in 2010 the launch of these new platforms which includes the introduction of scr technology will impact a number of our operating segments and is crucial to our success in north america although these engine platforms have undergone extensive testing and we believe that they are ready for production the discovery of any significant problems in these platforms could result in delays in our product launches recall campaigns increased warranty costs reputational risk and brand risk 

we may need to write off significant investments in our new lightduty diesel engine platforms if customer commitments further deteriorate 

we began development of a new lightduty diesel engine platform in july 2006 to be used in a variety of on and offhighway applications since that time and as of december 31 2009 we have capitalized investments of approximately 216 million market uncertainty due to the global recession has resulted in some customers delaying or cancelling their vehicle programs while others remain on schedule if customer expectations or volume projections further deteriorate from our current levels and we do not identify new customers we may need to recognize an impairment charge and write the asset down to net realizable value 

we are vulnerable to supply shortages from singlesourced suppliers  

for 2009 we single sourced approximately 70 to 80 percent of the total types of parts in our product designs any delay in our suppliers deliveries may adversely affect our operations at multiple manufacturing locations forcing us to seek alternative supply sources to avoid serious disruptions delays may be caused by factors affecting our suppliers including capacity constraints labor disputes economic downturns availability of credit the impaired financial condition of a particular supplier suppliers allocations to other purchasers weather emergencies or acts of war or terrorism any extended delay in receiving critical supplies could impair our ability to deliver products to our customers 

government regulation could adversely affect our business  

our engines are subject to extensive statutory and regulatory requirements governing emissions and noise including standards imposed by the epa the european union state regulatory agencies such as the california air resources board carb and other regulatory agencies around the world we have made and will be required to continue to make significant capital and research expenditures to comply with these regulatory standards developing engines to meet changing government regulatory requirements with different implementation timelines and emissions requirements makes developing engines efficiently for multiple markets complicated and could result in substantial additional costs that may be difficult to recover in certain markets in some cases we may be required to develop new products to comply with new regulations particularly those relating to air emissions for example we were required to develop new engines to comply with stringent emissions standards in the us by january 1 2010 while we were able to meet this and previous deadlines our ability to comply with other existing and future regulatory standards will be essential for us to maintain our position in the engine markets we serve further the successful development and introduction of new and enhanced products in order to comply with new regulatory requirements are subject to other risks such as delays in product development cost overruns and unanticipated technical and manufacturing difficulties 

greenhouse gas legislation or regulation could adversely affect our business 

there is growing consensus that some form of us federal legislation andor regulation may be forthcoming with respect to regulating manufacturers greenhouse gas emissions any such regulation could result in the imposition on us of significant additional costs in the form of taxes manufacturing restrictions andor emission allowances the impact of any future mandatory greenhouse gas legislative regulatory andor product standard requirements on our global businesses is dependent on the design terms and applicability of the mandate or standard we are unable to predict whether andor the extent to which any of these potential requirements will be enacted or imposed upon us 

our products are exposed to variability in material and commodity costs  

our businesses establish prices with our customers in accordance with contractual time frames however the timing of market price increases may prevent us from passing these additional costs on to our customers through timely pricing actions additionally higher material and commodity costs around the world may offset our efforts to reduce our cost structure while we customarily enter into financial transactions to address some of these risks there can be no assurance that commodity price fluctuations will not adversely affect our results of operations financial condition and cash flows in addition while the use of commodity price hedging instruments may provide us with protection from adverse fluctuations in commodity prices by utilizing these instruments we potentially forego the benefits that might result from favorable fluctuations in price as a result higher material and commodity costs as well as hedging these commodity costs during periods of decreasing prices both could result in declining margins 

we are subject to currency exchange rate and other related risks  

we conduct operations in many areas of the world involving transactions denominated in a variety of currencies we are subject to currency exchange rate risk to the extent that our costs are denominated in currencies other than those in which we earn revenues in addition since our financial statements are denominated in us dollars changes in currency exchange rates between the us dollar and other currencies have had and will continue to have an impact on our results of operations while we customarily enter into financial transactions to address these risks there can be no assurance that currency exchange rate fluctuations will not adversely affect our results of operations financial condition and cash flows in addition while the use of currency hedging instruments may provide us with protection from adverse fluctuations in currency exchange rates by utilizing these instruments we potentially forego the benefits that might result from favorable fluctuations in currency exchange rates 

we also face risks arising from the imposition of exchange controls and currency devaluations exchange controls may limit our ability to convert foreign currencies into us dollars or to remit dividends and other payments by our foreign subsidiaries or businesses located in or conducted within a country imposing controls currency devaluations result in a diminished value of funds denominated in the currency of the country instituting the devaluation 

further deterioration in the north american and european automotive industries could adversely impact our business  

a number of companies in the global automotive industry continue to experience financial difficulties in north america general motors corporation gm ford motor company and chrysler group llc chrysler have experienced declining markets furthermore gm and chrysler have filed for and then exited bankruptcy under chapter 11 of the us bankruptcy code and have accepted substantial monetary infusions from the united states government automakers across europe and japan are also experiencing difficulties from a weakened economy and tightening credit markets because many of our suppliers also supply automotive industry participants the difficult automotive 

industry conditions have also adversely affected our supply base lower production levels for some of our key suppliers increases in certain raw material commodity and energy costs and the global credit market crisis have resulted in severe financial distress among many companies within the automotive supply base the continuation of financial distress within the automotive industry and our shared supply base andor the subsequent bankruptcy of one or more additional automakers may lead to further supplier bankruptcies commercial disputes supply chain interruptions supplier requests for company sponsored capital support or a collapse of the supply chain 

significant declines in future financial and stock market conditions could diminish our pension plan asset performance and adversely impact our results of operations financial condition and cash flows  

we sponsor both funded and unfunded domestic and foreign defined benefit pension and other retirement plans our pension expense and the required contributions to our pension plans are directly affected by the value of plan assets the projected and actual rates of return on plan assets and the actuarial assumptions we use to measure our defined benefit pension plan obligations including the discount rate at which future projected and accumulated pension obligations are discounted to a present value we could experience increased pension expense due to a combination of factors including the decreased investment performance of pension plan assets decreases in the discount rate and changes in our assumptions relating to the expected return on plan assets 

significant declines in future financial and stock market conditions could cause material losses in our pension plan assets which could result in increased pension expense in future years and adverse changes to our financial condition we may be legally required to make contributions to our us pension plans in the future and these contributions could be material in addition if local legal authorities increase the minimum funding requirements for our pension plans outside the us we could be required to contribute more funds 

we are exposed to political economic and other risks that arise from operating a multinational business 

approximately 52 percent of our net sales for 2009 were attributable to customers outside the us compared to 59 percent in 2008 accordingly our business is subject to the political economic and other risks that are inherent in operating in numerous countries these risks include 

• the difficulty of enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through foreign legal systems • trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements • the imposition of withholding requirements on foreign income and tax rates in certain foreign countries that exceed those in the us • the imposition of tariffs exchange controls or other restrictions • difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations and the application of foreign labor regulations • required compliance with a variety of foreign laws and regulations and • changes in general economic and political conditions in countries where we operate particularly in emerging markets as we continue to operate our business globally our success will depend in part on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these and other related risks there can be no assurance that the consequences of these and other factors relating to our multinational operations will not have a material adverse effect upon us 

our business is exposed to risks of product liability claims  

we face an inherent business risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that our products failure to perform to specification results or is alleged to result in property damage bodily injury andor death we may experience material product liability losses in the future while we maintain insurance coverage with respect to certain product liability claims we may not be able to obtain such insurance on acceptable terms in the future if at all and any such insurance may not provide adequate coverage against product liability claims in addition product liability claims can be expensive to defend and can divert the attention of management and other personnel for significant periods of time regardless of the ultimate outcome an unsuccessful defense of a significant product liability claim could have a material adverse effect upon us in addition even if we are successful in defending against a claim relating to our products claims of this nature could cause our customers to lose confidence in our products and us 

our products are subject to recall for performancerelated issues  

our products may be subject to recall for performancerelated or safetyrelated issues product recalls subject us to harm to our reputation loss of current and future customers reduced revenue and product recall costs product recall costs are incurred when we decide either voluntarily or involuntarily to recall a product through a formal campaign to solicit the return of specific products due to a known or suspected performance issue 

our truck manufacturers and oem customers may not continue to outsource their engine supply needs  

several of our engine customers including paccar inc volvo ab and chrysler are truck manufacturers or oems that manufacture engines for some of their own products despite their engine manufacturing abilities these customers have historically chosen to outsource certain types of engine production to us due to the quality of our engine products our emissions capability our systems integration their customers preferences their desire for cost reductions their desire for eliminating production risks and their desire to maintain company focus however there can be no assurance that these customers will continue to outsource or outsource as much of their engine production in the future increased levels of oem vertical integration could result from a number of factors such as shifts in our customers business strategies acquisition by a customer of another engine manufacturer the inability of thirdparty suppliers to meet product specifications and the emergence of lowcost production opportunities in foreign countries any significant reduction in the level of engine production outsourcing from our truck manufacturer or oem customers could have a material adverse effect upon us 

our operations are subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations  

our plants and operations are subject to increasingly stringent environmental laws and regulations in all of the countries in which we operate including laws and regulations governing air emissions discharges to water and the generation handling storage transportation treatment and disposal of waste materials while we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with these environmental laws and regulations there can be no assurance that we will not be adversely impacted by costs liabilities or claims with respect to existing or subsequently acquired operations under either present laws and regulations or those that may be adopted or imposed in the future we are also subject to laws requiring the cleanup of contaminated property if a release of hazardous substances occurs at or from any of our current or former properties or at a landfill or another location where we have disposed of hazardous materials we may be held liable for the contamination and the amount of such liability could be material 

we rely on income from investees that we do not directly control 

our net income includes significant equity royalty and interest income from investees that we do not directly control for 2009 we recognized 214 million of equity royalty and interest income from investees the majority of our equity royalty and interest income from investees comes from our 13 unconsolidated north american distributors and from two of our joint ventures in china dongfeng cummins engine company ltd dcec and chongqing cummins engine company ltd ccec our equity ownership interests in our unconsolidated north american distributors generally range from 30 percent to 50 percent we have 50 percent equity ownership interests in dcec and ccec as a result although a significant percentage of our net income is derived from these unconsolidated entities we do not unilaterally control their management or operations which put a substantial portion of our net income at risk from the actions or inactions of these other entities a significant reduction in the level of contribution by these entities to our net income would likely have a material adverse effect upon us 

we face reputational and legal risk from affiliations with foreign joint venture partners  

several of our joint venture partners are domiciled in areas of the world with laws rules and business practices that differ from those in the us although we strive to select joint venture partners who share our values and understand our reporting requirements as a us domiciled company and to ensure that an appropriate business culture exists within these ventures to minimize and mitigate our risk we nonetheless face the reputational and legal risk that our joint venture partners will violate applicable laws rules and business practices 

unanticipated changes in our tax provisions the adoption of new us tax legislation or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could adversely affect our profitability  

we are subject to ongoing tax audits in various us and foreign jurisdictions tax authorities may disagree with certain tax reporting positions taken by us and as a result assess additional taxes against us we regularly assess the likely outcomes of these audits in order to determine the appropriateness of our tax provision however there can be no assurance that we will accurately predict the outcomes of these audits and the amounts ultimately paid upon resolution of these or subsequent tax audits could be materially different from the amounts previously included in our income tax expense and therefore could have a material impact on our tax provision 

our effective tax rate in the future could be adversely affected by changes to our operating structure changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities changes in tax laws and the discovery of new information in the course of our tax return preparation process in particular the carrying value of deferred tax assets which are predominantly in the us is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income in the us 

president obamas administration has recently announced proposals for new us tax legislation that if adopted could adversely affect our tax rate the proposed changes that could have an impact include the deferral of certain us income tax deductions and foreign tax credit reform although the scope of the proposed changes is unclear it is possible that these or other changes in the us tax laws could increase our effective tax rate and adversely affect our profitability in addition as a result of the economic recession many states are considering new tax legislation to raise revenues and reduce their spending deficits implementation of any of these new tax laws could adversely affect us 

we may be adversely impacted by work stoppages and other labor matters  

as of december 31 2009 we employed approximately 34900 persons worldwide approximately 13200 of our employees worldwide are represented by various unions under collective bargaining 

agreements that expire between 2010 and 2014 while we have no reason to believe that we will be impacted by work stoppages and other labor matters there can be no assurance that future issues with our labor unions will be resolved favorably or that we will not encounter future strikes work stoppages or other types of conflicts with labor unions or our employees any of these consequences may have an adverse effect on us or may limit our flexibility in dealing with our workforce in addition many of our customers have unionized work forces work stoppages or slowdowns experienced by our customers could result in slowdowns or closures at vehicle assembly plants where our engines are installed if one or more of our customers experience a material work stoppage it could have a material adverse effect on our operations 

we face significant competition in the markets we serve  

the markets in which we operate are highly competitive we compete worldwide with a number of other manufacturers and distributors that produce and sell similar products our products primarily compete on the basis of price performance fuel economy speed of delivery quality and customer support there can be no assurance that our products will be able to compete successfully with the products of these other companies for a more complete discussion of the competitive environment in which each of our segments operates see operating segments in item 1 business

in june 2008 four of our sites in southern indiana including our technical center experienced extensive flood damage we have submitted a claim for 237 million to our insurance carriers which includes a claim for business interruption our insurance carriers have disputed certain aspects of our claim and each party has filed suit against the other although we believe that we should be insured against the full amount of such claim there can be no assurance that we will be successful in pursuing these claims

 item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

organization of information 

the following managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations mda was prepared to provide the reader with a view and perspective of our businesses through the eyes of management and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes to those financial statements our mda is presented in the following sections 

• executive summary and financial highlights • results of operations • restructuring and other charges • operating segment results • liquidity and capital resources • contractual obligations and other commercial commitments • off balance sheet financing • application of critical accounting estimates • recently adopted and recently issued accounting pronouncements executive summary and financial highlights 

we are a global power leader that designs manufactures distributes and services diesel and natural gas engines electric power generation systems and enginerelated component products including filtration exhaust aftertreatment fuel systems controls and air handling systems we sell our products to original equipment manufacturers oems distributors and other customers worldwide we have longstanding relationships with many of the leading manufacturers in the markets we serve including paccar inc daimler trucks north america chrysler group llc volvo ab ford motor company komatsu man nutzfahrzeuge ag formerly volkswagen and case new holland we serve our customers through a network of more than 500 companyowned and independent distributor locations and approximately 5200 dealer locations in more than 190 countries and territories 

our reportable operating segments consist of the following engine power generation components and distribution this reporting structure is organized according to the products and markets each segment serves and allows management to focus its efforts on providing enhanced service to a wide range of customers the engine segment produces engines and parts for sale to customers in onhighway and various industrial markets the engines are used in trucks of all sizes buses and recreational vehicles as well as various industrial applications including construction mining agriculture marine oil and gas rail and military the power generation segment is an integrated provider of power systems which sells engines generator sets and alternators the components segment sells filtration products exhaust aftertreatment systems turbochargers and fuel systems the distribution segment includes whollyowned and partiallyowned distributorships engaged in wholesaling engines generator sets and service parts as well as performing service and repair activities on our products and maintaining relationships with various oems throughout the world 

our financial performance depends in large part on varying conditions in the markets we serve particularly the onhighway construction and general industrial markets demand in these markets tends to fluctuate in response to overall economic conditions and is particularly sensitive to changes in interest rate levels and our customers access to credit our sales may also be impacted by oem inventory levels and production schedules and stoppages economic downturns in markets we serve 

generally result in reductions in sales and pricing of our products as a worldwide business our operations are also affected by political economic and regulatory matters including environmental and emissions standards in the countries we serve at the same time our geographic diversity and broad product and service offerings have helped limit the impact from a drop in demand in any one industry or customer and the economy of any single country on our consolidated results 

the global economic downturn in 2009 extensively challenged most of our businesses and the markets in which they operate all of our operating segments incurred double digit declines in net sales and three business units incurred a decrease in ebit ranging from 44 percent to 56 percent our joint ventures throughout the world also experienced severe downturns in operating results causing income from equity investees to decline 15 percent we experienced significant decreases in market demand for many of our products the challenging worldwide economy impacted all of our business units in different ways our power generation and distribution businesses which have longer lead times began to see declines in 2009 while our other businesses started to experience declines in the second half of 2008 especially in the fourth quarter demand in most of our markets around the world appears to have reached bottom and we believe those markets have stabilized at these lower levels we are also seeing improvements in emerging markets including china india and brazil the economy in the united states us while showing some signs of recovery still remains fragile and unemployment continues to remain high in the second half of 2009 we experienced increased sales in our global engine markets and in north america we experienced a temporary increase in engine and related component demand prior to the 2010 emissions standard change the increased demand was consistent with sales trends we observed in prior emissions implementations and was the primary reason for sales to us markets increasing to 48 percent of total net sales in 2009 compared with 41 percent of total net sales in 2008 throughout the year we took actions to align our businesses with reduced customer demand particularly in the first nine months of 2009 these actions included global workforce reductions and closing certain manufacturing operations costs associated with these restructuring actions in conjunction with significantly reduced demand and volumes negatively impacted our operating results in 2009 compared to 2008 and 2007 results at the same time we took actions which enabled us to end the year with a stronger balance sheet we closely monitored our receivables and customer relationships reduced inventories 25 percent reduced capital expenditures 43 percent and increased our cash and marketable securities by over 06 billion generating over 11 billion in cash from operations at the same time we lowered our debt to capital ratio maintained our credit ratings improved our pension funding through increased contributions and strong returns and our 11 billion line of credit remains unused 

as a result of the temporary increase in sales in the second half of 2009 and the challenging economy we expect new environmental protection agency epa emission compliant engine and component demand will be weak in the first half of 2010 excluding the emerging markets we expect overall demand in most of our businesses to remain at relatively low levels for the first half of 2010 

while we expect overall demand for most of our products to be weak in the first half of 2010 with some improvements in demand in emerging markets the actions that we initiated in late 2008 and throughout 2009 will continue to enable us to navigate through the challenging economic environment and will position us to respond to market conditions when and where they improve our short term priorities remain 

• continue to earn a solid profit • continue to align our cost structure and manufacturing capacity with real demand for our products • continue to invest in critical technologies products and capacity and • continue to demonstrate that we care about our customers more than anyone else 30 

net income attributable to cummins inc was 428 million or 216 per diluted share on sales of 108 billion compared to 2008 net income attributable to cummins inc of 755 million or 384 per diluted share on sales of 143 billion the decrease in income was driven by a 25 percent decrease in net sales and a 26 percent decrease in gross margin as we were impacted by lower demand across most of our businesses focused cost reduction efforts helped mitigate the impact of lower volumes restructuring and other charges in 2009 were 99 million 65 million aftertax or 033 per diluted share for a detailed discussion of restructuring see note 3 restructuring and other charges to our consolidated financial statements  

results of operations 



2009 vs 2008 

net sales 

net sales decreased in all segments primarily due to lower demand as a result of the global economic downturn the primary drivers were 

• engine segment sales declined by 27 percent primarily due to industrial sales decreasing by 40 percent and onhighway sales decreasing by 16 percent • power generation segment sales declined by 31 percent due to declines in all lines of business led by the commercial products line of business • components segment sales declined by 25 percent due to declines in all lines of business led by the filtration and turbochargers businesses • distribution segment sales declined by 18 percent a more detailed discussion of sales by segment is presented in the operating segment results section 

gross margin 

significant drivers of the change in gross margins were as follows 



gross margin decreased by 771 million and as a percentage of sales decreased by 04 percentage points the decrease was led by lower volumes which were partially offset by increased engine purchases ahead of the january 1 2010 emissions standards change improved pricing and decreased production costs the overall decrease in volumes was due to lower sales resulting from the global economic downturn our warranty provision on sales in 2009 was 33 percent compared to 29 percent in 2008 our 2008 warranty expense included 117 million recorded in the fourth quarter associated with increases in the estimated warranty liability primarily for certain midrange engine products launched in 2007 the accrual rates in 2009 for these related engine products were higher than those recorded in 2008 before this change in estimate as such our warranty as a percent of sales for these engine families is higher on products sold in 2009 than it was in 2008 overall our relative product mix also impacted the rate as a percent of sales when comparing these two periods 

a more detailed discussion of margin by segment is presented in the operating segment results section 

selling general and administrative expenses 

selling general and administrative expenses decreased primarily due to a decrease of 74 million in discretionary spending in order to conserve cash and a decrease of 71 million in compensation and related expenses compensation and related expenses include salaries fringe benefits and variable 

compensation salaries and fringe benefits decreased due to severance actions taken throughout 2009 overall selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales increased to 115 percent in 2009 from 101 percent in 2008 primarily due to the 25 percent decrease in net sales 

research development and engineering expenses 

research development and engineering expenses decreased primarily due to a decrease in the number of engineering projects to conserve cash while focusing on the development of critical technologies and new products and increased reimbursements from third parties for engineering projects overall research development and engineering expenses as a percentage of sales increased to 34 percent in 2009 from 29 percent in 2008 primarily due to the 25 percent decrease in net sales 

equity royalty and interest income from investees 

equity royalty and interest income from investees decreased primarily due to the following changes in equity income 



these decreases were primarily due to lower demand as a result of the global economic conditions the effects of the global economic downturn were partially offset by modest increases in some markets 

other operating expense income net 

other operating expense income was as follows 



1 the flood gain represents flood insurance proceeds received during the third and fourth quarters of 2009 which more than offset flood related expenses recognized in 2008 and 2009 

interest income 

interest income decreased primarily due to lower interest rates in 2009 compared to 2008 

interest expense 

interest expense decreased primarily due to declining shortterm interest rates 

other expense income net 

other expense income was as follows 



1 the foreign currency exchange losses in 2009 and 2008 were due to unfavorable currency fluctuations especially with the british pound and the brazilian real in 2009 and the british pound the euro the australian dollar and the indian rupee in 2008 2 the change in the cash surrender value of corporate owned life insurance was due to market deterioration especially in the fourth quarter of 2008 which included the write down of certain investments to zero 

income tax expense 

our income tax rates are generally less than the 35 percent us income tax rate primarily because of lower taxes on foreign earnings and research tax credits our effective tax rate for 2009 was 244 percent compared to 306 percent for 2008 the decrease is due to tax on foreign earnings which are subject to lower tax rates and an increase in research tax credits our 2009 income tax provision also includes a 29 million 45 percent reduction in the fourth quarter related to adjustments to deferred tax accounts we released 19 million 30 percent of deferred tax liabilities on foreign earnings now considered to be permanently reinvested outside the us and recorded a deferred tax asset of 10 million 15 percent related to prior period matters 

we expect our 2010 effective tax rate to be 32 percent excluding any discrete items that may arise the research tax credit expired december 31 2009 and has not yet been renewed by congress if the research credit is extended we would anticipate the 2010 effective tax rate to drop to 30 percent 

noncontrolling interests 

noncontrolling interests eliminate the income or loss attributable to noncummins ownership interests in our consolidated entities noncontrolling interests decreased primarily due to lower income of 8 million at cummins india limited a publicly traded company at various exchanges in india as a result of the decline in demand due to the global economic downturn there were no other individual fluctuations in the subsidiaries that were significant 

net income attributable to cummins inc and diluted earnings per share attributable to cummins inc 

net income attributable to cummins inc and diluted earnings per share attributable to cummins inc decreased primarily due to significantly lower volumes restructuring and other charges and decreased equity income partially offset by a lower effective tax rate 

outlook 

nearterm 

many of the markets we serve have slowed significantly as a result of the credit crisis and the challenging global economic environment however demand in most of our markets appears to have reached bottom and we are seeing signs that markets have stabilized at these levels we are also seeing improvement in emerging markets including china india and brazil consistent with prior emissions standards implementation the north american onhighway markets experienced increased demand prior to the implementation of the epas 2010 emissions standards based on our prior experience we expect epa 2010 engine and component sales to onhighway oem customers to be very weak in the first half of 2010 in most of our other markets we expect demand to remain stable with current levels for the first half of 2010 while we expect emerging markets to have sales comparable to 2008 levels 

longterm 

while there is uncertainty in the nearterm market as a result of the current economic conditions and market dynamics surrounding the epa 2010 emissions standards change we are confident that opportunities for longterm growth and profitability will continue in the future 

2008 vs 2007 

net sales 

net sales increased in all segments due to the following drivers 

• our commercial power generation business experienced increased demand especially internationally • we increased our market share in north american includes the us and canada and excludes mexico heavyduty truck and mediumduty truck and bus markets • demand in industrial engine markets increased particularly the international construction and commercial marine markets • our distribution segment benefited from increased demand as well as the acquisition of a majority interest in three previously independent distributors • our turbocharger and emissions solutions businesses experienced increased demand • we had a favorable impact from foreign currency translation a detailed discussion of sales by segment is presented in the operating segment results section 

gross margin 

significant drivers of the change in gross margin were as follows 



gross margin increased by 384 million and as a percentage of sales increased by 09 percentage points benefits from increased pricing and a more favorable volumemix of products sold were partially offset by higher material costs reflecting the increase in commodity prices during the year and higher warranty expense our warranty expense reflected favorable warranty experience for some engine products and our provision related to sales in 2008 was 29 percent of sales down from 31 percent in 2007 this result was more than offset by negative trends primarily in certain midrange engine products launched in 2007 for which we recorded additional warranty liability of approximately 117 million in the fourth quarter of 2008 

a more detailed discussion of margin by segment is presented in the operating segment results section 

selling general and administrative expenses 

selling general and administrative expenses increased primarily due to increased consulting expenses of 36 million increased compensation and related expenses of approximately 34 million and the acquisition of a majority ownership interest in three previously independent north american distributors increased headcount and compensation and related expenses included salaries variable compensation and fringe benefits across the business in support of higher volumes and business growth overall selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales increased to 101 percent in 2008 from 99 percent in 2007 

research development and engineering expenses 

research development and engineering expenses increased significantly primarily due to higher spending on development programs for future products including increased headcount compensation and related expenses compensation and related expenses include salaries variable compensation and fringe benefits fluctuations in other miscellaneous research and development expenses were not significant individually or in the aggregate overall research development and engineering expenses as a percentage of sales increased to 29 percent in 2008 from 25 percent in 2007 

equity royalty and interest income from investees 

equity royalty and interest income from investees decreased primarily due to the following 



results from our north american distributors increased primarily due to income from a joint venture which we formed in the fourth quarter of 2007 dcec sales increased largely due to prebuy activity in the first half of 2008 prior to a midyear emissions change ccec increased primarily due to increased sales volumes tcl experienced decreased sales volumes for the year while mercruiser profits declined due to significant deterioration in the recreational marine market and increased research development and engineering expenses 

other operating expense income net 

other operating expense income was as follows 



1 the decrease in the gain on sale of fixed assets was primarily due to the 10 million gain on the sale of universal silencer in 2007 2 the increase in amortization of other intangibles was primarily due to amortization of purchased premiums related to the acquisition of a north american distributor in 2008 

interest income 

interest income decreased primarily due to lower average cash balances in 2008 compared to 2007 

interest expense 

interest expense decreased primarily due to declining shortterm interest rates and a benefit from our interest rate swap 

other expense income net 

other expense income was as follows 



1 the change in the cash surrender value of corporate owned life insurance was due to market deterioration especially in the fourth quarter of 2008 which included the write down of certain investments to zero 2 the foreign currency exchange losses in 2008 were due to unfavorable currency fluctuations in 2008 especially with the british pound the euro the australian dollar and the indian rupee 

income tax expense 

our income tax rates are generally less than the 35 percent us income tax rate primarily because of lower taxes on foreign earnings and research tax credits our effective tax rate for 2008 was 306 percent compared to 326 percent for 2007 the decrease is primarily due to greater foreign earnings in 2008 which are subject to lower tax rates our 2008 income tax provision also included a 10 million 08 percent reduction in the fourth quarter due to the legislative reinstatement of the us research tax credit 

noncontrolling interests 

noncontrolling interests eliminate the income or loss attributable to noncummins ownership interests in our consolidated entities noncontrolling interests increased primarily due to higher income of 10 million at cummins india limited a publicly traded company at various exchanges in india due to the creation of a new export business in 2008 and favorable price adjustments for high horsepower products there were no other individual fluctuations in the subsidiaries that were significant 

net income attributable to cummins inc and diluted earnings per share attributable to cummins inc 

net income attributable to cummins inc and diluted earnings per share attributable to cummins inc increased primarily due to higher volumes improved margins higher equity income and a lower effective tax rate these increases were partially offset by warranty expense restructuring charges and investment losses primarily occurring during the fourth quarter of 2008 in addition to unfavorable foreign currency effects 

restructuring and other charges 

2009 restructuring actions 

in 2009 we executed restructuring actions in response to a reduction in orders in most of our us and foreign markets due to the continuing deterioration in the global economy we reduced our global workforce by approximately 1000 professional employees in addition we took numerous employee 

actions at many of our manufacturing locations including approximately 3200 hourly employees significant downsizing at numerous facilities and complete closure of several facilities and branch distributor locations employee termination and severance costs were recorded based on approved plans developed by the businesses and corporate management which specified positions to be eliminated benefits to be paid under existing severance plans union contracts or statutory requirements and the expected timetable for completion of the plan estimates of restructuring were made based on information available at the time charges were recorded due to the inherent uncertainty involved actual amounts paid for such activities may differ from amounts initially recorded and we may need to revise previous estimates 

we incurred 2 million of restructuring expenses for lease terminations and 5 million of restructuring expenses for asset impairments in response to closures and downsizing noted above during 2009 we recorded a total pretax restructuring charge of 85 million comprising 90 million of charges related to 2009 actions net of the 3 million favorable change in estimate related to 2008 actions and the 2 million favorable change in estimate related to earlier 2009 actions in restructuring and other charges in our consolidated statements of income  these restructuring actions included 



in addition as a result of the restructuring actions described above we also recorded a 14 million curtailment loss in our pension and other postretirement plans see note 12 pension and other postretirement benefits to our consolidated financial statements for additional detail 

at december 31 2009 of the approximately 4200 employees affected by this plan all terminations were substantially complete if the 2009 restructuring actions are successfully implemented we expect the annualized savings from the professional actions to be approximately 50 million our charge related to the professional actions was approximately 30 million approximately 40 percent of the savings from the restructuring actions will be realized in cost of sales 45 percent in selling general and administrative expenses and 15 percent in research development and engineering expenses we expect the accrual to be paid in cash which will be funded with cash generated from operations 

the following table summarizes the balance of accrued restructuring charges by expense type and the changes in the accrued amounts for the applicable periods the restructuring related accruals were recorded in other accrued expenses in our consolidated balance sheets  



we do not include restructuring and other charges in our operating segment results the pretax impact of allocating restructuring and other charges to the segment results would have been as follows 



2008 restructuring actions 

we executed restructuring actions primarily in the form of voluntary and involuntary separation programs in the fourth quarter of 2008 these actions were in response to the continued deterioration in our us businesses and most key markets around the world in the second half of 2008 as well as a reduction in orders in most us and global markets for 2009 we reduced our worldwide professional workforce by approximately 650 employees or 45 percent we offered a voluntary retirement package to certain active professional employees in the us based on a clearly defined set of criteria we also took voluntary and involuntary actions which included approximately 800 hourly employees the majority of which received severance benefits the compensation packages contained salary and continuation of benefits including health care life insurance and outplacement services the voluntary retirement package was accepted by approximately 150 employees the remaining professional reductions of 500 employees were involuntary the expenses recorded during the year ended december 31 2008 included severance costs related to both voluntary and involuntary terminations during 2008 we incurred a pretax charge related to the professional and hourly restructuring initiatives of approximately 37 million 

employee termination and severance costs were recorded based on approved plans developed by the businesses and corporate management which specified positions to be eliminated benefits to be paid under existing severance plans or statutory requirements and the expected timetable for completion of the plan estimates of restructuring were made based on information available at the time charges were recorded due to the inherent uncertainty involved actual amounts paid for such activities may differ from amounts initially recorded and we may need to revise previous estimates 

at december 31 2008 of the approximately 1450 employees affected by this plan 1250 had been terminated all terminations were substantially complete as of december 31 2009 we expect the 2008 restructuring actions to yield approximately 45 million to 50 million in annual savings from professional actions approximately 41 percent of the savings from the restructuring actions will be 

realized in cost of sales 44 percent in selling general and administrative expenses and 15 percent in research development and engineering expenses 

the table below summarizes the balance of accrued restructuring expenses for 2008 actions which were included in the balance of other accrued expenses in our consolidated balance sheets as of december 31 2009 and 2008 



we do not include restructuring charges in the segment results the pretax impact of allocating restructuring charges for the year ended december 31 2008 would have been as follows 



there were no material changes to the estimated savings or periods under which we expect to recognize the savings for the 2008 actions 

operating segment results 

our reportable operating segments consist of the following engine power generation components and distribution this reporting structure is organized according to the products and markets each segment serves and allows management to focus its efforts on providing enhanced service to a wide range of customers the engine segment produces engines and parts for sale to customers in onhighway and various industrial markets the engines are used in trucks of all sizes buses and rvs as well as various industrial applications including construction mining agriculture marine oil and gas rail and military the power generation segment is an integrated provider of power systems which sells engines generator sets and alternators the components segment includes sales of filtration products exhaust and aftertreatment systems turbochargers and fuel systems the distribution segment includes whollyowned and partiallyowned distributorships engaged in wholesaling engines generator sets and service parts as well as performing service and repair activities on our products and maintaining relationships with various oems

the accounting policies of our operating segments are the same as those applied in our consolidated financial statements  we prepared the financial results of our operating segments on a 

basis that is consistent with the manner in which we internally disaggregate financial information to assist in making internal operating decisions we have allocated certain common costs and expenses primarily corporate functions among segments differently than we would for standalone financial information prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap these include certain costs and expenses of shared services such as information technology human resources legal and finance we also do not allocate debtrelated items actuarial gains or losses prior service costs or credits restructuring and other charges investment gains or losses flood damage gains or losses or income taxes to individual segments segment ebit may not be consistent with measures used by other companies 

engine segment results 

financial data for the engine segment was as follows 



a summary and discussion of engine segment net sales by market follows 



a summary of unit shipments by engine classification including unit shipments to power generation follows 



2009 vs 2008 

net sales 

engine segment sales experienced deterioration across all major markets versus 2008 as a result of the global economic downturn the following are the primary drivers by market 

• industrial market sales decreased due to deterioration in units sold in the construction marine and mining markets by 63 percent 45 percent and 50 percent respectively • stationary power market sales declined due to decreased sales to the power generation segment as it used existing inventory to meet declining customer demand • mediumduty truck sales decreased significantly due to a 35 percent decline in international truck units sold as a result of the global economic downturn the us market was impacted by the economic downturn however this was partially offset by increased sales ahead of the january 1 2010 emissions standards change and improving market share • heavyduty truck sales declined as international units sold were down 64 percent we experienced a decline in mexican heavyduty sales due to an increase in heavyduty truck sales in the first six months of 2008 resulting from the increased activity ahead of mexicos july 1 2008 new emissions requirements appreciation of the us dollar and an influx of used trucks into the market from the us and canada permitted under a new law although us truck fleets experienced financial challenges due to a lack of freight and limited access to credit our us heavyduty sales ended the year flat as a result of increased sales in the fourth quarter of 2009 ahead of the january 1 2010 emissions standards change and improving market share total onhighwayrelated sales were 61 percent of total engine segment sales compared to 53 percent in 2008 

segment ebit 

engine segment ebit decreased primarily due to lower gross margin and equity royalty and interest income from investees which were partially offset by decreased selling general and 

administrative expenses and decreased research development and engineering expenses changes in engine segment ebit and ebit as a percentage of sales were as follows 



the decrease in gross margin was primarily due to lower engine volumes in most markets as a result of the global economic downturn which was partially offset by increased sales in the us in the fourth quarter of 2009 ahead of the january 1 2010 emissions standards change price improvements and by cost reduction activities at our manufacturing plants equity royalty and interest income from investees decreased due to significantly lower demand at dcec komatsucummins engine company kcec and cummins mercruiser diesel marine llc the decrease in selling general and administrative expenses and research development and engineering expenses was primarily due to lower discretionary spending higher recovery of engineering expenses from third parties and decreased payroll costs as the result of restructuring actions 

2008 vs 2007 

net sales

• heavyduty sales increased primarily due to an increase in our market share in the north american includes the us and canada and excludes mexico heavyduty truck markets increased mexican heavyduty truck sales in the first six months of 2008 resulting from the prebuy activity ahead of mexicos july 1 2008 new emissions requirements and weaker demand in the first six months of 2007 resulting from the 2006 prebuy to replace trucks ahead of the 2007 emissions standards change • industrial market sales increased primarily related to strength in commercial marine and construction markets • mediumduty truck sales increased due to increased demand in global mediumduty truck markets primarily due to our market share increases in the north american mediumduty truck market weaker demand in the first six months of 2007 resulting from the 2006 prebuy to replace trucks ahead of the 2007 emissions standards change and strong demand in latin america driven by strong economic conditions in brazil in 2008 • stationary power sales increased primarily from intersegment sales to our power generation segment especially internationally • mediumduty bus sales increased due to market share gains in the north american bus market • we had a favorable impact from foreign currency translation these increases were partially offset by a 50 percent decline in units sold to chrysler this decline was due to the deteriorating demand for light duty trucks in north america as the result of the softening us economy and concerns over fuel prices earlier in the year 

total onhighwayrelated sales were 53 percent of total engine segment sales in 2008 compared to 56 percent in 2007 

segment ebit 

engine segment ebit decreased primarily due to increased research development and engineering and increased selling general and administrative expenses which were partially offset by increased gross margin changes in engine segment ebit and ebit as a percentage of sales were as follows 



the increase in research development and engineering expenses was the result of increased spending on emissions related programs the increased selling general and administrative expenses was primarily due to higher payroll costs as the result of salary increases and an increase in the number of segment employees during the year the increase in gross margin was primarily due to price improvements especially in industrial engines and parts and favorable product mix in the onhighway market the increase in gross margin was partially offset by increased warranty expense from the increased mix of newer emissionsdriven products and higher repair costs on certain engines and increased material prices due to higher commodity prices during the year 

power generation segment results

1 represents the acquisition of one distributor in 2009 partially offset by three distributor acquisitions in 2008 

the decrease in gross margin was primarily due to lower sales volumes as a result of the global economic downturn and unfavorable foreign currency translation selling general and administrative expenses decreased primarily due to favorable foreign currency translation lower sales volumes and decreased discretionary spending 

acquisition of a business 

in january 2010 we purchased an additional 50 percent ownership interest in cummins western canada bringing our total ownership interest to 80 percent a new owner purchased the other 20 percent interest from the previous owner the total accounting purchase price of the business is expected to be approximately 105 million to 110 million western canada recorded revenues of 226 million and we recorded equity earnings of 11 million for the year ended december 31 2009 

2008 vs 2007 

net sales 

distribution segment sales increased compared to 2007 as a result of strong organic growth in all regions mainly in europe the south pacific and the middle east we had higher sales of 260 million from the acquisition of a majority ownership interest in three previously independent distributors we had a favorable impact from foreign currency translation the higher sales were led by increased sales volumes in power generation parts and engine volumes followed by service 

segment ebit 

distribution segment ebit increased primarily due to higher margins which were partially offset by increased selling general and administrative expenses changes in distribution segment ebit and ebit as a percentage of sales were as follows 



1 the acquisitions represent the consolidation of three new distributors during the year and one new north american joint venture 

the increase in gross margin was primarily due to the increase in sales volumes for power generation parts and engines followed by service these increases in gross margin were partially offset by unfavorable currency translation the increase in selling general and administrative expenses was primarily due to higher payroll costs as the result of 2008 salary increases and an increase in the number of segment employees including increased costs related to the acquisition of three new distributors and the north american joint venture 

reconciliation of segment ebit to income before income taxes 

the table below reconciles the segment information to the corresponding amounts in the consolidated statements of income  



1 includes intercompany eliminations and unallocated corporate expenses for the year ended december 31 2009 unallocated corporate expenses include 99 million in restructuring and other charges and a gain of 12 million related to flood damage recoveries for the year ended december 31 2008 unallocated corporate expenses include 37 million of restructuring charges a 36 million decrease in cash surrender value in corporate owned life insurance and 5 million of losses related to flood damage recoveries there were no significant unallocated corporate expenses in 2007 

liquidity and capital resources 

managements assessment of liquidity 

we believe our financial condition and liquidity remain strong despite the difficult environment in the us and global economies our strong financial performance particularly in the fourth quarter of 2009 enabled us to finish the year with minimal debt and sizable cash and marketable securities balances this cash performance was driven primarily by improved inventory management controls on capital and discretionary spending and lower repurchases of common stock 

we assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate adequate cash to fund our operating investing and financing activities cash provided by operations is our principal source of liquidity as of december 31 2009 other sources of liquidity include 

• cash and cash equivalents of 930 million • marketable securities of 190 million • 107 billion available under our revolving credit facility • 154 million based on eligible receivables available under our accounts receivable sales program and • 229 million available under international and other domestic credit facilities the maturity schedule of our existing longterm debt does not require significant cash outflows in the intermediate term required annual principal payments range from 17 million to 67 million over each of the next five years 

while the impact of the continued market volatility cannot be predicted we believe our liquidity will provide us with the financial flexibility needed to fund working capital capital expenditures projected pension obligations dividend payments common stock repurchases and debt service obligations 

we have considered the impact of ongoing market instability and credit availability in assessing the adequacy of our liquidity and capital resources and are monitoring the impact on our customers and suppliers we have noticed an impact as reflected in our days sales in receivables but have not seen a significant impact on our results of operations financial position or cash flows in 2009 we expect that general market conditions could impact the rate at which we realize our receivables in the future and could impact eligible receivables under our accounts receivable program however we expect to generate positive cash flow from operations in 2010 we will continue to diligently monitor our receivables for potential slowing in collections that could occur as a result of continued difficult economic conditions and our customers access to credit the overall decline in market valuations negatively impacted the current value of our pension trusts in 2008 however pension assets produced strong positive returns in 2009 

at this time we are comfortable that the currently unused 107 billion credit capacity under our revolving credit facility is available to us this assertion is based upon the fact that we drew upon our revolving credit facility throughout the year with a prompt repayment to confirm participation by the banks included in the facility we successfully tested the facility again in february 2010 as a result we believe our access to liquidity sources has not been materially impacted by the current credit environment and we do not expect that it will be materially impacted in the near future there can be no assurance however that the cost or availability of future borrowings if any in the debt markets or our credit facilities will not be materially impacted by the ongoing capital market disruptions 

a significant portion of our cash flows is generated outside the us more than half of our cash and cash equivalents and most of our marketable securities at december 31 2009 are denominated in 

foreign currencies we manage our worldwide cash requirements considering available funds among the many subsidiaries through which we conduct our business and the cost effectiveness with which those funds can be accessed the repatriation of cash balances from certain subsidiaries could have adverse tax consequences however those balances are generally available without legal restrictions to fund ordinary business operations at the local level we have and will continue to transfer cash from these subsidiaries to us and to other international subsidiaries when it is cost effective to do so 

working capital summary 

we fund our working capital with cash from operations and shortterm borrowings when necessary various assets and liabilities including shortterm debt can fluctuate significantly from month to month depending on shortterm liquidity needs as a result working capital is a prime focus of management attention 



current assets increased primarily due to an increase in cash and cash equivalents caused by managements efforts to conserve cash reduce inventories and limit discretionary spending during the global recession see cash flows below and an increase in receivables the increase in receivables was due to higher sales in global engine markets higher sales in the fourth quarter of 2009 than in the fourth quarter of 2008 as a result of a temporary increase in engine and related component demand prior to the 2010 emissions standards change and the significant decrease in sales in the fourth quarter of 2008 as a result of the onset of the economic recession these increases were partially offset by a decrease in inventories as a result of our efforts to reduce our working capital 

current liabilities decreased primarily due to a decline in other accrued expenses and accounts payable as a result of reduced purchasing volume and controls around discretionary spending 

cash flows 

cash and cash equivalents increased 504 million during the year ended december 31 2009 compared to a 151 million decrease in cash and cash equivalents during the year ended december 31 2008 the change in cash and cash equivalents is as follows 

operating activities 



2009 vs 2008 

net cash provided by operating activities increased for the year ended december 31 2009 compared to 2008 primarily due to favorable working capital fluctuations primarily inventories as a result of managements response to the challenging global economy and increased dividends from our equity investees which were partially offset by decreased income as the result of declining sales managements priorities included reducing inventory aligning our cost and capacity with the real demand for our products and managing the business to generate positive cash flows by improving our working capital 

pensions 

the funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon a variety of variables and assumptions including return on invested assets market interest rates and levels of voluntary contributions to the plans as a result of the credit crisis and the related market recession our pension assets experienced significant deterioration in 2008 the financial market distress of 2008 continued into early 2009 with the debt and equity markets bottoming out in the first quarter in the second half of 2009 the financial markets began to rebound the recovery helped to improve our plan performance thus for the year ended december 31 2009 the return for our us plan was above 18 percent while our uk plan return was above 16 percent the most recent threeyear average return for all of our pension invested assets was slightly above one percent approximately 94 percent of our pension plan assets are invested in highly liquid investments such as equity and fixed income securities the remaining six percent of our plan assets are invested in less liquid but market valued investments including real estate and private equity we made 129 million of pension contributions in 2009 and we anticipate making contributions of 175 million to 185 million to our pension plans in 2010 expected contributions to our defined benefit pension plans in 2010 will meet or exceed the current funding requirements claims and premiums for other postretirement benefits are expected to approximate 53 million in 2010 the 129 million of pension contributions in 2009 included voluntary contributions of 108 million these contributions and payments include payments from our funds either to increase pension plan assets or to make direct payments to participants 

2008 vs 2007 

net cash provided by operating activities increased for the year ended december 31 2008 compared to 2007 primarily due to decreased pension funding increased net income as the result of increased sales and increased equity in earnings net of dividends which was partially offset by unfavorable working capital fluctuations the unfavorable working capital fluctuation was primarily due to an increase in inventory which was primarily to support strong business growth while the decreases in accounts payable and accounts receivable were more reflective of early shutdowns in many of our manufacturing facilities at the close of 2008 as demand softened throughout the fourth quarter the increase in accrued expenses was primarily due to an increase in warranty expense 

investing activities 



2009 vs 2008 

net cash used in investing activities decreased for the year ended december 31 2009 compared to 2008 primarily due to decreased capital expenditures and lower investments in the acquisition of businesses which were partially offset by increased cash paid for investments in marketable securities and lower cash proceeds from the sale of a business these decreases primarily occurred as a result of managements decision to conserve cash and maintain liquidity during the recession 

capital expenditures decreased as management tightened capital spending substantially across all business by limiting expenditures to critical projects and investments in development of new products despite the expected challenges in some of our markets in 2010 our financial position allows us the flexibility to increase capital expenditures for 2010 to approximately 400 million 

2008 vs 2007 

net cash used in investing activities increased for the year ended december 31 2008 compared to 2007 primarily due to an increase in capital expenditures and higher investments in businesses related to the purchase of three previously independent distributors and the acquisition of consolidated diesel corporation a manufacturing facility see note 22 acquisitions and divestitures to the consolidated financial statements for additional information these increases were partially offset by an increase in cash generated from net investments in marketable securities and the proceeds from the sale of a business 

capital expenditures for the year ended december 31 2008 increased 54 percent over 2007 to support our growth and included investments to increase capacity and to fund development of our new products our investments in capacity improvements and development of new products accelerated across all of our businesses 

financing activities 



2009 vs 2008 

net cash used in financing activities decreased for the year ended december 31 2009 compared to 2008 primarily due to the decrease in repurchases of common stock and lower payments on borrowings which was partially offset by a decrease in proceeds from borrowings and higher dividend payments 

our total debt was 704 million as of december 31 2009 compared with 698 million at december 31 2008 total debt as a percent of our total capital including total longterm debt was 149 percent at december 31 2009 compared to 167 percent at december 31 2008 

2008 vs 2007 

net cash used in financing activities decreased for the year ended december 31 2008 compared to 2007 primarily due to the decrease in repurchases of common stock the increase in proceeds from borrowings the increase in proceeds from sale of stock held by employee benefit trust and an increase in net borrowings under shortterm credit arrangements these fluctuations were partially offset by the increase in dividend payments our total debt as of december 31 2008 was 698 million compared to 674 million as of december 31 2007 

total debt as a percent of our total capital including longterm debt was 167 percent at december 31 2008 compared to 154 percent at december 31 2007 the 2008 debt to capital ratio was negatively impacted by a 675 million 433 aftertax charge to cummins inc shareholders equity to recognize the funded status of our defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans 

revolving credit agreement 

on june 30 2008 we entered into a threeyear revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of lenders the credit agreement provides us with a 11 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility the proceeds of which are to be used by us for working capital or other general corporate purposes 

the credit facility matures on june 30 2011 amounts payable under our revolving credit facility will rank pro rata with all of our other unsecured unsubordinated indebtedness up to 100 million under our credit facility is available for swingline loans denominated in us dollars advances under the facility bear interest at i a base rate or ii a rate equal to libor plus an applicable margin based on the credit ratings of our outstanding senior unsecured longterm debt based on our current longterm debt ratings the applicable margin on libor loans was 075 percent per annum as of 

december 31 2009 advances under the facility may be prepaid without premium or penalty subject to customary breakage costs 

the credit agreement includes various covenants including among others maintaining a leverage ratio of no more than 30 to 10 and maintaining fixed charge coverage ratio of at least 15 to 10 as of december 31 2009 we were in compliance with all such covenants including our leverage ratio of 06 to 10 and our fixed charge coverage ratio of 225 to 10 

repurchase of common stock 

in july 2006 the board of directors authorized us to acquire up to eight million shares of cummins common stock in 2007 we repurchased approximately 335 million of common stock at an average cost of 5576 per share representing approximately six million shares this concluded the share repurchase program authorized by the board of directors in july 2006 

in december 2007 the board of directors authorized the acquisition of up to 500 million of cummins common stock we began making purchases under the plan in march 2008 and purchased 128 million of stock during 2008 at an average cost of 5549 per share 

we announced in february 2009 that we had temporarily suspended our stock repurchase program to conserve cash in the fourth quarter of 2009 we lifted the suspension and will from time to time repurchase stock we purchased 20 million of common stock during the fourth quarter at an average cost of 4652 per common share 

quarterly dividends 

in july 2008 our board of directors voted to increase our quarterly cash dividend per share by 40 percent resulting in increasing our cash dividends from 0125 per common share to 0175 per common share cash dividends per share paid to common shareholders for the last three years were as follows 



total dividends paid to common shareholders in 2009 2008 and 2007 were 141 million 122 million and 89 million respectively declaration and payment of dividends in the future depends upon income and liquidity position among other factors and is subject to declaration by our board of directors who meet quarterly to consider the dividend payment we expect to fund dividend payments from cash from operations 

credit rating impact on our credit facilities 

a number of our contractual obligations and financing agreements such as our revolving credit facility and our equipment saleleaseback agreements have restrictive covenants andor pricing modifications that may be triggered in the event of downward revisions to our corporate credit rating there were no downgrades of our credit ratings in 2009 that have impacted these covenants or pricing modifications 

on march 10 2008 standard  poors sp upgraded our senior unsecured debt ratings from bbb to bbb and revised our outlook to stable citing our improved operating performance over the past several years including during the expected emissionsrelated downturn in heavyduty truck 

demand in 2007 combined with significant on and offbalance sheet debt reduction and increased business diversification 

on june 17 2008 fitch upgraded our senior unsecured debt ratings from bbb to bbb citing our recent market share gains and improving credit profile including improvement in our geographic and business diversification in the second quarter of 2009 moodys investor service inc and fitch reaffirmed our credit ratings 

credit ratings are not recommendations to buy and are subject to change and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating in addition we undertake no obligation to update disclosures concerning our credit ratings whether as a result of new information future events or otherwise our ratings and outlook as of december 31 2009 from each of the credit rating agencies are shown in the table below 



contractual obligations and other commercial commitments 

a summary of payments due for our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december 31 2009 is shown in the tables below 



1 includes principal payments and expected interest payments based on the terms of the obligations in february of 2009 we renegotiated our sale and leaseback transaction to extend the term for an additional two years and removed the requirement to provide residual insurance the lease obligations are included in this line item see note 14 commitments and contingencies to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on our sale and leaseback transaction 2 we are contractually obligated to fund 70 million in 2010 however our expected range of total pension contributions for 2010 is approximately 175 million to 185 million after 2010 our contractual agreement is 65 million per year through 2015 

the contractual obligations reported above exclude our unrecognized tax benefits of 56 million all of which is noncurrent as of december 31 2009 we are not able to reasonably estimate the 

period in which cash outflows relating to uncertain tax contingencies could occur see note 4 income taxes to the consolidated financial statements for further details 



off balance sheet financing 

sale of accounts receivable 

in july 2007 we amended our agreement with a financial institution to sell a designated pool of trade receivables to cummins trade receivables llc ctr a whollyowned special purpose subsidiary to extend the facility until july 2010 and raised the purchase limitation from 200 million to 400 million the agreement also provides us with an option to increase the purchase limitation up to 500 million upon approval as necessary ctr may transfer a direct interest in its receivables without recourse to the financial institution to maintain a balance in the designated pools of receivables sold we sell new receivables to ctr as existing receivables are collected receivables sold to ctr in which an interest is not transferred to the financial institution are included in receivables net on our consolidated balance sheets  the maximum interest in sold receivables that can be outstanding at any point in time is limited to the lesser of 400 million or the amount of eligible receivables held by ctr there are no provisions in this agreement that require us to maintain a minimum investment credit rating however the terms of the agreement contain the same financial covenants as our revolving credit facility as of december 31 2009 the amount available under this program was 154 million as of december 31 2009 and 2008 there were no amounts outstanding under this program 

financing arrangements for affiliated parties 

in accordance with the provisions of various joint venture agreements we may purchase andor sell products and components fromto the joint ventures and the joint ventures may sell products and components to unrelated parties the transfer price of products purchased from the joint ventures may differ from normal selling prices certain joint venture agreements transfer product to us at cost some transfer product to us on a costplus basis and other agreements provide for the transfer of products at market value 

application of critical accounting estimates 

a summary of our significant accounting policies is included in note 1 summary of significant accounting policies to our consolidated financial statements which discusses accounting policies that we have selected from acceptable alternatives 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap which often requires management to make judgments estimates and assumptions regarding uncertainties that affect the reported amounts presented and disclosed in the financial statements our management reviews these estimates and assumptions based on historical experience changes in business conditions and other relevant factors they believe to be reasonable under the circumstances in any given reporting period our actual results may differ from the estimates and assumptions used in preparing our consolidated financial statements  

critical accounting estimates are defined as follows the estimate requires management to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the estimate was made different estimates reasonably could have been used or if changes in the estimate are reasonably likely to occur from period to period and the change would have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations our senior management has discussed the development and selection of our accounting policies related accounting estimates and the disclosures set forth below with the audit committee of our board of directors we believe our critical accounting estimates include those addressing the recoverability of an investment related to new products the estimation of liabilities for warranty programs accounting for income taxes pension benefits and annual assessment of recoverability of goodwill 

recoverability of investment related to new products 

we have capitalized 216 million associated with the future launch of our lightduty diesel engine product market uncertainty due to the global recession has resulted in some customers delaying or cancelling their vehicle programs we concluded that events and circumstances indicated that these assets should be reviewed for possible impairment at december 31 2009 we used projections to assess whether future cash flows on an undiscounted basis related to the assets are likely to exceed the related carrying amount to determine if a writedown is appropriate these projections require estimates about product volume and the size of the market for vehicles that are not yet developed we used input from our customers in developing alternative cash flow scenarios our analysis indicated that the assets are recoverable at december 31 2009 if customer expectations or projected volumes deteriorate and we do not identify alternative customers andor product applications we could be required to writedown these assets to net realizable value 

warranty programs 

we estimate and record a liability for warranty programs primarily base warranty and other than product recalls at the time our products are sold our estimates are based on historical experience and reflect managements best estimates of expected costs at the time products are sold and subsequent adjustment to those expected costs when actual costs differ as a result of the uncertainty surrounding the nature and frequency of product recall programs the liability for such programs is recorded when we commit to a recall action which generally occurs when it is announced our warranty liability is generally affected by component failure rates repair costs and the time of failure future events and circumstances related to these factors could materially change our estimates and require adjustments to our liability new product launches require a greater use of judgment in developing estimates until historical experience becomes available product specific experience is typically available four or five quarters after product launch with a clear experience trend evident eight quarters after launch we generally record warranty expense for new products upon shipment using a factor based upon historical experience only in the first year a blend of actual product and historical experience in the second year and product specific experience thereafter note 11 product warranty liability to our consolidated financial statements contains a summary of the activity in our warranty liability account for 2009 and 2008 including adjustments to preexisting warranties 

accounting for income taxes 

we determine our provision for income taxes using the asset and liability method under this method deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax effects of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases future tax benefits of tax loss and credit carryforwards are also recognized as deferred tax assets we evaluate the recoverability of our deferred tax assets each quarter by assessing the likelihood of future profitability and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to 

realize our net deferred tax assets at december 31 2009 we recorded net deferred tax assets of 729 million these assets included 151 million for the value of tax loss and credit carryforwards a valuation allowance of 44 million was recorded to reduce the tax assets to the net value management believed was more likely than not to be realized in the event our operating performance deteriorates future assessments could conclude that a larger valuation allowance will be needed to further reduce the deferred tax assets in addition we operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and are subject to tax audits in these jurisdictions these audits can involve complex issues which may require an extended period of time to resolve we reduce our net tax assets for the estimated additional tax and interest that may result from tax authorities disputing uncertain tax positions we have taken and we believe we have made adequate provision for income taxes for all years that are subject to audit based upon the latest information available a more complete description of our income taxes and the future benefits of our tax loss and credit carryforwards is disclosed in note 4 income taxes to our consolidated financial statements  

pension benefits 

we sponsor a number of pension plans primarily in the us and the uk and to a lesser degree in various other countries in the us and the uk we have several major defined benefit plans that are separately funded we account for our pension programs in accordance with employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans under gaap gaap requires that amounts recognized in financial statements be determined using an actuarial basis as a result our pension benefit programs are based on a number of statistical and judgmental assumptions that attempt to anticipate future events and are used in calculating the expense and liability related to our plans each year at december 31 these assumptions include discount rates used to value liabilities assumed rates of return on plan assets future compensation increases employee turnover rates actuarial assumptions relating to retirement age mortality rates and participant withdrawals the actuarial assumptions we use may differ significantly from actual results due to changing economic conditions participant life span and withdrawal rates these differences may result in a material impact to the amount of net periodic pension expense to be recorded in our consolidated financial statements in the future 

the expected longterm return on plan assets is used in calculating the net periodic pension expense we considered several factors in developing our expected rate of return on plan assets the longterm rate of return considers historical returns and expected returns on current and projected asset allocations and is generally applied to a 5year average market value of return the longterm rate of return on plan assets represents an estimate of longterm returns on an investment portfolio consisting of a mixture of equities fixed income real estate and other miscellaneous investments the differences between the actual return on plan assets and expected longterm return on plan assets are recognized in the asset value used to calculate net periodic expense over five years the table below sets forth the expected return assumptions used to develop our pension expense for the period 20072009 and our expected rate for 2010 



a lower expected rate of return will increase our net periodic pension expense and reduce profitability 

the difference between the expected return and the actual return on plan assets is deferred from recognition in our results of operations and under certain circumstances such as when the difference exceeds 10 percent of the market value of plan assets or the projected benefit obligation pbo 

amortized over future years of service this is also true of changes to actuarial assumptions as of december 31 2009 we had net pension actuarial losses of 801 million and 364 million for the us and nonus pension plans respectively under gaap the actuarial gains and losses are recognized and recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss as these amounts exceed 10 percent of our pbo the excess is amortized over the average remaining service lives of participating employees 

the table below sets forth the net periodic pension expense for the period 2007 through 2009 and our expected expense for 2010 



the increase in periodic pension expense in 2009 was due to lower than historical returns on assets driven by the global economic recession another key assumption used in the development of the net periodic pension expense is the discount rate the discount rates used to develop our net periodic pension expense are set forth in the table below 



changes in the discount rate assumptions will impact the interest cost component of the net periodic pension expense calculation 

the discount rate enables us to state expected future cash payments for benefits as a present value on the measurement date the guidelines for setting this rate are discussed in gaap which suggests the use of a highquality corporate bond rate we used bond information provided by standard  poors for the us and iboxx for the uk all bonds used to develop our hypothetical portfolio in the us and uk were highquality noncallable bonds aa or better as of december 31 2009 the average yield of this hypothetical bond portfolio was used as the benchmark for determining the discount rate to be used to value the obligations of the plans subject to gaap accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions 

our model called for 60 years of benefit payments for the us plans the sum of the cash flows from the 60 bonds matched the cash flow from the benefit payment stream upon completion of the process the number of bonds purchased for each issue was used to determine the price of the entire portfolio the discount rate benchmark was set to the internal rate of return needed to discount the cash flows to arrive at the portfolio price 

in developing the uk discount rate excess cash flows resulted in the early years of the 60year period when the sum of the cash flow from the bonds maturing in later years exceeded the benefit payments in early years thus no bonds maturing in early years are needed as a result the price of the entire portfolio of bonds was too high because all benefit payments were covered with excess cash flow remaining we made no adjustment to the cash flow and the discount rate was determined as the internal rate of return needed to discount the cash flows to arrive at the portfolio price 

the table below sets forth the estimated impact on our 2010 net periodic pension expense relative to a change in the discount rate and a change in the expected rate of return on plan assets 



the above sensitivities reflect the impact of changing one assumption at a time a higher discount rate decreases the plan obligations and decreases our net periodic pension expense a lower discount rate increases the plan obligations and increases our net periodic pension expense it should be noted that economic factors and conditions often affect multiple assumptions simultaneously and the effects of changes in key assumptions are not necessarily linear 

our investment policies in the us and uk provide for the rebalancing of assets to maintain our longterm strategic asset allocation we are committed to its longterm strategy and do not attempt to time the market given empirical evidence that asset allocation is more critical than individual asset or investment manager selection rebalancing of the assets has and continues to occur the rebalancing is critical to having the proper weighting of assets to achieve the expected total portfolio returns 

for the us qualified pension plans our assumptions for the expected return on assets was 825 percent in 2009 projected returns are based primarily on broad publicly traded equity and fixed income indices and forwardlooking estimates of active portfolio and investment management as of december 31 2009 based upon our target asset allocations it is anticipated that our us investment policy will generate an average annual return over the 20year projection period equal to or in excess of 750 percent approximately 40 percent of the time while returns of 870 percent or greater are anticipated 25 percent of the time we expect additional positive returns from active investment management except for the shortterm adverse conditions in the equity markets in 2008 our recent threeyear annual rates of return have all exceeded 850 percent as a result based on the historical returns and forwardlooking return expectations we believe an investment return assumption of 800 percent per year in 2010 for us pension assets is reasonable the methodology used to determine the rate of return on pension plan assets in the uk was based on establishing an equityrisk premium over current longterm bond yields adjusted based on target asset allocations our strategy with respect to our investments in pension plan assets is to be invested with a longterm outlook therefore the risk and return balance of our asset portfolio should reflect a longterm horizon our pension plan asset allocation at december 31 2009 and 2008 and target allocation for 2010 are as follows 



actual cash funding for our us pension plans is governed by employee benefit and tax laws and the pension protection act of 2006 the act the act extends the use of an average corporate bond rate for determining current liabilities for funding purposes among its many provisions the act establishes a 100 percent funding target for plan years beginning after december 31 2007 which has now been extended to 2011 by the us congress due to the recession our funding strategy is to make contributions to our various qualified plans in accordance with statutory funding requirements and any additional contributions we determine are appropriate the table below sets forth our pension contributions for the period 20082009 and our expected range of contributions for 2010 



contributions beyond 2010 will depend on the funded status of our us plans at that time in relation to the targeted funding established under the act and contractual obligations negotiated in the uk 

our pension plans in the us and outside the us were underfunded at december 31 2009 by a total of 522 million due to pension trust asset performance 

under gaap the actuarial gains and losses and prior service costs credits are recognized and recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss increases in actuarial losses reduced our shareholders equity by 11 million aftertax in 2009 the increases resulted from lower discount rates and higher mortality assumptions partially offset by improved plan asset performance in 2009 

note 12 pension and other postretirement benefits to our consolidated financial statements provides a summary of our pension benefit plan activity the funded status of our plans and the amounts recognized in our consolidated financial statements  

annual assessment for recoverability of goodwill 

under gaap accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets the carrying value of goodwill is reviewed annually the fair value of each reporting unit was estimated by discounting the future cash flows less requirements for working capital and fixed asset additions in accordance with gaap our reporting units are generally defined as one level below an operating segment however there were two situations where we have aggregated two or more components which share similar economic characteristics and thus are aggregated into a single reporting unit for testing purposes these two situations are described further below this analysis has resulted in the following reporting units for our goodwill testing 

• within our components operating segment emissions solutions and filtration have been aggregated into a single reporting unit this reporting unit accounts for almost 90 percent of our total goodwill balance at december 31 2009 • also within our components segment our turbocharger business is considered a separate reporting unit • within our power generation segment our alternator business is considered a separate reporting unit • within our engine segment our recon business is considered a separate reporting unit this reporting unit is in the business of remanufacturing and reconditioning engines and certain engine components • our distribution segment is considered a single reporting unit as it is managed geographically and all regions share similar economic characteristics and provide similar products and services 65 

no other reporting units have goodwill our valuation method requires us to make projections of revenue operating expenses working capital investment and fixed asset additions for the reporting units over a multiyear period additionally management must estimate a weightedaverage cost of capital which reflects a market rate for each reporting unit for use as a discount rate the discounted cash flows are compared to the carrying value of the reporting unit and if less than the carrying value a separate valuation of the goodwill is required to determine if an impairment loss has occurred in addition we also perform a sensitivity analysis to determine how much our forecasts can fluctuate before the fair value of a reporting unit would be lower than its carrying amount as of the end of the third quarter in 2009 we performed the annual impairment assessment required by gaap and determined that our goodwill was not impaired at december 31 2009 our recorded goodwill was 364 million approximately 90 percent of which resided in the emissions solutions plus filtration reporting unit for this reporting unit a 10 percent reduction in our estimated future cash flows would not have impacted our assessment changes in our projections or estimates a deterioration of our operating results and the related cash flow effect or a significant increase in the discount rate could decrease the estimated fair value of our reporting units and result in a future impairment of goodwill 

recently adopted and recenty issued accounting pronouncements 

accounting pronouncements recently adopted 

in december 2007 the financial accounting standards board fasb amended its existing standards for business combinations which is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2008 the amended standards make significant changes to both the accounting and disclosures related to the acquisition of a business and could materially impact how we account for future business combination transactions because the standard will only impact transactions entered into after january 1 2009 the amended standards did not impact our consolidated financial statements upon adoption 

in december 2007 the fasb amended its existing standards for noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements which was effective for interim and annual fiscal periods beginning after december 15 2008 the new standard established accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the accounting for future ownership changes with respect to those subsidiaries the new standard defined a noncontrolling interest previously called a minority interest as the portion of equity in a subsidiary not attributable directly or indirectly to a parent the new standard required among other items that a noncontrolling interest be included in the consolidated balance sheet within equity separate from the parents equity consolidated net income to be reported at amounts inclusive of both the parents and noncontrolling interests shares and separately the amounts of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and noncontrolling interest all on the consolidated statements of income and if a subsidiary is deconsolidated any retained noncontrolling equity investment in the former subsidiary be measured at fair value and a gain or loss be recognized in net income based on such fair value we adopted the new standard effective january 1 2009 and applied it retrospectively as a result we reclassified noncontrolling interests of 246 million 292 million and 253 million respectively from the mezzanine section to equity in the december 31 2008 2007 and 2006 balance sheets certain reclassifications have been made to prior period amounts to conform to the presentation of the current period under the new standard 

in march 2008 the fasb amended its existing standards for disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities which was effective for interim and annual fiscal periods beginning after november 15 2008 the new standards require enhanced disclosures about a companys derivative and hedging activities we adopted the new standard effective january 1 2009 and applied it prospectively the new disclosures required are included in note 20 derivatives to our consolidated financial statements  

in june 2009 the fasb amended its existing standards for subsequent events which was effective for interim and annual fiscal periods ending after june 15 2009 and established general standards of accounting for and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued or are available to be issued the new standard established the period after the balance sheet date during which we should evaluate events or transactions that may occur for potential recognition or disclosure in the financial statements the circumstances under which we should recognize events or transactions occurring after the balance sheet date and the disclosures that should be made about events or transactions that occurred after the balance sheet date in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we evaluated subsequent events through february 25 2010 which is the date our annual report was filed with the securities and exchange commission 

accounting pronouncements issued but not yet effective 

in june 2009 the fasb amended its standards for accounting for transfers of financial assets which is effective for interim and annual fiscal periods beginning after november 15 2009 the new standard removes the concept of a qualifying specialpurpose entity from gaap the new standard modifies the financialcomponents approach used in previous standards and limits the circumstances in which a financial asset or portion of a financial asset should be derecognized the new standard also requires enhanced disclosure regarding transfers of financial interests and a transferors continuing involvement with transferred assets the new standard will require us to report any future activity under our sale of receivables program as secured borrowings as of january 1 2010 as of december 31 2009 we had no amounts outstanding under this program 

in june 2009 the fasb amended its existing standards related to the consolidation of variable interest entities which is effective for interim and annual fiscal periods beginning after november 15 2009 the new standard requires entities to analyze whether their variable interests give it a controlling financial interest of a variable interest entity vie and outlines what defines a primary beneficiary the new standard amends gaap by a changing certain rules for determining whether an entity is a vie b replacing the quantitative approach previously required for determining the primary beneficiary with a more qualitative approach and c requiring entities to continuously analyze whether they are the primary beneficiary of a vie among other amendments the new standard also requires enhanced disclosures regarding an entitys involvement in a vie while we are still finalizing our evaluation of the impact of this amendment on our consolidated financial statements  we believe the only impact will be the deconsolidation of cummins komatsu engine company ckec this deconsolidation will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements  financial information about ckec is included in note 23 variable interest entities to our consolidated financial statements  

in october 2009 the fasb amended its rules regarding the accounting for multiple element revenue arrangements the objective of the amendment is to allow vendors to account for revenue for different deliverables separately as opposed to part of a combined unit when those deliverables are provided at different times specifically this amendment addresses how to separate deliverables and simplifies the process of allocating revenue to the different deliverables when more than one deliverable exists the new rules are effective for us beginning january 1 2011 we are in the process of evaluating the impact that this amendment will have on our consolidated financial statements  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to financial risk resulting from volatility in foreign exchange rates interest rates and commodity prices this risk is closely monitored and managed through the use of financial derivative instruments including commodity swap contracts foreign currency forward contracts and interest rate swaps as stated in our policies and procedures financial derivatives are used expressly for hedging purposes and under no circumstances are they used for speculative purposes when material 

we adjust the value of our derivative contracts for counterparty or our credit risk the results and status of our hedging transactions are reported to senior management on a monthly and quarterly basis further information regarding financial instruments and risk management is contained in note 20 derivatives to our consolidated financial statements  

the following describes our risk exposures and provides results of sensitivity analysis performed as of december 31 2009 the sensitivity analysis assumes instantaneous parallel shifts in foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices 

foreign exchange rates 

as a result of our international business presence we are exposed to foreign currency exchange risks we transact business in foreign currencies and as a result our income experiences some volatility related to movements in foreign currency exchange rates to help manage our exposure to exchange rate volatility we use foreign exchange forward contracts on a regular basis to hedge forecasted intercompany and thirdparty sales and purchases denominated in nonfunctional currencies our internal policy allows for managing anticipated foreign currency cash flow for up to one year these foreign currency forward contracts are designated and qualify as foreign currency cash flow hedges under gaap the effective portion of the unrealized gain or loss on the forward contract is deferred and reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss aocl when the hedged forecasted transaction sale or purchase occurs the unrealized gain or loss is reclassified into income in the same line item associated with the hedged transaction in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects income the ineffective portion of the hedge unrealized gain or loss if any is recognized in current income during the period of change as of december 31 2009 the amount expected to be reclassified to income over the next year is not material for the years ended december 31 2009 and 2008 there were no circumstances that would have resulted in the discontinuance of a cash flow hedge 

to minimize the income volatility resulting from the remeasurement of net monetary assets and payables denominated in a currency other than the functional currency we enter into foreign currency forward contracts which are considered economic hedges the objective is to offset the gain or loss from remeasurement with the gain or loss from the fair market valuation of the forward contract these derivative instruments are not designated as hedges under gaap 

as of december 31 2009 the potential gain or loss in the fair value of our outstanding foreign currency contracts assuming a hypothetical 10 percent fluctuation in the currencies of such contracts would be approximately 31 million the sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates assumes the notional value to remain constant for the next 12 months the analysis ignores the impact of foreign exchange movements on our competitive position and potential changes in sales levels it should be noted that any change in the value of the contracts real or hypothetical would be significantly offset by an inverse change in the value of the underlying hedged items see note 20 derivatives to our consolidated financial statements  

interest rates 

we are exposed to market risk from fluctuations in interest rates we manage our exposure to interest rate fluctuations through the use of interest rate swaps the objective of the swaps is to more effectively balance our borrowing costs and interest rate risk 

in november 2005 we entered into an interest rate swap to effectively convert our 250 million debt due in 2028 from a fixed rate of 7125 to a floating rate based on a libor spread the terms of the swap mirror those of the debt with interest paid semiannually this swap qualifies as a fair value hedge under gaap the gain or loss on this derivative instrument as well as the offsetting gain 

or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in current income as interest expense these gains and losses for the year december 31 2009 were as follows 



commodity prices 

we are exposed to fluctuations in commodity prices due to contractual agreements with component suppliers in order to protect ourselves against future price volatility and consequently fluctuations in gross margins we periodically enter into commodity swap contracts with designated banks to fix the cost of certain raw material purchases with the objective of minimizing changes in inventory cost due to market price fluctuations the commodity swap contracts are derivative contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges under gaap the effective portion of the unrealized gain or loss is deferred and reported as a component of aocl when the hedged forecasted transaction purchase occurs the unrealized gain or loss is reclassified into income in the same line item associated with the hedged transaction in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects income the ineffective portion of the hedge if any is recognized in current income in the period in which the ineffectiveness occurs as of december 31 2009 we expect to reclassify an unrealized net gain of 5 million from aocl to income over the next year for the year ended december 31 2009 we discontinued hedge accounting on certain contracts where the forecasted transactions were no longer probable the amount reclassified to income as a result of this action was a loss of 4 million our internal policy allows for managing these cash flow hedges for up to three years 

as of december 31 2009 the potential gain or loss related to the outstanding commodity swap contracts assuming a hypothetical 10 percent fluctuation in the price of such commodities was 10 million the sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in commodity prices assumes the notional value to remain constant for the next 12 months the analysis ignores the impact of commodity price movements on our competitive position and potential changes in sales levels it should be noted that any change in the value of the swap contracts real or hypothetical would be significantly offset by an inverse change in the value of the underlying hedged items see note 20 derivatives to the consolidated financial statements

financial information about our investments in joint ventures and alliances is incorporated by reference from notes 1 2 and 22 to the consolidated financial statements 

in the event of a change of control of either party to these joint ventures and other strategic alliances certain consequences may result including automatic termination and liquidation of the venture exercise of put or call rights of ownership by the nonacquired partner termination or transfer of technology license rights to the nonacquired partner and increases in component transfer prices to the acquired partner we will continue to evaluate joint venture and partnership opportunities in order to penetrate new markets develop new products and generate manufacturing and operational efficiencies 

supply 

we source our materials and manufactured components from leading suppliers both domestically and internationally we machine and assemble some of the components used in our engines and power generation units including blocks heads turbochargers rods camshafts crankshafts filters exhaust systems alternators and fuel systems we single source approximately 80 to 85 percent of the total types of parts in our product designs we have long term agreements with critical suppliers who are the sole source for specific products or supply items although we elect to source a relatively high proportion of our total raw materials and component requirements from sole suppliers we have established a process to annually review our sourcing strategies with a focus on the reduction of risk which has led us to dual source critical components we are also developing suppliers in many global or emerging markets to serve our businesses across the globe and provide alternative sources in the event of disruption from existing suppliers 

patents and trademarks 

we own or control a significant number of patents and trademarks relating to the products we manufacture these patents and trademarks have been granted and registered over a period of years although these patents and trademarks are generally considered beneficial to our operations we do not believe any patent group of patents or trademark other than our leading brand house trademarks is considered significant to our business 

seasonality 

while individual product lines may experience modest seasonal declines in production there is no material effect on the demand for the majority of our products on a quarterly basis however our power generation segment normally experiences seasonal declines in the first quarter of our fiscal year due to general declines in construction spending during this period and our distribution segment normally experiences seasonal declines in first quarter business activity due to holiday periods in asia and australia 

largest customers 

we have thousands of customers around the world and have developed longstanding business relationships with many of them we have longterm heavyduty engine supply agreements with paccar and volvo trucks north america we have midrange supply agreements with paccar as its exclusive engine supplier as well as with daimler trucks north america formerly freightliner llc ford and volkswagen we also have a supply agreement with chrysler primarily relating to sales of our isb engine for use in dodge ram trucks collectively our net sales to these six customers was less than 21 percent of consolidated net sales in 2008 and individually was less than 

8 percent of consolidated net sales to any single customer these agreements contain standard purchase and sale agreement terms covering engine and engine parts pricing quality and delivery commitments as well as engineering product support obligations the basic nature of our agreements with oem customers is that they are longterm price and operations agreements that assure the availability of our products to each customer through the duration of the respective agreements agreements with most oems contain bilateral termination provisions giving either party the right to terminate in the event of a material breach change of control or insolvency or bankruptcy of the other party 

backlog 

demand in many of our markets has grown rapidly in the last three years resulting in longer lead times in some of our businesses however as a result of the recent economic turmoil many of the lead times have decreased significantly while we have supply agreements with some truck and offhighway equipment oems most of our business is transacted through open purchase orders these open orders are historically subject to monthtomonth releases and are subject to cancellation on reasonable notice without cancellation charges and therefore are not considered firm 

research and development expense 

our research and development program is focused on product improvements innovations and cost reductions for our customers we expense research and development expenditures net of contract reimbursements when incurred research and development expenses net of contract reimbursements were 422 million in 2008 318 million in 2007 and 312 million in 2006 contract reimbursements were 61 million in 2008 52 million in 2007 and 40 million in 2006 for 2008 and 2007 27 percent or 116 million and 17 percent or 55 million respectively were directly related to compliance with 2010 epa emissions standards for 2006 3 percent or 10 million was related to compliance with 2007 epa emissions standards 

environmental compliance 

product environmental compliance 

our engines are subject to extensive statutory and regulatory requirements that directly or indirectly impose standards governing emissions and noise our products comply with emissions standards that the epa the california air resources board carb and other state regulatory agencies as well as other regulatory agencies around the world have established for heavyduty onhighway diesel and gas engines and offhighway engines produced through 2008 our ability to comply with these and future emissions standards is an essential element in maintaining our leadership position in regulated markets we have made and will continue to make significant capital and research expenditures to comply with these standards failure to comply with these standards could result in adverse effects on our future financial results 

epa engine certifications 

the current onhighway emissions standards came into effect in the us on january 1 2007 to meet the 2007 us epa heavyduty onhighway emissions standards cummins is using cooled exhaust gas recirculation egr technology with particulate matter pm filters cooled egr is the same technology that we have used since april 2002 and was selected after reviewing other aftertreatment technologies such as nitrogen oxide nox adsorbers and selective catalytic reduction scr our experience with particulate filters and the availability of ultralowsulfur diesel fuel combined to give us the confidence in meeting these tough standards in the us additionally while we believe the egrpm filter combination was the right solution for 2007 in the us and for certain offhighway 

applications we have selected scr as the right technology to meet onhighway euro iv and v emissions standards 

new onhighway emission standards will be required in 2010 in the us we announced that we will use an evolution of our proven 2007 technology solution to maintain power and torque with substantial fuel economy improvement and maintenance intervals comparable with todays engines we will offer a complete lineup of onhighway engines to meet the nearzero emissions standards midrange and heavyduty engines for epa 2010 will require nox aftertreatment nox reduction will be achieved by an integrated technology solution comprised of the xpi high pressure common rail fuel system scr technology nextgeneration cooled egr advanced electronic controls proven air handling and the cummins particulate filter we are confident that we will meet these standards 

emissions standards in international markets including europe japan mexico australia brazil india and china are becoming more stringent we believe that our experience in meeting us emissions standards leaves us well positioned to take advantage of opportunities in these markets as the need for emissions control capability grows 

federal and california regulations require manufacturers to report failures of emissionsrelated components to the epa and carb when the failure rate reaches a specified level at higher failure rates a product recall may be required in 2008 we submitted seven reports to the epa relating to four different defects affecting oxidation catalysts exhaust flex pipes engine control modules and vehicle labels the oxidation catalysts defect necessitated the campaign of approximately 430 engines and the vehicle label defect resulted in the campaign of 66 vehicles 

other environmental statutes and regulations 

expenditures for environmental control activities and environmental remediation projects at our facilities in the us have not been a substantial portion of our annual capital outlays and are not expected to be material in 2009 except as follows we believe we are in compliance in all material respects with laws and regulations applicable to our plants and operations 

in the us pursuant to notices received from federal and state agencies andor defendant parties in site environmental contribution actions we have been identified as a potentially responsible party prp under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of 1980 as amended or similar state laws at approximately 19 waste disposal sites based upon our experiences at similar sites we believe that our aggregate future remediation costs will not be significant we have established accruals that we believe are adequate for our expected future liability with respect to these sites 

in addition we have four other sites where we are working with governmental authorities on remediation projects the costs for these remediation projects are not expected to be material

 item 1a risk factors relating to our business 

set forth below and elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k are some of the principal risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual business results to differ materially from any forwardlooking statements contained in this report in addition future results could be materially affected by general industry and market conditions changes in laws or accounting rules general us and nonus economic and political conditions including a global economic slowdown fluctuation of interest rates or currency exchange rates terrorism political unrest or international conflicts political instability or major health concerns natural disasters commodity prices or other disruptions of expected economic and business conditions these risk factors should be considered in addition to our cautionary comments concerning forwardlooking statements in this report including statements related to markets for our products and trends in our business that involve a number of risks and uncertainties our separate section above cautionary statements regarding forwardlooking information should be considered in addition to the following statements 

our consolidated operating results and financial condition may be adversely impacted by worldwide economic conditions and credit tightening 

the recent global economic crisis has caused a general tightening in the credit markets lower levels of liquidity increases in the rates of default and bankruptcy and extreme volatility in credit equity and fixed income markets these conditions may make it difficult or impossible for our customers and suppliers to accurately forecast and plan future business activities which may cause 

them to slow or suspend spending on products and services as our customers face this challenging economic time they may find it difficult to gain sufficient credit in a timely manner which could result in an impairment of their ability to place orders with us or to make timely payments to us for previous purchases if this occurs our revenue may be reduced thereby having a negative impact on our results of operations in addition we may be forced to increase our allowance for doubtful accounts and our days sales outstanding may increase which would have a negative impact on our cash position liquidity and financial condition as a result of these conditions and depending on the length and impact these conditions have on our individual businesses we could experience impairments to assets of certain businesses we cannot predict the timing or the duration of this or any other economic downturn in the economy 

the north american and european automotive industries are in distress and with further deterioration could adversely impact our business 

a number of companies in the global automotive industry are facing severe financial difficulties in north america general motors ford and chrysler have experienced declining markets they have announced significant restructuring actions in an effort to improve profitability and some have received federal financing assistance the north american automotive manufacturers are also burdened with substantial structural costs such as pension and healthcare costs that have impacted their profitability and labor relations and may ultimately result in severe financial difficulty including bankruptcy automakers across europe and japan are also experiencing difficulties from a weakened economy and tightening credit markets automotive industry conditions have adversely affected our supply base lower production levels for some of our key suppliers increases in certain raw material commodity and energy costs and the global credit market crisis has resulted in severe financial distress among many companies within the automotive supply base the continuation of financial distress within the automotive industry and the supply base andor the bankruptcy of one or more of the automakers may lead to supplier bankruptcies commercial disputes supply chain interruptions supplier requests for company sponsored capital support or a collapse of the supply chain 

we have a long standing relationship with chrysler for the production of diesel engines for their heavyduty truck series chrysler demand for this product decreased in the last twelve months and accounted for three percent of our consolidated sales in 2008 if chrysler were to enter into bankruptcy the collection of receivables would be at risk if such an event was to occur and chrysler is unable to successfully emerge from bankruptcy in the near term it may be forced to sell some or all of its assets which could include certain production lines including the dodge ram which could adversely impact our sales 

deterioration in the automotive markets could impact the business plan for our lightduty engine products currently under development 

in july 2006 we announced plans to develop and manufacture a lightduty diesel engine to be used in a variety of on and offhighway applications in july 2007 we entered into an agreement with chrysler where it would purchase the engine exclusively for use in lightduty pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles we have development agreements and commercial letters of intent with other automotive and marine customers we proceeded with the technical development of these engine applications and have made significant investment in a manufacturing facility in columbus indiana 

in january 2009 chrysler announced that it was delaying introduction of its 1500 dodge ram pickup truck with our new lightduty diesel engine until at least 2011 since that time we have continued to discuss with chrysler its commitment to the lightduty diesel engine agreement 

in january 2009 we formally requested that chrysler provide us with assurances that chrysler planned to continue to perform its obligations under our agreement for the development of these 

lightduty diesel engines chrysler maintains that its ability to perform its obligations under the agreement remains unchanged despite its recent need for financial assistance from the federal government we remain committed to the development of this product line for other existing customers and will continue to discuss the light duty diesel engine program with chrysler as well as with other potential customers if significant modifications occur in these programs and we are unable to find alternative customers or applications for these products we may need to impair our assets which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

the current deterioration of the credit and capital markets may adversely impact our ability to obtain financing on acceptable terms or obtain funding under our revolving credit facility 

global financial markets have been experiencing extreme volatility and disruption and the credit markets have been exceedingly distressed if credit markets continue to deteriorate we may be unable to obtain adequate funding under our revolving credit facility because our lending counterparties may be unwilling or unable to meet their funding obligations 

if we are unable to access our revolving credit facility the instability of financial markets could significantly increase the cost of obtaining additional or alternate funding from the credit markets as many lenders have increased interest rates enacted tighter lending standards and refused to refinance existing debt even if lenders and institutional investors are willing and able to provide adequate funding interest rates may rise in the future and therefore increase the cost of borrowing we incur on any of our floating rate debt 

due to these factors we cannot be certain that funding will be available if needed and to the extent required on acceptable terms if funding is not available when needed or is available only on unfavorable terms it might adversely affect our ability to operate our business which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations 

our manufacturing operations are dependent upon thirdparty suppliers making us vulnerable to supply shortages 

cummins manufactures strategic components internally and through suppliers we single source approximately 80 to 85 percent of the total types of parts in our product designs any delay in our suppliers deliveries may affect our operations at multiple manufacturing locations forcing us to seek alternative supply sources to avoid serious disruptions delays are caused by factors affecting our suppliers including capacity constraints labor disputes economic downturns availability of credit the impaired financial condition of a particular supplier suppliers allocations to other purchasers weather emergencies or acts of war or terrorism any delay in receiving supplies could impair our ability to deliver products to our customers and accordingly could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our products are subject to substantial government regulation 

our engines are subject to extensive statutory and regulatory requirements governing emissions and noise including standards imposed by the epa the european union state regulatory agencies such as the carb and other regulatory agencies around the world developing engines to meet changing government regulatory requirements with different implementation timelines and emissions requirements makes developing engines efficiently for multiple markets complicated and could result in substantial additional costs that may be difficult to recover in some markets in some cases we may be required to develop new products to comply with new regulations particularly those relating to air emissions for example we were required to develop new engines to comply with stringent emissions standards in the united states us by january 1 2010 and europe by september 1 2010 while we 

were able to meet previous deadlines our ability to comply with other existing and future regulatory standards will be essential for us to maintain our position in the engine markets we serve 

we have made and will be required to continue to make significant capital and research expenditures to comply with these regulatory standards further the successful development and introduction of new and enhanced products are subject to risks such as delays in product development cost overruns and unanticipated technical and manufacturing difficulties in june 2008 four cummins facilities in southern indiana including our technical center experienced extensive damage caused by flood water resulting from an unusually high amount of rainfall the technical center was closed for a period of time during a critical testing period for new engine development to meet 2010 emission standards we are insured for business interruption however it is possible that we will experience unrecoverable costs as a result of this loss of testing time any failure to comply with regulatory standards affecting our products could subject us to fines or penalties and could require us to cease production of any noncompliant engine or to recall any engines produced and sold in violation of the applicable standards see product environmental compliance in item 1 business for a complete discussion of the environmental laws and regulations that affect our products 

variability in material and commodity costs could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

our manufacturing processes are exposed to variability in material and commodity costs our businesses establish prices with our customers in accordance with contractual time frames however the timing of market price increases may prevent us from passing these additional costs on to our customers through timely pricing actions additionally higher material and commodity costs around the world may offset our efforts to reduce our cost structure while we customarily enter into financial transactions to address some of these risks we cannot assure that commodity price fluctuations will not adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition in addition while the use of commodity price hedging instruments may provide us with protection from adverse fluctuations in commodity prices by utilizing these instruments we potentially forego the benefits that might result from favorable fluctuations in price as a result higher material and commodity costs as well as hedging these commodity costs during periods of decreasing prices both could result in declining margins and could materially impact our results of operations and financial condition 

we are subject to currency exchange rate and other related risks 

we conduct operations in many areas of the world involving transactions denominated in a variety of currencies we are subject to currency exchange rate risk to the extent that our costs are denominated in currencies other than those in which we earn revenues in addition since our financial statements are denominated in us dollars changes in currency exchange rates between the us dollar and other currencies have had and will continue to have an impact on our earnings while we customarily enter into financial transactions to address these risks we cannot assure that currency exchange rate fluctuations will not adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition in addition while the use of currency hedging instruments may provide us with protection from adverse fluctuations in currency exchange rates by utilizing these instruments we potentially forego the benefits that might result from favorable fluctuations in currency exchange rates 

we also face risks arising from the imposition of exchange controls and currency devaluations exchange controls may limit our ability to convert foreign currencies into us dollars or to remit dividends and other payments by our foreign subsidiaries or businesses located in or conducted within a country imposing controls currency devaluations result in a diminished value of funds denominated in the currency of the country instituting the devaluation actions of this nature if they occur or continue for significant periods of time could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition in any given period 

deteriorating market conditions could diminish our pension plan asset performance which could adversely impact our equity and our cash flow 

we sponsor both funded and unfunded domestic and foreign defined benefit pension and other retirement plans our pension expense and the required contributions to our pension plans are directly affected by the value of plan assets the projected and actual rates of return on plan assets and the actuarial assumptions we use to measure our defined benefit pension plan obligations including the discount rate at which future projected and accumulated pension obligations are discounted to a present value we could experience increased pension expense due to a combination of factors including the decreased investment performance of pension plan assets decreases in the discount rate and changes in our assumptions relating to the expected return on plan assets 

the value of investments in our pension trusts have decreased during the recent market decline as a result we experienced a material change to our consolidated balance sheet which included an increase to other longterm liabilities and a corresponding decrease in stockholders equity through other comprehensive income if the market turmoil causes further declines in our pension plan assets we could continue to experience increased pension expense in future years and changes to stockholders equity we may be legally required to make contributions to our us pension plans in the future and these contributions could be material in addition if local legal authorities increase the minimum funding requirements for our pension plans outside the us we could be required to contribute more funds which would negatively affect our cash flow 

we are exposed to political economic and other risks that arise from operating a multinational business 

approximately 59 percent of our net sales for 2008 were attributable to customers outside the us accordingly our business is subject to the political economic and other risks that are inherent in operating in numerous countries these risks include 

• the difficulty of enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through foreign legal systems • trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements • the imposition of withholding requirements on foreign earnings and tax rates in certain foreign countries that exceed those in the us • the imposition of tariffs exchange controls or other restrictions • difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations and the application of foreign labor regulations • required compliance with a variety of foreign laws and regulations and • changes in general economic and political conditions in countries where we operate particularly in emerging markets as we continue to expand our business globally our success will depend in part on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these and other risks we cannot assure that these and other factors will not have a material adverse effect on our international operations or on our business as a whole 

our products are subject to recall for performance related issues 

we are at risk for product recall costs product recall costs are incurred when we decide either voluntarily or involuntarily to recall a product through a formal campaign to solicit the return of specific products due to a known or suspected performance issue costs typically include the cost of the product part or component being replaced customer cost of the recall and labor to remove and replace the defective part or component when a recall decision is made we estimate the cost of the recall and record a charge to earnings in that period in accordance with fasb statement of financial 

accounting standards sfas no 5 accounting for contingencies in making this estimate judgment is required as to the quantity or volume to be recalled the total cost of the recall campaign the ultimate negotiated sharing of the cost between us and the customer and in some cases the extent to which the supplier of the part or component will share in the recall cost as a result these estimates are subject to change 

we cannot assure that our truck manufacturers and oem customers will continue to outsource their engine supply needs 

several of our engine customers including paccar navistar volvo and chrysler are truck manufacturers or oems that manufacture engines for some of their own products despite their engine manufacturing abilities these customers have chosen to outsource certain types of engine production to us due to the quality of our engine products our emissions capability systems integration their customers preferences and in order to reduce costs eliminate production risks and maintain company focus however we cannot assure that these customers will continue to outsource engine production in the future increased levels of oem vertical integration could result from a number of factors such as shifts in our customers business strategies acquisition by a customer of another engine manufacturer the inability of thirdparty suppliers to meet product specifications and the emergence of lowcost production opportunities in foreign countries any significant reduction in the level of engine production outsourcing from our truck manufacturer or oem customers could significantly impact our revenues and accordingly have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our operations are subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations 

our plants and operations are subject to increasingly stringent environmental laws and regulations in all of the countries in which we operate including laws and regulations governing emissions to air discharges to water and the generation handling storage transportation treatment and disposal of waste materials while we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with these environmental laws and regulations we cannot assure that we will not be adversely impacted by costs liabilities or claims with respect to existing or subsequently acquired operations under either present laws and regulations or those that may be adopted or imposed in the future we are also subject to laws requiring the cleanup of contaminated property if a release of hazardous substances occurs at or from any of our current or former properties or at a landfill or another location where we have disposed of hazardous materials we may be held liable for the contamination and the amount of such liability could be material 

we face risks through our equity method investments in companies that we do not control 

our net earnings include significant equity earnings technical fees and royalty income from unconsolidated subsidiaries for the year ended december 31 2008 we recognized 231 million of equity earnings and 22 million of other income from our unconsolidated subsidiaries which comprised almost 34 percent of our net earnings the majority 80 percent of our equity earnings comes from our north american distributors dcec and ccec we have equity interests in several of our north american distributors who distribute the full range of our products and services to customers and endusers dcec is located in xiangfan china and produces our b c and l series four to nine liter mechanical engines in addition to full electronic diesel engines ccec is located in chongqing china and manufactures several models of our heavyduty and highhorsepower diesel engines serving primarily the industrial and stationary power markets in china our equity investments may not always perform at the levels we have seen in recent years 

we face reputational and legal risk from affiliations with joint venture partners 

several of our joint venture partners are domiciled in areas of the world with laws rules and business practices that differ from those in the us we strive to select partners who share our values and understand the cummins reporting and compliance needs as a us domiciled company we work to ensure that an appropriate business culture exists within the ventures to minimize and mitigate our risk 

we may be adversely impacted by work stoppages and other labor matters 

as of december 31 2008 we employed approximately 39800 persons worldwide approximately 14300 of our employees worldwide are represented by various unions under collective bargaining agreements that expire between 2010 and 2014 while we have no reason to believe that we will be impacted by work stoppages and other labor matters we cannot assure that future issues with our labor unions will be resolved favorably or that we will not encounter future strikes work stoppages or other types of conflicts with labor unions or our employees any of these factors may have an adverse effect on us or may limit our flexibility in dealing with our workforce in addition many of our customers have unionized work forces work stoppages or slowdowns experienced by our customers could result in slowdowns or closures at vehicle assembly plants where our engines are installed if one or more of our customers experience a material work stoppage it could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our business is exposed to risks of product liability claims 

we face an inherent business risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that our products failure to perform to specification results or is alleged to result in property damage bodily injury andor death we may experience material product liability losses in the future while we maintain insurance coverage with respect to certain product liability claims we may not be able to obtain such insurance on acceptable terms in the future if at all and any such insurance may not provide adequate coverage against product liability claims in addition product liability claims can be expensive to defend and can divert the attention of management and other personnel for significant periods of time regardless of the ultimate outcome an unsuccessful defense of a product liability claim could have a material adverse affect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows in addition even if we are successful in defending against a claim relating to our products claims of this nature could cause our customers to lose confidence in our products and us 

we face significant competition in the markets we serve 

the markets in which we operate are highly competitive we compete worldwide with a number of other manufacturers and distributors that produce and sell similar products our products primarily compete on the basis of price performance fuel economy speed of delivery quality and customer support there can be no assurance that our products will be able to compete successfully with the products of these other companies any failure by us to compete effectively in the markets we serve could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition for a more complete discussion of the competitive environment in which each of our segments operates see operating segments in item 1 business 

our business is affected by the cyclical nature of the markets we serve 

our financial performance depends in large part on varying conditions in the markets and geographies that we serve demand in these markets and geographies fluctuates in response to overall economic conditions and is particularly sensitive to changes in interest rate levels our sales are also impacted by oem inventory levels and production schedules and stoppages economic downturns in 

the markets we serve generally result in reductions in sales and pricing of our products which could reduce future earnings and cash flow economic trends can impact our product lines in different ways for example our business with chrysler pickup trucks is a consumer driven market while other product lines serve customers in markets where availability of credit could impact the timing of their purchasing decisions

organization of information 

the following managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations mda was prepared to provide the reader with a view and perspective of our businesses through the eyes of management and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes to those financial statements our mda is presented in the following sections

executive summary and financial highlights 

we are a leading global power provider that designs manufactures distributes and services diesel and natural gas engines electric power generation systems and enginerelated component products including filtration and exhaust aftertreatment fuel systems controls and air handling systems we sell our products to original equipment manufacturers oems distributors and other customers worldwide we have longstanding relationships with many of the leading manufacturers in the markets we serve including paccar inc international truck and engine corporation navistar international corporation chrysler llc volvo ab daimler trucks north america formerly freightliner ford motor company case new holland komatsu and volkswagen we serve our customers through a network of more than 500 companyowned and independent distributor locations and approximately 5200 dealer locations in more than 190 countries and territories 

our reportable operating segments consist of the following engine power generation components and distribution this reporting structure is organized according to the products and markets each segment serves this type of reporting structure allows management to focus its efforts on providing enhanced service to a wide range of customers the engine segment produces engines and parts for sale to customers in onhighway and various industrial markets the engines are used in trucks of all sizes buses and recreational vehicles as well as various industrial applications including construction mining agriculture marine oil and gas rail and military the power generation segment is an integrated provider of power systems which sells engines generator sets and alternators the components segment includes sales of filtration products exhaust aftertreatment systems turbochargers and fuel systems the distribution segment includes whollyowned and partiallyowned distributorships engaged in wholesaling engines generator sets and service parts as well as performing service and repair activities on our products and maintaining relationships with various oems throughout the world 

our financial performance depends in large part on varying conditions in the markets we serve particularly the onhighway construction and general industrial markets demand in these markets tends to fluctuate in response to overall economic conditions and is particularly sensitive to changes in interest rate levels and our customers access to credit our sales may also be impacted by oem inventory levels and production schedules and stoppages economic downturns in markets we serve generally result in reductions in sales and pricing of our products as a worldwide business our operations are also affected by political economic and regulatory matters including environmental and emissions standards in the countries we serve however our geographic diversity and broad product and service offerings have helped limit the impact of any one industry or customer and the economy of any single country on our consolidated results in 2008 softness in the pickup truck recreational vehicle and recreational marine markets worsened and evidence of a downturn in the united states us and european economies and softening in global markets became more evident particularly in the fourth quarter when we saw severe declines in the truck and construction businesses despite these unfavorable conditions we reported increased net sales and net income during 2008 compared to 2007 approximately 54 percent of our annual 2007 sales came from countries other than the us and that trend grew to 59 percent for the year ended december 31 2008 which helped to mitigate some of our exposure in the us economy the diversity of our business portfolio has contributed to the significant organic growth we have experienced over the past several years and continued into 2008 despite more difficult economic conditions 

we continued our strong performance of the past four years into 2008 with a fifth straight year of record net sales and net income net income was 755 million or 384 per diluted share on sales of 143 billion compared to 2007 net income of 739 million or 370 per diluted share on sales of 130 billion the income improvement was driven by a 10 percent increase in net sales and a 15 percent increase in gross margin as we benefited from improved pricing and higher demand across most of our businesses increased market share in a number of markets and focused cost reduction 

efforts however as the result of the deepening global credit crisis that began impacting many of our markets in the fourth quarter of 2008 and the bleak global economic outlook for 2009 we implemented targeted restructuring actions in the fourth quarter of 2008 at a pretax cost of 37 million 26 million aftertax or 013 per share we are also taking additional restructuring actions in early 2009 to adjust for continued weakening markets and decaying economic conditions affecting most of our markets for a detailed discussion of restructuring see restructuring charges and note 3 to the consolidated financial statements 

results of operations 



2008 vs 2007 

net sales 

net sales increased in all segments due to the following drivers 

• our commercial power generation business experienced increased demand especially internationally • we increased our market share in north american includes the united states us and canada and excludes mexico heavyduty truck and mediumduty truck and bus markets • industrial engine markets demand increased particularly the international construction and commercial marine markets • our distribution segment benefited from increased demand as well as the acquisition of a majority interest in three previously independent distributors • our turbocharger and emissions solutions businesses experienced increased demand • we had a favorable impact from foreign currency translation these increases in net sales were partially offset by softening in the us economy which has resulted in a significant reduction in demand in lightduty automotive and recreational markets for engines as well as decreased demand for consumer power generation products and a significant reduction in most other markets in the fourth quarter of 2008 as the result of the economic recession 

a more detailed discussion of sales by segment is presented in the operating segments results section 

gross margin 

significant drivers of the change in gross margins were as follows 



gross margin increased by 384 million and as a percentage of sales increased by 09 percentage points benefits from increased pricing and a more favorable volumemix of products sold were partially offset by higher material costs reflecting the increase in commodity prices during the year and higher warranty expense our warranty expense reflects favorable warranty experience for some engine products and our provision related to sales in 2008 was 29 percent of sales down from 31 percent in 2007 this result was more than offset by negative trends primarily in certain midrange engine products launched in 2007 for which we recorded additional warranty liability of approximately 117 million in the fourth quarter of 2008 

a more detailed discussion of margin by segment is presented in the operating segments results section 

selling general and administrative expenses 

selling general and administrative expenses increased primarily due to increased consulting expenses of 36 million increased compensation and related expenses of approximately 34 million and the acquisition of a majority ownership interest in three previously independent north american distributors increased headcount and compensation and related expenses included salaries variable compensation and fringe benefits across the business in support of higher volumes and business growth overall selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales increased to 101 percent in 2008 from 99 percent in 2007 

research development and engineering expenses 

research development and engineering expenses increased significantly primarily due to higher spending on development programs for future products including increased headcount compensation and related expenses compensation and related expenses include salaries variable compensation and fringe benefits fluctuations in other miscellaneous research and development expenses were not significant individually or in the aggregate overall research development and engineering expenses as a percentage of sales increased to 29 percent in 2008 from 25 percent in 2007 

equity royalty and interest income from investees 

equity royalty and interest income from investees increased significantly primarily due to increases in income from north american distributors of 17 million dongfeng cummins engine company ltd dcec of 14 million increased royalty and interest income of 9 million and increased income from chongqing cummins engine company limited ccec of 8 million shanghai fleetguard filter co ltd also experienced an increase of 2 million these increases were slightly offset by decreases from tata cummins ltd tcl of 6 million and cummins mercruiser diesel marine llc mercruiser of 8 million north american distributors increased primarily due to income from a joint venture which we formed in the fourth quarter of 2007 dcec sales increased largely due to prebuy activity in the first half of 2008 prior to a midyear emissions change ccec increased primarily due to increased sales volumes tcl experienced decreased sales volumes for the year while mercruiser profits declined due to a significant decline in the recreational marine market and increased research development and engineering expenses 

other operating expense income net 



1 the decrease in the gain on sale of fixed assets was primarily due to the 10 million gain on the sale of universal silencer in 2007 29 

2 the increase in amortization of other intangibles was primarily due to amortization of purchased premiums related to the acquisition of a north american distributor in 2008 interest income 

interest income decreased primarily due to lower average cash balances in 2008 compared to 2007 

interest expense 

interest expense decreased primarily due to declining shortterm interest rates and a benefit from our interest rate swap 

other expense income net 



1 the change in the cash surrender value of corporate owned life insurance was due to market deterioration especially in the fourth quarter of 2008 which included the write down of certain investments to zero 2 the foreign currency exchange losses in 2008 were due to unfavorable currency fluctuations in 2008 especially with the british pound the euro the australian dollar and the indian rupee income tax expense 

our income tax rates are generally less than the 35 percent us income tax rate primarily because of lower taxes on foreign earnings and research tax credits our effective tax rate for 2008 was 306 percent compared to 326 percent for 2007 the decrease is primarily due to greater foreign earnings in 2008 which are subject to lower tax rates our 2008 income tax provision also includes a 10 million 08 percent reduction in the fourth quarter due to the legislative reinstatement of the us research tax credit 

we expect our 2009 effective tax rate to be 31 percent excluding any discrete items that may arise 

minority interests in income of consolidated subsidiaries 

minority interests in income of consolidated subsidiaries eliminates the income or loss attributable to noncummins ownership interests in our consolidated entities minority interests in income of consolidated subsidiaries increased primarily due to higher income at our consolidated subsidiary in india cummins india limiteds cils a 51 percent owned subsidiary minority interest increased 10 million due to the creation of a new export business in 2008 and favorable price adjustments for high horsepower products there were no other individual fluctuations in the subsidiaries that were significant 

net income and diluted earnings per share 

net income and diluted earnings per share increased primarily due to higher volumes improved margins higher equity income and a lower effective tax rate these increases were partially offset by warranty expense restructuring charges and investment losses primarily occurring during the fourth quarter of 2008 in addition to unfavorable foreign currency effects 

outlook 

nearterm 

we expect sales and profits to be lower in 2009 given the economic outlook our operating results in 2009 will depend on how the current global economic conditions impact the markets we serve forecasting for 2009 is a significant challenge with these uncertain market conditions many of the markets we serve are slowing significantly as a result of the credit crisis and softening global economic environment and we expect 2009 sales will be down significantly from 2008 levels in response to anticipated market conditions we executed voluntary and involuntary separation actions in december of 2008 and january of 2009 we expect to continue to focus on cost reductions and scaling production to meet current demand if uncertainties in the credit and capital markets continue the overall impact on our customers as well as end user demand for our products could have a significant adverse impact on our nearterm results in light of current economic conditions if conditions continue to worsen in 2009 it is reasonably possible that we may be required to incur impairment charges on certain assets as we decrease production or close certain manufacturing facilities in response to decreasing demand impairments could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position at this time we cannot estimate these potential impairment charges 

longterm 

while there is uncertainty in the nearterm market as a result of the current economic conditions we continue to be optimistic that opportunities for longterm growth and profitability will continue in the future 

2007 vs 2006 

net sales 

net sales increased in all segments due to the following drivers 

• our commercial generator and alternator businesses benefited from improved pricing and strong organic growth • our emission solutions and turbocharger businesses experienced strong organic growth • we benefited from improved pricing for emission compliant engines • most onhighway and offhighway markets experienced strong demand • we had a favorable impact from foreign currency translation these increases were partially offset by 

• demand in our north american heavyduty onhighway market decreased as a result of the 2007 change in emissions standards • we deconsolidated one of our north american joint ventures beginning in 2007 whose 2006 sales totaled 163 million 31 

a more detailed discussion of sales by segment is presented in the operating segment results section 

gross margin 

significant drivers of the change in gross margin were as follows 



gross margin as a percentage of sales declined by 21 percentage points as margin percentages declined in three of our segments the provision for warranties issued for the year was 31 percent of consolidated sales compared to 28 percent for 2006 

a more detailed discussion of margin by segment is presented in our operating segment results section 

selling general and administrative expenses 

selling general and administrative expenses increased primarily due to increased compensation and related expenses of approximately 116 million in support of higher volumes and business growth and increased consulting fees and other outside services of 32 million increased headcount compensation and related expenses included salaries variable compensation and fringe benefits across the business in support of higher volumes and business growth overall selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales declined to 99 percent in 2007 from 101 percent in 2006 

research development and engineering expenses 

research development and engineering expenses increased primarily due to higher spending on new product development and critical technologies for 2010 and beyond including increased headcount compensation and related expenses to support business growth compensation and related expenses include salaries variable compensation and fringe benefits fluctuations in other miscellaneous research development and engineering expenses were not significant individually or in the aggregate overall research development and engineering expenses declined to 25 percent in 2007 from 28 percent in 2006 

equity royalty and interest income from investees 

equity royalty and interest income from investees increased significantly primarily due to improved income from north american distributors of 35 million dcec of 22 million ccec of 7 million and mercruiser of 5 million while the other joint ventures had slight increases north american distributors increased primarily as the result of organic growth acquisitions and the deconsolidation of a north american joint venture in 2007 

other operating expense income net 



1 the increase in the gain on sale of fixed assets was primarily due to the 10 million gain on the sale of universal silencer in 2007 interest income 

interest income decreased primarily due to lower average cash balances in 2007 compared to 2006 

interest expense 

interest expense decreased primarily due to a decline of 137 million in debt balances partially offset by higher interest rates 

other expense income net 



1 the loss on early extinguishment of debt in 2006 was incurred when we repaid our 250 million 95 percent notes in december of 2006 2 the increased gains on foreign currency were primarily due to favorable currency fluctuations in 2007 especially with the british pound the euro the indian rupee and the australian dollar income tax expense 

our income tax rates have been less than the 35 percent us income tax rate primarily because of lower taxes on foreign income and research tax credits export tax benefits also reduced our tax rate prior to 2007 

our effective tax rate for 2007 was 326 percent compared to 299 percent for 2006 the increase is in part due to the full repeal after 2006 of us export tax benefits which reduced our 2006 tax rate by 

14 percent our income tax provision for 2006 also included a 28 million 26 percent benefit for the favorable resolution of tax uncertainties related to prior years offset by a 12 million 11 percent increase for the effect of new indiana tax legislation 

minority interests in income of consolidated subsidiaries 

minority interests are primarily attributable to cil a 51 percent owned subsidiary and wuxi holset engineering co ltd wuxi a 55 percent owned subsidiary these two subsidiaries accounted for over 80 percent of the total minority interest in 2007 these increases were partially offset by the deconsolidation of cummins eastern canada llp cec a 51 percent owned subsidiary on january 1 2007 the remainder of the consolidated partiallyowned subsidiaries had a combination of immaterial increases and decreases in income 

net income and diluted earnings per share 

net income and diluted earnings per share increased primarily due to higher volumes significant improvement in equity earnings lower interest expense and favorable foreign currency effects these increases were partially offset by higher fixed costs to support growth and a higher effective tax rate 

restructuring charges 

we have executed restructuring actions primarily in the form of voluntary and involuntary separation programs in the fourth quarter of 2008 these actions were in response to the continued deterioration we saw in our us businesses and most key markets around the world in the second half of 2008 as well as a reduction in orders in most us and global markets for 2009 we reduced our worldwide professional workforce by approximately 650 employees or 45 percent we offered a voluntary retirement package to certain active professional employees in the us based on a clearly defined set of criteria we also took voluntary and involuntary actions which included approximately 800 hourly employees the majority of which received severance benefits the compensation packages contained salary and continuation of benefits including health care life insurance and outplacement services the voluntary retirement package was accepted by approximately 150 employees the remaining professional reductions of 500 employees were involuntary the expenses recorded during the year ended december 31 2008 included severance costs related to both voluntary and involuntary terminations during 2008 we incurred a pretax charge related to the professional and hourly restructuring initiatives of approximately 37 million 

employee termination and severance costs were recorded based on approved plans developed by the businesses and corporate management which specified positions to be eliminated benefits to be paid under existing severance plans or statutory requirements and the expected timetable for completion of the plan estimates of restructuring were made based on information available at the time charges were recorded due to the inherent uncertainty involved actual amounts paid for such activities may differ from amounts initially recorded and we may need to revise previous estimates 

at december 31 2008 of the approximately 1450 employees to be affected by this plan 1250 had been terminated if the restructuring actions are successfully implemented we expect such actions to yield approximately 45 million to 50 million in annual savings approximately 41 percent of the savings from the restructuring actions will be realized in cost of sales 44 percent in selling general and administrative expenses and 15 percent in research development and engineering expenses we expect all of the pretax charge to be paid in cash which will be funded with cash generated from operations 

the table below summarizes the balance of accrued restructuring expenses which is included in the balance of other accrued expenses in the consolidated balance sheets for the year ended december 31 2008 



1 restructuring charges include severance pay and benefits and related charges we do not include restructuring charges in the segment results the pretax impact of allocating restructuring charges for the year ended december 31 2008 would have been as follows 



in early 2009 we announced additional reductions in our workforce through both voluntary and involuntary actions of approximately 1300 employees by march 1 2009 including 800 salaried employees and 500 hourly employees in light of current economic conditions if conditions continue to worsen in 2009 it is reasonably possible that we may be required to take further actions including workforce reductions and impairments on certain assets as we decrease production or close certain manufacturing facilities in response to decreasing demand these actions could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position we expect our first quarter restructuring charge to exceed the amount taken in 2008

a summary and discussion of engine segment net sales by market follows 



a summary of unit shipments by engine classification including unit shipments to power generation follows 



2008 vs 2007 

net sales 

engine segment sales increased primarily due to the following drivers 

• heavyduty sales increased primarily due to an increase in our market share in the north american includes the us and canada and excludes mexico heavyduty truck markets increased mexican heavyduty truck sales in the first six months of 2008 resulting from the prebuy activity ahead of mexicos july 1 2008 new emissions requirements and weaker demand in the first six months of 2007 resulting from the 2006 prebuy to replace trucks ahead of the 2007 emissions regulations change • industrial market sales increased primarily related to strength in commercial marine and construction markets • mediumduty trucks sales increased due to increased demand in global mediumduty truck markets primarily due to our market share increases in the north american mediumduty truck market weaker demand in the first six months of 2007 resulting from the 2006 prebuy to replace trucks ahead of the 2007 emissions regulations change and strong demand in latin america driven by strong economic conditions in brazil in 2008 • stationary power sales increased primarily from intersegment sales to our power generation segment especially internationally • mediumduty bus sales increased due to market share gains in the north american bus market • we had a favorable impact from foreign currency translation these increases were partially offset by a 50 percent decline in units sold to chrysler this decline was due to the deteriorating demand for light duty trucks in north america as the result of the softening us economy and concerns over fuel prices earlier in the year 

total onhighwayrelated sales were 53 percent of total engine segment sales in 2008 compared to 56 percent in 2007 

segment ebit 

engine segment ebit decreased primarily due to lower engine volumes in the midrange onhighway truck markets increased warranty expense and increased material cost partially offset by improved industrial engine and parts pricing and more favorable sales mix in the onhighway markets gross margin increased 73 million or 6 percent however gross margin percentage decreased by 03 percentage points gross margin was higher due to price improvements primarily in industrial engines and favorable product mix these increases were partially offset by increased warranty expense 

due to the increased mix of newer emissionsdriven products and higher repair costs on certain engines in addition to increased material prices due to higher commodity prices during the year selling general and administrative expenses increased 30 million or 5 percent and remained relatively flat as a percentage of sales for the year the increase in selling general and administrative expenses was primarily due to higher payroll costs as the result of salary increases and an increase in the number of segment employees during the year research development and engineering expenses increased 64 million or 29 percent and increased 05 percentage points as a percentage of sales for the year as compared to the prior year the increase in research development and engineering expenses was the result of increased spending on emissions related programs

• emissions solutions business sales increased due to high demand in all markets and geographic regions from the sale of new products to meet new onhighway emission standards • turbocharger business sales increased significantly due to high demand in all markets and geographic regions from the sale of new products to meet the new onhighway emission standards • filtration business sales increased primarily due to growth in emerging markets of eastern europe and the middle east • emission solutions and turbocharger businesses benefited from market share gains in north america • we had a favorable impact from foreign currency translation segment ebit 

components segment ebit increased primarily due to increased volumes and gross margins in most components businesses and the sale of a business during 2007 gross margin improved 68 million or 20 percent however the gross margin percentage decreased 11 percentage points gross margin percentages were unfavorably impacted by higher metal costs and new product introduction costs in addition both our emission solutions and turbo technologies businesses experienced low margins as the result of costs associated with meeting extremely strong demand selling general and administrative expenses increased 30 million or 17 percent however selling general and administrative expenses improved by 07 percentage points as a percentage of net sales the increase in selling general and administrative expenses was primarily due to higher payroll costs and increases in infrastructure investments including the number of employees to provide for the growing components business research development and engineering expenses increased by 5 million or 7 percent however research development and engineering expenses improved by 

05 percentage points as a percentage of net sales segment ebit was also favorably impacted by the 10 million gain on the sale of universal silencer 

distribution segment results 

financial data for the distribution segment was as follows 



2008 vs 2007 

net sales 

distribution segment sales increased as a result of the following drivers 

• we experienced strong organic growth in all regions mainly in europe the south pacific and the middle east • we had higher sales from the acquisition of a majority ownership interest in three previously independent distributors of 260 million • we had a favorable impact from foreign currency translation the higher sales were led by increased sales volumes in power generation parts and engine volumes followed by service 

segment ebit 

distribution segment ebit increased primarily due to increased sales volumes for power generation parts and engines followed by service and improved pricing however segment ebit decreased as a percentage of sales primarily due to unfavorable currency translation adjustments which negatively impacted our ebit as a percentage of sales by 13 percentage points excluding the 17 million impact of three new distributors consolidated during the year and one new north american joint venture ebit was 225 million for the year and decreased 03 percentage points as a percentage of sales gross margin increased by 145 million or 45 percent and improved 07 percentage points as a percentage of sales the increase in gross margin was primarily due to the increase in sales volumes and improved pricing selling general and administrative expenses increased 78 million or 31 percent however selling general and administrative expenses improved by 12 percentage points as a percentage of sales the increase in selling general and administrative expenses was primarily due to higher payroll costs as the result of 2008 salary increases and an increase in the number of segment employees including increased costs related to the acquisition of three new distributors and the north american joint venture 

2007 vs 2006 

net sales 

distribution segment sales increased as a result of the following drivers 

• we experienced organic growth in europe and the middle east primarily due to increased sales of power generation equipment in both regions • we had a favorable impact from foreign currency translation the higher sales were led by increased sales volumes in power generation engine and parts 

these increases were partially offset by the deconsolidation of one of our north american joint ventures that accounted for approximately 163 million or 12 percent of sales in the year ended 2006 

segment ebit 

distribution segment ebit increased primarily due to equity royalty and interest income from investees led by a 35 million increase from our north american distributors gross margin improved 14 million or 5 percent however the gross margin percentage decreased 14 percentage points the decrease in gross margin percentage was primarily due to the deconsolidation of one of our north american joint ventures in 2007 selling general and administrative expenses increased 15 million or 6 percent however selling general and administrative expenses improved by 07 percentage points as a percentage of net sales the increase in selling general and administrative expenses was primarily due to higher payroll costs as the result of 2007 salary increases an increase in infrastructure investments including the number of employees to provide for the growing distribution business and unfavorable foreign currency translation

liquidity and capital resources 

managements assessment of liquidity 

we believe our financial condition and liquidity remain strong despite the downturn in the us and global economies our strong balance sheet and improved credit ratings enabled us to secure a new threeyear revolving credit facility in the third quarter of 2008 

we assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate adequate cash to fund our operating investing and financing activities cash provided by operations is our principal source of liquidity as of december 31 2008 other sources of liquidity include 

• cash and cash equivalents of 426 million • marketable securities of 77 million • 106 billion available under our revolving credit facility • 170 million based on eligible receivables available under our accounts receivable sales program and • 194 million available under international credit facilities the maturity schedule of our existing longterm debt does not require significant cash outflows in the intermediate term required annual principal payments range from 12 million to 32 million over each of the next five years 

while the impact of the continued market volatility cannot be predicted we believe our liquidity will provide us with the financial flexibility needed to fund working capital capital expenditures projected pension obligations dividend payments and debt service obligations 

we have considered the impact of recent market instability and credit availability in assessing the adequacy of our liquidity and capital resources we expect that general market conditions could impact the rate at which we realize our receivables in the future and could impact eligible receivables under our accounts receivable program however we expect to generate positive cash flow from operations in 2009 we will continue to diligently monitor our receivables for potential slowing in collections that could occur as a result of softening economic conditions and our customers access to credit the overall decline in market valuations has impacted the current value of our pension trusts as discussed in more detail below 

at this time we are comfortable that the available credit capacity under our revolving credit facility is available to us this assertion is based upon the fact that we drew upon our revolving credit facility with a prompt repayment in february 2009 to confirm participation by the banks included in the facility as a result we believe our access to liquidity sources has not been materially impacted by the current credit environment and we do not expect that it will be materially impacted in the near future there can be no assurance however that the cost or availability of future borrowings if any in the debt markets or our credit facilities will not be materially impacted by the ongoing capital market disruptions 

a significant portion of our cash flows is generated outside the us more than half of our cash and cash equivalents and most of our marketable securities at december 31 2008 are denominated in foreign currencies we manage our worldwide cash requirements considering available funds among the many subsidiaries through which we conduct our business and the cost effectiveness with which those funds can be accessed the repatriation of cash balances from certain subsidiaries could have adverse tax consequences however those balances are generally available without legal restrictions to fund ordinary business operations at the local level we have and will continue to transfer cash from these subsidiaries to us and to other international subsidiaries when it is cost effective to do so 

working capital summary 

we fund our working capital with cash from operations and shortterm borrowings when necessary various assets and liabilities including shortterm debt can fluctuate significantly from month to month depending on shortterm liquidity needs as a result working capital is a prime focus of management attention 



current assets decreased 102 million primarily due to a 216 million decrease in receivables due to lower sales in the fourth quarter a 151 million decrease in cash see cash flows below and a decrease of 43 million in marketable securities due to the decline in the overall market these decreases were partially offset by a 146 million increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets a 91 million increase in inventory and a 71 million increase in deferred income taxes the increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets was primarily due to the increase in refundable income taxes 

current liabilities decreased 72 million primarily due to a decrease in accounts payable of 254 million due to reduced purchases in the fourth quarter a decrease in accrued compensation benefits and retirement costs of 77 million and a decrease in shortterm borrowings of 50 million these decreases were offset by an increase of 212 million in other accrued expenses and an increase in accrued warranty of 97 million the increase in other accrued expenses was primarily due to the recognition of liabilities related to commodity and currency hedges increased deferred revenue and increased workers compensation accruals 

cash flows 

cash and cash equivalents decreased by 151 million during the year ended december 31 2008 the change in cash and cash equivalents is as follows 



operating activities 

2008 vs 2007 

net cash provided by operating activities increased 177 million for the year ended december 31 2008 compared to 2007 in both 2008 and 2007 our principal source of cash from operations was net income of 755 million and 739 million respectively which reflected strong operational performance in both years for 2008 the net income contribution was partially offset by a growth in working capital of 267 million and pension contributions of 102 million the growth in 2008 working capital was 

largely driven by higher inventories of 251 million and lower accounts payable of 174 million which was partially offset by higher accrued expenses of 124 million and a decrease in accounts receivable of 88 million the increase in inventory was primarily to support strong business growth while the decrease in accounts payable was more reflective of early shutdowns in many of our manufacturing facilities at the close of 2008 as demand softened throughout the fourth quarter the increase in accrued expenses was primarily due to an increase in warranty expense and the decrease in accounts receivable was driven by the early shutdown and softening demand 

for 2007 working capital increased by 139 million as sales and production growth generated a combined increase in inventory and accounts receivable of 458 million however this amount was largely funded by a 353 million increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities also in support of strong volumes in addition pension contributions of 250 million offset strong net income performance 

pensions 

the funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon a variety of variables and assumptions including return on invested assets market interest rates and levels of voluntary contributions to the plans as the result of the ongoing credit crisis and the related market recession our pension assets have experienced significant deterioration during 2008 through the end of 2008 shortterm returns for both our us and uk pension plans are significantly below our longterm expected rate of return of 825 percent and 725 percent respectively used in our assumptions due to adverse conditions in the equity markets as a result of losses experienced in global equity markets which began at the end of the third quarter and accelerated in the fourth quarter our pension funds had significant negative returns for 2008 which resulted in a 695 million 445 million aftertax charge to shareholders equity in the fourth quarter and thus will create increased pension costs in 2009 approximately 96 percent of our pension plan assets are invested in highly liquid investments such as equity and fixed income securities the remaining four percent of our plan assets are invested in less liquid but market valued investments including real estate and private equity we made pension contributions of 102 million to our pension plans in 2008 we anticipate making contributions of 125 million to 135 million to our pension plans in 2009 expected contributions to our defined pension plans in 2009 will meet or exceed the current funding requirements claims and premiums for other postretirement benefits are expected to approximate 53 million in 2009 the 102 million of pension contributions in 2008 included voluntary contributions of 70 million these contributions and payments include payments from company funds either to increase pension plan assets or to make direct payments to plan participants 

2007 vs 2006 

net cash provided by operating activities declined 30 million for the year ended december 31 2007 compared to 2006 in both 2007 and 2006 our principal source of cash from operations was net income of 739 million and 715 million respectively which reflected strong operational performance in both years for 2007 working capital increased by 139 million as sales and production growth generated a combined increase in inventory and accounts receivable of 458 million however this amount was largely funded by a 353 million increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities in addition pension contributions of 250 million offset net income performance 

for 2006 working capital increased by 191 million as sales and production growth generated a combined increase in inventory and accounts receivable of 459 million which was partially funded by a 272 million increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities in addition pension contributions of 266 million offset strong net income performance 

investing activities 

2008 vs 2007 

net cash used in investing activities increased 333 million for the year ended 2008 compared to 2007 the increase was primarily due to a 190 million increase in capital expenditures higher investments in businesses of 122 million related to the purchase of three previously independent distributors and the acquisition of consolidated diesel corporation a manufacturing facility see note 21 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information increased cash flows for undesignated hedges of 39 million and higher investments in and advances to equity investees of 23 million these increases were partially offset by a 29 million increase in the proceeds from the sale of equity investments due to the sale of the european engine alliance in 2008 see note 21 to our consolidated financial statements  

capital expenditures for the year ended 2008 increased 54 percent over 2007 to support our growth and included investments to increase capacity and to fund development of our new products our investments in capacity improvements and development of new products accelerated across all of our businesses we continue to invest approximately 35 percent of our capital in lowcost regions of the world to further leverage our opportunities for cost reduction and future growth opportunities capital expenditures for 2008 were 543 million in preparation for the challenging economic climate expected in 2009 we have tightened capital expenditures to preserve cash during the recession and as a result expect an approximate 30 percent reduction of spending from 2008 levels this spending excludes any assets that may need to be purchased as a result of the flood we anticipate remaining flood related expenditures will range from 55 million to 65 million and will occur over the next four quarters 

2007 vs 2006 

net cash used in investing activities increased 238 million in 2007 compared to 2006 the increase was primarily due to a 104 million increase in capital expenditures a 57 million outflow for the purchase of longterm investments an increase of 48 million in cash used for investments in and advances to equity investees and an increased outflow of 18 million for the acquisition of businesses the majority of which was to acquire the remaining 50 percent equity ownership in a 5050 joint venture 

capital expenditures for the year ended 2007 increased 42 percent over 2006 to support our growth and included investments to increase capacity and to fund development of our new products 

financing activities 

2008 vs 2007 

net cash used in financing activities decreased 339 million in 2008 compared to 2007 the majority of the decrease in cash outflows was due to the decrease in repurchase of common stock of 207 million the increase in proceeds from borrowings of 61 million the 50 million increase in proceeds from sale of stock held by employee benefit trust and a 45 million increase in net borrowings under shortterm credit arrangements these fluctuations were partially offset by the increase in dividend payments of 33 million 

our total debt was 698 million as of december 31 2008 compared with 674 million at december 31 2007 total debt as a percent of our total capital including total longterm debt was 178 percent at december 31 2008 compared to 165 percent at december 31 2007 the 2008 debt to capital ratio was negatively impacted by a 675 million 433 million after tax charge to shareholders equity to recognize the funded status of our defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans 

2007 vs 2006 

net cash used in financing activities increased 68 million in 2007 compared to 2006 the majority of the increase in cash outflows is due to the increase in repurchases of common stock of 214 million and a decrease in the proceeds from borrowings of 79 million which was partially offset by a 256 million decrease in payments on borrowings and capital leases 

revolving credit agreement 

on june 30 2008 we entered into a threeyear revolving credit agreement dated as of june 30 2008 the credit agreement with a syndicate of lenders and issuers named therein the credit agreement provides a 11 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility the credit facility the proceeds of which are to be used to provide working capital or for other general corporate purposes of cummins 

the credit facility matures on june 30 2011 the credit facility is unsecured and amounts payable under it will rank pro rata with all other unsecured unsubordinated indebtedness of cummins a portion of the credit facility up to 100 million is available for swingline loans denominated in us dollars loans will bear interest at i a base rate or ii a rate equal to libor plus an applicable margin based on the credit ratings of cummins outstanding senior unsecured longterm debt based on our current longterm debt ratings the applicable margin on libor loans was 20 percent per annum as of december 31 2008 loans may be prepaid without premium or penalty subject to customary breakage costs 

the credit facility replaces 650 million in aggregate principal amount of a revolving credit facility former credit agreement maintained by cummins which was terminated effective june 30 2008 

the credit agreement includes covenants substantially similar to those in the former credit agreement including among others a a leverage ratio b fixed charge coverage ratio c limitations on priority indebtedness d limitations on our ability to consummate a merger consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets and e limitations on our ability to change the nature of our business 

the obligation of cummins to pay amounts outstanding under the credit facility may be accelerated upon the occurrence of an event of default as defined in the credit agreement such 

events of default include among others a cummins failure to pay the principal of or interest on borrowings under the credit facility b any representation or warranty of cummins in the credit agreement proving to be materially false or misleading c cummins breach of any of its covenants contained in the credit agreement and d the bankruptcy or insolvency of cummins 

there are no material relationships between cummins or its affiliates and any of the lenders other than as described above 

repurchase of common stock 

we announced in february 2009 that we have temporarily suspended our stock repurchase program to conserve cash 

in december 2007 the board of directors authorized the acquisition of up to 500 million of cummins common stock we began making purchases under the plan in march 2008 and purchased 128 million of stock during 2008 at an average cost of 5549 per share 

in july 2006 the board of directors authorized us to acquire up to eight million shares of cummins common stock in 2007 we repurchased approximately 335 million of common stock at an average cost of 5576 per share representing approximately six million shares this concluded the share repurchase program authorized by the board of directors in july 2006 

quarterly dividends 

in july 2008 the board of directors voted to increase the quarterly cash dividend per share by 40 percent and increased cash dividends from 0125 per common share to 0175 per common share dividends per share paid to common shareholders for the years ended december 31 were as follows 



total dividends paid to common shareholders for the years ended december 31 2008 2007 and 2006 were 122 million 89 million and 66 million respectively declaration and payment of dividends in the future depends upon income and liquidity position among other factors 

financial covenants and credit rating 

a number of our contractual obligations and financing agreements such as our revolving credit facility and our equipment saleleaseback agreements have restrictive covenants andor pricing modifications that may be triggered in the event of downward revisions to our corporate credit rating there have been no events in 2008 to impede our compliance with these covenants 

on march 10 2008 standard  poors sp upgraded our senior unsecured debt ratings from bbb to bbb and revised our outlook to stable citing cummins improved operating performance over the past several years including during the expected emissionsrelated downturn in heavyduty truck demand in 2007 combined with significant on and offbalance sheet debt reduction and increased business diversification 

on june 17 2008 fitch upgraded our senior unsecured debt ratings from bbb to bbb citing cummins recent market share gains and improving credit profile including improvement in cummins geographic and business diversification 

our current ratings and outlook from each of the credit rating agencies are shown in the table below 



contractual obligations and other commercial commitments 

a summary of payments due for our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december 31 2008 is shown in the tables below 



1 includes principal payments and expected interest payments based on the terms of the obligations in february of 2009 we renegotiated our sale and leaseback transaction to extend the term for an additional two years and removed the requirement to provide residual insurance the lease obligations are included in this line item see note 19 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on our sale and leaseback transaction 2 we are contractually obligated to fund 28 million in 2009 however our expected range of total pension contributions for 2009 is approximately 125 million to 135 million due to the ongoing capital market disruptions we are unable to predict funding requirements beyond 2009 the contractual obligations reported above exclude our unrecognized tax benefits of 57 million all of which is noncurrent as of december 31 2008 we are not able to reasonably estimate the 

period in which cash outflows relating to uncertain tax contingencies could occur see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for further details 



1 guarantees and other commitments include a 25 million commitment with irwin financial corporation in 2008 see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the commitment off balance sheet financing 

sale of accounts receivable 

in july 2007 we amended our agreement with a financial institution to sell a designated pool of trade receivables to cummins trade receivables llc ctr a whollyowned special purpose subsidiary to extend the facility until july 2010 and raised the purchase limitation from 200 million to 400 million the agreement also provides us with an option to increase the purchase limitation up to 500 million upon approval as necessary ctr may transfer a direct interest in its receivables without recourse to the financial institution to maintain a balance in the designated pools of receivables sold we sell new receivables to ctr as existing receivables are collected receivables sold to ctr in which an interest is not transferred to the financial institution are included in receivables net on our consolidated balance sheets  the maximum interest in sold receivables that can be outstanding at any point in time is limited to the lesser of 400 million or the amount of eligible receivables held by ctr there are no provisions in this agreement that require us to maintain a minimum investment credit rating however the terms of the agreement contain the same financial covenants as our revolving credit facility as of december 31 2008 the amount available under this program was 170 million as of december 31 2008 and 2007 there were no amounts outstanding under this program 

financing arrangements for related parties 

in accordance with the provisions of various joint venture agreements we may purchase andor sell products and components fromto the joint ventures and the joint ventures may sell products and components to unrelated parties the transfer price of products purchased from the joint ventures may differ from normal selling prices certain joint venture agreements transfer product to us at cost some transfer product to us on a costplus basis and other agreements provide for the transfer of products at market value 

application of critical accounting estimates 

a summary of our significant accounting policies is included in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements of this annual report which discusses accounting policies that we have selected from acceptable alternatives there were no accounting policies adopted during 2008 that had a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap which often requires management to make judgments estimates and assumptions regarding uncertainties that affect 

the reported amounts presented and disclosed in the financial statements our management reviews these estimates and assumptions based on historical experience changes in business conditions and other relevant factors they believe to be reasonable under the circumstances in any given reporting period our actual results may differ from the estimates and assumptions used in preparing our consolidated financial statements 

critical accounting estimates are defined as follows the estimate requires management to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the estimate was made different estimates reasonably could have been used or if changes in the estimate are reasonably likely to occur from period to period and the change would have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations our senior management has discussed the development and selection of our accounting policies related accounting estimates and the disclosures set forth below with the audit committee of our board of directors we believe our critical accounting estimates include those addressing the estimation of liabilities for warranty programs accounting for income taxes pension benefits and annual assessment of recoverability of goodwill 

warranty programs 

we estimate and record a liability for warranty programs primarily base warranty and other than product recalls at the time our products are sold our estimates are based on historical experience and reflect managements best estimates of expected costs at the time products are sold and subsequent adjustment to those expected costs when actual costs differ as a result of the uncertainty surrounding the nature and frequency of product recall programs the liability for such programs is recorded when we commit to a recall action which generally occurs when it is announced our warranty liability is generally affected by component failure rates repair costs and the time of failure future events and circumstances related to these factors could materially change our estimates and require adjustments to our liability new product launches require a greater use of judgment in developing estimates until historical experience becomes available product specific experience is typically available four or five quarters after product launch with a clear experience trend evident eight quarters after launch we generally record warranty expense for new products upon shipment using a factor based upon historical experience only in the first year a blend of actual product and historical experience in the second year and product specific experience thereafter note 12 to the consolidated financial statements contains a summary of the activity in our warranty liability account for 2008 and 2007 including adjustments to preexisting warranties 

accounting for income taxes 

we determine our provision for income taxes using the asset and liability method under this method deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax effects of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases future tax benefits of tax loss and credit carryforwards are also recognized as deferred tax assets we evaluate the recoverability of our deferred tax assets each quarter by assessing the likelihood of future profitability and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize our net deferred tax assets at december 31 2008 we recorded net deferred tax assets of 835 million these assets include 40 million for the value of tax loss and credit carryforwards a valuation allowance of 25 million has been recorded to reduce the tax assets to the net value management believes is more likely than not to be realized in the event our operating performance deteriorates future assessments could conclude that a larger valuation allowance will be needed to further reduce the deferred tax assets in addition we operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and are subject to tax audits in these jurisdictions these audits can involve complex issues which may require an extended period of time to resolve we reduce our net tax assets for the estimated additional tax and interest that may result from tax authorities disputing uncertain tax positions we 

have taken and we believe we have made adequate provision for income taxes for all years that are subject to audit based upon the latest information available a more complete description of our income taxes and the future benefits of our tax loss and credit carryforwards is disclosed in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements  

pension benefits 

we sponsor a number of pension plans primarily in the us and the uk and to a lesser degree in various other countries in the us and the uk we have several major defined benefit plans that are separately funded we account for our pension programs in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 87 employers accounting for pensions sfas 87 and sfas no 158 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans—an amendment of fasb statements no 87 88 106 and 132 r sfas 158 sfas 87 requires that amounts recognized in financial statements be determined using an actuarial basis as a result our pension benefit programs are based on a number of statistical and judgmental assumptions that attempt to anticipate future events and are used in calculating the expense and liability related to our plans these assumptions include discount rates used to value liabilities assumed rates of return on plan assets future compensation increases employee turnover rates actuarial assumptions relating to retirement age mortality rates and participant withdrawals the actuarial assumptions we use may differ significantly from actual results due to changing economic conditions participant life span and withdrawal rates these differences may result in a material impact to the amount of net periodic pension expense to be recorded in our consolidated financial statements in the future sfas 158 requires an employer to recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan as an asset or liability in its statement of financial position and to recognize changes in that funded status in the year in which the changes occur through comprehensive income the statement also requires an employer to measure the funded status of a plan as of the date of its yearend statement of financial position we adopted sfas 158 except for the measurement date change as required on december 31 2006 we adopted the measurement date change as of january 1 2008 

the expected longterm return on plan assets is used in calculating the net periodic pension expense we considered several factors in developing our expected rate of return on plan assets the longterm rate of return considers historical returns and expected returns on current and projected asset allocations and is generally applied to a 5year average market value of return the longterm rate of return on plan assets represents an estimate of longterm returns on an investment portfolio consisting of a mixture of equities fixed income real estate and other miscellaneous investments the differences between the actual return on plan assets and expected longterm return on plan assets are recognized in the asset value used to calculate net periodic expense over five years the table below sets forth the expected return assumptions used to develop our pension expense for the period 20062008 and our expected rate for 2009 

longterm expected return assumptions 



a lower expected rate of return will increase our net periodic pension expense and reduce profitability 

the difference between the expected return and the actual return on plan assets is deferred from recognition in our results of operations and under certain circumstances such as when the difference exceeds 10 percent of the market value of plan assets or the projected benefit obligation pbo 

amortized over future years of service this is also true of changes to actuarial assumptions as of december 31 2008 we had net pension actuarial losses of 837 million and 322 million for the us and nonus pension plans respectively under sfas 158 the actuarial gains and losses are recognized and recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss as these amounts exceed 10 percent of our pbo the excess is amortized over the average remaining service lives of participating employees 

the table below sets forth the net periodic pension expense for the period 20062008 and our expected expense for 2009 



the decrease in periodic pension expense in 2008 was due to higher expected returns on assets driven by the significant pension contributions we made in 2007 another key assumption used in the development of the net periodic pension expense is the discount rate the discount rates used to develop our net periodic pension expense are set forth in the table below 

discount rates 



changes in the discount rate assumptions will impact the interest cost component of the net periodic pension expense calculation 

the discount rate enables us to state expected future cash payments for benefits as a present value on the measurement date the guidelines for setting this rate are discussed in eitf d36 which suggests the use of a highquality corporate bond rate we used bond information provided by standard  poors for the us and iboxx for the uk all bonds used to develop our hypothetical portfolio in the us and uk were highquality noncallable bonds aa or better as of december 31 2008 however for the uk we removed the bonds from the index that were downgraded during december 2008 but had not yet been removed from the iboxx aa index at the measurement date the average yield of this hypothetical bond portfolio was used as the benchmark for determining the discount rate to be used to value the obligations of the plans subject to sfas 87 and sfas no 106 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions in addition for the us plans the cash flows were matched to the citigroup pension discount curve as of december 31 2008 the results of that exercise provided a 6257 percent rate which confirmed our selection 

our model called for 60 years of benefit payments for the us plans the sum of the cash flows from the 60 bonds matched the cash flow from the benefit payment stream upon completion of the process the number of bonds purchased for each issue was used to determine the price of the entire portfolio the discount rate benchmark was set to the internal rate of return needed to discount the cash flows to arrive at the portfolio price 

in developing the uk discount rate excess cash flows resulted in the early years of the 60 year period when the sum of the cash flow from the bonds maturing in later years exceeded the benefit payments in early years thus no bonds maturing in early years are needed as a result the price of the entire portfolio of bonds was too high because all benefit payments were covered with excess cash flow remaining we made no adjustment to the cash flow and the discount rate was determined as the internal rate of return needed to discount the cash flows to arrive at the portfolio price 

the table below sets forth the estimated impact on our 2009 net periodic pension expense relative to a change in the discount rate and a change in the expected rate of return on plan assets 



the above sensitivities reflect the impact of changing one assumption at a time a higher discount rate decreases the plan obligations and decreases our net periodic pension expense a lower discount rate increases the plan obligations and increases our net periodic pension expense it should be noted that economic factors and conditions often affect multiple assumptions simultaneously and the effects of changes in key assumptions are not necessarily linear 

our investment policies in the us and uk provide for the rebalancing of assets to maintain our longterm strategic asset allocation we are committed to its longterm strategy and do not attempt to time the market given empirical evidence that asset allocation is more critical than individual asset or investment manager selection rebalancing of the assets has and continues to occur the rebalancing is critical to having the proper weighting of assets to achieve the expected total portfolio returns based upon our target asset allocations it is anticipated that our us investment policy will generate an average annual return over the 20year projection period equal to or in excess of 75 percent approximately 50 percent of the time while returns of 90 percent or greater are anticipated 25 percent of the time except for the shortterm adverse conditions in the equity markets in 2008 our recent threeyear average rates of return have exceeded 100 percent as a result based on the historical returns and forwardlooking return expectations we believe an investment return assumption of 825 percent per year for us pension assets is reasonable the methodology used to determine the rate of return on pension plan assets in the uk was based on establishing an equityrisk premium over current longterm bond yields adjusted based on target asset allocations our strategy with respect to our investments in pension plan assets is to be invested with a longterm outlook therefore the risk and return balance of our asset portfolio should reflect a longterm horizon our pension plan asset allocation at december 31 2008 and 2007 and target allocation for 2009 are as follows 



actual cash funding for our pension plans is governed by employee benefit and tax laws and the pension protection act of 2006 the act the act extends the use of an average corporate bond rate for determining current liabilities for funding purposes among its many provisions the act establishes a 100 percent funding target for plan years beginning after december 31 2007 which has now been extended by the us congress due to the recession our funding strategy is to make contributions to our various qualified plans in accordance with statutory funding requirements and any additional 

contributions we determine are appropriate the table below sets forth our pension contributions for the period 20072008 and our expected range of contributions for 2009 



contributions beyond 2009 will depend on the funded status of our plans at that time in relation to the targeted funding established under the act 

our qualified pension plans in the us and outside the us were underfunded at december 31 2008 by a total of 581 million due to pension trust asset performance 

under sfas 158 the actuarial gains and losses and prior service costs credits are recognized and recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss increases in actuarial losses reduced our shareholders equity by 445 million after tax in 2008 the increases resulted from plan asset performance in 2008 

note 11 to the consolidated financial statements provides a summary of our pension benefit plan activity the funded status of our plans and the amounts recognized in our consolidated financial statements 

annual assessment for recoverability of goodwill 

under the provisions of sfas no 142 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 142 the carrying value of goodwill is reviewed annually the fair value of each reporting unit was estimated by discounting the future cash flows less requirements for working capital and fixed asset additions our valuation method requires us to make projections of revenue operating expenses working capital investment and fixed asset additions for the reporting units over a multiyear period additionally management must estimate its weightedaverage cost of capital for each reporting unit for use as a discount rate the discounted cash flows are compared to the carrying value of the reporting unit and if less than the carrying value a separate valuation of the goodwill is required to determine if an impairment loss has occurred as of the end of the third quarter in 2008 we performed the annual impairment assessment required by sfas 142 and determined that our goodwill was not impaired at december 31 2008 our recorded goodwill was 362 million changes in our projections or estimates a deterioration of our operating results and the related cash flow effect or a significant increase in the discount rate could decrease the estimated fair value of our reporting units and result in a future impairment of goodwill

in september 2006 the fasb issued sfas no 158 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans—an amendment of fasb statements no 87 88 106 and 132r sfas 158 this statement requires balance sheet recognition of the overfunded or underfunded status of pension and postretirement benefit plans in addition the measurement date the date at which plan assets and the benefit obligation are measured is required to be the companys fiscal year end during 2006 we adopted the provisions except for the measurement date change of sfas 158 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans—an amendment of fasb statements no 87 88 106 and 132r which resulted in a 94 million noncash charge to equity we adopted the measurement date provisions of sfas 158 effective january 1 2008 the majority of our pension and postretirement plans previously used a november 30 measurement date all plans are now measured at december 31 consistent with the companys fiscal year end the noncash effect of the adoption of the measurement date provisions of sfas 158 decreased shareholders equity by approximately 10 million 7 million aftertax and increased longterm liabilities by approximately 10 million there was no effect on our results of operations see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the adoption of this standard 

accounting pronouncements issued but not yet effective 

in december 2007 the fasb issued sfas no 141 revised 2007 business combinations sfas 141r which is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2008 sfas 141r makes significant changes to both the accounting and disclosures related to the acquisition of a business and could materially impact how we account for future business combination transactions because the standard will only impact transactions entered into after january 1 2009 sfas 141r will not impact our consolidated financial statements upon adoption 

in december 2007 the fasb issued sfas no 160 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements sfas 160 which is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2008 sfas 160 amends accounting research bulletin no 51 consolidated financial statements arb 51 and establishes accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary for cummins the most significant impact of the standard at adoption will be to reclass a majority of our minority interests 250 million at december 31 2008 to be included as a part of equity which may affect certain performance and equity ratios we are currently evaluating the potential additional impact that sfas 160 may have on our consolidated financial statements  

in march 2008 the fasb issued sfas no 161 disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas 161 which is effective for fiscal years beginning after november 15 2008 sfas 161 amends sfas no 133 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas 133 and requires enhanced disclosures about a companys derivative and hedging activities we do not expect the adoption of sfas 161 to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements  but are still evaluating the additional disclosure requirements 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to financial risk resulting from volatility in foreign exchange rates interest rates and commodity prices this risk is closely monitored and managed through the use of financial derivative instruments including commodity forward contracts currency forward contracts and interest rate swaps as stated in our policies and procedures financial derivatives are used expressly for hedging purposes and under no circumstances are they used for speculation purposes when material we adjust the value of our derivative contracts for counterparty or our credit risk the results and status of our hedging transactions are reported to senior management on a monthly and quarterly basis 

further information regarding financial instruments and risk management is contained in note 18 to the consolidated financial statements 

the following describes our risk exposures and provides results of sensitivity analysis performed as of december 31 2008 the sensitivity analysis assumes instantaneous parallel shifts in foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices 

foreign exchange rates 

as a result of our international business presence we are exposed to foreign currency exchange risk we transact in foreign currencies and have significant assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies as a result our income experiences some volatility related to movements in foreign currency exchange rates in order to benefit from global diversification and after considering naturally offsetting currency positions we enter into forward contracts to minimize our existing exposures recognized asset and liability and hedge forecasted transactions the objective of our hedging program is to reduce the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on income by essentially creating offsetting currency exposures 

as of december 31 2008 the potential gain or loss in the fair value of our outstanding foreign currency contracts assuming a hypothetical 10 percent fluctuation in the currencies of such contracts would be approximately 68 million the sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates assumes the notional value to remain constant for the next 12 months the analysis ignores the impact of foreign exchange movements on our competitive position and potential changes in sales levels it should be noted that any change in the value of the contracts real or hypothetical would be significantly offset by an inverse change in the value of the underlying hedged items see note 18 to the consolidated financial statements  

interest rates 

we are also exposed to interest rate risk as a result of our indebtedness our objective in managing our exposure to changes in interest rates is to limit the effect of interest rate changes on income and cash flows and to lower our overall cost of borrowing to achieve this objective we primarily use interest rate swap agreements to manage exposure to interest rate changes related to our borrowing arrangements 

in november 2005 we entered into an interest rate swap to effectively convert our 250 million due in 2028 debt from a fixed rate of 7125 to a floating rate based on a libor spread the terms of the swap mirror those of the debt with interest paid semiannually this swap qualifies as a fair value hedge under sfas no 133 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 

commodity prices 

we are also exposed to fluctuations in commodity prices through the purchase of raw materials as well as contractual agreements with component suppliers to reduce the effect of raw material price changes for select commodities we periodically enter into commodity forward contracts with designated banks to hedge a portion of our anticipated raw material purchases 

as of december 31 2008 the potential gain or loss related to the outstanding commodity forward contracts assuming a hypothetical 10 percent fluctuation in the price of such commodities was 10 million the sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in commodity prices assumes the notional value to remain constant for the next 12 months the analysis ignores the impact of commodity price movements on our competitive position and potential changes in sales levels it should be noted that any change in the value of the forward contracts real or hypothetical would be significantly offset by 

an inverse change in the value of the underlying hedged items see note 18 to the consolidated financial statements

changes in internal control over financial reporting

managements report on internal control over financial reporting

internal control over financial reporting is a process that involves human diligence and compliance and is subject to lapses in judgment and breakdowns resulting from human failures internal control over financial reporting can be circumvented by collusion or improper management override because of such limitations there is a risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting however these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce though not eliminate the risk material misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate

while our portfolio of branded products and offerings contains a number of market leaders we operate in a highly competitive sector and our branded offerings compete with the brands offered by other manufacturers and distributors that produce and sell similar offerings 

·   customers and partners to maintain technology leadership and a global presence in a costeffective manner we have established strategic alliances with a number of our leading customers these partnerships provide us with a knowledge and understanding of our customers’ technology and business needs and enable us to develop products and services which better meet their requirements at lower costs for example we have both customer and supplier arrangements with komatsu ltd including manufacturing joint ventures and a product development joint venture through which we have partnered in the development of several engines we are also the exclusive supplier of engines for komatsu mining equipment in addition we have been the exclusive diesel engine supplier to daimlerchrysler for its dodge ram truck since 1988 and in 2003 our exclusivity agreement was extended beyond model year 2007 we have longterm agreements with volvo and international truck and engine corporation for the supply of heavyduty truck engines and paccar for the supply of both heavyduty and mediumduty engines these agreements afford us longterm price stability and eliminate certain dealer and enduser discounts as well as offer closer integration on product development we also have multiple international joint ventures which manufacture heavyduty and midrange engines including partnerships with tata motors ltd which is the leading truck manufacturer in india and dongfeng automotive corporation an engine supplier to the largest mediumduty truck manufacturer in china

·   global presence we have a strong global presence including a worldwide distribution system manufacturing and engineering facilities around the world and a network of global supply sources our worldwide presence has enabled us to take advantage of growth opportunities in international markets with sales outside the us growing from 43 percent of total consolidated net sales in 2000 to 50 percent of total consolidated net sales in 2006 for over 70 years we have developed a distribution and service network that includes more than 550 companyowned and independent distributor locations and 5000 independent dealers located throughout 160 countries and territories we also have manufacturing operations and product engineering centers around the world with facilities in the united kingdom uk brazil mexico canada france australia china india south africa japan and singapore in addition we have developed a global network of highquality lowcost supply sources to support our manufacturing base

standards a full three years ahead of the requirements we have also developed lowemission highperformance natural gas engines as an alternativefuel option for the onhighway industrial and power generation markets our technology leadership in filtration exhaust aftertreatment air handling and fuel systems allows us to develop integrated product solutions for the onhighway offhighway and power generation markets allowing our customers to use a single highperformance lowcost system as opposed to multiple components from different suppliers 

business strategy 

the five key principles upon which we drive our business strategies are as follows 

·   being a low cost producer in as many of our markets as possible in many of our markets product or system cost is a critical performance parameter for our customers to achieve cost leadership we will continue to leverage our innovative technology economies of scale global presence and customer partnerships we have focused on reducing costs and lowering our breakeven point to maintain a competitive advantage and to deliver quality products to our customers the following key initiatives are integral to this strategy

·   six sigma since the program’s inception in 2000 we have not only applied six sigma to manufacturing processes and in the initial design of new products but also expanded the program to include processes with customers suppliers and distributors six sigma yields not only significant cost savings and improved quality it strengthens our relationships with these important stakeholders and contributes to developing longterm relationships

·   global sourcing our cost reduction efforts in supply chain management include global procurement from less expensive international markets such as china india eastern europe and brazil which has resulted in significantly reducing the cost of purchased materials and services during the last six years

·   technical productivity we have managed our research and development costs through a number of initiatives including a using analysisled design to eliminate capitalintensive prototypes through virtual computer modeling b performing significant analysis work at our technical center in india c applying engineering standards globally and d with costsharing arrangements with oem customers and joint venture partnerships cummins operates 17 technical centers around the world in august 2006 we further strengthened our engine research and development capability by officially opening our first technical center in central china’s wuhan city these initiatives have helped us to continue to be a technology leader while maintaining our research and engineering expense at approximately 28 percent of consolidated net sales for 2006

·   expanding into related markets we will continue to focus growth initiatives in related businesses where we can use our existing investments in products or technology leading brand name or market presence to establish a competitive advantage that focus is particularly on ventures that complement our existing businesses by being less capitalintensive and less cyclical or countercyclical to our core businesses for example the production of lightduty diesel engines in an existing cummins facility that will introduce us to a new consumer customer base furthermore we will target related markets that offer higher rates of growth attractive returns and more stable cash flows through product and end market diversity specific growth opportunities are outlined below

·   our engine segment strategy includes the development of lightduty diesel engines for the suvlight duty pickup truck and industrial markets both in the us and in china in addition our strategy includes the development of high horsepower engines for the growing oil and gas and marine markets

·   our power generation strategy is focused on attaining leadership positions in all major commercial generator set markets globally including growth in market share in european middle eastern and african markets and penetration gains in power electronics and controls such as automatic transfer switches and switchgear the business is also pursuing growth opportunities in adjacent markets for consumer generator sets including towable trailers portable generator sets auxiliary power units and residential generator sets

·   our components segment will leverage our filtration exhaust fuel systems turbocharger and engine technologies to provide integrated solutions for its customers and meet increasingly stringent emissions requirements

·   our distribution segment is growing through the expansion of the aftermarket parts and service business by capitalizing on its global customer base and fast growth markets in china india and russia as well as the middle east our strategy also includes increasing our ownership interest in key portions of the distribution channel

·   creating greater shareholder value return on equity is a primary measure of our consolidated financial performance we report the performance of our operating segments based on segment ebit segment ebit is earnings before interest expense taxes and minority interests

·   leveraging complementary businesses  strong synergies and relationships exist between our operating segments in the following areas

·   shared technology in addition to common platforms of base product technology our operating segments have technical capabilities which can be applied commercially to provide integrated solutions for our customers the operating segments also realize synergies in the development and application of broader technology tools such as information technology

·   common channels and distribution all operating segments utilize a common distribution channel which provides access to a full range of our products and also provides economies of scale

·   shared customers and partners there is substantial commonality in customers and partners between operating segments which allows us to build strong customer relationships and provides opportunity for expanded product offerings

·   corporate brand and image all operating segments benefit from the established and respected corporate brand

·   creating the right environment for success  we believe that creating the right environment for success means creating an inclusive learning environment while reinforcing a performance ethic that attracts develops and retains highquality talent we measure our success through skill and competency assessment leadership development outcomes and participation in tailored individual development and training programs

our operating segments 

we operate four complementary operating segments that share technology customers strategic partners brands and our distribution network to gain a competitive advantage in their respective markets with our size and global presence we provide worldclass products service and support to our customers in a costeffective manner in each of our operating segments we compete worldwide with a number of other manufacturers and distributors that produce and sell similar products our products primarily compete on the basis of price performance fuel economy speed of delivery quality and customer support 

we made certain leadership changes effective may 2 2005 within our management team in connection with these changes certain modifications were made to our internal reporting these modifications are summarized below 

·   the filtration and other segment was renamed the components segment and now includes operating results of the fuel systems business which were previously included in the engine segment historically the fuel systems business transferred product within the engine segment at cost beginning in the third quarter of 2005 those transfers began using a costplus based transfer price as a result of this change segment ebit increased for the components segment and decreased for the engine segment but there was no impact to consolidated earnings revenues of the components segment were also increased to reflect transfers to the engine segment and eliminations were increased by a corresponding amount

·   the north american distribution business was combined with the international distribution segment and renamed the distribution segment previously the north american distribution business was reported in the engine and power generation segments as investee equity and included the results of a partiallyowned distributor that is consolidated as a result revenues of the engine segment were increased to reflect sales to the consolidated distributor that were previously eliminated and decreased for the revenues of the consolidated distributor which are now included in the distribution segment in addition this change also caused investee equity earnings in the engine and power generation segments to decrease while investee equity earnings in the distribution segment increased by a corresponding amount

engine segment 

our engine segment manufactures and markets a broad range of diesel and natural gaspowered engines under the cummins brand name for the heavyand mediumduty truck bus recreational vehicle rv lightduty automotive agricultural construction mining marine oil and gas rail and governmental equipment markets we offer a wide variety of engine products with displacement from 14 to 91 liters and horsepower ranging from 31 to 3500 in addition we provide a full range of new parts and service as well as remanufactured parts and engines through our extensive distribution network the engine segment is our largest operating segment accounting for approximately 55 percent of total sales before intersegment eliminations in 2006 

the principal customers of our heavyand mediumduty truck engines include truck manufacturers such as international truck and engine corporation navistar international corporation volvo trucks north america paccar and freightliner cnh komatsu hitachi ingersoll rand and brunswick represent manufacturers of construction agricultural and marine equipment to whom we sell our industrial engines the principal customers of our lightduty onhighway engines are daimlerchrysler and manufacturers of rvs 

in the markets served by our engine segment we compete with independent engine manufacturers as well as oems who manufacture engines for their own products our primary competitors in north america are caterpillar inc detroit diesel corporation volvo trucks north america mack trucks inc and international truck and engine corporation engine division our primary competitors in international markets vary from country to country with local manufacturers generally predominant in each geographic market other engine manufacturers in international markets include mercedes benz volvo renault vehicules industriels scania weichai power co ltd and nissan diesel motor co ltd 

our engine segment organizes its engine parts and service businesses around the following enduser markets

segment financial information 

financial information about our operating segments is incorporated by reference from note 21 to the consolidated financial statements 

supply 

we have developed and maintain a worldclass supply base in terms of technology quality and cost we source our materials and manufactured components from leading suppliers both domestically and internationally we have adequate sources of supply of raw materials and components we machine and assemble some of the components used in our engines and power generation units including blocks heads rods turbochargers camshafts crankshafts filters exhaust systems alternators and fuel systems we also have arrangements with certain suppliers who are the sole source for specific products or supply items between 75 and 85 percent of our total raw material and component purchases in 2006 were purchased from suppliers who are the sole source of supply for a particular supply item although we elect to source a relatively high proportion of our total raw materials and component requirements from sole suppliers the majority of these supply items can be purchased from alternate suppliers with the appropriate leadtime and sourcing plan in 2006 we established a process to annually review our sourcing strategies with a focus on the reduction of risk we are also developing suppliers in many global or lowcost locations to serve our businesses across the globe and provide alternative sources in the event of disruption from existing suppliers in addition we maintain dual sourcing at a commodity level on many of our sole sourced part numbers our supply agreements vary according to the particular part number sourced however these agreements typically include standard terms relating to cost including cost reduction targets quality and delivery our supply agreements also typically include customary intellectual property provisions that contain prohibitions on the use of our intellectual property by the suppliers for any purpose other than their performance of the supply agreements and indemnity covenants from suppliers for breach by them of intellectual property rights of third parties in performance of the agreements the duration of our more important supply agreements varies but typically ranges between three and five years many of our supply agreements include early termination provisions related to failure to meet quality and delivery requirements 

patents and trademarks 

we own or control a significant number of patents and trademarks relating to the products we manufacture these have been granted and registered over a period of years although these patents and trademarks are generally considered beneficial to our operations we do not believe any patent group of patents or trademark other than our leading brand house trademarks is considered significant in relation to our business 

seasonality 

while individual product lines may experience modest seasonal declines in production there is no material effect on the demand for the majority of our products on a quarterly basis however our power generation segment normally experiences seasonal declines in the first quarter of the fiscal year due to general declines in construction spending and our distribution segment normally experiences seasonal declines in first quarter business activity due to holiday periods in asia and australia 

largest customer 

we have thousands of customers around the world and have developed longstanding business relationships with many of them daimlerchrysler is our largest customer accounting for approximately 10 percent of our consolidated net sales in 2006 primarily relating to sales of our isb engine for use in 

dodge ram trucks and sales of our heavy and mediumduty truck engines to the freightliner division of daimlerchrysler while a significant number of our sales to daimlerchrysler are under longterm supply agreements these agreements provide for the supply of daimlerchrysler’s engine requirements for particular vehicle models and not a specific volume of engines the loss of this customer or a significant decline in the production level of daimlerchrysler vehicles that use our engines would have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition we have been an engine supplier to daimlerchrysler for nearly 20 years and to freightliner for well over 50 years a summary of principal customers for each operating segment is included in our segment discussion 

in addition to our agreements with daimlerchrysler we have longterm heavyduty engine supply agreements with international truck and engine corporation paccar and volvo trucks north america collectively our net sales to these three customers was less than 19 percent of consolidated net sales in 2006 and individually was less than 9 percent of consolidated net sales for each customer as with daimlerchrysler these agreements contain standard purchase and sale agreement terms covering engine and engine parts pricing quality and delivery commitments as well as engineering product support obligations the basic nature of our agreements with oem customers is that they are longterm price and operations agreements that assure the availability of our products to each customer through the duration of the respective agreements there are no guarantees or commitments by these customers of any kind regarding volumes or market shares except in the case of daimlerchrysler which has committed that cummins will be its exclusive diesel engine supplier for the dodge ram heavyduty pickup truck agreements with oems contain bilateral termination provisions giving either party the right to terminate in the event of a material breach change of control or insolvency or bankruptcy of the other party 

backlog 

demand in many of our markets has grown rapidly in the last two years resulting in longer lead times however while we have supply agreements with some truck and offhighway equipment oems most of our business is transacted through open purchase orders these open orders are historically subject to monthtomonth releases and are subject to cancellation on reasonable notice without cancellation charges and therefore are not considered firm 

distribution 

for over 70 years we have been developing a distribution and service network that includes more than 550 independent distributor locations and 5000 independent dealers in 160 countries and territories in north america this network is comprised of independent and partiallyowned distributors internationally our network consists of independent partiallyowned and whollyowned distributors most distributors sell the full range of our products as well as complementary products and services our distribution segment operates within this network with 17 companyowned distributors and 12 joint ventures in approximately 270 locations in over 90 countries and territories 

our licensing agreements with independent and partiallyowned distributors generally have a threeyear term and are restricted to specified territories our distributors develop and maintain a network of dealers with which we have no direct relationship the distributors are permitted to sell other noncompetitive products only with our consent we license all of our distributors to use our name and logo in connection with the sale and service of our products with no right to assign or sublicense the marks except to authorized dealers without our consent products are sold to the distributors at standard domestic or international distributor net prices as applicable net prices are wholesale prices we establish to permit our distributors an adequate margin on their sales subject to local laws we can refuse to renew these agreements at will and we may terminate them upon 90day notice for inadequate sales change in principal ownership and certain other reasons distributors also have the right to terminate the agreements upon 60day notice without cause or 30day notice for cause upon termination or failure to renew we 

may be required to purchase the distributor’s current inventory and may at our option purchase other assets of the distributor but are under no obligation to do so 

our distribution capability is a key element of our business strategy and competitive position particularly in our efforts to increase customer access to aftermarket replacement parts and repair service there are more than 5000 locations in north america primarily owned and operated by oems or their dealers at which cummins trained service personnel and parts are available to service maintain and repair our engines we also have parts distribution centers located strategically throughout the world in order to serve our customers and distributors

employees 

as of december 31 2006 we employed approximately 34600 persons worldwide 

environmental compliance 

product environmental compliance 

our engines are subject to extensive statutory and regulatory requirements that directly or indirectly impose standards governing emissions and noise our products comply with emissions standards that the epa the california air resources board carb and other state regulatory agencies as well as other regulatory agencies around the world have established for heavyduty onhighway diesel and gas engines and offhighway engines produced through 2006 our ability to comply with these and future emissions standards is an essential element in maintaining our leadership position in regulated markets we have made and will continue to make significant capital and research expenditures to comply with these standards failure to comply with these standards could result in adverse effects on our future financial results 

epa engine certifications 

in the fourth quarter of 2002 we implemented new onroad emissions standards these were implemented in accordance with the terms of a 1998 consent decree that we and a number of other engine manufacturers entered into with the epa the us department of justice doj and carb the consent decree also required us to pull forward by one year to january 1 2005 the implementation of tier iii emissions standards for offroad engines in the 300 to 749 horsepower range sales of these engines commenced january 1 2005 the consent decree was in response to concerns raised by these agencies regarding the level of nitrogen oxide emissions from heavyduty diesel engines on december 15 2006 we were notified by the epa that the consent decree provisions relating to certification of onhighway engines have been terminated indicating our successful completion of that portion of the consent decree certain other requirements of the consent decree continue and are on course to terminate within deadlines 

federal and california regulations require manufacturers to report failures of emissionsrelated components to the epa and carb when the failure rate reaches a specified level at higher failure rates a product recall may be required in 2006 we submitted 46 reports to the epa relating to 24 different defects affecting egr valves turbochargers and a minor mathematical change to the calibration algorithm none of these defects resulted in a campaign of a material nature 

emissions standards in international markets including europe and japan are becoming more stringent we believe that our experience in meeting us emissions standards leaves us well positioned to take advantage of opportunities in these markets as the need for emissions control capability grows 

new onhighway emissions standards came into effect in the us on january 1 2007 in december 2003 we announced that we would meet the 2007 us epa heavyduty onhighway emissions standards by combining our existing cooled exhaust gas recirculation egr technology with particulate matter pm filters cooled egr is the same technology that we have used since april 2002 and was selected after reviewing other aftertreatment technologies such as nox adsorbers and selective catalytic reduction scr our experience with particulate filters and the availability of ultralowsulfur diesel fuel combine to give us the confidence in meeting these tough standards in the us additionally while we believe the egrpm filter combination is the right solution for 2007 in the us we have selected scr as the right technology to meet onhighway euro iv emissions standards and certain offhighway applications 

other environmental statutes and regulations 

we believe we are in compliance in all material respects with laws and regulations applicable to our plants and operations during the last five years expenditures for environmental control activities and 

environmental remediation projects at our facilities in the us have not been a substantial portion of annual capital outlays and are not expected to be material in 2007 

pursuant to notices received from federal and state agencies andor defendant parties in site environmental contribution actions we have been identified as a potentially responsible party prp under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of 1980 as amended or similar state laws at approximately 17 waste disposal sites based upon our experiences at similar sites we believe that our aggregate future remediation costs will not be significant we have established accruals that we believe are adequate for our expected future liability with respect to these sites 




 item 1a   risk factors relating to our business 

set forth below and elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k are some of the principal risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual business results to differ materially from any forwardlooking statements contained in this report in addition future results could be materially affected by general industry and market conditions changes in laws or accounting rules general us and nonus economic and political conditions including a global economic slowdown fluctuation of interest rates or currency exchange rates terrorism political unrest or international conflicts political instability or major health concerns natural disasters or other disruptions of expected economic and business conditions these risk factors should be considered in addition to our cautionary comments concerning forwardlooking statements in this report including statements related to markets for our products and trends in our business that involve a number of risks and uncertainties our separate section in item 7 below “disclosure regarding forwardlooking statements” should be considered in addition to the following statements 

our business is affected by the cyclical nature of the markets we serve 

our financial performance depends in large part on varying conditions in the markets and geographies that we serve demand in these markets and geographies fluctuates in response to overall economic conditions and is particularly sensitive to changes in interest rate levels our sales are also impacted by oem inventory levels and production schedules and stoppages economic downturns in the markets we serve generally result in reductions in sales and pricing of our products which could reduce future earnings and cash flow 

our products are subject to substantial government regulation 

our engines are subject to extensive statutory and regulatory requirements governing emissions and noise including standards imposed by the epa state regulatory agencies such as the carb and other regulatory agencies around the world in some cases we may be required to develop new products to comply with new regulations particularly those relating to air emissions for example we were required to develop new engines to comply with stringent emissions standards by january 1 2007 while we were able to meet this deadline our ability to comply with other existing and future regulatory standards will be essential for us to maintain our position in the engine markets we serve currently we believe we are on schedule to meet all deadlines for known future regulatory standards 

we have made and will be required to continue to make significant capital and research expenditures to comply with these regulatory standards further the successful development and introduction of new and enhanced products are subject to risks such as delays in product development cost overruns and unanticipated technical and manufacturing difficulties any failure to comply with regulatory standards affecting our products could subject us to fines or penalties and could require us to cease production of any noncompliant engine or to recall any engines produced and sold in violation of the applicable 

standards see “business—environmental compliance—product environmental compliance” for a complete discussion of the environmental laws and regulations that affect our products 

our products are subject to recall for performance related issues 

we are at risk for product recall costs product recall costs are incurred when we decide either voluntarily or involuntarily to recall a product through a formal campaign to solicit the return of specific products due to a known or suspected performance issue costs typically include the cost of the product part or component being replaced customer cost of the recall and labor to remove and replace the defective part or component when a recall decision is made we estimate the cost of the recall and record a charge to earnings in that period in accordance with fasb statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 5 “accounting for contingencies” in making this estimate judgment is required as to the quantity or volume to be recalled the total cost of the recall campaign the ultimate negotiated sharing of the cost between us and the customer and in some cases the extent to which the supplier of the part or component will share in the recall cost as a result these estimates are subject to change 

we cannot assure that our truck manufacturers and oem customers will continue to outsource their engine supply needs 

several of our engine customers including paccar navistar volvo and daimlerchrysler are truck manufacturers or oems that manufacture engines for some of their own products despite their engine manufacturing abilities these customers have chosen to outsource certain types of engine production to us due to the quality of our engine products our emissions capability systems integration their customer’s preference and in order to reduce costs eliminate production risks and maintain company focus however we cannot assure that these customers will continue to outsource engine production in the future increased levels of oem vertical integration could result from a number of factors such as shifts in our customers’ business strategies acquisition by a customer of another engine manufacturer the inability of thirdparty suppliers to meet product specifications and the emergence of lowcost production opportunities in foreign countries any significant reduction in the level of engine production outsourcing from our truck manufacturer or oem customers could significantly impact our revenues and accordingly have a material adverse affect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our largest customer accounts for a significant share of our business 

sales to daimlerchrysler accounted for approximately 10 percent of our consolidated net sales for 2006 primarily relating to sales of our isb engine for use in the dodge ram truck and sales of our heavyand mediumduty truck engines to its freightliner division while a significant amount of our sales to daimlerchrysler are under longterm supply agreements these agreements provide for the supply of daimlerchrysler’s engine requirements for particular models and not a specific number of engines accordingly the loss of daimlerchrysler as a customer or a significant decline in the production levels for the vehicles in which daimlerchrysler uses our products would have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our manufacturing operations are dependent upon thirdparty suppliers making us vulnerable to supply shortages 

we obtain materials and manufactured components from thirdparty suppliers a significant number of our suppliers representing 75 to 85 percent of our total raw material and component purchasers in 2006 are the sole source for a particular supply item although the majority of these materials and components can be obtained from other suppliers any delay in our suppliers’ abilities to provide us with necessary materials and components may affect our capabilities at a number of our manufacturing locations or may require us to seek alternative supply sources delays in obtaining supplies may result from a number of 

factors affecting our suppliers including capacity constraints labor disputes the impaired financial condition of a particular supplier suppliers’ allocations to other purchasers weather emergencies or acts of war or terrorism any delay in receiving supplies could impair our ability to deliver products to our customers and accordingly could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

we may be adversely impacted by work stoppages and other labor matters 

as of december 31 2006 we employed approximately 34600 persons worldwide approximately 13500 of our employees worldwide are represented by various unions under collective bargaining agreements with various unions that expire between 2007 and 2011 while we have no reason to believe that we will be impacted by work stoppages and other labor matters we cannot assure that future issues with our labor unions will be resolved favorably or that we will not encounter future strikes further unionization efforts or other types of conflicts with labor unions or our employees any of these factors may have an adverse effect on us or may limit our flexibility in dealing with our workforce in addition many of our customers have unionized work forces work stoppages or slowdowns experienced by our customers could result in slowdowns or closures at vehicle assembly plants where our engines are installed if one or more of our customers experience a material work stoppage it could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our products involve risks of exposure to product liability claims 

we face an inherent business risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that our products’ failure to perform to specifications results or is alleged to result in property damage bodily injury andor death we may experience material product liability losses in the future while we maintain insurance coverage with respect to certain product liability claims we may not be able to obtain such insurance on acceptable terms in the future if at all and any such insurance may not provide adequate coverage against product liability claims in addition product liability claims can be expensive to defend and can divert the attention of management and other personnel for significant periods of time regardless of the ultimate outcome an unsuccessful defense of a product liability claim could have a material adverse affect on our business results of operations and financial condition and cash flows in addition even if we are successful in defending against a claim relating to our products claims of this nature could cause our customers to lose confidence in our products and us 

our operations are subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations 

our plants and operations are subject to increasingly stringent environmental laws and regulations in all of the countries in which we operate including laws and regulations governing emissions to air discharges to water and the generation handling storage transportation treatment and disposal of waste materials while we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with these environmental laws and regulations we cannot assure that we will not be adversely impacted by costs liabilities or claims with respect to existing or subsequently acquired operations under either present laws and regulations or those that may be adopted or imposed in the future we are also subject to laws requiring the cleanup of contaminated property if a release of hazardous substances occurs at or from any of our current or former properties or at a landfill or another location where we have disposed of hazardous materials we may be held liable for the contamination and the amount of such liability could be material 

we are exposed to political economic and other risks that arise from operating a multinational business 

approximately 50 percent of our net sales for 2006 were attributable to customers outside the united states accordingly our business is subject to the political economic and other risks that are inherent in operating in numerous countries these risks include 

·   the difficulty of enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through foreign legal systems

·   trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements

·   tax rates in certain foreign countries that exceed those in the united states and the imposition of withholding requirements on foreign earnings

·   the imposition of tariffs exchange controls or other restrictions

·   difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations and the application of foreign labor regulations

·   required compliance with a variety of foreign laws and regulations and

·   changes in general economic and political conditions in countries where we operate particularly in emerging markets

as we continue to expand our business globally our success will depend in part on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these and other risks we cannot assure that these and other factors will not have a material adverse affect on our international operations or on our business as a whole 

we are subject to currency exchange rate and other related risks 

we conduct operations in many areas of the world involving transactions denominated in a variety of currencies we are subject to currency exchange rate risk to the extent that our costs are denominated in currencies other than those in which we earn revenues in addition since our financial statements are denominated in us dollars changes in currency exchange rates between the us dollar and other currencies have had and will continue to have an impact on our earnings while we customarily enter into financial transactions to address these risks we cannot assure that currency exchange rate fluctuations will not adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition in addition while the use of currency hedging instruments may provide us with protection from adverse fluctuations in currency exchange rates by utilizing these instruments we potentially forego the benefits that might result from favorable fluctuations in currency exchange rates 

we also face risks arising from the imposition of exchange controls and currency devaluations exchange controls may limit our ability to convert foreign currencies into us dollars or to remit dividends and other payments by our foreign subsidiaries or businesses located in or conducted within a country imposing controls currency devaluations result in a diminished value of funds denominated in the currency of the country instituting the devaluation actions of this nature if they occur or continue for significant periods of time could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition in any given period 

we face significant competition in the markets we serve 

the markets in which we operate are highly competitive we compete worldwide with a number of other manufacturers and distributors that produce and sell similar products our products primarily compete on the basis of price performance fuel economy speed of delivery quality and customer support there can be no assurance that our products will be able to compete successfully with the products of these other companies any failure by us to compete effectively in the markets we serve could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition for a more complete

results of operations 

2006 vs 2005 

 

  

net sales 

net sales increased in all segments engine sales were up 854 million or 13 percent due to strong demand from heavy and mediumduty truck oems higher engine volumes for industrial applications and increased shipments of lightduty engines engine and part sales to onhighway markets were 12 percent higher compared to last year with increased volumes in most market segments power generation sales increased 417 million or 21 percent due to increased demand across all product lines components sales increased 281 million or 14 percent due to increased sales within all of our components businesses distribution sales increased 194 million or 16 percent primarily due to increased demand for power generation products followed by increased parts service and engine volumes see our “operating segment results” section for further details on sales by segment 

gross margin 

gross margin improved primarily due to increased sales the related absorption benefits on fixed manufacturing costs and changes in sales mix all of which increased gross margin by 395 million in addition 94 million in price realization net of increased product costs improved gross margin in the current year compared to the prior year these increases in margin were partially offset by increased warranty expenses of 53 million primarily as a result of the increased volumes as well as increased spending of 43 million for new product introductions and rampup 

warranty expense as a percent of sales increased slightly to 28 percent in 2006 compared to 27 percent in 2005 

selling and administrative expenses 

selling and administrative expenses increased primarily due to incremental staffing and higher compensation and related expenses of approximately 64 million which included salaries variable compensation and fringe benefits as a result of our improved financial performance other factors affecting selling and administrative expenses included increased consulting fees and other outside services of 33 million increased marketing and administrative expenses of 18 million and increased travel expenses of 16 million the remaining change in selling and administrative expenses is due to a combination of increases in various other miscellaneous expenses none of which were significant individually partially offset by a favorable foreign currency impact overall selling and administrative expenses were 113 percent of sales in 2006 compared to 115 percent of sales in 2005 

research and engineering expenses 

research and engineering expenses increased primarily due to increased compensation expense and consulting and outside services as well as higher spending on development programs for future products we had significant research and engineering expenses across the engine and components segments related to new product development for 2007 and beyond as well as research and engineering expenses for growth platforms across geographies the engine segment accounted for 24 million of the increase in research and engineering expenses along with an increase in the components segment of 12 million fluctuations in other miscellaneous research and development expenses were not significant individually or in the aggregate 

investee equity royalty and other income 

investee equity royalty and other income increased slightly primarily due to an increase in earnings at several of our equity investees led by an 18 million increase in earnings from our north american distributors a 6 million increase in earnings from tata cummins ltd and a 3 million increase in earnings from ccec these increases were partially offset by a 17 million decrease in earnings from dongfeng cummins engine company ltd dcec as a result of weakness in the mediumduty truck market due to the continuous tonnage upgrade of china’s truck industry 

other operating expenses net 

the major components of other operating expense are royalty income amortization of intangible assets and gain or loss on sale of fixed assets the 2006 results include a 9 million gain on the sale of seg and a legal settlement of approximately 3 million in addition royalty income decreased by approximately 4 million in 2006 fluctuations in other miscellaneous operating expenses and income none of which were material resulted in an additional 2 million of other operating expense 

interest income 

interest income increased primarily due to higher average cash balances in 2006 compared to 2005 the higher average cash balances are due to increased earnings and stronger cash flows from operations in 2006 

interest expense 

interest expense decreased primarily due to lower debt balances in 2006 as compared to 2005 the conversion of our 300 million 7 convertible subordinated debentures during the second quarter resulted in a reduction in interest expense of over 10 million for 2006 

other income expenses net 

the major components of other income expense include foreign currency exchange gains and losses bank charges and other miscellaneous income and expenses the fluctuation in other income in 2006 compared to 2005 is due to a fluctuation in foreign currency exchange gains and losses from a loss of approximately 6 million in 2005 to a gain of approximately 11 million in 2006 partially offsetting the fluctuation in foreign currency gains and losses was a 12 million loss on the early extinguishment of debt incurred when we repaid our 250 million 95 notes in december 2006 in addition there were several fluctuations in the components of miscellaneous other income and expenses none of which were individually significant 

provision for income taxes 

our tax rates are generally less than the 35 percent us income tax rate primarily because of lower taxes on foreign earnings export tax benefits and research tax credits 

our effective tax rate for 2006 was 299 percent our income tax provision for 2006 was impacted by a 12 million or 023 per share increase in the first quarter for the effect of new indiana tax legislation and a 28 million or 055 per share reduction in the second quarter due to the favorable resolution of tax uncertainties related to prior years and by a 10 million or 020 per share reduction in the fourth quarter due to the retroactive reinstatement of the us research tax credit our effective tax rate for 2005 was 271 percent our 2005 provision was reduced by 16 million for the tax benefits of foreign dividend distributions which qualified for a special 85 percent deduction under the american jobs creation act of 2004 and by 8 million due to the favorable resolution in the fourth quarter of 2005 of prior year tax positions which had been in dispute 

we expect our 2007 effective tax rate to be 33 percent excluding any discrete items that may arise the jobs act phases out the export tax benefits reduced 20 percent for 2005 40 percent for 2006 and repealed thereafter that have been a key factor in our low tax rate export benefits are replaced with a new us manufacturer’s tax deduction which began phasing in starting in 2005 however we do not expect the manufacturer’s deduction to produce a comparable level of benefits 

minority interests in earnings of consolidated subsidiaries 

minority interest is primarily attributable to cummins india ltd cil a 51 percent owned subsidiary cummins eastern canada llp cec a 51 percent owned subsidiary and wuxi holset engineering co ltd wuxi a 55 percent owned subsidiary these three subsidiaries account for over 90 percent of the total minority interest in 2006 earnings at these three subsidiaries increased this year resulting in a combined increase in minority interest of 7 million for 2006 compared to 2005 in addition earnings at seg gmbh  co kg a 51 percent owned subsidiary prior to its sale in the fourth quarter of 2006 improved resulting in a 3 million yearoveryear increase in minority interests the remainder of the consolidated partiallyowned subsidiaries had a combination of immaterial increases and decreases in earnings 

2005 vs 2004 

   

net sales 

net sales increased in all segments with the primary driver being a 1233 million or 23 percent increase in engine sales due to strong demand from heavy and mediumduty truck oems higher engine volumes for industrial and stationary power applications and increased shipments of lightduty engines engine and part sales to onhighway markets were 20 percent higher compared to 2004 with increased volumes in all market segments power generation sales increased 157 million or 9 percent due to increased demand for commercial generator sets generator drives and alternators partially offset by a moderate decrease in rental revenue and a slight decrease in sales to the consumer market components sales increased 217 million or 12 percent primarily reflecting increased demand from firstfit oems and the aftermarket channel distribution sales increased 218 million or 22 percent primarily due to increased demand for engines and power generation products internationally and sales growth from distributor acquisitions see our “operating segment results and outlook” section for further details on sales by segment 

gross margin 

gross margin improved primarily due to increased sales the related absorption benefits on fixed manufacturing costs and changes in sales mix all of which increased gross margin by 453 million in addition pricing actions of 145 million in 2005 enabled us to more than offset the increased material costs of steel and other commodities of 130 million other factors which impacted gross margin to a lesser extent were slightly increased warranty costs the favorable impact of currency exchange rates and other miscellaneous cost reductions as a result of the foregoing gross margin percentage increased to 220 percent in 2005 from 199 percent in 2004 

warranty expense as a percent of sales decreased slightly to 27 percent in 2005 compared to 31 percent in 2004 

selling and administrative expenses 

selling and administrative expenses increased primarily due to higher compensation and related expenses of approximately 72 million which included salaries variable compensation and fringe benefits as a result of our improved financial performance in addition incremental staffing added to the increased compensation and related expenses shipping and handling costs increased by approximately 11 million due to increased sales volumes other factors increasing selling and administrative expenses to a lesser extent included marketing and administrative expenses consulting fees and other outside services which combined for 23 million of the increase overall selling and administrative expenses were 115 percent of sales in 2005 compared to 120 percent of sales in 2004 

research and engineering expenses 

research and engineering expenses increased primarily due to increased compensation expense and consulting and outside services as well as higher spending on prototype development programs for future products the engine segment accounted for 38 million of the increase in research and engineering expenses along with a slight increase in the components segment offset by a slight decrease in the power generation segment other miscellaneous research and development expenses increased as well however they were not significant individually or in the aggregate 

investee equity royalty and other income 

investee equity royalty and other income increased primarily due to improved earnings from our north american distributors of 8 million and improved earnings from ccec of 7 million these increases were partially offset by decreased earnings from dcec of 7 million due to reduced demand in china’s truck market in response to regulatory changes

the major components of other operating expenses are royalty income amortization of intangible assets and loss on sale of fixed assets the fluctuation from 2004 to 2005 was primarily due to a decrease in the loss on sale of fixed assets 

interest income 

interest income increased primarily due to higher average cash balances in 2005 compared to 2004 the increased cash balances are due to increased earnings and stronger cash flows from operations in 2005 

interest expense 

interest expense decreased slightly due to a combination of factors interest expense on debt in 2005 was lower due to the repayment of longterm debt in the first quarter the lower interest expense on debt was partially offset by increased interest expense on capital leases related to power generation equipment due to the conversion of operating leases to capital leases in late 2004 

other expenses net 

the major components of other expense include foreign currency exchange gains and losses bank charges and other miscellaneous expenses the increase in other expense in 2005 compared to 2004 is primarily due to an increase in foreign currency exchange losses and a decrease in the gain on sale of marketable securities these increases to other expense were partially offset by writedowns of investments in 2004 that did not recur in 2005 

provision for income taxes 

the higher 2005 tax provision of 271 percent reflects the increase in earnings before taxes our 2005 provision was reduced by 16 million for the tax benefits of foreign dividend distributions which qualified for a special 85 percent deduction under the american jobs creation act of 2004 and by 8 million due to the favorable resolution in the fourth quarter of 2005 of prior year tax positions which had been in dispute excluding these unusual or nonrecurring benefits our 2005 effective tax rate was 301 percent this rate was lower than the 35 percent us tax rate primarily because of us export tax benefits and research tax credits along with lower taxes on foreign earnings especially foreign joint venture equity earnings recorded net of foreign taxes 

minority interests in earnings of consolidated subsidiaries 

the increase in minority interests was primarily attributable to higher earnings at cummins eastern canada llp a 51 percentowned subsidiary and cummins india limited a 51 percentowned subsidiary these two subsidiaries account for over seventy percent of the total minority interest in 2005 the remainder of the increase in minority interests was attributable to a combination of immaterial increases and decreases in earnings at the remaining consolidated subsidiaries 

operating segment results and outlook 

our reportable operating segments consist of the following engine power generation components and distribution this reporting structure is organized according to the products and markets each segment serves this type of reporting structure allows management to focus its efforts on providing enhanced service to a wide range of customers the engine segment produces engines and parts for sale to customers in onhighway and various industrial markets the engines are used in trucks of all sizes buses and rvs as well as various industrial applications including construction mining agriculture marine oil and gas rail and military the power generation segment is an integrated provider of power systems selling engines generator sets and alternators and providing rental of power equipment for both standby and prime power uses the components segment includes sales of filtration products exhaust and aftertreatment systems turbochargers and fuel systems the distribution segment includes whollyowned and partiallyowned distributorships engaged in wholesaling engines generator sets and service parts performing service and repair activities on our products and maintaining relationships with various oems 

we use segment ebit defined as earnings before interest expense taxes and minority interests as a primary basis for the chief operating decisionmaker to evaluate the performance of each of our operating segments segment amounts exclude certain expenses not specifically identifiable to segments 

the accounting policies of our operating segments are the same as those applied in the consolidated financial statements  we prepared the financial results of our operating segments on a basis that is consistent with the manner in which we internally disaggregate financial information to assist in making internal operating decisions we have allocated certain common costs and expenses primarily corporate functions among segments differently than we would for standalone financial information prepared in accordance with gaap these include certain costs and expenses of shared services such as information technology human resources legal and finance we also do not allocate debtrelated items actuarial gains or losses prior service costs or credits minimum pension liabilities or income taxes to individual segments segment ebit may not be consistent with measures used by other companies 

a summary of operating results by segment for the years ended december 31 is shown below 

   

1   includes intercompany eliminations and unallocated corporate expenses

the tables below reconcile the segment information to the corresponding amounts in the consolidated financial statements 

   

we made certain leadership changes effective may 2 2005 within our management team in connection with these changes certain modifications were made to our internal reporting these modifications are summarized below 

·   the filtration and other segment was renamed the components segment and now includes operating results of the fuel systems business which were previously included in the engine segment historically the fuel systems business transferred product within the engine segment at cost beginning in the third quarter of 2005 those transfers now use a costplus based transfer price as a result of this change segment ebit increased for the components segment and decreased for the engine segment but there was no impact to consolidated earnings revenues of the components segment were also increased to reflect transfers to the engine segment and eliminations were increased by a corresponding amount

·   the north american distribution business was combined with the international distribution segment and renamed the distribution segment previously the north american distribution business was reported in the engine and power generation segments as equity from investees and included the results of a partiallyowned distributor that is consolidated as a result revenues of the engine segment were increased to reflect sales to the consolidated distributor that were previously eliminated and decreased for the revenues of the consolidated distributor which are now included 

in the distribution segment in addition this change also caused earnings from equity investees in the engine and power generation segments to decrease while earnings from equity investees in the distribution segment increased by a corresponding amount 

due to the extent of intersegment sales activity and certain seasonality in inventory levels during the year we have presented the elimination of intersegment profit in inventory resulting from intersegment transactions in the nonsegment items column of our segment reporting see note 21 to the consolidated financial statements  this presentation better aligns segment revenues with segment costs and presents segment ebit as if each segment was an independent standalone entity 

the impact of the above changes on operating results and net assets by segment for 2004 is shown in the table below

engine results and outlook 

2006 vs 2005 

the net sales investee income and segment ebit for engine were as follows dollars in millions 

   

the increase in net sales for this segment was primarily due to strong demand across most markets particularly the north american heavyduty truck market and stationary power due to the strong performance of our power generation segment along with strong industrial market sales total onhighwayrelated sales were 63 percent of engine segment net sales during 2006 and 2005 

the improvement in segment ebit was primarily due to the higher engine volumes across all major markets the accompanying gross margin benefits of higher absorption of fixed manufacturing costs improved pricing and manufacturing efficiencies all of which resulted in a nearly one percentage point improvement in gross margin percentage in 2006 compared to last year gross margin increased 221 million or 18 percent in 2006 compared to last year selling and administrative expenses increased 61 million or 11 percent however selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased slightly research and engineering expenses increased 24 million or 12 percent compared to 2005 and remained flat as a percentage of net sales compared to last year 

in addition earnings from joint ventures decreased 13 million compared with 2005 primarily due to a 17 million decrease in earnings at dcec as a result of weakness in the mediumduty truck market due to the continuous tonnage upgrade of china’s truck industry 

a summary and discussion of engine net sales by market follows dollars in millions 

   

a summary of unit shipments by engine classification including unit shipments to power generation follows 

 

  

heavyduty truck 

the increase in sales to the heavyduty truck market was primarily driven by the north american truck market as oems work to meet growing demand from truck fleets replacing trucks ahead of the 2007 change in emissions standards global unit shipments of heavyduty truck engines were up 17 percent in 2006 compared to 2005 with north american shipments up 18 percent and international shipments up 11 percent 

mediumduty truck and bus 

the increase in mediumduty truck and bus revenues was due to strong demand ahead of the 2007 change in emission standards and our growing market share position with north american oems in the medium duty truck and bus markets shipments of mediumduty truck engines were up 36 percent to north american oems and down 20 percent to international oems compared with 2005 shipments to north american bus oems increased 56 percent in 2006 compared to 2005 while international shipments were down 10 percent the increase in mediumduty truck and bus engine shipments in north america is due to our increased penetration in this market and an overall increase in demand ahead of the emission standard changes the decrease in shipments to international mediumduty truck oems is primarily due to changes in emissions standards in brazil to euro iii effective january 1 2006 the decrease in international bus engine shipments yearoveryear is due to a large purchase made in 2005 by a customer in china 

lightduty automotive and rv 

sales of lightduty automotive engines increased as a result of higher volumes total lightduty automotive unit shipments were approximately 196000 in 2006 an increase of 5 percent compared to 2005 the majority of the lightduty automotive and rv volumes was driven by demand from daimlerchrysler with shipments of approximately 162000 units or a 1 percent increase compared to 2005 engine shipments to recreational vehicle oems increased by nearly 33 percent in 2006 compared with 2005 due to new product introductions and growing penetration at key oems 

industrial 

total sales were up in most industrial markets primarily due to strong demand unit shipments increased 18 percent in 2006 compared to 2005 approximately 52 percent of the shipments were to north american markets and 48 percent to international markets in 2006 compared to 56 percent and 44 percent respectively in 2005 the overall change in the geographic sales mix is due to the continued strength of the international construction market which is being driven by strong demand in the middle east and asia total shipments to the construction market increased 20 percent largely because international shipments increased 31 percent other markets showing significant increases in shipments were the mining market and the oil and gas market with increases of 10 percent and 39 percent respectively the mining market demand is up as the strength in commodity prices has been driving investment in mining capacity the shipments to the oil and gas market have increased as sustained oil and natural gas prices continue to drive activity and investments in new equipment in addition we continue to penetrate this market further with the release of more engine platforms to this application other industrial markets had modest increases in shipments compared to 2005 

stationary power 

the increase in sales to stationary power markets is due to the increased net sales to our power generation segment these net sales are eliminated in our consolidated statements of earnings  see the power generation results and outlook for a discussion of the increase in net sales 

2005 vs 2004 

the net sales investee income and segment ebit for engine were as follows dollars in millions 

 

  

the increase in net sales for this segment was primarily due to strong demand across all market sectors particularly the lightduty automotive market with record engine sales to daimlerchrysler and the north american heavyduty and mediumduty truck markets total onhighwayrelated engine sales were 63 percent of engine segment net sales in 2005 compared with 65 percent in 2004 

the improvement in segment ebit was primarily due to the higher engine volumes across all major markets the accompanying gross margin benefits of higher absorption of fixed manufacturing costs pricing and favorable foreign exchange impacts all of which resulted in a two percentage point improvement in gross margin percentage over 2004 gross margin increased 344 million or 38 percent over 2004 selling and administrative expenses increased 63 million or 13 percent over 2004 however selling and 

administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales improved almost a full percentage point research and engineering expenses increased 38 million or 24 percent compared to 2004 and remained flat as a percentage of net sales compared to the prior period 

in addition earnings from joint ventures remained flat compared with 2004 due to higher earnings from several joint ventures which were offset by a 7 million decrease in earnings at dcec in reaction to changes in the regulatory environment 

a summary and discussion of engine net sales by market follows dollars in millions 

 

  

a summary of unit shipments by engine classification including unit shipments to power generation follows 

 

  

heavyduty truck 

the increase in sales to the heavyduty truck market was primarily driven by the recovery in the north american truck market as oems increased build rates to meet the growing demand from truck fleets replacing aging equipment and adding capacity unit shipments of heavyduty truck engines were up 27 percent in 2005 compared to 2004 with north american shipments up 26 percent and international shipments up 33 percent 

mediumduty truck and bus 

the increase in mediumduty truck and bus revenues is due to increased shipments of mediumduty truck and bus engines in north america and internationally shipments of mediumduty truck engines were up 24 percent to north american oems and up 12 percent to international oems compared with 2004 the increase in mediumduty truck engine shipments was driven primarily by economic growth as demand in this market typically correlates with demand in the heavyduty market sales of bus engines and parts increased in 2005 compared to 2004 due to strong demand from north american oems with shipments up 53 percent and international shipments up 48 percent international shipments were up due to strong demand in asia and latin america slightly offset by lower volumes in europe 

lightduty automotive 

sales of lightduty automotive engines increased as a result of higher volumes total unit shipments were 187000 in 2005 an increase of 4 percent compared to 2004 most of the increase in lightduty automotive sales was driven by continued demand from daimlerchrysler with record shipments of 160000 units or a 4 percent increase compared to 2004 engine shipments to rv oems remained flat in 2005 compared with 2004 

industrial 

total sales were up in most industrial markets primarily due to strong demand as the capital goods sector of the economy expanded unit shipments increased 24 percent yearoveryear reflecting a slight change in sales mix to higherpriced engines approximately 56 percent of the shipments were to north american markets and 44 percent to international markets compared to 52 percent and 48 percent respectively in 2004 both the construction and agricultural markets had increased sales of approximately 28 percent in 2005 over 2004 while sales for the mining and marine markets increased 34 percent and 43 percent respectively during the same time period these markets make up over 90 percent of the total industrial market the increased sales in these markets were seen both in north american and international markets with the exception of a slight decrease in sales to the international agriculture market 

stationary power 

the increase in sales to stationary power markets is due to the increased net sales to our power generation segment these net sales are eliminated in our consolidated statements of earnings  see the power generation results and outlook for a discussion of the increase in net sales 

outlook for 2007 

net sales for this segment are expected to be flat in 2007 with increased shipments in the offhighway and mediumduty truck and bus markets offsetting the decrease in the north american heavyduty truck market while north american heavyduty class 8 truck sales will likely be down 30 to 40 percent in 2007 our yearoveryear north american heavyduty truck engine volumes could be down as much as 50 percent depending on the amount of 2006 engine inventory currently at the truck oems the decline will be most severe in the first half of 2007 with industry shipments expected to improve in the second half of 2007 as a result we expect our market share to drop in the first quarter due to oem’s carrying over more competitor 2006 engines to manage their vehicle model transition and quickly recover in the second half of the year to 2006 levels or higher as we believe our new products will quickly gain widespread acceptance versus competitive engine technologies 

we expect the brazilian mediumduty truck market to remain flat in 2007 while our european mediumduty truck engine shipments will benefit from our new supply relationship with nissan these markets together with significant market share gains in north america are forecasted to drive global mediumduty truck and bus shipments up approximately 25 percent in 2007 

we expect shipments to the global lightduty automotive and rv markets to increase nearly 5 percent in 2007 through new product offerings and increased availability of our product at key oems 

although some commodity prices have retreated at the end of 2006 from their historical highs we expect to see sustained demand in 2007 for our engines in the oil and gas and mining equipment markets growth in these markets will be paced by our incremental 15 percent capacity expansion planned in our highhorsepower plants during the year global construction shipments are expected to show modest growth in 2007 with increased availability at oems in north america india and japan we expect 

earnings for this segment to be the lowest in the first quarter in 2007 with expected improvements throughout the year as we increase operational efficiencies related to new product introduction new product pricing is expected to be largely offset by new product cost we anticipate full year ebit margins will be slightly below or equal to the bottom end of the targeted range of 7 to 10 percent of sales 

power generation results and outlook 

2006 vs 2005 

the net sales investee income and segment ebit for power generation were as follows dollars in millions 

 

  

the increase in net sales in this segment was primarily due to increased volumes as a result of strong demand in the commercial generator set and alternator lines of business and improved pricing our commercial and alternator businesses are up in nearly all markets our consumer power electronics energy solutions and rental markets also saw modest increases partially offsetting the increased sales in these lines of business was the absence of sales from seg as the business was sold in the fourth quarter 

the improvement in segment ebit was largely attributable to strong commercial generator set and alternator sales across geographic markets except china as well as improved mix and price realization while material costs particularly copper have increased yearoveryear we have been able to more than absorb these costs through improved pricing gross margin improved 91 million or 27 percent in 2006 compared to 2005 gross margin percentage improved nearly one percentage point compared to 2005 selling and administrative expenses increased 28 million or 14 percent over 2005 however selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales improved by one half of a percentage point in 2006 compared to 2005 research and engineering expenses increased 7 million or 33 percent during 2006 compared to 2005 and as a percentage of net sales increased slightly compared to 2005 

a summary of engine shipments used in power generation equipment by engine category follows 

 

  

2005 vs 2004 

the net sales investee income and segment ebit for power generation were as follows dollars in millions 

 

  

the increase in net sales in this segment was primarily due to increased volumes as a result of strong demand in the commercial generator set genset markets and alternator markets pricing actions also contributed to the increase in net sales 

the improvement in segment ebit was largely attributable to strong commercial generator set sales across all geographic markets except china and the related benefits of fixed cost absorption as well as price realization and cost reduction actions these benefits were partially offset by increased costs of materials primarily copper gross margin improved 67 million or 25 percent over 2004 gross margin percentage improved over two percentage points compared to the prior period selling and administrative expenses decreased 3 million or 2 percent over 2004 and selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales improved one percentage point compared to the prior period research and engineering expenses decreased 8 million or 28 percent compared to 2004 and research and engineering expenses as a percentage of net sales improved by 05 of a percentage point compared to the prior period 

a summary of engine shipments used in power generation equipment by engine category follows 

 

  

outlook for 2007 

we expect net sales to grow 10 to 12 percent in 2007 excluding the absence of net sales due to the disposal of seg in 2006 we expect net sales of commercial generator sets and alternator equipment to continue to be robust in north america the uk the middle east eastern and western europe and india consumer sales are projected to increase as we ramp up production of portable gensets introduce auxiliary power units for commercial trucks and expect greater penetration in the towable segment of the rv market price realization on new products global sourcing initiatives and manufacturing efficiency gains are anticipated to produce steady improvement in margins throughout 2007 earnings for this segment are expected to remain near or at the top end of its targeted range of 7 to 9 percent of sales 

components results and outlook 

2006 vs 2005 

the net sales investee income and segment ebit for components were as follows dollars in millions 

 

  

components net sales increased across all businesses and all geographic markets but were primarily driven by strong demand in our turbocharger and fuel systems businesses we had strong growth in north america and europe with increases in both aftermarket volume and oem volume 

segment ebit improved during 2006 compared to 2005 primarily due to improved volume in addition ebit as a percentage of net sales increased slightly gross margin increased 56 million or 17 percent in 2006 compared to 2005 and gross margin percentage improved nearly one half of a percentage point compared to 2005 primarily due to improved volume and improved pricing selling and administrative expenses increased 23 million or 12 percent compared to 2005 but decreased slightly as a percentage of net sales research and engineering expenses increased due to additional investment in the development of a number of new products and critical technologies that will be launched in 2007 and beyond research and engineering expenses increased 12 million or 21 percent compared to 2005 and increased slightly as a percentage of net sales 

2005 vs 2004 

the net sales investee income and segment ebit for components were as follows dollars in millions 

 

  

components net sales increased across all geographic markets primarily due to strong demand in the us latin america and asia sales of our turbochargers increased due to higher aftermarket sales to oems partially offset by lower demand in china 

segment ebit improved slightly compared with 2004 primarily due to improved volume however ebit as a percentage of net sales declined slightly due to a lower gross margin percentage resulting from higher steel prices used in exhaust products and manufacturing filters as well as production inefficiencies driven by capacity constraints gross margin increased 33 million or 11 percent over 2004 however gross margin percentage decreased slightly in addition higher selling and administrative expenses and increases in research and engineering expenses contributed to the reduction in segment ebit as a percentage of net sales selling and administrative expenses increased 18 million or 10 percent over 2004 but remained 

relatively flat yearoveryear as a percentage of net sales research and engineering expenses increased due to the development of a number of new products that were launched in 2006 and beyond research and engineering expenses increased 6 million or 12 percent compared to 2004 and remained flat yearoveryear as a percentage of net sales 

outlook for 2007 

net sales for this segment are forecasted to grow approximately 18 to 22 percent in 2007 primarily due to growth in our emission solutions and turbocharger businesses the manufacturing improvements that we began to implement in the second half of 2006 are expected to correct operational issues in the emission solutions business in 2007 the material cost and operational issues in the turbocharger business are expected to yield a slower margin improvement as they ramp up new products we expect to see sequential improvement in earnings from this segment after the first quarter and to achieve the lower end of the targeted range of 7 to 9 percent of net sales by the end of 2007 

distribution results and outlook 

2006 vs 2005 

the net sales investee income and segment ebit for distribution were as follows dollars in millions 

 

  

distribution net sales increased primarily due to strong overall demand in the middle east europe and the south pacific the higher net sales were led by increases in power generation volume followed by parts service and engine volume the middle east is the primary driver for the higher power generation volume accounting for over half of the increase parts and service and engine volumes were up throughout several geographic markets most notably europe east asia and the middle east 

segment ebit increased primarily due to higher gross margins resulting from greater sales of engines parts and power generation equipment gross margin in 2006 improved 38 million or 14 percent over 2005 however gross margin percentage decreased slightly due to an unfavorable shift in mix from parts to engines and gensets the increase in gross margin was partially offset by higher selling and administrative expenses selling and administrative expenses increased 26 million or 12 percent however selling and administrative expenses decreased by over one half of a percentage point as a percentage of net sales in the same period 

also contributing to the increase in segment ebit yearoveryear was a 20 million increase in investee equity earnings primarily attributable to an 18 million increase in earnings at our north american distributors 

2005 vs 2004 

the net sales investee income and segment ebit for distribution were as follows dollars in millions 

 

  

distribution net sales increased primarily due to strong demand in europe latin america the south pacific north america and the middle east where sales at our dubai distributorship were up 65 percent yearoveryear partially offset by lower sales in east asia in addition net sales were favorably impacted by foreign exchange rates 

segment ebit increased primarily due to higher gross margins resulting from increased sales of engines parts and service and power generation equipment as well as pricing actions and favorable exchange rates gross margin improved 69 million or 33 percent over 2004 while gross margin percentage increased almost two percentage points the increase in gross margin was partially offset by higher selling and administrative expenses primarily from acquisitions new branch openings and dealer development support selling and administrative expenses increased 52 million or 32 percent and increased just over one percentage point as a percentage of net sales in the same period 

also contributing to the increase in segment ebit yearoveryear was a 9 million increase in investee equity earnings this is primarily attributable to an 8 million increase in earnings at our north american distributors 

outlook for 2007 

we will no longer consolidate one of our north american joint ventures beginning in 2007 see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements regarding this joint venture in addition an independent distributor in iraq will market the sales of power generation equipment in that country rather than through our companyowned distributor in dubai excluding these changes to the reporting of segment revenue we expect net sales to increase between 7 and 10 percent in 2007 while we are adding two distributors in europe early in 2007 the majority of this growth will be organic from existing distributors nonresidential construction spending outside of the us is expected to continue to drive our revenue growth in power generation and the offhighway engine markets we also announced the formation of joint ventures in thailand and nigeria and expect to finalize new joint ventures in colombia south america and the carolinas here in the us early in 2007 earnings for this segment are forecasted to remain above the top end of its targeted range of 8 to 10 percent of sales 

geographic markets 

sales to international markets were 50 percent of total net sales in 2006 compared with 51 percent of total net sales in 2005 and 48 percent of total net sales in 2004

liquidity and capital resources 

overview of capital structure 

cash provided by operations is the primary source of funding our working capital requirements at certain times cash provided by operations is subject to seasonal fluctuations and as a result we may use periodic borrowings primarily our revolving credit facility and our accounts receivable sales program to fund our working capital requirements as of december 31 2006 there were no amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility or our receivable sales program 

cash and cash equivalents increased 61 million during 2006 to 840 million at the end of the year compared to 779 million at the beginning of the year cash and cash equivalents were higher in 2006 as a result of an increase in cash provided by operations generated primarily by higher net earnings we have focused much of our efforts on improving our balance sheet through debt reduction and increasing our liquidity we believe our net debt position is a strong indicator of how much progress we have made in these areas this measure is not defined under us gaap and may not be computed the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies our net debt position is as follows 

 

  

at december 31 2006 we believe our liquidity with cash and cash equivalents of 840 million marketable securities of 95 million 542 million available under our revolving credit facility 200 million available under our accounts receivable program and 123 million available under international credit facilities see the table below under available credit capacity provides us with the financial flexibility needed to satisfy future shortterm funding requirements for working capital debt service obligations capital expenditures projected pension funding common stock repurchases dividend payments and expansion in emerging markets 

the jobs act provided for a temporary 85percent dividends received deduction on certain foreign earnings repatriated during a oneyear period the deduction resulted in an approximate 525 federal tax rate on the repatriated earnings we repatriated 71 million under the jobs act in 2005 foreign earnings repatriated under the jobs act increased liquidity in the united states with a corresponding reduction of liquidity in our foreign subsidiaries 

our total debt was 811 million as of december 31 2006 compared with 1367 million at december 31 2005 total debt as a percent of our total capital including total longterm debt was 224 percent at december 31 2006 compared to 423 percent at december 31 2005 included in longterm debt at december 31 2006 and 2005 was 60 million and 71 million respectively attributable to consolidating a leasing entity under the provisions of fin 46r see notes 2 and 11 to the consolidated financial statements  also included in shortterm and longterm debt at december 31 2006 was 67 million from the consolidation of two joint ventures consolidated under the provisions of fin 46r see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements  the consolidation of these entities did not materially impact our 2006 or 2005 net earnings nor did it affect compliance with any of our debt covenants we do not expect the consolidation of these entities to have a material impact on net earnings or affect our compliance with debt covenants in future periods 

available credit capacity

working capital summary 

 

  

cash flows 

the following table summarizes the key elements of our cash flows for the years ended december 31 

 

  

2006 versus 2005 

operating activities   net cash provided by operating activities improved 80 million in 2006 compared to 2005 primarily due to 165 million of higher net earnings and an 82 million decrease in cash utilized for working capital partially offset by an increase in pension funding of 115 million and a decrease in cash provided by changes in long term liabilities of 65 million net changes in working capital utilized 226 million in cash during 2006 compared to utilizing 308 million in 2005 or a net decrease in cash utilized for working capital of 82 million yearoveryear cash utilized for working capital tends to fluctuate from period to period based on various factors including sales and production volumes as well as timing pension funding increased yearoveryear as we made additional contributions towards our goal of reaching 90 percent funded by the end of 2007 as of the end of 2006 our global pension funding was at approximately 885 percent of global pension benefit obligations

the funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon a variety of variables and assumptions including return on invested assets market interest rates and levels of voluntary contributions to the plans declines in longterm interest rates have had a negative impact on the projected and accumulated obligation however better than expected investment returns and additional voluntary contributions have improved the funded status of all plans helping to minimize future required funding during 2006 we made cash contributions of 266 million we expect to contribute approximately 230 million to 240 million to our defined benefit pension plans in 2007 

investing activities   net cash used in investing activities increased 65 million in 2006 compared to 2005 the increase was primarily due to higher capital expenditures of 76 million which includes an increase in investments in internal use software of 13 million net cash utilized for purchases of marketable securities in 2006 was 30 million as we increased our short term investment holdings as opposed to 2005 when we were in a net liquidation of securities position with net cash proceeds of 3 million significant sources of cash from investing activities yearoveryear includes increased proceeds from the disposal of equipment of 28 million as well as 24 million received related to the sale of seg

the majority of our capital spending in 2006 was primarily for new product introduction capacity expansion manufacturing equipment and tooling for new products capital expenditures for 2007 will increase to support our growth and will include investments to increase capacity and to fund our new products our investments in capacity improvement are focused cut across all of our businesses and designed for rapid return on investment we continue to invest more of our capital in lowcost regions of the world to further leverage our opportunities for cost reduction we currently expect capital expenditures for 2007 to be between 320 million and 350 million to support these initiatives 

financing activities   net cash used in financing activities was 508 million in 2006 compared to a use of cash of 372 million in 2005 or a net change in cash outflows of 136 million yearoveryear in 2006 we repaid our 250 million 95 notes while in 2005 we repaid our 225 million 645 notes the other significant use of cash in financing activities when comparing 2006 to 2005 relates to repurchases of our common stock in 2006 we completed our previously announced 100 million stock repurchase and we began repurchasing stock under a new repurchase plan that began in the third quarter of 2006 year over year our stock repurchases increased 83 million also contributing to the increase to a lesser extent was a decrease in the proceeds from the issuance of common stock of 21 million and an increase in dividend payments due to the 20 percent increase in quarterly dividends that the board approved in july

2005 versus 2004 

operating activities   net cash provided by operating activities improved 146 million in 2005 compared to 2004 primarily due to 200 million of higher net earnings a 175 million increase in the deferred tax provision a 101 million increase in longterm liabilities and a 35 million change in equity earnings of investees partially offset by an increase in working capital of 378 million net changes in 

working capital utilized 308 million in cash during 2005 compared to providing 70 million in 2004 or a net decrease in cash provided by working capital of 378 million yearoveryear the net increase of 378 million of cash used by changes in working capital compared to 2004 resulted primarily from lower accrued expenses of 148 million higher accounts receivable of 146 million and lower accounts payable of 102 million partially offset by lower inventory of 17 million and changes in other current assets of 1 million accounts receivable increased due to higher sales levels a higher mix of international receivables and the discontinuance of a major customer’s trade payables program that previously allowed for accelerated payment terms the net reduction in accounts payable was due to a larger rampup in production during 2004 and the decrease in accrued expenses was driven by a lower increase in accrued warranty of 86 million and a lower increase in accrued payrolls of 63 million 

investing activities   net cash used in investing activities increased 31 million in 2005 compared to 2004 the increase was primarily due to higher capital expenditures of 41 million which included investments in internal use software of 6 million and a decrease in cash inflows from net liquidations of marketable securities of 24 million partially offset by a 16 million decrease in cash used for acquisition of businesses investments in and advances to equity investees of 6 million and an increase in proceeds from disposals of 9 million

the majority of our capital spending of 186 million in 2005 was primarily for capacity increases manufacturing equipment and tooling for new products 

financing activities   net cash used in financing activities was 372 million in 2005 compared to a 66 million source of cash in 2004 or a net change in cash outflows of 438 million yearoveryear the majority of the change yearoveryear is due to the march 1 2005 repayment of the 225 million 645 notes a significant decrease in the proceeds of common stock issued from the exercise of stock options of 118 million and 38 million in common stock repurchases in 2005

cash dividends 

cash dividends of 030 per common share were declared in the first and second quarter of 2006 in july 2006 the board of directors voted to increase the quarterly cash dividend per share by 20 percent and as a result cash dividends of 036 per common share were declared in the third and fourth quarter of 2006 cash dividends of 030 per common share were declared and paid in each quarter of 2005 and 2004 dividends paid to common shareholders for the years ended december 31 2006 2005 and 2004 were 66 million 56 million and 53 million respectively declaration and payment of dividends in the future depends upon our earnings and liquidity position among other factors 

share repurchases 

in july 2006 the board of directors authorized us to acquire up to two million shares of cummins common stock in addition to what has been acquired under previous authorizations for the year ended december 31 2006 we repurchased approximately 121 million of common stock representing approximately 11 million shares this included purchases under our 100 million share repurchase program introduced in september 2005 which was completed in the second quarter of 2006 

debt conversion 

on may 8 2006 the board of directors approved our plan to redeem all of the 7 convertible quarterly income preferred securities that were issued in june 2001 on may 9 2006 we gave the trustee our formal irrevocable notification of our intent to redeem the preferred securities this notification provided the holders of the preferred securities 30 days in which to convert their securities into shares of common stock upon expiration of the notification period all remaining securities not converted were redeemed for cash at a premium above liquidation value substantially all of the 300 million 7 

convertible subordinated debentures outstanding were converted into shares of our common stock during the second quarter of 2006 as a result of the conversion approximately 63 million shares of common stock were issued during the second quarter which resulted in an increase of approximately 15 million to common stock outstanding and an increase of approximately 276 million to additional contributed capital since substantially all holders converted their preferred securities to common stock the loss on extinguishment of this debt was insignificant 

debt repayment 

in september 2005 we announced our intention to repay the 250 million 95 notes in december 2006 the first call date for the debt the notes were issued in november 2002 and were repaid in december 2006 using cash generated from operations we paid a premium of approximately 12 million due to the early retirement of this debt 

approximately 62 million of our 120 million 675 debentures were repaid on february 15 2007 at the election of the holders such election and notification was required to be made between december 15 2006 and january 15 2007 at december 31 2006 we have included the 62 million repaid on february 15 2007 in shortterm borrowings in our consolidated balance sheet  

lease extension 

in july 2006 we amended and extended the lease on our corporate headquarters facility to 2019 the total rental payments to be made over the revised lease term are approximately 59 million as a result of this extension we were required to reevaluate the classification of this lease based on the terms of the extension this lease is now classified as a capital lease as a result our longterm debt increased by approximately 40 million 

rental business 

during the third quarter of 2006 we extended a lease relating to a portion of our rental business by six years the lease was set to expire on september 30 2006 instead of paying a balloon payment of approximately 42 million on september 30 2006 the amount has been financed over a six year term at a fixed rate in addition to extending this lease we reduced the interest rate by approximately 2 percentage points during the fourth quarter of 2006 we refinanced a lease relating to another portion of our rental business under the terms of the agreement which is effective as of january 1 2007 the new lease has a six year term and the interest rate is approximately 2 percentage points lower than the existing lease the total amount refinanced was approximately 28 million both leases were treated as capital leases both before and after the changes for more information regarding our rental business and related lease agreements see note 20 to the consolidated financial statements  

contractual obligations and other commercial commitments 

a summary of payments due for our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december 31 2006 is shown in the tables below 

 

1   includes principal payments and expected interest payments based on the terms of the obligations

2   our minimum required pension funding in the us is zero and approximately 60 million to 65 million in the uk for 2007 

 

  

financial covenants and credit rating 

a number of our contractual obligations and financing agreements such as our revolving credit facility and our equipment saleleaseback agreements have restrictive covenants andor pricing modifications that may be triggered in the event of downward revisions to our corporate credit rating there have been no events in 2006 to impede our compliance with these covenants 

our current ratings and outlook from each of the credit rating agencies are shown in the table below 

 

  

off balance sheet financing 

sale of accounts receivable 

in january 2004 we entered into a threeyear facility agreement with a financial institution to sell a designated pool of trade receivables to cummins trade receivables llc ctr a whollyowned special purpose subsidiary in january 2007 this facility was extended for one year as necessary ctr may transfer a direct interest in its receivables without recourse to the financial institution to maintain a balance in the designated pools of receivables sold we sell new receivables to ctr as existing receivables are collected receivables sold to ctr in which an interest is not transferred to the financial institution are included in “receivables net” on our consolidated balance sheets  the maximum interest in sold receivables that can be outstanding at any point in time is limited to the lesser of 200 million or the amount of eligible receivables held by ctr there are no provisions in this agreement that require us to maintain a minimum investment credit rating however the terms of the agreement contain the same financial covenants as our revolving credit facility there was no interest in receivables sold under this program to the financial institution in 2006 or 2005 and the interest in receivables sold in 2004 was not significant as of december 31 2006 and 2005 there were no amounts outstanding under this program 

financing arrangements for related parties 

in accordance with the provisions of various joint venture agreements we may purchase products and components from the joint ventures sell products and components to the joint ventures and the joint ventures may sell products and components to unrelated parties the transfer price of products purchased from the joint ventures may differ from normal selling prices certain joint venture agreements transfer product to us at cost some transfer product to us on a costplus basis and other agreements provide for the transfer of products at market value 

we purchase significant quantities of midrange diesel and natural gas engines components and service parts from consolidated diesel company cdc a general partnership that was formed in 1980 with j i case case to jointly fund engine development and manufacturing capacity cummins and case now cnh global nv are general partners and each partner shares 50 percent ownership in cdc under the terms of the agreement cdc is obligated to make its entire production of diesel engines and related products available solely to the partners each partner is entitled to purchase up to onehalf of cdc’s actual production and a partner may purchase in excess of onehalf of actual production to the extent productive capacity is available beyond the other partner’s purchase requirement the partners are each obligated unconditionally and severally to purchase annually at least one engine or engine kit produced by cdc provided a minimum of one engine or engine kit is produced the transfer price of cdc’s engines to the partners must be sufficient to cover its manufacturing cost in such annual accounting period including interest and financing expenses but excluding depreciation expense other than scheduled depreciation expense as defined in the agreement in addition each partner is obligated to contribute onehalf of the capital investment required to maintain plant capacity and each partner has the right to invest unilaterally in plant capacity which additional capacity is available to the other partner for a fee to date neither partner has made a unilateral investment in plant capacity at cdc 

we are not a guarantor of any of cdc’s obligations or commitments however we are required as a partner to provide up to 50 percent of cdc’s base working capital as defined by the agreement the amount of base working capital is calculated each quarter and if supplemental funding greater than the base working capital amount is required the amount is funded through thirdparty financing arranged by cdc or we may elect to fund the requirement although we are under no obligation to do so to date when supplemental funding is required above the base working capital amount we have elected to provide that funding to cdc if the amount of supplemental funding required is less than the base working capital amount it is funded equally by the partners excess cash generated by cdc is remitted to cummins until 

cdc’s working capital amount is reduced to the base working capital amount any further cash remittances from cdc to the partners are shared equally by the partners 

in the first quarter of 2004 we adopted certain provisions of fin 46r under the provisions of fin 46r cdc and another engine manufacturing entity jointly owned and operated by us were considered vies and we were deemed the primary beneficiary of these vies by virtue of our pricing arrangements with them and substantial product purchases from them as a result we consolidated the assets and liabilities of cdc and the other engine manufacturer as of march 28 2004 previously these joint ventures were accounted for under the equity method of accounting and included in our consolidated balance sheets as “investments in and advances to equity investees” first quarter results for these entities were recorded as “investee equity royalty and other income” in our consolidated statements of earnings and results for the rest of the year were consolidated in our consolidated statements of earnings for a further discussion of the impact of adopting fin 46r see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements 

application of critical accounting estimates 

a summary of our significant accounting policies is included in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements of this annual report which discusses accounting policies that we have selected from acceptable alternatives other than for the adoption of new accounting pronouncements as discussed in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements  there were no accounting policies adopted during 2006 that had a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap that often require management to make judgments estimates and assumptions regarding uncertainties that affect the reported amounts presented and disclosed in the financial statements our management reviews these estimates and assumptions based on historical experience changes in business conditions and other relevant factors they believe to be reasonable under the circumstances in any given reporting period our actual results may differ from the estimates and assumptions used in preparing our consolidated financial statements 

critical accounting estimates are defined as follows the estimate requires management to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the estimate was made different estimates reasonably could have been used or if changes in the estimate are reasonably likely to occur from period to period and the change would have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations our senior management has discussed the development and selection of our accounting policies related accounting estimates and the disclosures set forth below with the audit committee of our board of directors we believe our critical accounting estimates include those addressing the estimation of liabilities for warranty programs accounting for income taxes pension benefits and annual assessment of recoverability of goodwill 

warranty programs 

we estimate and record a liability for warranty programs primarily base warranty other than product recalls at the time our products are sold our estimates are based on historical experience and reflect management’s best estimates of expected costs at the time products are sold and subsequent adjustment to those expected costs when actual costs differ as a result of the uncertainty surrounding the nature and frequency of product recall programs the liability for such programs is recorded when we commit to a recall action which generally occurs when it is announced our warranty liability is generally affected by component failure rates repair costs and the time of failure future events and circumstances related to these factors could materially change our estimates and require adjustments to our liability new product launches require a greater use of judgment in developing estimates until historical experience becomes available product specific experience is typically available four or five quarters after product launch with a 

clear experience trend evident eight quarters after launch we generally record warranty expense for new products upon shipment using a factor based upon historical experience only in the first year a blend of actual product and historical experience in the second year and product specific experience thereafter note 13 to the consolidated financial statements contains a summary of the activity in our warranty liability account for 2006 and 2005 including adjustments to preexisting warranties 

accounting for income taxes 

we determine our provision for income taxes using the asset and liability method under this method deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax effects of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases future tax benefits of tax loss and credit carryforwards are also recognized as deferred tax assets we evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets each quarter by assessing the likelihood of future profitability and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize our net deferred tax assets at december 31 2006 we recorded net deferred tax assets of 696 million these assets include 39 million for the value of tax loss and credit carryforwards a valuation allowance of 26 million has been recorded to reduce the tax assets to the net value management believes is more likely than not to be realized in the event our operating performance deteriorates future assessments could conclude that a larger valuation allowance will be needed to further reduce the deferred tax assets in addition we operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and are subject to tax audits in these jurisdictions these audits can involve complex issues which may require an extended period of time to resolve we reduce our net tax assets for the estimated additional tax and interest that may result from tax authorities disputing certain tax positions we have taken and we believe we have made adequate provision for income taxes for all years that are subject to audit based upon the latest information available a more complete description of our income taxes and the future benefits of our tax loss and credit carryforwards are disclosed in note 9 to the consolidated financial statements  

pension benefits 

we sponsor a number of pension plans primarily in the us and the uk and to a lesser degree in various other countries in the us and the uk we have several major defined benefit plans that are separately funded we account for our pension programs in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 87 “employers’ accounting for pensions” sfas 87 and sfas no 158 “employers’ accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans—an amendment of fasb statements no 87 88 106 and 132 r sfas 158 sfas 87 requires that amounts recognized in financial statements be determined using an actuarial basis as a result our pension benefit programs are based on a number of statistical and judgmental assumptions that attempt to anticipate future events and are used in calculating the expense and liability related to our plans these assumptions include discount rates used to value liabilities assumed rates of return on plan assets future compensation increases employee turnover rates actuarial assumptions relating to retirement age mortality rates and participant withdrawals the actuarial assumptions we use may differ significantly from actual results due to changing economic conditions participant life span and withdrawal rates these differences may result in a material impact to the amount of net periodic pension expense to be recorded in our consolidated financial statements in the future  sfas 158 requires an employer to recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan as an asset or liability in its statement of financial position and to recognize changes in that funded status in the year in which the changes occur through comprehensive income the statement also requires an employer to measure the funded status of a plan as of the date of its yearend statement of financial position we adopted sfas 158 as required on december 31 2006 we did not adopt the measurement date change as it is not required until december 31 2008 

the expected longterm return on plan assets is used in calculating the net periodic pension expense the differences between the actual return on plan assets and expected longterm return on plan assets are recognized in the asset value used to calculate net periodic expense over five years the expected rate of return on us pension plan assets used to develop our pension expense was 85 percent for each year ended december 31 2006 2005 and 2004 the expected rate of return on nonus pension plan assets was 724 percent 756 percent and 808 percent respectively in 2007 we plan to use an expected rate of return of 85 percent for us pension plan assets and 725 percent for nonus pension plan assets a lower expected rate of return will increase our net periodic pension expense and reduce profitability 

the difference between the expected return and the actual return on plan assets is deferred from recognition in our results of operations and under certain circumstances such as when the difference exceeds 10 percent of the market value of plan assets or the projected benefit obligation pbo amortized over future years of service this is also true of changes to actuarial assumptions as of december 31 2006 we had net pension actuarial losses of 468 million and 358 million for the us and nonus pension plans respectively under sfas 158 the actuarial gains and losses are recognized and recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss as these amounts exceed 10 percent of our pbo the excess is amortized over the average remaining service lives of participating employees 

our net periodic pension expense was 120 million in 2006 103 million in 2005 and 89 million in 2004 our net periodic pension expense is expected to be approximately 97 million in 2007 the decrease in periodic pension expense is due to higher expected returns on assets driven by the significant pension contributions we made in 2006 in addition our expense is expected to decline as the amortization of prior investment losses begins to be replaced with the amortization of prior investment gains another key assumption used in the development of the net periodic pension expense is the discount rate the discount rate used to develop our net periodic pension expense in the us was 560 percent 575 percent and 625 percent for the years ended december 31 2006 2005 and 2004 the discount rate for our nonus pension expense was 495 percent 530 percent and 566 percent we will use 560 percent and 496 percent for us and nonus pension expense in 2007 changes in the discount rate assumptions will impact the interest cost component of the net periodic pension expense calculation our funding strategy is to fund the plan approximately 90 percent on a pbo basis 

the discount rate enables us to state expected future cash payments for benefits as a present value on the measurement date the guidelines for setting this rate are discussed in eitf d36 which suggests a highquality corporate bond rate we used bond information provided by standard  poors for the us and iboxx for the uk all bonds used to develop our hypothetical portfolio in the us and uk were highquality noncallable bonds aa or better as of november 30 2006 the average yield of this hypothetical bond portfolio was used as the benchmark for determining the discount rate to be used to value the obligations of the plans subject to sfas 87 and sfas no 106 “employer’s accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions” 

our model called for 60 years of benefit payments for the us plans the sum of the cash flows from the 60 bonds matched the cash flow from the benefit payment stream upon completion of the process the number of bonds purchased for each issue was used to determine the price of the entire portfolio the discount rate benchmark was set to the internal rate of return needed to discount the cash flows to arrive at the portfolio price 

in developing the uk discount rate excess cash flows resulted in the early years of the 60 year period when the sum of the cash flow from the bonds maturing in later years exceeded the benefit payments in early years thus no bonds maturing in early years are needed as a result the price of the entire portfolio of bonds was too high because all benefit payments were covered with excess cash flow remaining we made no adjustment to the cash flow and the discount rate was determined as the internal rate of return needed to discount the cash flows to arrive at the portfolio price due to the flat shape of the yield curve 

this methodology choice impacted the discount rate by less than two basis percentage points the discount rate would have been slightly higher had the cash flows been allowed to reinvest 

the table below sets forth the estimated impact on our 2007 net periodic pension expense relative to a change in the discount rate and a change in the expected rate of return on plan assets 

 

  

the above sensitivities reflect the impact of changing one assumption at a time a higher discount rate decreases the plan obligations and decreases our net periodic pension expense a lower discount rate increases the plan obligations and increases our net periodic pension expense it should be noted that economic factors and conditions often affect multiple assumptions simultaneously and the effects of changes in key assumptions are not necessarily linear 

we considered several factors in developing our expected rate of return on plan assets including historical returns and input from our external advisors the longterm rate of return on plan assets represents an estimate of longterm returns on an investment portfolio consisting of a mixture of equities fixed income real estate and other miscellaneous investments based upon our target asset allocations it is anticipated that our us investment policy will generate an average annual return over the 20year projection period equal to or in excess of 773 percent approximately 50 percent of the time while returns of 928 percent or greater are anticipated 25 percent of the time our three year average rate of return has exceeded 85 percent in each of the last three years as a result based on the historical returns and forwardlooking return expectations we believe an investment return assumption of 85 percent per year for us pension assets is reasonable the methodology used to determine the rate of return on pension plan assets in the uk was based on establishing an equityrisk premium over current longterm bond yields adjusted based on target asset allocations our strategy with respect to our investments in pension plan assets is to be invested with a longterm outlook therefore the risk and return balance of our asset portfolio should reflect a longterm horizon our pension plan asset allocation at december 31 2006 and 2005 and target allocation for 2007 are as follows 

 

  

actual cash funding for our pension plans is governed by employee benefit and tax laws and the pension protection act of 2006 “the act” the act extends the use of an average corporate bond rate for determining current liabilities for funding purposes among its many provisions the act establishes a 100 percent funding target for plan years beginning after december 31 2007 we may voluntarily make contributions to achieve our funding strategy described above during 2006 and 2005 we made cash 

contributions to our pension plans of 266 million and 151 million respectively and we expect to make cash contributions of approximately 230 million to 240 million in 2007 contributions beyond 2007 will depend on the funded status of our plans at that time in relation to the targeted funding established under the act 

the minimum pension liability was eliminated upon the adoption of sfas 158 the estimated accumulated benefit obligation related to the us uk and several other smaller pension plans exceeded the fair value of the plan assets as of december 31 2006 and 2005 changes in the minimum pension liability decreased our shareholders’ equity by 24 million after tax and minority interest in 2005 prior to adopting sfas 158 additional minimum pension liabilities were reduced by 102 million after tax and minority interest through a direct credit to accumulated other comprehensive loss the reduction of these liabilities resulted from strong plan asset performance and significant pension contributions in 2005 and 2006 

note 12 to the consolidated financial statements provides a summary of our pension benefit plan activity the funded status of our plans the amounts recognized in our consolidated financial statements and the impacts of sfas 158 

annual assessment for recoverability of goodwill 

under the provisions of sfas no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” sfas 142 the carrying value of goodwill is reviewed annually the fair value of each reporting unit was estimated by discounting the future cash flows less requirements for working capital and fixed asset additions our valuation method requires us to make projections of revenue operating expenses working capital investment and fixed asset additions for the reporting units over a multiyear period additionally management must estimate its weightedaverage cost of capital for each reporting unit for use as a discount rate the discounted cash flows are compared to the carrying value of the reporting unit and if less than the carrying value a separate valuation of the goodwill is required to determine if an impairment loss has occurred as of the end of the third quarter in 2006 we performed the annual impairment assessment required by sfas 142 and determined that our goodwill was not impaired at december 31 2006 our recorded goodwill was 356 million changes in our projections or estimates a deterioration of our operating results and the related cash flow effect or a significant increase in the discount rate could decrease the estimated fair value of our reporting units and result in a future impairment of goodwill 

recently adopted accounting pronouncements 

in december 2004 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 123 revised 2004 “sharebased payment” sfas 123r this standard requires financial statement recognition of compensation cost related to sharebased payment transactions sharebased payment transactions within the scope of sfas 123r include stock options restricted stock plans performancebased awards stock appreciation rights and employee share purchase plans we implemented the revised standard in the first quarter of 2006 prior to january 1 2006 we accounted for stockbased employee awards issued after december 31 2002 using the fair value method preferred by sfas no 123 “accounting for stockbased compensation” sfas 123r requires us to estimate forfeitures in calculating the expense relating to stockbased compensation as opposed to recognizing these forfeitures and the corresponding reduction in expense as they occur sfas 123r also requires prospective presentation of the “tax benefit on sharebased awards” as a financing activity rather than an operating activity in our consolidated statements of cash flows  see note 19 to the consolidated financial statements for the impact that the adoption of this standard had on our consolidated financial statements  

in may 2005 the fasb issued sfas no 154 “accounting changes and error corrections—a replacement of accounting principles board apb opinion no 20 and fasb statement no 3” sfas 154 this standard changes the requirements for the accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principle and applies to all voluntary changes in accounting principle it also applies to changes required by an accounting pronouncement in the unusual instance that the pronouncement does not include specific transition provisions when a pronouncement includes specific transition provisions those provisions should be followed apb 20 required that most voluntary changes in accounting principle be recognized by including in net income of the period of the change the cumulative effect of changing to the new accounting principle this standard requires retrospective application to prior period financial statements of changes in accounting principle unless it is impracticable to determine either the periodspecific effects or the cumulative effect of the change the provisions of sfas 154 are effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2005 the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements  

in september 2006 the sec staff issued staff accounting bulletin sab no 108 “considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements sab 108 sab 108 was issued in order to eliminate the diversity of practice surrounding how public companies quantify financial statement misstatements traditionally there have been two widelyrecognized methods for quantifying the effects of financial statement misstatements the “rollover” method and the “iron curtain” method the rollover method focuses primarily on the impact of a misstatement on the income statement including the reversing effect of prior year misstatements but its use can lead to the accumulation of misstatements in the balance sheet the iron curtain method on the other hand focuses primarily on the effect of correcting the periodend balance sheet with less emphasis on the reversing effects of prior years on the income statement we currently use the iron curtain method for quantifying identified financial statement misstatements in sab 108 the sec staff established an approach that requires quantification of financial statement misstatements based on the effects of the misstatements on each of the company’s financial statements and related financial statement disclosures this model is commonly referred to as a “dual approach” because it requires quantification of errors under both the iron curtain and rollover methods we were required to apply the provisions of sab 108 in connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2006 the application of sab 108 did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements  

in september 2006 the fasb issued sfas no 158 “employers’ accounting for defined benefit plans and other postretirement plans—an amendment of fasb statements no 87 88 106 and 132r” sfas 158 which requires employers to fully recognize the obligations associated with singleemployer defined benefit pension retiree healthcare and other postretirement plans in their financial statements in 

addition sfas 158 requires companies to measure plan assets and liabilities as of the end of a fiscal year rather than a date within 90 days of the end of the fiscal year we adopted sfas 158 effective december 31 2006 except for the change in measurement date provisions which are not effective until 2008 total assets total liabilities minority interests and total shareholders’ equity were impacted in the following manner total assets increased by approximately 11 million total liabilities increased by approximately 106 million minority interests decreased by approximately 1 million and shareholders’ equity decreased by approximately 94 million the adoption of sfas 158 did not impact compliance with any of our financial covenants see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the impact that the adoption of this standard had on our consolidated financial statements  

accounting pronouncements issued but not yet effective 

in february 2006 the fasb issued sfas no 155 “accounting for certain hybrid financial instruments—an amendment of fasb statements no 133 and 140” sfas 155 sfas 155 changes certain accounting requirements for certain hybrid financial instruments by permitting fair value remeasurement for any hybrid financial instrument that contains an embedded derivative that otherwise would require bifurcation the new standard also changed certain accounting requirements for interestonly and principalonly strips and other aspects of accounting for securitized financial assets we will adopt sfas 155 effective january 1 2007 we do not expect the adoption of sfas 155 to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements  

in march 2006 the fasb issued sfas no 156 “accounting for servicing of financial assets—an amendment of fasb statement no 140” sfas 156 that provides guidance on accounting for separately recognized servicing assets and servicing liabilities in accordance with the provisions of sfas 156 separately recognized servicing assets and servicing liabilities must be initially measured at fair value if practicable subsequent to initial recognition the company may use either the amortization method or the fair value measurement method to account for servicing assets and servicing liabilities within the scope of this statement we will adopt sfas 156 effective january 1 2007 we do not expect the adoption of sfas 156 to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements  

in july 2006 the fasb issued fasb interpretation fin no 48 “accounting for uncertainty in income taxes—an interpretation of fasb statement no 109” fin 48 which prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement process for recording in the financial statements uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return in addition fin 48 provides guidance on the derecognition classification accounting in interim periods and disclosure requirements for uncertain tax positions we will adopt fin 48 effective january 1 2007 we do not expect the adoption of fin 48 to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements  

in september 2006 the fasb issued sfas no 157 “fair value measurements” sfas 157 which defines fair value establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements we will adopt sfas 157 effective january 1 2008 we are currently evaluating the impact if any that sfas 157 will have on our consolidated financial statements

 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to financial risk resulting from volatility in foreign exchange rates interest rates and commodity prices this risk is closely monitored and managed through the use of financial derivative instruments including commodity forward contracts currency forward contracts and interest rate swaps as stated in our policies and procedures financial instruments are used expressly for hedging purposes and under no circumstances are they used for speculative purposes our hedging transactions are entered into with banking institutions that have strong credit ratings and thus the credit risk associated with these transactions is not considered significant the results and status of our hedging transactions are reported to senior management on a monthly and quarterly basis further information regarding financial instruments and risk management is contained in note 18 to the consolidated financial statements 

the following describes our risk exposures and provides results of sensitivity analyses performed as of december 31 2006 the sensitivity analysis assumes instantaneous parallel shifts in foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices 

foreign exchange rates 

as a result of our international business presence we are exposed to foreign currency exchange risk we transact in foreign currencies and have significant assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies as a result our earnings experience some volatility related to movements in foreign currency exchange rates in order to benefit from global diversification and after considering naturally offsetting currency positions we enter into forward contracts to minimize our existing exposures recognized asset and liability and hedge forecasted transactions the objective of our hedging program is to reduce the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on earnings by essentially creating offsetting currency exposures 

as of december 31 2006 the potential gain or loss in the fair value of our outstanding foreign currency contracts assuming a hypothetical 10 percent fluctuation in the currencies of such contracts would be approximately 7 million the sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates assumes the notional value to remain constant for the next 12 months the analysis ignores the impact of foreign exchange movements on our competitive position and potential changes in sales levels it should be noted that any change in the value of the contracts real or hypothetical would be significantly offset by an inverse change in the value of the underlying hedged items see note 18 to the consolidated financial statements  

interest rates 

we are also exposed to interest rate risk as a result of our indebtedness our objective in managing our exposure to changes in interest rates is to limit the effect of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower our overall cost of borrowing to achieve this objective we primarily use interest rate swap agreements to manage exposure to interest rate changes related to our borrowing arrangements 

in november 2005 we entered into an interest rate swap to effectively convert our 250 million due in 2028 debt from a fixed rate of 7125 to a floating rate based on a libor spread the terms of the swap mirror those of the debt with interest paid semiannually this swap qualifies as a fair value hedge under sfas no 133 “accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities” 

in november 2002 we terminated an interest rate swap relating to our 645 notes that matured in 2005 the swap acted as a fair value hedge and converted 225 million notional amount from fixed rate debt into floating rate debt that matured in 2005 the termination of this swap resulted in a 12 million gain the gain was amortized to earnings as a reduction of interest expense over the remaining life of the debt the amount of gain recognized during 2005 and 2004 was 1 million and 5 million respectively as of december 31 2005 there was no longer any deferred gain remaining on our consolidated balance sheets see note 18 to the consolidated financial statements  

commodity prices 

we are also exposed to fluctuations in commodity prices through the purchase of raw materials as well as contractual agreements with component suppliers to reduce the effect of raw material price changes for select commodities we periodically enter into commodity forward contracts with designated banks to hedge a portion of our anticipated raw material purchases 

as of december 31 2006 the potential gain or loss related to the outstanding commodity forward contracts assuming a hypothetical 10 percent fluctuation in the price of such commodities was 13 million the sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in commodity prices assumes the notional value to remain constant for the next 12 months the analysis ignores the impact of commodity price movements on our competitive position and potential changes in sales levels it should be noted that any change in the value 

of the forward contracts real or hypothetical would be significantly offset by an inverse change in the value of the underlying hedged items see note 18 to the consolidated financial statements

we made certain leadership changes effective may 2 2005 within our management team in connection with these changes certain modifications were made to our internal reporting these modifications are summarized below 

·   the filtration and other segment was renamed the components segment and now includes operating results of the fuel systems business which were previously included in the engine segment historically the fuel systems business transferred product within the engine segment at cost beginning in the third quarter those transfers now use a costplus based transfer price as a result of this change segment ebit increased for the components segment and decreased for the engine segment but there was no impact to consolidated earnings revenues of the components 

segment were also increased to reflect transfers to the engine segment and eliminations were increased by a corresponding amount 

·   the north american distribution business was combined with the international distribution segment and renamed the distribution segment previously the north american distribution business was reported in the engine and power generation segments as investee equity and included the results of a partiallyowned distributor that is consolidated as a result revenues of the engine segment were increased to reflect sales to the consolidated distributor that were previously eliminated and decreased for the revenues of the consolidated distributor which are now included in the distribution segment in addition this change also caused investee equity earnings in the engine and power generation segments to decrease while investee equity earnings in the distribution segment increased by a corresponding amount

segment financial information 

financial information about our operating segments is incorporated by reference from note 19 to the consolidated financial statements 

supply 

we have developed and maintain a worldclass supply base in terms of technology quality and cost we source our materials and manufactured components from leading suppliers both domestically and internationally we have adequate sources of supply of raw materials and components we machine and assemble some of the components used in our engines and power generation units including blocks heads rods turbochargers camshafts crankshafts filters exhaust systems alternators and fuel systems we also have arrangements with certain suppliers who are the sole source for specific products or supply items between 75 and 85 percent of our total raw material and component purchases in 2005 were purchased from suppliers who are the sole source of supply for a particular supply item although we elect to source a relatively high proportion of our total raw materials and component requirements from sole suppliers the majority of these supply items can be purchased from alternate suppliers with the appropriate sourcing plan we are also developing suppliers in many global or lowcost locations to serve our businesses across the globe and provide alternative sources in the event of disruption from existing suppliers in addition we maintain dual sourcing at a commodity level on many of our sole sourced part numbers our supply agreements vary according to the particular part number sourced however these agreements typically include standard terms relating to cost including cost reduction targets quality and delivery our supply agreements also typically include customary intellectual property provisions that contain prohibitions on the use of our intellectual property by the suppliers for any purpose other than their performance of the supply agreements and indemnity covenants from suppliers for breach by them of intellectual property 

rights of third parties in performance of the agreements the duration of our more important supply agreements varies but typically ranges between three and five years many of our supply agreements include early termination provisions related to failure to meet quality and delivery requirements in order to reduce the risk of dependency the raw materials and components from single source suppliers are reviewed periodically to ensure a second source or alternative exists to guarantee supply 

patents and trademarks 

we own or control a significant number of patents and trademarks relating to the products we manufacture these have been granted and registered over a period of years although these patents and trademarks are generally considered beneficial to our operations we do not believe any patent group of patents or trademark other than our leading brand house trademarks is considered significant in relation to our business 

seasonality 

while individual product lines may experience modest seasonal declines in production there is no material effect on the demand for the majority of our products on a quarterly basis however our power generation segment normally experiences seasonal declines in the first quarter of the fiscal year due to general declines in construction spending and our distribution segment normally experiences seasonal declines in first quarter business activity due to holiday periods in asia and australia 

largest customer 

we have thousands of customers around the world and have developed longstanding business relationships with many of them daimlerchrysler is our largest customer accounting for approximately 12 percent of our consolidated net sales in 2005 primarily relating to sales of our isb engine for use in dodge ram trucks and sales of our mediumduty engines to the freightliner division of daimlerchrysler while a significant number of our sales to daimlerchrysler are under longterm supply agreements these agreements provide for the supply of daimlerchrysler’s engine requirements for particular vehicle models and not a specific volume of engines the loss of this customer or a significant decline in the production level of daimlerchrysler vehicles that use our engines would have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition we have been an engine supplier to daimlerchrysler for more than 15 years a summary of principal customers for each operating segment is included in our segment discussion 

in addition to our agreements with daimlerchrysler we have longterm heavyduty engine supply agreements with international truck and engine corporation paccar and volvo trucks north america collectively our net sales to these three customers was less than 19 percent of consolidated net sales in 2005 and individually was less than 9 percent of consolidated net sales for each customer as with daimlerchrysler these agreements contain standard purchase and sale agreement terms covering engine and engine parts pricing quality and delivery commitments as well as engineering product support obligations the basic nature of our agreements with oem customers is that they are longterm generally five years or longer price and operations agreements that assure the availability of our products to each customer through the duration of the respective agreements there are no guarantees or commitments by these customers of any kind regarding volumes or market shares except in the case of daimlerchrysler which has committed that cummins will be its exclusive diesel engine supplier for the dodge ram heavyduty pickup truck agreements with oems contain bilateral termination provisions giving either party the right to terminate in the event of a material breach change of control or insolvency or bankruptcy of the other party 

backlog 

demand in many of our markets has grown rapidly in the last two years resulting in longer lead times however while we have supply agreements with some truck and offhighway equipment oems most of our business is transacted through open purchase orders these open orders are historically subject to monthtomonth releases and are subject to cancellation on reasonable notice without cancellation charges and therefore are not considered firm 

distribution 

for over 70 years we have been developing a distribution and service network that includes more than 550 independent distributor locations and 5000 independent dealers in 160 countries and territories in north america this network is comprised of independent and partiallyowned distributors internationally our network consists of independent partiallyowned and whollyowned distributors most distributors sell the full range of our products as well as complementary products and services our distribution segment operates within this network with 17 companyowned distributors and 10 joint ventures in 233 locations across 90 countries and territories 

our licensing agreements with independent and partiallyowned distributors generally have a threeyear term and are restricted to specified territories our distributors develop and maintain a network of dealers with which we have no direct relationship the distributors are permitted to sell other noncompetitive products only with our consent we license all of our distributors to use our name and logo in connection with the sale and service of our products with no right to assign or sublicense the marks except to authorized dealers without our consent products are sold to the distributors at standard domestic or international distributor net prices as applicable net prices are wholesale prices we establish to permit our distributors an adequate margin on their sales subject to local laws we can refuse to renew these agreements at will and we may terminate them upon 90day notice for inadequate sales change in principal ownership and certain other reasons distributors also have the right to terminate the agreements upon 60day notice without cause or 30day notice for cause upon termination or failure to renew we may be required to purchase the distributor’s current inventory and may at our option purchase other assets of the distributor but are under no obligation to do so 

our distribution capability is a key element of our business strategy and competitive position particularly in our efforts to increase customer access to aftermarket replacement parts and repair service there are more than 5000 locations in north america primarily owned and operated by oems or their dealers at which cummins trained service personnel and parts are available to service maintain and repair our engines we also have parts distribution centers located strategically throughout the world in order to serve our customers and distributors 

financial information about whollyowned distributors partiallyowned distributors consolidated under fasb interpretation no 46r “consolidation of variable interest entities” fin 46r issued by the financial accounting standards board fasb and distributors accounted for under the equity method are incorporated by reference to notes 1 2 and 3 to the consolidated financial statements  

research and engineering 

our research and engineering program is focused on product improvements innovations and cost reductions for our customers in 2005 our research and engineering expenditures were 278 million compared to 241 million in 2004 of this amount approximately 27 percent or 76 million was directly related to the development of heavyduty and mediumduty engines that are designed to comply with the 2007 emissions standards 

in the engine segment we continue to invest in system integration and in technologies to meet increasingly more stringent emissions standards we have focused our engine technology development on four critical subsystems combustion air handling electronic controls and exhaust aftertreatment we were the first diesel engine manufacturer to have an engine certified by the epa as being in compliance with the current epa standards we also were the first engine manufacturer to announce a lowcost combustiononly emission solution for tier iii industrial diesel engines that does not require exhaust gas recirculation nor exhaust aftertreatment in addition we were the first company to demonstrate a prototype vehicle that meets epa 2007 gasolineequivalent “tier ii bin 5” emission levels 

in power generation our product engineering focus is to develop products with the best performance at the lowest cost for our customers our power electronics technology development is aimed at applying digital electronics to eliminate multiple genset controllers and achieve higher levels of system integration and control we meet the most advanced emission standards around the world employing both combustion and exhaust aftertreatment technologies looking to future lowemission power generation technologies we have a department of energy funded program to develop a solid oxide fuel cell system for vehicle auxiliary power generation and for smaller stationary power generation applications 

in components we are building on our strengths in design integration to develop modules that integrate multiple filtration functions into a single engine subsystem component we are developing new filter media and technologies that support lowemission engines including exhaust aftertreatment closed crankcase ventilation fuel systems and centrifugal soot removal 

in 2003 we established cummins research and technology india private ltd crti this partiallyowned subsidiary provides analytical services such as structural dynamics computational fluid dynamics and design to all cummins entities crti is located in pune india in 2004 we signed a joint venture agreement with dcec for a research facility in china that is expected to open in mid2006 the cummins east asia research and development co ltd will provide engineering and technical services for the full range of cummins products manufactured in china including diesel and natural gas engines power generators turbochargers and filtration products

employees 

as of december 31 2005 we employed approximately 33500 persons worldwide 

environmental compliance 

product environmental compliance 

our engines are subject to extensive statutory and regulatory requirements that directly or indirectly impose standards governing emissions and noise our products comply with emissions standards that the epa the california air resources board carb and other state regulatory agencies as well as other regulatory agencies around the world have established for heavyduty onhighway diesel and gas engines and offhighway engines produced through 2005 our ability to comply with these and future emissions standards is an essential element in maintaining our leadership position in regulated markets we have made and will continue to make significant capital and research expenditures to comply with these standards failure to comply with these standards could result in adverse effects on our future financial results 

epa engine certifications 

in the fourth quarter of 2002 we implemented new onroad emissions standards these were implemented in accordance with the terms of a 1998 consent decree that we and a number of other engine manufacturers entered into with the epa the us department of justice doj and carb the consent decree was in response to concerns raised by these agencies regarding the level of nitrogen oxide emissions from heavyduty diesel engines engines sold through 2005 are still subject to these emissions levels and will continue to be until january 1 2007 when new standards come into effect 

the consent decree also required us to pull forward by one year to january 1 2005 the implementation of tier iii emissions standards for offroad engines in the 300 to 749 horsepower range this development was finished early in 2004 and all testing and epacarb certification was concluded sales of these engines commenced january 1 2005 

federal and california regulations require manufacturers to report failures of emissionsrelated components to the epa and carb when the failure rate reaches a specified level at higher failure rates a product recall may be required in 2005 we submitted 128 reports to the epa relating to 44 different defects affecting egr valves fan speed software and data plates none of these defects resulted in a campaign of a material nature 

emissions standards in international markets including europe and japan are becoming more stringent we believe that our experience in meeting us emissions standards leaves us well positioned to take advantage of opportunities in these markets as the need for emissions control capability grows 

in december 2003 we announced that we will meet the 2007 us epa heavyduty onhighway emissions standards by combining our existing cooled exhaust gas recirculation egr technology with particulate matter pm filters cooled egr is the same technology that we have used since april 2002 and was selected after reviewing other aftertreatment technologies such as nox adsorbers and selective catalytic reduction scr our experience with particulate filters and the availability of ultralowsulfur diesel fuel combine to give us the confidence in meeting these tough standards in the us additionally while we believe the egrpm filter combination is the right solution for 2007 in the us we have selected scr as the right technology to meet onhighway euro iv emissions standards and certain offhighway applications 

other environmental statutes and regulations 

we believe we are in compliance in all material respects with laws and regulations applicable to our plants and operations during the last five years expenditures for environmental control activities and environmental remediation projects at our facilities in the us have not been a substantial portion of annual capital outlays and are not expected to be material in 2006 

pursuant to notices received from federal and state agencies andor defendant parties in site environmental contribution actions we have been identified as a potentially responsible party prp under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of 1980 as amended or similar state laws at approximately 16 waste disposal sites based upon our experiences at similar sites we believe that our aggregate future remediation costs will not be significant we have established accruals that we believe are adequate for our expected future liability with respect to these sites 




 item 1a   risk factors relating to our business

set forth below and elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k are some of the principal risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual business results to differ materially from any forwardlooking statements contained in this report in addition future results could be materially affected by general industry and market conditions changes in laws or accounting rules general us and nonus economic and political conditions including a global economic slowdown fluctuation of interest rates or currency exchange rates terrorism political unrest or international conflicts political instability or major health concerns natural disasters or other disruptions of expected economic and business conditions these risk factors should be considered in addition to our cautionary comments concerning forwardlooking statements in this report including statements related to markets for our products and trends in our business that involve a number of risks and uncertainties our separate section in item 7 below “disclosure regarding forwardlooking statements” should be considered in addition to the following statements 

our business is affected by the cyclical nature of the markets we serve 

our financial performance depends in large part on varying conditions in the markets and geographies that we serve demand in these markets and geographies fluctuates in response to overall economic conditions and is particularly sensitive to changes in interest rate levels and fuel costs our sales are also impacted by oem inventory levels and production schedules and stoppages economic downturns in the markets we serve generally result in reductions in sales and pricing of our products which could reduce future earnings and cash flow 

our products are subject to substantial government regulation 

our engines are subject to extensive statutory and regulatory requirements governing emissions and noise including standards imposed by the epa state regulatory agencies such as the carb and other regulatory agencies around the world in some cases we may be required to develop new products to comply with new regulations particularly those relating to air emissions for example under the terms of a consent decree that we and a number of other engine manufacturers entered into with the doj the carb and the epa we were required to develop new engines to comply with stringent emissions standards by october 1 2002 while we were able to meet this deadline our ability to comply with other existing and future regulatory standards will be essential for us to maintain our position in the engine markets we serve currently we believe we are on schedule to meet all deadlines for known future regulatory standards 

we have made and will be required to continue to make significant capital and research expenditures to comply with these regulatory standards further the successful development and introduction of new and enhanced products are subject to risks such as delays in product development cost overruns and unanticipated technical and manufacturing difficulties any failure to comply with regulatory standards affecting our products could subject us to fines or penalties and could require us to cease production of any noncompliant engine or to recall any engines produced and sold in violation of the applicable standards see “business—environmental compliance—product environmental compliance” for a complete discussion of the environmental laws and regulations that affect our products 

our products are subject to recall for performance related issues 

we are at risk for product recall costs product recall costs are costs incurred when we decide either voluntarily or involuntarily to recall a product through a formal campaign to solicit the return of specific products due to a known or suspected performance issue costs typically include the cost of the product part or component being replaced customer cost of the recall and labor to remove and replace the defective part or component when a recall decision is made we estimate the cost of the recall and record a charge to earnings in that period in accordance with fasb statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 5 “accounting for contingencies” in making this estimate judgment is required as to the quantity or volume to be recalled the total cost of the recall campaign the ultimate negotiated sharing of the cost between us and the customer and in some cases the extent to which the supplier of the part or component will share in the recall cost as a result these estimates are subject to change 

we cannot assure that our truck manufacturers and oem customers will continue to outsource their engine supply needs 

some of our engine customers including volvo and daimlerchrysler are truck manufacturers or oems that manufacture engines for their own products despite their engine manufacturing abilities these customers have chosen to outsource certain types of engine production to us due to the quality of our engine products and in order to reduce costs eliminate production risks and maintain company focus however we cannot assure that these customers will continue to outsource engine production in the future increased levels of production insourcing could result from a number of factors such as shifts in our customers’ business strategies acquisition by a customer of another engine manufacturer the inability of thirdparty suppliers to meet product specifications and the emergence of lowcost production opportunities in foreign countries any significant reduction in the level of engine production outsourcing from our truck manufacturer or oem customers could significantly impact our revenues and accordingly have a material adverse affect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our largest customer accounts for a significant share of our business 

sales to daimlerchrysler accounted for approximately 12 percent of our consolidated net sales for 2005 primarily relating to sales of our isb engine for use in the dodge ram truck and sales of our heavyand mediumduty engines to its freightliner division while a significant amount of our sales to daimlerchrysler are under longterm supply agreements these agreements provide for the supply of daimlerchrysler’s engine requirements for particular models and not a specific number of engines accordingly the loss of daimlerchrysler as a customer or a significant decline in the production levels for the vehicles in which daimlerchrysler uses our products would have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our manufacturing operations are dependent upon thirdparty suppliers making us vulnerable to supply shortages 

we obtain materials and manufactured components from thirdparty suppliers a significant number of our suppliers representing 75 to 85 percent of our total raw material and component purchasers in 2005 are the sole source for a particular supply item although the majority of these materials and components can be obtained from other suppliers any delay in our suppliers’ abilities to provide us with necessary materials and components may affect our capabilities at a number of our manufacturing locations or may require us to seek alternative supply sources delays in obtaining supplies may result from a number of factors affecting our suppliers including capacity constraints labor disputes the impaired financial condition of a particular supplier suppliers’ allocations to other purchasers weather emergencies or acts of war or terrorism any delay in receiving supplies could impair our ability to deliver products to our customers and accordingly could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

we may be adversely impacted by work stoppages and other labor matters 

as of december 31 2005 we employed approximately 33500 persons worldwide approximately 12500 of our employees worldwide are represented by various unions under collective bargaining agreements with various unions that expire between 2006 and 2010 while we have no reason to believe that we will be impacted by work stoppages and other labor matters we cannot assure that future issues with our labor unions will be resolved favorably or that we will not encounter future strikes further unionization efforts or other types of conflicts with labor unions or our employees any of these factors may have an adverse effect on us or may limit our flexibility in dealing with our workforce in addition many of our customers have unionized work forces work stoppages or slowdowns experienced by our customers could result in slowdowns or closures at vehicle assembly plants where our engines are installed if one or more of our customers experience a material work stoppage it could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our products involve risks of exposure to product liability claims 

we face an inherent business risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that our products’ failure to perform to specifications results or is alleged to result in property damage bodily injury andor death we may experience material product liability losses in the future while we maintain insurance coverage with respect to certain product liability claims we may not be able to obtain such insurance on acceptable terms in the future if at all and any such insurance may not provide adequate coverage against product liability claims in addition product liability claims can be expensive to defend and can divert the attention of management and other personnel for significant periods of time regardless of the ultimate outcome an unsuccessful defense of a product liability claim could have a material adverse affect on our business results of operations and financial condition and cash flows in addition even if we are successful in defending against a claim relating to our products claims of this nature could cause our customers to lose confidence in our products and our company 

our operations are subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations 

our plants and operations are subject to increasingly stringent environmental laws and regulations in all of the countries in which we operate including laws and regulations governing emissions to air discharges to water and the generation handling storage transportation treatment and disposal of waste materials while we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with these environmental laws and regulations we cannot assure that we will not be adversely impacted by costs liabilities or claims with respect to existing or subsequently acquired operations under either present laws and regulations or those that may be adopted or imposed in the future we are also subject to laws requiring the cleanup of contaminated property if a release of hazardous substances occurs at or from any of our current or former properties or at a landfill or another location where we have disposed of hazardous materials we may be held liable for the contamination and the amount of such liability could be material 

we are exposed to political economic and other risks that arise from operating a multinational business 

approximately 51 percent of our net sales for 2005 were derived from sources outside the united states accordingly our business is subject to the political economic and other risks that are inherent in operating in numerous countries these risks include 

·   the difficulty of enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through foreign legal systems

·   trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements

·   tax rates in certain foreign countries that exceed those in the united states and the imposition of withholding requirements on foreign earnings

·   the imposition of tariffs exchange controls or other restrictions

·   difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations and the application of foreign labor regulations

·   required compliance with a variety of foreign laws and regulations and

·   changes in general economic and political conditions in countries where we operate particularly in emerging markets

as we continue to expand our business globally our success will depend in part on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these and other risks we cannot assure that these and other factors will not have a material adverse affect on our international operations or on our business as a whole 

we are subject to currency exchange rate and other related risks 

we conduct operations in many areas of the world involving transactions denominated in a variety of currencies we are subject to currency exchange rate risk to the extent that our costs are denominated in currencies other than those in which we earn revenues in addition since our financial statements are denominated in us dollars changes in currency exchange rates between the us dollar and other currencies have had and will continue to have an impact on our earnings while we customarily enter into financial transactions to address these risks we cannot assure that currency exchange rate fluctuations will not adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition in addition while the use of currency hedging instruments may provide us with protection from adverse fluctuations in currency exchange rates by utilizing these instruments we potentially forego the benefits that might result from favorable fluctuations in currency exchange rates 

we also face risks arising from the imposition of exchange controls and currency devaluations exchange controls may limit our ability to convert foreign currencies into us dollars or to remit dividends and other payments by our foreign subsidiaries or businesses located in or conducted within a country imposing controls currency devaluations result in a diminished value of funds denominated in the currency of the country instituting the devaluation actions of this nature if they occur or continue for significant periods of time could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition in any given period 

we face significant competition in the markets we serve 

the markets in which we operate are highly competitive we compete worldwide with a number of other manufacturers and distributors that produce and sell similar products our products primarily compete on the basis of price performance fuel economy speed of delivery quality and customer support there can be no assurance that our products will be able to compete successfully with the products of these other companies any failure by us to compete effectively in the markets we serve could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition for a more complete discussion of the competitive environment in which each of our segments operates see “business—our operating segments”

 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

we are exposed to financial risk resulting from changes in foreign exchange rates interest rates and commodity prices this risk is closely monitored and managed through the use of financial derivative instruments including commodity price swaps forward contracts and interest rate swaps as clearly stated in our policies and procedures financial instruments are used expressly for hedging purposes and under no circumstances are they used for speculative purposes our hedging transactions are entered into with banking institutions that have strong credit ratings and thus the credit risk associated with these transactions is not considered significant the results and status of our hedging transactions are reported to senior management on a monthly and quarterly basis further information regarding financial instruments and risk management is contained in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements 

the following describes our risk exposures and provides results of sensitivity analyses performed as of december 31 2005 the sensitivity analysis assumes instantaneous parallel shifts in foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices 

foreign exchange rates 

as a result of our international business presence we are exposed to foreign currency exchange risk we transact in foreign currencies and have significant assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies as a result our earnings experience some volatility related to movements in foreign currency exchange rates in order to benefit from global diversification and after considering naturally offsetting currency positions we enter into forward contracts to minimize our existing exposures recognized asset and liability and hedge forecasted transactions the objective of our hedging program is to reduce the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on earnings by essentially creating offsetting currency exposures 

as of december 31 2005 the potential gain or loss in the fair value of our outstanding foreign currency contracts assuming a hypothetical 10 percent fluctuation in the currencies of such contracts would be approximately 44 million the sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates assumes the notional value to remain constant for the next 12 months the analysis ignores the impact of foreign exchange movements on our competitive position and potential changes in sales levels it should be noted that any change in the value of the contracts real or hypothetical would be significantly offset by an inverse change in the value of the underlying hedged items see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements  

interest rates 

we are also exposed to interest rate risk as a result of our indebtedness our objective in managing our exposure to changes in interest rates is to limit the effect of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower our overall cost of borrowing to achieve this objective we primarily use interest rate swap agreements to manage exposure to interest rate changes related to our borrowing arrangements 

in november 2005 we entered into an interest rate swap to effectively convert our 250 million due in 2028 debt from a fixed rate of 7125 to a floating rate based on a libor spread the terms of the swap mirror those of the debt with interest paid semiannually this swap qualifies as a fair value hedge under sfas no 133 “accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities” 

in november 2002 we terminated an interest rate swap relating to our 645 notes that matured in 2005 the swap acted as a fair value hedge and converted 225 million notional amount from fixed rate debt into floating rate debt that matured in 2005 the termination of this swap resulted in a 12 million gain the gain was amortized to earnings as a reduction of interest expense over the remaining life of the debt the amount of gain recognized during 2005 2004 and 2003 was 1 million 5 million and 5 million 

respectively as of december 31 2005 there is no longer any deferred gain remaining on our consolidated balance sheets see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements  

in march 2001 we terminated two fixedtofloating interest rate swap agreements related to our 625 notes with principal amount of 125 million due in 2003 and 645 notes with principal amount of 225 million due in 2005 the termination of these swaps resulted in a 9 million gain the gain was amortized to earnings as a reduction of interest expense over the remaining life of the debt the amount of gain recognized was not material in 2005 and was 1 million and 2 million during 2004 and 2003 respectively as of december 31 2005 there is no longer any deferred gain remaining on our consolidated balance sheets see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements  

commodity prices 

we are also exposed to fluctuations in commodity prices through the purchase of raw materials as well as contractual agreements with component suppliers to reduce the effect of raw material price changes for select commodities we periodically enter into commodity swap contracts with designated banks to hedge a portion of our anticipated raw material purchases 

as of december 31 2005 the potential gain or loss related to the outstanding commodity swap contracts assuming a hypothetical 10 percent fluctuation in the price of such commodities was 5 million the sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in commodity prices assumes the notional value to remain constant for the next 12 months the analysis ignores the impact of commodity price movements on our competitive position and potential changes in sales levels it should be noted that any change in the value of the swaps real or hypothetical would be significantly offset by an inverse change in the value of the underlying hedged items see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements

including partnerships with the tata group whose member company is the leading truck manufacturer in india and dongfeng automotive corporation an engine supplier to the second largest truck manufacturer in china 

·   global presence we have a strong global presence including a world class distribution system manufacturing and engineering facilities around the world and a network of global supply sources our worldwide presence has enabled us to take advantage of growth opportunities in international markets with sales outside the us growing from 39 percent of total sales in 1999 to 48 percent of total sales in 2004 in the last 45 years we have developed a distribution and service network that includes more than 550 companyowned and independent distributor locations and 5000 independent dealers located throughout 160 countries and territories we also have manufacturing operations and product engineering centers around the world with facilities in the united kingdom uk brazil mexico canada france australia china india south africa and singapore in addition we have developed a global network of highquality lowcost supply sources to support our manufacturing base

·   leading technology we have an established reputation for delivering highquality technologically advanced products we continuously work with our customers to develop new products to improve the performance of their vehicles equipment or systems at competitive cost levels we are a leader in developing technologies to reduce diesel engine emissions a key concern of our customers and regulators around the world we were the first company to develop engines that were certified to meet new emissions standards governing onhighway heavyduty diesel engines these standards went into effect for cummins in the us on october 1 2002 we were also the first manufacturer to receive a tier iii certificate of conformity from the epa for our qsm offhighway engine that meets the january 2005 emissions standards we have also developed lowemission highperformance natural gas engines as an alternative fuel option for the onhighway industrial and power generation markets our technology leadership enables us to develop integrated product solutions for the power generation and filtration markets allowing our customers to use a single highperformance lowcost system as opposed to multiple components from different suppliers

business strategy 

the four key elements of our business strategy are as follows 

·   aggressively pursue cost leadership in many of our markets product or system cost is a critical performance parameter for our customers to achieve cost leadership we will continue to leverage our innovative technology economies of scale global presence and customer partnerships beginning in 2000 we have continuously focused on dramatically reducing costs and lowering our breakeven point to maintain a competitive advantage and to deliver quality products to our customers the following key initiatives are integral to this strategy

·   six sigma since the program’s inception five years ago cummins has not only applied six sigma to manufacturing processes and in the initial design of new products but also expanded the program to include processes with customers suppliers and distributors six sigma yields not only significant cost savings and improved quality it strengthens the relationships with these important stakeholders and yields longterm relationships

·   global sourcing cummins cost reduction efforts in supply chain management and global procurement from less expensive international markets such as china india eastern europe and brazil have resulted in significantly reducing the cost of purchased materials and services during the last five years

·   technical productivity cummins is maximizing its technical productivity for less by conducting offshore research and development at its technical center in india by sharing development cost with its customer oem and joint venture partnerships and by using analysisled design to eliminate capitalintensive prototypes through virtual computer modeling in 2004 we signed an agreement with dongfeng cummins engine co ltd for a technical center facility in china that is scheduled to open in the first quarter of 2006

·   expand into related markets we will continue to focus growth initiatives in related businesses where we can use our existing investments in products or technology leading brand names or market presence to establish a competitive advantage furthermore we will target related markets that offer higher rates of growth attractive returns and more stable cash flows through product and end market diversity specific growth opportunities are outlined below

·   cummins engine business has made a significant investment in the company’s north american distributors engines for the growing oil and gas markets service and maintenance contracts and progress toward our strategy to meet 2007 and 2010 onhighway emissions standards

·   cummins power generation business is focused on increasing sales of standby power mobile and auxiliary power distributed generation alternators and power electronics and controls such as transfer switches and switchgear

·   cummins filtration and other business will leverage the company’s filtration exhaust and engine technologies to provide integrated solutions for its customers and meet increasingly stringent emissions requirements

·   cummins international distributor business is growing through the expansion of the aftermarket parts and service business by capitalizing on its global customer base and fast growth markets in china india and russia

·   maximize return on capital return on capital specifically return on average net assets roana is our primary measure of financial performance each of our business segments use roana measurement targets and we allocate capital based on segment performance against those targets we calculate roana as segment ebit divided by segment average net assets segment ebit is earnings before interest loss on early retirement of debt taxes minority interests preferred dividends and cumulative effect of accounting changes and segment average net assets is net assets excluding debt taxes and adjustments to the minimum pension liability

·   leverage complementary businesses  strong synergies and relationships exist between cummins businesses in the following areas

·   shared technology in addition to common platforms of base product technology our businesses have technical capabilities which can be applied commercially to provide integrated solutions for our customers the businesses also realize synergies in the development and application of broader technology tools such as information technology

·   common channels and distribution all business units utilize a common distribution channel which provides access to a full range of our products and also provides economies of scale

·   shared customers and partners there is substantial commonality in customers and partners between business units which allows us to build strong customer relationships and provides opportunity for expanded product offerings

·   corporate brand and image all business units benefit from the established respected corporate brand

·   ensuring and reinforcing a strong performance ethic this means doing what we say we will do in terms of financial performance meeting customer and partner expectations and demonstrating our corporate core values

as a result of our intense focus on roana we have been able to reduce capital spending while still funding key development programs including the completion of a full range of emissioncompliant engines during 2002 – 2004 our average annual capital spending was lower compared to the average capital spending during the 1999 – 2001 period prior to 2001 our annual capital expenditures were significant as we launched new engine platforms capital expenditures for 2005 will increase to support our growth including investments to increase capacity and to fund our new products our investments in capacity improvement are very focused cut across all of our businesses and are designed for rapid return on investment we continue to invest more of our capital in lowcost regions of the world to further leverage our opportunities for cost reduction in total we expect capital expenditures to be in the range of 220 million to 240 million dollars to support these initiatives while still remaining below depreciation and amortization 

one of our goals is to regain an investment grade credit rating from the rating agencies to achieve this goal we have put significant management focus on increasing earnings improving cash flow and reducing debt levels

segment financial information 

financial information about our business segments is incorporated by reference from note 21 to the consolidated financial statements 

supply 

we have developed and maintain a world class supply base in terms of technology quality and cost we source our materials and manufactured components from leading suppliers both domestically and internationally we have adequate sources of supply of raw materials and components we machine and assemble some of the components used in our engines and power generation units including blocks heads rods turbochargers camshafts crankshafts filters exhaust systems alternators and fuel systems we also have arrangements with certain suppliers who are the sole source for specific products or supply items between 75 and 85 percent of our total raw material and component purchases in 2004 were purchased from suppliers who are the sole source of supply for a particular supply item although we elect to source a relatively high proportion of our total raw materials and component requirements from sole suppliers the majority of these supply items can be purchased from alternate suppliers with the appropriate sourcing plan in addition we maintain dual sourcing at a commodity level on many of our sole sourced part numbers our supply agreements vary according to the particular part number sourced however these agreements typically include standard terms relating to cost including cost reduction targets quality and delivery our supply agreements also typically include customary intellectual property provisions that contain prohibitions on the use of our intellectual property by the suppliers for any purpose other than their performance of the supply agreements and indemnity covenants from suppliers for breach by them of intellectual property rights of third parties in performance of the agreements the duration of our more important supply agreements varies but typically ranges between three and five years and some extend through 2010 many of our supply agreements include early termination provisions related to failure to meet quality and delivery requirements in order to reduce the risk of dependency the raw materials and components from single source suppliers are reviewed periodically to ensure a second source or alternative exists to guarantee supply 

patents and trademarks 

we own or control a significant number of patents and trademarks relating to the products we manufacture these have been granted and registered over a period of years although these patents and trademarks are generally considered beneficial to our operations we do not believe any patent group of patents or trademark other than our leading brand house trademarks is considered significant in relation to our business 

seasonality 

while individual product lines may experience modest seasonal declines in production there is no material effect on the demand for the majority of our products on a quarterly basis however our power generation business normally experiences seasonal declines in the first quarter of the fiscal year due to general declines in construction spending and our international distributor business normally experiences seasonal declines in first quarter business activity due to holiday periods in asia and australia 

largest customer 

we have thousands of customers around the world and have developed longstanding business relationships with many of them daimlerchrysler is our largest customer accounting for approximately 13 percent of our consolidated net sales in 2004 primarily relating to sales of our isb engine for use in dodge ram trucks and sales of our mediumduty engines to the freightliner division of daimlerchrysler while a significant number of our sales to daimlerchrysler are under longterm supply agreements these agreements provide for the supply of daimlerchrysler’s engine requirements for particular vehicle models and not a specific volume of engines daimlerchrysler is our only customer accounting for more than 10 percent of our net sales in 2004 the loss of this customer or a significant decline in the production level of daimlerchrysler vehicles that use our engines would have an adverse effect on our business results of 

operations and financial condition we have been an engine supplier to daimlerchrysler for more than 15 years a summary of principal customers for each business segment is included in our segment discussion 

in addition to our agreements with daimlerchrysler we have longterm heavyduty engine supply agreements with international truck and engine corporation paccar and volvo trucks north america collectively our net sales to these three customers was less than 18 of consolidated net sales in 2004 and individually was less than 9 of consolidated net sales for each customer as with daimlerchrysler these agreements contain standard purchase and sale agreement terms covering engine and engine parts pricing quality and delivery commitments as well as engineering product support obligations the basic nature of our agreements with oem customers is that they are longterm generally five years or longer price and operations agreements that assure the availability of our products to each customer through the duration of the respective agreements there are no guarantees or commitments by these customers of any kind regarding volumes or market shares except in the case of daimlerchrysler which has committed that cummins will be its exclusive diesel engine supplier for the dodge ram heavyduty pickup truck agreements with oems contain bilateral termination provisions giving either party the right to terminate in the event of a material breach change of control or insolvency or bankruptcy of the other party 

backlog 

while we have supply agreements with some truck and offhighway equipment oems most of our business is transacted through open purchase orders these open orders are historically subject to monthtomonth releases and are subject to cancellation on reasonable notice without cancellation charges and therefore are not considered firm 

distribution 

over the last 45 years we have developed a distribution and service network that includes more than 550 distributor locations and 5000 dealers in 160 countries and territories this network is comprised of independent distributors north american distributors that are partiallyowned by us and international distributors that are whollyowned each distributor sells the full range of our products as well as complementary products and services our international distributor business operates within this network with 17 companyowned distributors and one joint venture in 116 locations across 77 countries and territories 

our agreements with independent and partiallyowned distributors generally have a threeyear term and are exclusive with respect to specified territories our distributors develop and maintain the network of dealers with which we have no direct relationship the distributors are permitted to sell other noncompetitive products only with our consent we license all of our distributors to use our name and logo in connection with the sale and service of our products with no right to assign or sublicense the marks except to authorized dealers without our consent products are sold to the distributors at standard domestic or international distributor net prices as applicable net prices are wholesale prices we establish to permit our distributors an adequate margin on their sales we can refuse to renew these agreements at will and we may terminate them upon 90day notice for inadequate sales change in principal ownership and certain other reasons distributors also have the right to terminate the agreements upon 60day notice without cause or 30day notice for cause upon termination or failure to renew we are required to purchase the distributor’s current inventory and may at our option purchase other assets of the distributor but are under no obligation to do so 

our distribution capability is a key element of our business strategy and competitive position particularly in our efforts to increase customer access to aftermarket replacement parts and repair service 

there are more than 5000 locations in north america primarily owned and operated by oems or their dealers at which cummins trained service personnel and parts are available to service maintain and repair our engines we also have parts distribution centers located strategically throughout the world in order to serve our customers and distributors 

financial information about whollyowned distributors partiallyowned distributors consolidated under fin46r and distributors accounted for under the equity method are incorporated by reference to notes 1 2 and 3 to the consolidated financial statements 

research and engineering 

our research and engineering program is focused on product improvements innovations and cost reductions for our customers in 2004 our research and engineering expenditures were 241 million compared to 200 million in 2003 of this amount approximately 8 percent or 20 million was directly related to the development of heavyduty and mediumduty engines that are designed to comply with the 2007 emissions standards 

in the engine business we continue to invest in system integration and in technologies to meet increasingly more stringent emissions standards we have focused our engine technology development on five critical subsystems combustion air handling fuel systems electronic controls and exhaust aftertreatment we were the first diesel engine manufacturer to have an engine certified by the epa as being in compliance with the current epa standards we also were the first engine manufacturer to announce a lowcost combustiononly emission solution for tier iii industrial diesel engines that does not require exhaust gas recirculation nor exhaust aftertreatment in addition we were the first company to demonstrate a prototype vehicle that meets epa 2007 gasolineequivalent “tier ii bin 5” emission levels 

in power generation our product engineering focus is best performance at lowest cost for our customers our power electronics technology development is aimed at applying digital electronics to eliminate multiple genset controllers and achieve higher levels of system integration and control we meet the most advanced emission standards around the world employing both combustion and exhaust aftertreatment technologies looking to future lowemission power generation technologies we have a doefunded program to develop a solid oxide fuel cell system for vehicle auxiliary power generation and for smaller stationary power generation applications 

in filtration we are building on our strengths in design integration to develop modules that integrate multiple filtration functions into a single engine subsystem component we are developing new filter media and technologies that support low emission engines including exhaust aftertreatment closed crankcase ventilation and centrifugal soot removal 

in 2003 we established cummins research and technology indian private ltd crti this partiallyowned subsidiary provides analytical services such as structural dynamics computational fluid dynamics and design to all cummins entities crti has selected satyam computer services limited to provide startup services in the form of engineering staff and leased work space crti is located in pune india in 2004 we signed a joint venture agreement with dongfeng cummins engine co ltd for a research facility in china that is expected to open in the first quarter of 2006 the cummins east asia tech center will provide engineering and technical services for the full range of cummins products manufactured in china including diesel and natural gas engines power generators turbochargers and filtration products

employees 

as of december 31 2004 we employed approximately 28100 persons worldwide approximately 10300 of our employees are represented by various unions under collective bargaining agreements that expire between 2005 and 2008 

environmental compliance 

product environmental compliance 

our engines are subject to extensive statutory and regulatory requirements that directly or indirectly impose standards governing emissions and noise our products comply with emissions standards that the environmental protection agency epa the california air resources board carb and other state regulatory agencies as well as other regulatory agencies around the world have established for heavyduty onhighway diesel and gas engines and offhighway engines produced through 2005 our ability to comply with these and future emissions standards is an essential element in maintaining our leadership position in regulated markets we have made and will continue to make significant capital and research expenditures to comply with these standards failure to comply with these standards could result in adverse effects on our future financial results 

epa engine certifications 

in the fourth quarter 2002 we implemented new onroad emissions standards these were implemented in accordance with the terms of a 1998 consent decree that we and a number of other engine manufacturers entered into with the epa the us department of justice doj and carb the consent decree was in response to concerns raised by these agencies regarding the level of nitrogen oxide emissions from heavyduty diesel engines 

the consent decree also requires us to pull forward by one year to january 1 2005 the implementation of tier iii emissions standards for offroad engines in the 300 to 749 horsepower range this development was finished early in the year and all testing and epacarb certification was concluded so that these engines could be sold commencing january 1 2005 

federal and california regulations require manufacturers to report failures of emissionsrelated components to the epa and carb when the failure rate reaches a specified level at higher failure rates a product recall may be required in 2004 we submitted one report to the epa relating to incorrect or missing data plates on 39 engines 

emissions standards in international markets including europe and japan are becoming more stringent we believe that our experience in meeting us emissions standards leaves us well positioned to take advantage of opportunities in these markets as the need for emissions control capability grows 

in december 2003 we announced that we will meet the 2007 us epa heavyduty onhighway emissions standards by combining our existing cooled exhaust gas recirculation technology with particulate matter pm filters cooled egr is the same technology that we have used since april 2002 and was selected after reviewing other aftertreatment technologies such as nox adsorbers and selective catalytic reduction scr our experience with particulate filters and the availability of ultralowsulfur diesel fuel combine to give us the confidence in meeting these tough standards in the us additionally while the egrpm filter combination is the right solution for 2007 in the us we have selected scr as the right technology to meet onhighway euro iv emissions standards and certain offhighway applications 

other environmental statutes and regulations 

we believe we are in compliance in all material respects with laws and regulations applicable to our plants and operations during the last five years expenditures for environmental control activities and environmental remediation projects at our facilities in the us have not been a substantial portion of annual capital outlays and are not expected to be material in 2005 

pursuant to notices received from federal and state agencies andor defendant parties in site environmental contribution actions we have been identified as a potentially responsible party prp under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of 1980 as amended or similar state laws at approximately 14 waste disposal sites based upon our experiences at similar sites we believe that our aggregate future remediation costs will not be significant we have established accruals that we believe are adequate for our expected future liability with respect to these sites 

risk factors relating to our business 

set forth below and elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k and in other documents we file with the sec are some of the principal risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual business results to differ materially from any forwardlooking statements or other projections contained in this report in addition future results could be materially affected by general industry and market conditions changes in laws or accounting rules general us and nonus economic and political conditions including a global economic slowdown fluctuation of interest rates or currency exchange rates terrorism political unrest or international conflicts political instability or major health concerns natural disasters or other disruptions of expected economic and business conditions these risk factors should be considered in addition to our cautionary comments concerning forwardlooking statements in this report including statements related to markets for our products and trends in our business that involve a number of risks and uncertainties our separate section in item 7 below “disclosure regarding forwardlooking statements” should be considered in addition to the following statements 

our business is affected by the cyclical nature of the markets we serve 

our financial performance depends in large part on varying conditions in the markets that we serve particularly the automotive construction and general industrial markets demand in these markets fluctuates in response to overall economic conditions and is particularly sensitive to changes in interest rate levels and fuel costs our sales are also impacted by oem inventory levels and production schedules and stoppages economic downturns in the markets we serve generally result in reductions in sales and pricing of our products which could reduce future earnings and cash flow 

our products are subject to substantial government regulation 

our engines are subject to extensive statutory and regulatory requirements governing emissions and noise including standards imposed by the epa state regulatory agencies such as the carb and other regulatory agencies around the world in some cases we may be required to develop new products to comply with new regulations particularly those relating to air emissions for example under the terms of a consent decree that we and a number of other engine manufacturers entered into with the doj the carb and the epa we were required to develop new engines to comply with stringent emissions standards by october 1 2002 while we were able to meet this deadline our ability to comply with other existing and future regulatory standards will be essential for us to maintain our position in the engine markets we serve currently we believe we are on schedule to meet all deadlines for known future regulatory standards 

we have made and will be required to continue to make significant capital and research expenditures to comply with these standards but we cannot assure that we will be able to achieve the technological advances that may be necessary for us to continue to comply with evolving regulatory standards further 

the successful development and introduction of new and enhanced products are subject to risks such as delays in product development cost overruns and unanticipated technical and manufacturing difficulties any failure to comply with regulatory standards affecting our products could subject us to fines or penalties and could require us to cease production of any noncompliant engine or to recall any engines produced and sold in violation of the applicable standards see “business—environmental compliance—product environmental compliance” for a complete discussion of the environmental laws and regulations that affect our products 

our products are subject to recall for performance related issues 

we are at risk for product recall costs product recall costs are costs incurred when we decide either voluntarily or involuntarily to recall a product through a formal campaign to solicit the return of specific products due to a known or suspected performance issue costs typically include the cost of the product part or component being replaced customer cost of the recall and labor to remove and replace the defective part or component when a recall decision is made we estimate the cost of the recall and record a charge to earnings in that period in accordance with financial accounting standards board statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 5 “accounting for contingencies” in making this estimate judgment is required as to the quantity or volume to be recalled the total cost of the recall campaign the ultimate negotiated sharing of the cost between us and the customer and in some cases the extent to which the supplier of the part or component will share in the recall cost as a result these estimates are subject to change 

we cannot assure that our truck manufacturers and oem customers will continue to outsource their engine supply needs 

some of our engine customers including volvo and daimlerchrysler are truck manufacturers or oems that manufacture engines for their own products despite their engine manufacturing abilities these customers have chosen to outsource certain types of engine production to us due to the quality of our engine products and in order to reduce costs eliminate production risks and maintain company focus however we cannot assure that these customers will continue to outsource engine production in the future increased levels of production insourcing could result from a number of factors such as shifts in our customers’ business strategies which could result from the acquisition of another engine manufacturer the inability of third party suppliers to meet product specifications and the emergence of lowcost production opportunities in foreign countries any significant reduction in the level of engine production outsourcing from our truck manufacturer or oem customers could significantly impact our revenues and accordingly have a material adverse affect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our largest customer accounts for a significant share of our business 

sales to daimlerchrysler accounted for approximately 13 of our net sales for 2004 primarily relating to sales of our isb engine for use in the dodge ram truck and sales of our heavyand mediumduty engines to its freightliner division while a significant amount of our sales to daimlerchrysler is under longterm supply agreements these agreements provide for the supply of daimlerchrysler’s engine requirements for particular models and not a specific number of engines accordingly the loss of daimlerchrysler as a customer or a significant decline in the production levels for the vehicles which daimlerchrysler uses our products would have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our manufacturing operations are dependent upon thirdparty suppliers making us vulnerable to supply shortages 

we obtain materials and manufactured components from thirdparty suppliers a significant number of our suppliers representing 75 to 85 percent of our total raw material and component purchasers in 2004 

are the sole source for a particular supply item although the majority of these materials and components can be obtained from other suppliers any delay in our suppliers’ abilities to provide us with necessary materials and components may affect our capabilities at a number of our manufacturing locations or may require us to seek alternative supply sources delays in obtaining supplies may result from a number of factors affecting our suppliers including capacity constraints labor disputes the impaired financial condition of a particular supplier suppliers’ allocations to other purchasers weather emergencies or acts of war or terrorism any delay in receiving supplies could impair our ability to deliver products to our customers and accordingly could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

we may be adversely impacted by work stoppages and other labor matters 

as of december 31 2004 we employed approximately 28100 persons worldwide approximately 10300 of our employees are represented by various unions under collective bargaining agreements that expire between 2005 and 2008 we cannot assure you that future issues with our labor unions will be resolved favorably or that we will not encounter future strikes further unionization efforts or other types of conflicts with labor unions or our employees any of these factors may have an adverse effect on us or may limit our flexibility in dealing with our workforce in addition many of our customers have unionized work forces work stoppages or slowdowns experienced by our customers could result in slowdowns or closures at vehicle assembly plants where our engines are installed if one or more of our customers experience a material work stoppage it could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our products involve risks of exposure to product liability claims 

we face an inherent business risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that our products’ failure to perform to specifications results or is alleged to result in property damage bodily injury andor death we may experience material product liability losses in the future while we maintain insurance coverage with respect to certain product liability claims we may not be able to obtain such insurance on acceptable terms in the future if at all and any such insurance may not provide adequate coverage against product liability claims in addition product liability claims can be expensive to defend and can divert the attention of management and other personnel for significant periods of time regardless of the ultimate outcome an unsuccessful defense of a product liability claim could have a material adverse affect on our business results of operations and financial condition and cash flows in addition even if we are successful in defending against a claim relating to our products claims of this nature could cause our customers to lose confidence in our products and our company 

our operations are subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations 

our plants and operations are subject to increasingly stringent environmental laws and regulations in all of the countries in which we operate including laws and regulations governing emissions to air discharges to water and the generation handling storage transportation treatment and disposal of waste materials while we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with these environmental laws and regulations we cannot assure you that we will not be adversely impacted by costs liabilities or claims with respect to existing or subsequently acquired operations under either present laws and regulations or those that may be adopted or imposed in the future we are also subject to laws requiring the cleanup of contaminated property if a release of hazardous substances occurs at or from any of our current or former properties or at a landfill or another location where we have disposed of hazardous materials we may be held liable for the contamination and the amount of such liability could be material 

we are exposed to political economic and other risks that arise from operating a multinational business 

approximately 48 percent of our net sales for 2004 were derived from sources outside the united states accordingly our business is subject to the political economic and other risks that are inherent in operating in numerous countries these risks include 

·   the difficulty of enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through foreign legal systems

·   trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements

·   tax rates in certain foreign countries that exceed those in the united states and the imposition of withholding requirements on foreign earnings

·   the imposition of tariffs exchange controls or other restrictions

·   difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations and the application of foreign labor regulations

·   required compliance with a variety of foreign laws and regulations and

·   changes in general economic and political conditions in countries where we operate particularly in emerging markets

as we continue to expand our business globally our success will depend in part on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these and other risks we cannot assure that these and other factors will not have a material adverse affect on our international operations or on our business as a whole 

we are subject to currency exchange rate and other related risks 

we conduct operations in many areas of the world involving transactions denominated in a variety of currencies we are subject to currency exchange rate risk to the extent that our costs are denominated in currencies other than those in which we earn revenues in addition since our financial statements are denominated in us dollars changes in currency exchange rates between the us dollar and other currencies have had and will continue to have an impact on our earnings while we customarily enter into financial transactions to address these risks we cannot assure that currency exchange rate fluctuations will not adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition in addition while the use of currency hedging instruments may provide us with protection from adverse fluctuations in currency exchange rates by utilizing these instruments we potentially forego the benefits that might result from favorable fluctuations in currency exchange rates 

we also face risks arising from the imposition of exchange controls and currency devaluations exchange controls may limit our ability to convert foreign currencies into us dollars or to remit dividends and other payments by our foreign subsidiaries or businesses located in or conducted within a country imposing controls currency devaluations result in a diminished value of funds denominated in the currency of the country instituting the devaluation actions of this nature if they occur or continue for significant periods of time could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition in any given period 

we face significant competition in the markets we serve 

the markets in which we operate are highly competitive we compete worldwide with a number of other manufacturers and distributors that produce and sell similar products our products primarily compete on the basis of price performance fuel economy speed of delivery quality and customer support some of our competitors are companies or divisions or operating units of companies that have greater financial and other resources than we do there can be no assurance that our products will be able to compete successfully with the products of these other companies any failure by us to compete effectively in the markets we serve could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and

overview 

cummins is a global power leader comprised of four reportable complementary business segments engine power generation filtration and other and international distributors our businesses design manufacture distribute and service diesel and natural gas engines and related technologies including fuel systems controls air handling and filtration emissions solutions and electrical power generation systems our products are sold to original equipment manufacturers oems distributors and other customers worldwide major oem customers include daimlerchrysler paccar international truck and engine corporation navistar volvo komatsu ford volkswagen cnh global and our joint venture partners in china dongfeng cummins engine co ltd and india tata cummins limited we serve our customers through a network of more than 550 companyowned and independent distributor locations and approximately 5000 dealer locations in more than 160 countries and territories our business units share technology customers strategic partners brands and our distribution network 

our financial performance is affected by the cyclical nature and varying conditions of the markets we serve particularly the automotive construction and general industrial markets demand in these markets fluctuates in response to overall economic conditions and is particularly sensitive to changes in the price of crude oil fuel costs volume of freight tonnage interest rate levels nonresidential construction spending and general industrial capital spending economic downturns in the markets we serve generally result in reductions in sales volume and pricing of our products and reduce earnings and cash flow although cyclicality is a factor in our business the financial impact of it has been reduced somewhat by our geographical expansion growth in our distributor business and improvements in our fixed cost structure that have resulted in a lower breakeven point of our production costs 

financial overview 

the table below sets forth our consolidated statements of earnings data as a percentage of net sales for the years ended december 31 

   

cummins experienced very strong performance in 2004 with record sales and earnings net earnings were 350 million or 739 per share on sales of 84 billion compared to 2003 net earnings of 50 million or 127 per share on sales of 63 billion the earnings improvement was driven by a 34 percent increase in net sales primarily from our engine business and record sales at our power generation business both segments experienced strong demand across respective automotive and industrial markets with particularly strong demand in the north american heavyduty truck market where engine sales were up 94 percent from the prior year and our market share increased significantly sales also increased in the filtration and other and international distributor businesses in 2004 compared to 2003 reflecting substantial improvement in demand and business conditions our joint ventures contributed 111 million in earnings in 2004 compared to 70 million in 2003 with the largest increase from our expanded joint venture in china dongfeng cummins engine company dcec overall 2004 was an exceptionally strong financial year for cummins and we believe the programs we have in place position us for another good year in 2005 

business outlook 

our engine business experienced much stronger than expected volumes in virtually all of its markets in 2004 and most economic indicators point toward continued improvement at a moderate pace in the north american heavyduty truck market in 2005 we currently expect north american heavyduty truck production levels to increase a minimum of 15 percent from an estimated 245000 units in 2004 to approximately 280000 to 285000 units in 2005 while 2004 demand was driven partially from fleets adding capacity as freight volume increased the majority of the increase resulted from the replacement of aging vehicles in 2005 we expect demand will be driven primarily by the economy as manufacturing and consumer spending levels increase and trucking fleets expand their capacity by adding equipment we also expect sales of our midrange engines to the mediumduty markets to increase in 2005 as economic indicators for this market historically correlate with those of the heavyduty market currently we estimate 

our engine volumes for the worldwide mediumduty truck market to increase 20 percent in 2005 including an increase in market share sales of our 59 liter turbo diesel engine to daimler chrysler for the dodge ram truck reached record levels in 2004 and we expect 2005 volumes will increase with the scheduled availability of our engine in the new dodge ram mega cab we expect the dodge ram heavyduty cummins turbo will continue to result in strong sales volumes as demand for dieselpowered light vehicles increases our industrial markets also experienced a strong recovery in 2004 and continued growth is expected through 2005 particularly overall demand from construction and mining oems 

our power generation business struggled financially in 2002 and 2003 as demand for global power generation declined resulting in high inventory levels overcapacity and market pricing pressures in 2004 profitability returned to this segment based upon strong demand for commercial products in china and the middle east a significant increase in alternator sales to generator set oems record sales of onan branded generator sets to rv oems our focus on cost reduction initiatives benefits from restructuring and new product introductions in 2005 we expect continued growth in commercial international markets for power generation and alternators and stronger growth in domestic markets in our consumer business we expect two new product launches a portable generator set and a residential standby generator set to offset a slight volume decline in rv generator sets overall power generation revenues are expected to increase in 2005 with improved profitability for this segment 

in our filtration and other business our long term agreements with key customers executed in 2003 and 2004 provided excellent revenue growth in 2004 although our financial results were impacted by the dramatic rise in steel prices and capacity constraints in our exhaust manufacturing we expect revenue growth to continue in 2005 and we also expect some growth in aftermarket revenues from new products released in 2004 revenue from our emission solutions business is expected to increase in 2005 as we continue to gain market share in the domestic retrofit business overall filtration and other business revenues are expected to increase approximately 7 percent in 2005 and profitability is expected to improve as a result of cost reduction initiatives and the impact of pricing actions to offset steel cost increases 

in 2004 revenues improved in every geographic region and profitability was up significantly in our international distributor business as the worldwide economy continues to improve and our engine population increases we expect sales growth in engines parts service and power generation equipment and solid profit margins to continue in this business as we capitalize on a growing global customer base we expect revenues to increase over 10 percent in 2005 from economic growth and increased profitability from higher sales volume managed expenses and planned consolidations 

income from our joint ventures is expected to continue to be strong in 2005 particularly in asia through our partnership dcec which is a supplier to the second largest truck manufacturer in china and in north america through our distributorship joint ventures 

we expect our businesses to generate sufficient cash from operations in 2005 to fund capital expenditures research and development pension funding debt service costs and dividend payments in addition we expect cash outflows to fund our joint ventures will approximate 25  30 million in 2005 we have available various short and longterm credit arrangements which are discussed below and disclosed in note 11 to the consolidated financial statements  these credit arrangements and other programs such as our accounts receivable program provide the financial flexibility when needed to satisfy future shortterm funding requirements of our debt service obligations and projected working capital requirements on march 1 2005 we repaid our 225 million 645 notes on their maturity date from cash and cash equivalents on hand with the exception of payments required under various operating and capital leases principal and interest payments on notes issued by a consolidated vie and our pension funding commitments there are no major fixed cash payment obligations occurring until 2010 when our 95 notes with principal amount of 250 million mature 

significant events transactions and financial trends 

throughout this management’s discussion and analysis we have disclosed significant events or transactions that had a material impact on our net earnings or segment ebit financial position and cash flows in 2004 our net earnings benefited from significant tax events that likely will not recur with similar materiality or impact on our effective tax rate our 2004 tax expense was reduced by the following nonrecurring benefits 

·   we reassessed the treatment of foreign tax credits previously recognized as tax deductions and used them as tax credits 25 million

·   we amended prior years us income tax returns and claimed additional export tax benefits 11 million

·   we reversed valuation allowances related to state tax net operating losses that were no longer needed 16 million and

·   we reduced our tax expense for a change in the estimated state income tax rate used to value deferred tax assets 9 million

other significant events and transactions that occurred during 2004 were 

·   we adopted certain provisions of fin 46r as of march 28 2004 which required us to consolidate the assets and liabilities of three variable interest entities previously accounted for under the equity method of accounting as of april 25 2004 we consolidated another entity under the provisions of fin 46r after eliminating intercompany transactions our assets and liabilities as of december 31 2004 increased 319 million and 251 million respectively and our net sales gross margin and net earnings increased 145 million 60 million and 0 million respectively for the year ended december 31 2004 see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements 

·   our gross margin and net earnings were negatively affected by the rising cost of steel and other commodities primarily copper manufacturing and logistics inefficiencies due to significant increases in production and supplier constraints to meet growing demand steel prices increased 5060 percent during 2004 and it is likely they will remain high in the first half of 2005 although we expect increases to be less significant than those experienced in 2004 while our primary focus remains on controlling our costs through cost reduction efforts and six sigma projects we have implemented pricing actions in our businesses to offset our current estimate of the impact of commodity prices in 2005 in addition we have engaged in detailed capacity and throughput analysis work with many of our key suppliers to help them manage capacity constraint issues and have also developed a recovery plan to address our manufacturing and logistics inefficiencies

·   during 2004 we amended the master lease agreements related to two leases representing a majority of equipment leased in our powerrent program one of the lease amendments required us to retain full residual risk on the equipment and the other required us to repurchase the equipment at the end of the twoyear noncancelable lease terms as a result both leases are now classified as capital leases the total addition to our consolidated balance sheets as property plant and equipment relating to the capital leases was 104 million and the balance of the capital lease obligations at december 31 2004 was 103 million see note 18 to the consolidated financial statements 

·   6 million pretax gain amortization related to the early termination of interest rate swaps in 2001 and 2002

·   8 million pretax charge related to early extinguishment of debt

·   4 million pretax gain amortization related to the early termination of interest rate swaps in 2001 and 2002 and

·   3 million aftertax credit for the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle related to changing our pension measurement date

results of operations 

net sales 

net sales of our business segments for the years ended december 31 follows 

   

·   sales of our engine business increased 1869 million or 51 percent 38 percent excluding the change in transfer pricing discussed below under business segment results compared to the prior year primarily due to strong demand from heavy and mediumduty truck oems increased shipments to chrysler of lightduty engines for the dodge ram truck and higher engine shipments to industrial oems engine and part sales to automotive markets were 42 percent higher than 2003 with increased shipments in all market segments except bus applications

·   power generation sales increased 548 million or 41 percent 45 percent excluding the change in transfer pricing discussed below under business segment results compared to the prior year buoyed by strong demand for generator sets and alternators in international markets and continued robust demand for rv and other consumer power generation products

·   sales in the filtration and other business were up 428 million or 41 percent 21 percent excluding the change in transfer pricing discussed below under business segment results compared to the prior year with improvements in most markets but primarily driven by north american oems

·   sales in our international distributor business increased 187 million or 28 percent compared to 2003 with moderate growth in engine parts and service and strong demand for power generation products

·   total sales in 2004 increased approximately 145 million from the consolidation of entities under fin 46r see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements 

sales increased in all of our business segments in 2003 compared to 2002 with a majority of the increase occurring in the second half of the year as economic conditions strengthened and overall demand for our products improved 

·   engine business sales increased 196 million or 6 percent primarily from higher engine sales to daimlerchrysler for the dodge ram truck

·   power generation sales increased 103 million or 8 percent compared to the prior year buoyed by strong fourth quarter demand

·   sales in the filtration and other business exceeded the 1 billion level up 105 million or 11 percent yearoveryear reflecting demand improvement and increased market penetration

·   sales in our international distributor business increased 95 million or 17 percent compared to 2002 primarily from strong sales of engines and parts at our distributorships in australia dubai and south africa

gross margin 

our gross margin was 1680 million in 2004 compared to 1123 million in 2003 with related gross margin percentages of 199 and 178 respectively the majority of the change in yearoveryear gross margin was a result of the following 

·   higher engine shipments particularly to the north american automotive and industrial markets higher sales across our other three businesses 525 million and related absorption benefits on fixed manufacturing costs 125 million

·   increased product coverage costs due to higher volumes 69 million

·   higher material costs for copper and steel net of price realization 53 million

·   supplier inefficiencies resulting from higher volumes including premium freight charges and overtime 40 million

·   the impact of favorable currency exchange rates 18 million and

·   onetime charge for inventory valuation 9 million

approximately 11 percent of the increase in 2004 gross margin was a result of consolidating entities under fin 46r see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements  

product coverage expense as a percent of net sales was 31 percent in 2004 compared to 30 percent in 2003 in the fourth quarter we revised our definition of product coverage expense to include only the cost of base engine warranty and exclude the costs of other marketing and extended warranty programs the majority of which are purchased by customers in our view this definition is a more relevant and preferable measure than previously used and accordingly we have presented base engine warranty expense as a percent of net sales for 2003 and 2002 on a comparable basis 

gross margin increased 78 million in 2003 compared to 2002 on a net sales increase of 443 million and the related gross margin percentages were relatively flat at 178 percent the gross margin on our new emissions compliant engine models was essentially flat compared to the preemission engines as the higher price of the new engine models was offset by incremental costs of new parts and components and higher accrual for product coverage costs the gross margin percentage in 2003 however appears lower as the gross margin dollar amount was measured against a higher sales value due to the pricing action base 

engine warranty expense as a percentage of net sales was essentially flat yearoveryear at 30 percent in 2003 and 31 percent in 2002 

selling and administrative expenses 

selling and administrative expenses were 1015 million or 120 percent of net sales in 2004 compared to 830 million or 132 percent of net sales in 2003 or an increase of 185 million or 22 percent yearoveryear the increase was comprised of 107 million for selling expenses including 25 million from unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates and 78 million for administrative expenses including 9 million from unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates the yearoveryear increase in selling expenses was a result of the following

·   higher compensation and fringe benefits from incremental staffing 15 million and

·   increased consulting expenses primarily sarbanesoxley implementation costs 14 million

fluctuations in foreign exchange rates had an unfavorable impact on 2004 selling and administrative expenses primarily due to changes in the pound sterling 16 million australian dollar 7 million and the euro 5 million approximately 34 million or 18 percent of the increase in selling and administrative expenses resulted from consolidating entities under fin 46r see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements  

in 2003 selling and administrative expenses were 830 million 132 percent of net sales compared to 736 million 126 percent of net sales in 2002 included in the increase was 28 million from the impact of foreign exchange rate changes at our foreign entities of the total increase approximately 56 million was related to selling expenses and 38 million to administrative expenses the increase in selling expense was attributable to the following

restructuring impairment and other charges and credits 

through the end of 2002 we continued a restructuring program initiated in 1998 to improve our cost structure the charges related to this program included staffing reductions and reorganizations in various business segments asset impairment writedowns for manufacturing equipment facility closure and consolidation costs dissolution costs and restructuring actions related to joint venture operations cancellation of a new engine development program and exit costs related to several small business operations 

our 2002 results included a net 8 million credit related to restructuring programs comprised of a net 2 million charge in the second quarter and a 10 million reversal of excess accruals in the fourth quarter the second quarter charge included 16 million for restructuring actions recognized in the quarter offset by a 14 million reversal of excess accruals the excess accruals resulted from realigning or canceling restructuring actions taken in 2001 and 2000 the 16 million second quarter charge included the following

·   2 million related to facility closures and consolidations

the workforce reduction included severance costs and related benefits of terminating approximately 220 salaried and 350 hourly employees and was based on amounts pursuant to established benefit programs or statutory requirements of the affected operations the overall workforce reductions were a result of closing operations and moving production to available capacity the asset impairment charge related to equipment available for disposal the carrying value of the equipment and the effect of suspending depreciation on the equipment were not significant in the fourth quarter of 2002 the number and mix of employees terminated under this program differed from our original estimate and we reversed approximately 1 million of excess accruals for severance costs and benefits approximately 210 salaried and 350 hourly employees were terminated under this plan

interest expense 

interest expense was 113 million in 2004 an increase of 23 million compared to 90 million in 2003 the increase was primarily due to the following

interest expense was 90 million in 2003 compared to 61 million in 2002 most of the increase resulted from the following

other income net was 10 million 18 million and 9 million income in 2004 2003 and 2002 respectively and includes losses on asset sales impairment losses foreign currency exchange interest income royalty income and other miscellaneous income and expense items other income decreased in 2004 compared to 2003 primarily due to losses on the sale of fixed assets and investment writedowns partially offset by higher royalties from increased sales volumes and higher technology income from joint venture partners the major components of other income and expense segregated between operating items and nonoperating items are disclosed in note 20 to the consolidated financial statements 

provision benefit for income taxes 

our income tax provision was 56 million in 2004 compared to a 12 million provision in 2003 and a 38 million income tax benefit in 2002 the higher 2004 tax provision reflects the increase in profit before taxes our effective tax rate is normally below the us corporate income tax rate of 35 percent primarily because of research tax credits and reduced taxes on export earnings our 2004 effective tax rate of 13 percent is unusually low not only because of the normal favorable effects of research credits and export tax benefits but also because of the following nonrecurring benefits

·   as a result of continued earnings improvement and improved economic outlook we reassessed the treatment of 2002 and 2003 foreign tax credits previously recognized as tax deductions and determined they could be used as full tax credits the more favorable treatment of these credits reduced our 2004 income tax provision by 25 million

·   as a result of improved cash flow during 2004 we filed amended us income tax returns to claim additional export tax benefits related to prior years which we had previously forgone to avoid the associated tax payments required on the nonexempt export income of our foreign sales corporation these additional export tax benefits related to prior years reduced our 2004 income tax provision by 11 million

·   the 2004 earnings improvement also caused us to reassess our ability to realize state tax benefits from net operating losses generated in prior years previously we had provided a valuation allowance to reduce the recorded tax value of these loss carryforwards to a lower estimated realizable value our reassessment determined that 16 million of this allowance was no longer needed and was recorded as a reduction of our 2004 income tax expense

·   in conjunction with our reassessment of the realizable value of state tax benefits we also recognized a change in the estimated average state income tax rate used to value our deferred tax assets this rate change reduced our 2004 income tax expense by 9 million

excluding the unusual or nonrecurring benefits described above our 2004 effective tax rate was 27 percent this rate was lower than the 35 percent us tax rate primarily because of export tax benefits and research tax credits generated by 2004 operations we expect our 2005 effective tax rate to be higher than this but still well below 35 percent the american jobs creation act of 2004 phases out the export tax benefits reduced 20 percent for 2005 that have been a key factor in our low tax rate however those benefits are replaced with a new us manufacturer’s tax deduction which phases in beginning in 2005 the jobs act also includes a special oneyear 85 percent deduction for qualifying dividends repatriated from foreign operations generally the special 2005 repatriation rules are only beneficial on very lowtaxed foreign earnings we are reviewing the possible application of the rules to some foreign joint venture repatriations that could potentially reduce our 2005 income tax provision by 5 million to 10 million 

the 2002 income tax benefit included a onetime 57 million favorable tax adjustment credit related to the settlement of us internal revenue service income tax audits for tax years 1994 through 1999 

the amount of income taxes paid in 2004 2003 and 2002 was 87 million 50 million and 30 million respectively note 9 to the consolidated financial statements contains a complete disclosure of our income taxes including a reconciliation of the income tax provision benefit that would be expected using the 35 percent us federal income tax rate to the actual income tax provision benefit recorded 

minority interests in earnings of consolidated subsidiaries 

minority interests in our consolidated operations were 26 million in 2004 compared to 14 million in 2003 and 16 million in 2002 approximately onehalf of the increase in 2004 compared to 2003 resulted from higher earnings at wuxi holset ltd 3 million a 55 percent owned subsidiary and cummins india limited 4 million a 51 percent ownedsubsidiary the remainder of the increase in minority interests is attributable to consolidating the results of four entities under the provisions of fin 46r see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements  the decrease in 2003 compared to 2002 is a result of lower earnings at wuxi holset and cummins india limited partially offset by income from our 60 percentowned subsidiary in brazil cummins powerent comericio e locação ltda 

dividends on preferred securities 

dividends on our preferred securities were 11 million in 2003 and 21 million in 2002 effective july 1 2003 these dividends were prospectively classified as interest expense in our consolidated statements of earnings in accordance with sfas 150 a description of our obligation relating to these preferred securities is provided in note 11 to the consolidated financial statements 

cumulative effect of change in accounting principles 

consolidation of a variable interest entity—2003 

in 2001 we entered into a saleleaseback agreement whereby we sold and leased back heavyduty engine manufacturing equipment from a grantor trust whollyowned by a financial institution in december 2003 the grantor trust which acts as a lessor in the saleleaseback transaction was consolidated 

when we adopted fin 46r under fin 46r the lessor trust was deemed a variable interest entity vie and we were deemed the primary beneficiary of the trust by virtue of our guaranteeing the leased equipment’s residual value accordingly we recorded the cumulative effect of consolidating the vie in our consolidated financial statements as a change in accounting principle as of december 31 2003 with the following impact 

·   reduced earnings 6 million 4 million aftertax or 009 per share which represents the reversal of the original saleleaseback transaction as if it had not occurred and the consolidation of the vie from the inception of the lease and

·   increased property plant and equipment by a net 92 million current carrying value as if it had been depreciated since the beginning of the lease and increased longterm debt other liabilities and minority interests by a net 98 million

our consolidated statement of earnings in 2004 also included interest expense on the lessor’s debt of 7 million and depreciation expense on the equipment of 11 million rather than rent expense the effect of consolidating this vie in 2004 reduced our pretax earnings by approximately 5 million which represents the difference between the sum of interest and depreciation expense recorded in 2004 and rent expense that would have been recorded prior to consolidation see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for a description of the change in accounting and note 18 for a description of the original leasing transaction the consolidation of the vie did not impact 2003 consolidated statements of earnings other than the cumulative effect at december 31 2003 nor did it affect compliance with any of our debt covenants

change in pension measurement date—2002 

during the fourth quarter of 2002 we changed the measurement date for measuring the return on assets invested in our pension plans and the minimum liability for pension plan obligations from september 30 to november 30 this change in measurement date aligns more closely with our fiscal yearend  and we believe provides a more current measurement of plan obligations and investment return on plan assets than previously presented in accordance with gaap we have reported this change in our consolidated statements of earnings as a change in accounting principle the cumulative aftertax effect of the change increased 2002 earnings 3 million or 007 per share and was recorded as of january 1 2002 see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of this accounting change 

business segment results 

we have four reportable business segments engine power generation filtration and other and international distributors this reporting structure is organized according to the products and markets served by each segment and allows management to focus its efforts on providing enhanced service to a wide range of customers we evaluate the performance of each of our business segments based on earnings before interest taxes minority interests and cumulative effect of accounting changes segment ebit and return on average net assets excluding debt taxes and adjustments to the minimum pension liability 

prior to january 1 2004 intersegment transfers between the engine segment and the power generation segment and between the filtration and other segment and the engine segment were recorded at cost and a sale was not recorded by the transferor segment effective january 1 2004 all intersegment sales of the transferor segments were recorded at a marketbased transfer price discounted for certain items unit shipments are now also reflected in the sales volumes of the transferor segments certain intersegment cost allocations to the transferor segments have also been eliminated in addition certain engines manufactured by the engine segment and sold to international distributors through power generation were previously recorded as a sale by power generation however under the new methodology power generation now records a sale commission on such sales we believe this change allows our 

segment management to focus on those pricing decisions and cost structuring actions within their control the impact of this change in methodology to 2004 segment results follows 

·   engine business sales increased 502 million

·   filtration and other business sales increased 205 million

·   power generation sales decreased 44 million and

·   intersegment sales eliminations increased 663 million

the net impact of this change did not have a material effect on segment ebit for any of our segments segment results for 2003 and 2002 were not restated to reflect the change to marketbased transfer pricing as it was impracticable to do so 

engine 

the net sales and segment ebit for the engine business for the years ended december 31 were as follows 

   

net sales for this business increased 1869 million or 51 percent in 2004 compared to 2003 the increase was primarily due to the economic recovery evidenced by strong demand across all market sectors particularly the north american heavyduty and mediumduty truck markets and the lightduty automotive market with record engine sales to daimlerchrysler for the dodge ram truck total automotiverelated engine sales were 67 percent of engine business sales in 2004 compared to 71 percent in 2003 

net sales for this business increased 196 million or 6 percent in 2003 compared to 2002 the increase was primarily due to strong sales of isb engines to daimlerchrysler for the dodge ram truck 

segment ebit increased 271 million in 2004 to almost five times segment ebit in 2003 the yearoveryear improvement was primarily a net result of the following 

·   improved gross margin resulting from higher engine volumes and service part sales and the accompanying benefits of fixed cost absorption at our manufacturing plants along with the consolidation of heavyduty test and assembly operations 458 million

·   increased selling and administrative expenses 96 million and research and engineering expenses 29 million

·   higher product coverage expense from increased sales volumes 59 million

·   steel surcharges 28 million from higher steel prices and

·   premium freight costs 17 million

in addition income from joint ventures increased 34 million compared to 2003 primarily from higher volumes and earnings at our china joint venture dcec and earnings from our north american distributorships 

in 2003 segment ebit increased 21 million or 43 percent compared to 2002 the yearoveryear improvement in earnings was primarily a net result of the following 

·   higher earnings from joint ventures and alliances 41 million resulting from higher sales volumes from dcec and north american distributors

·   increased selling and administrative expenses 38 million resulting from higher pension cost and higher variable compensation as a consequence of earnings improvement

·   higher engine volumes and the accompanying benefits of fixed cost absorption at our manufacturing plants and our consolidation of heavyduty test and assembly operations 20 million and

·   reduced spending for research and development following the launch of our 2002 emissionscompliant engines 7 million

a summary and discussion of engine business net sales by market for the years ended december 31 follows

heavyduty truck 

sales to the heavyduty truck market increased significantly in 2004 up 641 million or 58 percent compared to 2003 the increase resulted from strong demand in the north american truck industry driven primarily by economic growth and related increase in freight tonnage and higher replacement demand for trucks unit shipments of heavyduty truck engines were up 84 percent in 2004 compared to 2003 with north american shipments up 97 percent and international shipments up 26 percent 

in 2003 sales to the heavyduty truck market increased 31 million or 3 percent compared to 2002 sales the increase was primarily attributable to a modest recovery in the north american truck industry evidenced by strong demand at the end of the year as fourth quarter sales increased 15 percent compared to the previous quarter unit shipments of heavyduty truck engines declined 14 percent in 2003 compared 2002 the decline was a result of significant prebuy activity prior to the north american october 1 2002 epa emissions standards the volume decline in 2003 unit shipments was more than offset by higher unit pricing for our new isx and ism emissions compliant engines and higher part sales 

mediumduty truck and bus 

mediumduty truck and bus revenues increased 213 million or 38 percent in 2004 compared to 2003 shipments of mediumduty truck engines were up 93 percent to north american oems and up 36 percent to international oems compared to 2003 the increase in mediumduty truck engine shipments was driven primarily by economic growth as demand in this market typically correlates with demand in the heavyduty market worldwide shipments of bus engines were down 10 percent in 2004 compared to 2003 most of the decline occurred in international markets with some demand recovery in china where volumes were up compared to 2003 however lower sales to india and europecis more than offset the increase 

in 2003 mediumduty truck and bus revenues declined 39 million or 7 percent compared to 2002 the majority of the decrease resulted from declining bus engine sales as engine sales for mediumduty trucks were essentially flat compared to 2002 worldwide bus engine sales declined 37 percent in 2003 and unit shipments were down 39 percent primarily in north america due to declining market share from a major bus oem and also lower engine sales to china where sales were replaced by sales from one of our joint ventures in china 

lightduty automotive 

sales of lightduty automotive engines increased 241 million or 26 percent in 2004 compared to 2003 total unit shipments were 178000 in 2004 an increase of 18 percent compared to 2003 most of the increase in lightduty automotive sales was driven by strong demand from daimlerchrysler for dodge ram truck engines with record shipments of 154300 units or a 20 percent increase compared to 2003 engine shipments to recreational vehicle oems decreased slightly down 3 percent in 2004 compared to 2003 partially as a result of higher shipments in 2003 in advance of new product introductions and slightly lower market share in 2004 

in 2003 sales from our lightduty automotive engines increased 154 million or 20 percent compared to 2002 total unit shipments in 2003 were 150300 an increase of 21 percent compared to the prior year engine shipments to daimlerchrysler for the dodge ram truck set a record in 2003 increasing 28 percent compared to the prior year primarily driven by increased demand and market share improvement unit shipments of mediumduty engines to the recreational vehicle market declined 13 percent yearoveryear reflecting a prebuy of engine models in 2002 prior to the new emissions standards 

industrial 

total industrial sales to the construction agricultural mining marine government oil and gas and rail markets increased 252 million or 24 percent in 2004 compared to 2003 unit shipments increased 26 percent yearoveryear reflecting a slight change in sales mix to lowerpriced engines approximately 42 percent of the shipments were to north american markets and 58 percent to international markets compared to 39 percent and 61 percent respectively in 2003 overall growth in industrial markets was driven by strong demand in 2004 as the capital goods sector of the economy experienced a significant recovery the yearoveryear increase in sales resulted primarily from the following 

·   engine sales to the construction market increased 25 percent yearoveryear with shipments to north american oems up 41 percent and shipments to international oems up 20 percent

in 2003 total industrial sales increased 50 million or 5 percent compared to 2002 while shipments were down 2 percent yearoveryear reflecting a change in sales mix to higherpriced engines the yearoveryear increase was attributable to the following 

·   sales to construction equipment oems increased 9 percent in 2003 compared to 2002 with shipments to north american oems down 10 percent and shipments to international oems up 9 percent

·   total 2003 engine shipments to the agricultural equipment market increased 9 percent compared to 2002 with a 32 percent increase to international oems due to strong demand in latin america

·   engine shipments to mining equipment oems primarily k and q series highhorsepower engines were down 6 percent to oems in north america but were more than offset by a 44 percent increase from international oems primarily due to market share gain

·   engine shipments to the marine market declined 20 percent in 2003 compared to 2002 partially as a result of our new joint venture with brunswick corporation cummins mercruiser diesel marine llc which records sales of our midrange and heavyduty engines for recreational marine applications

·   engine sales to government markets increased 59 percent in 2003

·   engine shipments to the recently entered oil and gas equipment market were up significantly in 2003 primarily from market share gains in north america and

·   shipments of engines to railcar builders declined 30 percent in 2003 as a result of weak demand

stationary power 

engine business sales to stationary power markets were 522 million in 2004 this new sales category arose from a change in 2004 where all intersegment engine sales from the engine business to the power generation business are recorded at a marketbased transfer price prior to 2004 intersegment transfers were recorded at cost and a sale was not recorded by the engine business segment financial results for 2003 and 2002 were not restated to reflect this change as it was impracticable to do so 

power generation 

the net sales and segment ebit for power generation for the years ended december 31 were as follows 

   

net sales for this business increased 548 million or 41 percent compared to 2003 excludes 44 million attributable to the change in intersegment transfer pricing a majority of the sales increase was driven by improved economic conditions in the commercial consumer and alternator product markets as follows

segment ebit in 2004 was 84 million slightly below segment ebit in 2003 while higher filtration sales and increased volumes at holset contributed an incremental 40 million to gross margin yearoveryear gross margin percentage declined in 2004 compared to 2003 the lower gross margin percentage resulted from the following 

·   higher steel prices used in manufacturing filters and exhaust products 17 million net of 7 million price recovery and

·   production inefficiencies from capacity constraints 21 million

in addition higher selling and administrative expenses 30 million and increases in research and engineering expenses 16 million reduced segment ebit in 2004 compared to 2003 and were partially offset by higher earnings at joint ventures 2 million and other income 2 million 

segment ebit declined 8 million or 9 percent compared to 2002 earnings were lower in 2003 primarily from 

·   higher selling and administrative expenses 19 million from funding growth initiatives increased logistics and higher employee benefit costs including pensions

liquidity and capital resources 

overview of capital structure 

cash provided by continuing operations is a major source of funding our working capital requirements at certain times cash provided by operations is subject to seasonal fluctuations and as a result we use periodic borrowings primarily our accounts receivable sales program and our revolving credit facility to fund our working capital requirements as of december 31 2004 there were no amounts outstanding under our receivable sales program or our revolving credit facility 

in the fourth quarter of 2000 we entered into a receivable securitization program that provided a costeffective method to fund our trade accounts receivable this program diversified our funding base and provided a flexible source of funding that was not reported on our balance sheet in december 2003 this program expired and there were no amounts outstanding under the program at that time in january 2004 we entered into a similar type of program with a different financial institution a more complete description of this program which discloses certain cash flows related to the program is found below under the caption “off balance sheet financing—sale of accounts receivable” and in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements  we also have various short and longterm credit arrangements available which are also discussed below and disclosed in note 11 to the consolidated financial statements  

we believe cash generated from operations our credit facility arrangements and our accounts receivable program provide us with the financial flexibility required to satisfy future shortterm funding requirements for working capital debt service obligations capital spending and projected pension funding on march 1 2005 we repaid our 645 notes with principal amount of 225 million from cash and cash equivalents at december 31 2004 we believe our liquidity is adequate with cash and cash equivalents of 611 million 530 million available under our new revolving credit facility and 175 million available under our accounts receivable program see the table below under available credit capacity 

our total debt including convertible subordinated debentures was 1645 million as of december 31 2004 compared to 1429 million at december 31 2003 total debt including our convertible subordinated debentures as a percent of our total capital including total longterm debt was 540 percent at december 31 2004 compared to 601 percent at december 31 2003 included in longterm debt at december 31 2004 and 2003 was 81 million and 90 million respectively attributable to consolidating a leasing entity under the provisions of fin 46r see notes 2 and 11 to the consolidated financial statements  also included in shortterm and longterm debt at december 31 2004 was 132 million from the consolidation of four joint ventures previously reported under the equity method of accounting and now consolidated under the provisions of fin 46r see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements  the consolidation of these entities did not materially impact our 2004 net earnings nor did it affect compliance with any of our debt covenants we do not expect the consolidation of these entities to have a material impact on net earnings or affect our compliance with debt covenants in future periods 

restructuring actions 

during the period 20002002 we recorded significant charges to restructure our operations largely focused in our engine business these actions and the resulting charges were primarily taken in response to the downturn in the north american trucking industry and related conditions and included workforce reductions asset impairment losses termination of a new engine development program and other charges total net cash outflows associated with these actions approximated 91 million including 25 million in 2002 and 2 million in 2003 the associated annual savings from these restructuring actions were estimated at 97 million certain of these restructuring actions are also described above and in note 19 to the consolidated financial statements  all of the restructuring actions were completed as of december 31 2003 

available credit capacity 

the table below provides the components of available credit capacity as of december 31 

 

1   our previous accounts receivable program expired in december 2003 and in january 2004 we entered into a new threeyear agreement for a similar program with a different financial institution see discussion below under the caption “sale of accounts receivable”

cash flows 

cash and cash equivalents increased 503 million during 2004 and were 611 million at the end of the year compared to 108 million at the beginning of the year cash and cash equivalents were higher in 2004 as a result of an increase in cash provided by operations generated primarily by higher net earnings 

the following table summarizes the key elements of our cash flows for the years ended december 31 

   

operating activities net cash provided by operating activities improved 456 million in 2004 compared to 2003 primarily due to higher net earnings 300 million increase in noncash adjustments for depreciation and amortization expense 49 million and pension expense 28 million net changes in working capital also provided 80 million in cash during 2004 compared to a 5 million use in 2003 or a net increase in cash provided by working capital of 85 million yearoveryear the increase was a result of increases in accounts payable 110 million and accrued expenses 214 million partially offset by increases in accounts receivable 99 million and inventories 141 million accounts payable and inventory were higher in 2004 primarily from higher production levels necessary to meet increased demand and from the effects of consolidating entities under fin 46r 70 million and 73 million respectively accounts receivable increased due to higher sales levels and the impact of fin 46r 72 million and accrued expenses increased primarily from payroll and variable compensation accruals 87 million pension liability 22 million and the impact of fin 46r 44 million

investing activities net cash used in investing activities increased 54 million in 2004 compared to 2003 the increase was due to higher capital expenditures 40 million increased investment in and advances to equity investees 15 million acquisition of a business 18 million for purchase of a distributorship partially offset by cash inflows from net liquidations of marketable securities 22 million

the majority of our capital spending in 2004 included equipment for new product support and capacity expansion in our engine and filtration and other segments our 2005 capital spending program is 

expected to be in the range of 220 million to 240 million primarily for increased capacity and funding investment in manufacturing equipment and tooling for new products 

financing activities net cash provided by financing activities was 74 million in 2004 compared to a net cash outlflow of 145 million in 2003 or a net change in cash inflows of 219 million yearoveryear most of the change occurred from a significant cash outflow in march 2003 from the payment of our 125 million 625 notes and significant cash inflows in 2004 from the proceeds of common stock issued from the exercise of a large number of stock options 148 million

cash requirements 

a summary of payments due for our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december 31 2004 is shown in the tables below 

 

1   pension funding obligations are included only for 2005 as the amount of our funding obligations beyond the next year are not yet determinable

   

financial covenants and credit rating 

a number of our contractual obligations and financing agreements such as our revolving credit facility and our equipment saleleaseback agreement have restrictive covenants andor pricing modifications that may be triggered in the event of downward revisions to our corporate credit rating our credit rating is determined by independent credit rating agencies and includes an annual assessment of the creditworthiness of our debt securities and other obligations it is intended to measure the probability of timely repayment of principal and interest of our notes and shortterm debt generally a higher credit rating leads to a more favorable effect on the marketability and pricing of our debt instruments in the capital markets a credit rating of baa3 or higher by moody’s or a rating of bbb or higher by standard  poor’s two of the major credit rating agencies is considered investment grade currently the corporate credit rating of our debt securities is below investment grade 

  

any rating can be revised upward or downward or withdrawn at any time by a rating agency if it decides the circumstances warrant that change and there can be no assurance that our debt ratings will not be lowered further or withdrawn by a rating agency any future lowering of our credit ratings could further increase the cost of our financing agreements and arrangements and may have a negative impact on our ability to access the capital markets or borrow funds at current rates 

our current rating and ratings outlook from each of the credit rating agencies is shown in the table below and remain unchanged from the prior year except each agency updated its ratings outlook from negative to stable in 2004 each rating should be viewed independently of any other rating 

   

we do not believe a further downgrade of our credit rating will have a material impact on our financial results financial condition or access to sufficient liquidity however one of our corporate goals is to regain an investment grade credit rating from the rating agencies to achieve this goal we have placed significant management focus on earnings improvement increased cash flow and debt reduction the impact of credit ratings on our financing arrangements is discussed below 

new revolving credit facility 

in december 2004 we entered into a new revolving credit facility the new facility replaced our previous 385 million revolving credit facility that was scheduled to expire in november 2005 deferred debt issue costs related to the previous facility were expensed in the fourth quarter and were not material the new facility provides for aggregate unsecured borrowings up to 650 million and is available on a revolving basis for a period of five years borrowings are primarily available in us dollars although up to 60 million of the facility is available for multicurrency borrowings and letters of credit up to 200 million is available for total letters of credit and up to 50 million is available for swingline loans a number of our subsidiaries are permitted to borrow and obtain letters of credit under the facility although aggregate borrowings and letters of credit for our subsidiaries may not exceed 60 million 

subsidiary borrowings under the facility are guaranteed by us and the borrowing subsidiary certain of those guarantees are limited by the terms of our existing public indenture which governs a number of our outstanding notes and debentures the indenture restricts the ability of our subsidiaries to incur or guarantee indebtedness and their ability is also limited by similar terms in the indenture governing our 250 million senior notes 

at our option borrowings under the revolving credit facility bear interest at a rate equal to the following 

·   the london interbank offered rate libor plus a spread ranging from 10 percent to 20 percent based on our credit rating or

·   the alternate base rate rate or abr which is the greater of the administrative agent’s prime rate and the federal funds effective rate plus 05 percent plus a spread ranging from 0 percent to 10 percent based on our credit rating and utilization of the credit facility

in addition we are required to pay quarterly fees on unused commitments under the new revolving credit facility which are based on our credit rating and also an annual administration fee to the administrative agent for the facility 

the terms of the revolving credit facility contain covenants that restrict our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to among other things incur liens enter into sale and leaseback transactions enter into merger agreements consolidation or asset sale transactions dispose of capital stock of subsidiaries incur subsidiary indebtedness and enter into speculative swap transactions the revolving credit facility also restricts our ability to under the terms of our existing public indenture redesignate “unrestricted subsidiaries” as “restricted subsidiaries” or designate future subsidiaries as “restricted subsidiaries” the revolving credit facility also includes the following financial covenants which are measured quarterly 

·   the ratio of 1 the sum of our consolidated indebtedness and our securitization financings to 2 the sum of our consolidated ebitda for any period of four consecutive quarters may not exceed 325 to 10 for the periods prior to december 31 2006 and may not exceed 30 to 10 for the periods thereafter and

·   the ratio of 1 our consolidated ebitda minus capital expenditures to 2 our consolidated interest expense for any period of four consecutive quarters may not be less than 150 to 10

for purposes of the financial covenants described above “consolidated indebtedness” “consolidated ebitda” “consolidated interest expense” “securitization financings” “capital expenditures” and other financial measurements are calculated and defined by the terms of the revolving credit facility agreement 

legal and bank facility fees of 36 million related to this agreement were capitalized as deferred debt costs and will be amortized over the five year life of the facility as of december 31 2004 we had 118 million of letters of credit outstanding against this facility no borrowings and we were in compliance with all of the covenants of the agreement 

off balance sheet financing 

sale of accounts receivable 

in january 2004 we entered into a new three year facility agreement with a financial institution to sell a designated pool of trade receivables to cummins trade receivables llc ctr a whollyowned special purpose subsidiary as necessary ctr may transfer a direct interest in its receivables without recourse to the financial institution to maintain a balance in the designated pools of receivables sold we sell new receivables to ctr as existing receivables are collected receivables sold to ctr in which an interest is not transferred to the financial institution are included in “receivables net” on our consolidated balance sheets  the maximum interest in sold receivables that can be outstanding at any point in time is limited to the lesser of 200 million or the amount of eligible receivables held by ctr there are no provisions in this agreement that require us to maintain a minimum investment credit rating however the terms of the agreement contain the same financial covenants as those described above under our revolving credit facility the interest in receivables sold under this program to the financial institution in 2004 was not significant and as of december 31 2004 there were no amounts outstanding under this program 

under our old program which expired on december 15 2003 we had an agreement with a different financial institution where we sold a designated pool of trade receivables to cummins receivable corporation crc a special purpose subsidiary under this program crc transferred an interest in its receivables without recourse to limited purpose receivable securitization companies conduits that were established and maintained by an independent financial institution the conduits would then fund their purchases by issuing commercial paper 

no accounts receivable sold to either subsidiary were written off during 2004 2003 or 2002 the weighted average interest rate on securitized repayments during 2004 2003 and 2002 was 26 percent 12 percent and 18 percent respectively the sold receivables servicing portfolio which is included in 

receivables at december 31 and the proceeds from the sale of receivables and other related cash flows are disclosed in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements 

saleleaseback transactions 

in 2001 we entered into a saleleaseback agreement with a variable interest entity vie whereby we sold certain manufacturing equipment and leased it back under an operating lease as a result of the moody’s downgrade in april 2002 and a standard  poor’s downgrade in october 2002 we were required under the lease agreement to obtain irrevocable unconditional standby letters of credit in an amount of 69 million the letters of credit were posted to the benefit of the equipment lessor and lenders and will remain in effect until we achieve and maintain a minimum investment grade credit rating for 12 consecutive months the saleleaseback transaction is described in note 18 to the consolidated financial statements  

in december 2003 the grantor trust which acts as a lessor in the sale and lease back transaction discussed above was consolidated due to the adoption of fin 46r the impact of adopting fin 46r and a description of the entities consolidated under fin 46r are described in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements as a result of the consolidation the manufacturing equipment and the present value of the minimum lease payments were included in our consolidated balance sheets as property plant and equipment and longterm debt respectively in addition our consolidated statements of earnings includes interest expense on the lessor’s debt obligations and depreciation expense on the manufacturing equipment rather than rent expense under the lease agreement the cumulative effect of this transaction was recorded as a change in accounting principle effective december 31 2003 and reduced net earnings by 6 million before related tax benefits of 2 million the amount of interest expense and depreciation expense was 7 million and 11 million in 2004 respectively the consolidation of the vie did not impact our credit rating or compliance with our debt covenants 

powerrent business 

in 1999 our power generation business entered into an ongoing leasing program in which it built and sold power generation equipment to a financial institution and leased the equipment and related components back under a threemonth noncancelable lease arrangement with subsequent renewals on a monthly basis up to a maximum of 36 months the equipment was sold at cost and pursuant to lease accounting rules the excess of the fair value of the equipment sold over its cost was recognized as prepaid rent and reflected the normal profit margin that would have been realized at the time of sale the margins on the equipment sales were deferred and the leases recorded as operating leases the prepaid rent was amortized ratably over the accounting lease term upon termination of the leases through a sale of the equipment to a third party the previously deferred margins on the sale to the financial institution were recorded as income we sublease the equipment to customers under shortterm rental agreements with terms that vary based upon customer and geographic region in june 2004 the master lease agreement associated with this arrangement was amended to allow deployment of the equipment in countries other than the us the amendment required us to retain full residual risk on the equipment’s value at the end of the noncancelable lease term as a result of this amendment the leases under this program were classified as capital leases at the end of the noncancelable lease term we may either 1 extend the lease term for an additional period 2 repurchase the equipment at the current guaranteed value or 3 arrange for a sale of the equipment to a third party and pay the difference between the guaranteed value and the proceeds recovered from the sale 

during 2002 and 2003 we entered into new leases for portions of the equipment with a different lessor 29 million and 34 million respectively the new leases had a minimum twoyear noncancelable lease term with monthly renewal options for the 2002 transaction and four sixmonth renewal options for the 2003 transaction the deferred margin associated with the equipment that transferred to the new lessor 

remained unchanged as there was not an ultimate sale to a third party in december 2004 the master lease agreement associated with these leases was also amended to allow deployment of the equipment in countries outside the us this amendment required us to repurchase the equipment at the end of the twoyear noncancelable lease terms and as a result the leases were classified as capital leases 

the financial impact of amending these leasing arrangements which represent the substantial majority of the equipment under lease in our powerrent program resulted in an increase in our capital lease obligations by the present value of 1 the remaining minimum lease payments plus 2 any guaranteed residual or repurchase obligation at the time of amendment in addition we increased the amount of our property plant and equipment by this same amount reduced for the remaining deferred gains associated with the original saleleaseback of the units discussed above the equipment will be depreciated over its expected remaining useful life the total increase in our property plant and equipment at the time the leases were amended was 104 million the balance of the capital lease obligations related to these programs at december 31 2004 was 103 million 

future lease payments including repurchase obligations under each lease are included in note 18 to the consolidated financial statements  we do not expect the reclassification of the leases to have a material impact on net earnings or affect compliance with any of our debt covenants 

financing arrangements for related parties 

in accordance with the provisions of various joint venture agreements we may purchase products and components from the joint ventures sell products and components to the joint ventures and the joint ventures may sell products and components to unrelated parties the transfer price of products purchased from the joint ventures may differ from normal selling prices certain joint venture agreements transfer product to us at cost some transfer product to us on a costplus basis and other agreements provide for the transfer of products at market value 

we purchase significant quantities of midrange diesel and natural gas engines components and service parts from consolidated diesel company cdc a general partnership that was formed in 1980 with j i case case to jointly fund engine development and manufacturing capacity cummins and case now cnh global nv are general partners and each partner shares 50 percent ownership in cdc under the terms of the agreement cdc is obligated to make its entire production of diesel engines and related products available solely to the partners each partner is entitled to purchase up to onehalf of cdc’s actual production and a partner may purchase in excess of onehalf of actual production to the extent productive capacity is available beyond the other partner’s purchase requirement the partners are each obligated unconditionally and severally to purchase annually at least one engine or engine kit produced by cdc provided a minimum of one engine or engine kit is produced the transfer price of cdc’s engines to the partners must be sufficient to cover its manufacturing cost in such annual accounting period including interest and financing expenses but excluding depreciation expense other than scheduled depreciation expense as defined in the agreement in addition each partner is obligated to contribute onehalf of the capital investment required to maintain plant capacity and each partner has the right to invest unilaterally in plant capacity which additional capacity is available to the other partner for a fee to date neither partner has made a unilateral investment in plant capacity at cdc 

we are not a guarantor of any of cdc’s obligations or commitments however we are required as a partner to provide up to 50 percent of cdc’s base working capital as defined by the agreement the amount of base working capital is calculated each quarter and if supplemental funding greater than the base working capital amount is required the amount is funded through third party financing arranged by cdc or we may elect to fund the requirement although we are under no obligation to do so to date when supplemental funding is required above the base working capital amount we have elected to provide that funding to cdc if the amount of supplemental funding required is less than the base working capital 

amount it is funded equally by the partners excess cash generated by cdc is remitted to cummins until cdc’s working capital amount is reduced to the base working capital amount any further cash remittances from cdc to the partners are shared equally by the partners 

in the first quarter of 2004 we adopted certain provisions of fin 46r under the provisions of fin 46r cdc and another engine manufacturing entity jointly owned and operated by us were considered vie’s and we were deemed the primary beneficiary of these vies by virtue of our pricing arrangements with them and substantial product purchases from them as a result we consolidated the assets and liabilities of cdc and the other engine manufacturer as of march 28 2004 previously these joint ventures were accounted for under the equity method of accounting and included in our consolidated balance sheets as “investments in and advances to equity investees” first quarter results for these entities were recorded as “equity royalty and other income from investees” in our consolidated statements of earnings and results for the rest of the year were consolidated in our consolidated statements of earnings for a further discussion of the impact of adopting fin 46r see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements 

financing arrangements and guarantees of distributors residual value guarantees and other guarantees and indemnifications 

u s distributors 

since 1997 we have had an operating agreement with a financial institution that requires us to guarantee revolving loans equipment term loans and leases real property loans and letters of credit made by the financial institution to certain independent cummins and onan distributors in the united states and to certain distributors in which we own an equity interest the agreement has been amended supplemented or otherwise modified several times since 1997 and in the third quarter of 2004 we amended restated and simplified the terms of the operating agreement 

under the amended and restated terms our guarantee of any particular distributor financing is limited to the amount of the financing in excess of the distributor’s “borrowing base” the “borrowing base” is equal to the amount the distributor could borrow from the financial institution without a cummins guarantee furthermore if any distributor defaults under its financing arrangement with the financial institution and the maturity of amounts owed under the agreement is accelerated then we are required to purchase from the financial institution at amounts approximating fair market value certain property inventory and rental power generation equipment manufactured by cummins that are secured by the distributor’s financing agreement 

the operating agreement will continue in effect until february 7 2007 and may be renewed for additional oneyear terms as of december 31 2004 we had 10 million of guarantees outstanding under the operating agreement relating to distributor borrowings of 122 million 

residual value guarantees—leased equipment 

as more fully discussed in note 13 to the consolidated financial statements  we have various residual value guarantees on equipment leased under operating leases the amount of those guarantees at december 31 2004 was 11 million 

other guarantees 

in addition to the guarantees discussed above from time to time we enter into other guarantee arrangements including nonnorth american distributor financing guarantees of third party debt and other miscellaneous guarantees the maximum potential loss related to these guarantees was 21 million at december 31 2004 

we also have arrangements with certain suppliers that require us to purchase minimum volumes or be subject to monetary penalties the penalty amounts are less than our purchase commitments and essentially allow the supplier to recover their tooling costs if we were to discontinue purchasing from these suppliers as of december 31 2004 the penalties would approximate 37 million however we do not anticipate paying any supplier penalties under these arrangements based on our current forecast of purchasing volumes 

indemnifications 

periodically we enter into various contractual arrangements where we agree to indemnify a third party against certain types of losses including the following 

·   product liability and license patent or trademark indemnifications as discussed in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements 

·   asset sale agreements where we agree to indemnify the purchaser against future environmental exposures related to the sold asset and

·   any contractual agreement where we agree to indemnify the counterparty for losses suffered as a result of a misrepresentation in the contract

we regularly evaluate the probability of having to incur costs associated with these indemnifications and accrue for expected losses that are probable because the indemnifications are not related to specific known liabilities and due to their uncertain nature we are unable to estimate the maximum amount of the potential loss associated with these indemnifications 

application of critical accounting estimates 

a summary of our significant accounting policies is included in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements of this annual report we believe the application of our accounting policies on a consistent basis enables us to provide financial statement users with useful reliable and timely information about our earnings results financial position and cash flows 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap that often require management to make judgments estimates and assumptions regarding uncertainties that affect the reported amounts presented and disclosed in the financial statements our management reviews these estimates and assumptions based on historical experience changes in business conditions and other relevant factors they believe to be reasonable under the circumstances in any given reporting period our actual results may differ from the estimates and assumptions used in preparing our consolidated financial statements 

critical accounting estimates are defined as follows the estimate requires management to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the estimate was made different estimates reasonably could have been used or if changes in the estimate are reasonably likely to occur from period to period and the change would have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations our senior management has discussed the development and selection of our accounting policies related accounting estimates and the disclosures set forth below with the audit committee of our board of directors we believe our critical accounting estimates include those addressing the estimation of liabilities for product coverage programs accounting for income taxes pension benefits and annual assessment of recoverability of goodwill 

product coverage programs 

we estimate and record a liability for product coverage programs primarily base warranty other than product recalls at the time our products are sold our estimates are based on historical experience and reflect management’s best estimates of expected costs at the time products are sold and subsequent adjustment to those expected costs when actual costs differ as a result of the uncertainty surrounding the nature and frequency of product recall programs the liability for such programs is recorded when we commit to a recall action which generally occurs when it is announced our warranty liability is generally affected by component failure rates repair costs and the time of failure future events and circumstances related to these factors could materially change our estimates and require adjustments to our liability new product launches require a greater use of judgment in developing estimates until historical experience becomes available product specific experience is typically available four or five quarters after product launch with a clear experience trend evident eight quarters after launch we generally record product coverage expense for new products upon shipment using a factor based upon historical experience only in the first year a blend of actual product and historical experience in the second year and product specific experience thereafter note 1 to the consolidated financial statements contains a summary of the activity in our product coverage liability account for 2004 2003 and 2002 including adjustments to preexisting warranties 

accounting for income taxes 

we determine our provision for income taxes using the asset and liability method under this method deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax effects of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases future tax benefits of tax loss and credit carryforwards are also recognized as deferred tax assets we evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets each quarter by assessing the likelihood of future profitability and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize our net deferred tax assets at december 31 2004 the company has recorded net deferred tax assets of  960 million these assets include 248 million for the value of tax loss and credit carryforwards that generally have a limited life and begin expiring in 2012 the ultimate realization of our net deferred tax assets will require a sustained level of profitability having assessed the future profit plans and tax planning strategies together with the years of expiration of carryforward benefits a valuation allowance of 39 million has been recorded to reduce the tax assets to the net value management believes is more likely than not to be realized should the company’s operating performance deteriorate future assessments could conclude that a larger valuation allowance will be needed to further reduce the deferred tax assets factors that may affect our ability to sustain profitability include but are not limited to a decline in sales or gross margin loss of market share increased competition and existing and future regulatory emissions standards in addition we operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and are subject to tax audits in these jurisdictions these audits can involve complex issues which may require an extended period of time to resolve however we believe we have made adequate provision for income taxes for all years that are subject to audit a more complete description of our income taxes and the future benefits of our tax loss and credit carryforwards is disclosed in note 9 to the consolidated financial statements 

pension benefits 

we sponsor a number of pension plans in the us the uk and various other countries in the us and the uk we have several major defined benefit plans that are separately funded we account for our pension programs in accordance with sfas 87 “employers’ accounting for pensions” which requires that amounts recognized in financial statements be determined using an actuarial basis as a result our pension benefit programs are based on a number of statistical and judgmental assumptions that attempt to anticipate future events and are used in calculating the expense and liability related to our plans these 

assumptions include discount rates used to value liabilities assumed rates of return on plan assets future compensation increases employee turnover rates actuarial assumptions relating to retirement age mortality rates and participant withdrawals the actuarial assumptions we use may differ significantly from actual results due to changing economic conditions participant life span and withdrawal rates these differences may result in a material impact to the amount of net periodic pension expense to be recorded in our consolidated financial statements in the future  

the expected longterm return on plan assets is used in calculating the net periodic pension expense the differences between the actual return on plan assets and expected longterm return on plan assets are recognized in the asset value used to calculate net periodic expense over five years the expected rate of return on us pension plan assets used to develop our pension expense was 85 85 and 100 for the years ended december 31 2004 2003 and 2002 the expected rate of return on nonus pension plan assets was 808 844 and 853 in 2005 we plan to use an expected rate of return of 85 for us pension plan assets and 75  for nonus pension plan assets a lower rate of return will increase our net periodic pension expense and reduce profitability 

our net periodic pension expense was 89 million in 2004 61 million in 2003 and 21 million in 2002 our net periodic pension expense is expected to be in a range of 105 million to 115 million in 2005 another key assumption used in the development of the net periodic pension expense is the discount rate the discount rate used to develop our net periodic pension expense in the us was 625 70 and 725 for the years ended december 31 2004 2003 and 2002 the discount rate for our nonus pension expense was 566 591 and 634 we will use 575 and 532 for us and nonus pension expense in 2005 changes in the discount rate assumptions will impact the interest cost component of the net periodic pension expense calculation and due to the fact that the accumulated benefit obligation abo is calculated on a present value basis changes in the discount rate assumption will impact the current abo an increase in the abo caused by a decrease in the discount rate may result in additional voluntary contributions to a pension plan as our funding strategy is to fund the plan approximately 90 on an abo basis in the us 

the table below sets forth the estimated impact on our 2005 net periodic pension expense relative to a change in the discount rate and a change in the expected rate of return on plan assets 

   

the above sensitivities reflect the impact of changing one assumption at a time it should be noted that economic factors and conditions often affect multiple assumptions simultaneously and the effects of changes in key assumptions are not necessarily linear 

the methodology used to determine the expected rate of return on the pension plan assets in the us was based on a combination of two studies performed by independent consultants the methodology used to determine the rate of return on pension plan assets in the uk was based on establishing an equityrisk premium over current longterm bond yields adjusted based on target asset allocations our strategy with respect to our investments in pension plan assets is to be invested with a longterm outlook therefore the 

risk and return balance of our asset portfolio should reflect a longterm horizon our pension plan asset allocation at december 31 2004 2003 and target allocation for 2005 are as follows 

   

actual cash funding for our pension plans is governed by employee benefit and tax laws and the job creation and worker assistance act of 2002 this act included temporary rules allowing companies to use for funding purposes discount rates for 2002 and 2003 equal to 120 percent of the weighted average 30year us treasury bond yield during 2004 and 2003 we made cash contributions to our pension plans of 135 million and 118 million respectively and we expect to make cash contributions of approximately 135 million in 2005 

note 12 to the consolidated financial statements provides a summary of our pension benefit plan activity the funded status of our plans and the amounts recognized in our consolidated financial statements  

annual assessment for recoverability of goodwill 

under the provisions of sfas 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” the carrying value of assets acquired including goodwill is reviewed annually during the 2004 review the fair value of the reporting units to which the assets including goodwill were assigned was carried forward from the previous year in compliance with certain criteria set forth in sfas 142 except for the goodwill resulting from the consolidation of vies the fair value of each reporting unit was estimated by discounting the future cash flows before interest less requirements for working capital and fixed asset additions our valuation method requires us to make projections of revenue operating expenses working capital investment and fixed asset additions for the reporting units over a multiyear period additionally management must estimate its weighted average cost of capital for each reporting unit for use as a discount rate the discounted cash flows are compared to the carrying value of the reporting unit and if less than the carrying value a separate valuation of the goodwill is required to determine if an impairment loss has occurred as of the end of the third quarter in 2004 we performed the annual impairment assessment required by sfas 142 and determined that our goodwill was not impaired at december 31 2004 our recorded goodwill was 355 million changes in our projections or estimates a deterioration of our operating results and the related cash flow effect or a significant increase in the discount rate could decrease the estimated fair value of our reporting units and result in a future impairment of goodwill 

recently adopted accounting pronouncements 

in january 2003 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no 46 “consolidation of variable interest entities fin 46” an interpretation of accounting research bulletin no 51 “consolidated financial statements” in december 2003 the fasb issued a revised version of fin 46 fin 46r we adopted the provisions of fin 46r in december 2003 for certain entities previously considered to be special purpose entities spes under gaap and for new entities created on or after february 1 2003 the remaining provisions of fin 46r were adopted as of march 28 2004 resulting in the consolidation of three joint ventures previously accounted for under the equity method in 

the second quarter ended june 27 2004 we consolidated another entity under the provisions of fin 46r see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for the impact of fin 46r 

in may 2004 the fasb issued fasb staff position no 1062  “accounting and disclosure requirements related to the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of 2003” fsp 1062 in response to a new law that provides a federal subsidy for prescription drug benefits under medicare to certain sponsors of retiree health care benefit plans this fsp requires the effects of the subsidy and expected changes in plan participation be accounted for currently as an actuarial experience gain to be recognized over the average remaining service lives of plan participants and allows several implementation alternatives we determined the effects of the medicare act were not material to our consolidated financial statements and therefore the adoption of fsp 1062 did not require us to remeasure our liability or expense for postretirement benefits at an interim date rather the effects of the medicare act were included in the determination of our annual postretirement plan liability in november 2004 

a small grandfathered portion of our retiree population qualifies for the medicare subsidy under our current retiree health care plans the subsidy lowered our accumulated postretirement benefit obligation apbo by approximately 4 percent the participation in our plans could decrease if participants elect the medicare coverage we have modeled the sensitivity of our apbo to reflect participation changes if 10 percent of our retiree population left our plan and enrolled in medicare our apbo would be reduced an additional 3 percent the net impact of the subsidy and a 10 percent hypothetical decline in population would not have been material to our 2004 expense 

in december 2004 the fasb issued fasb staff position no 1092 “accounting and disclosure guidance for the foreign earnings repatriation provision within the american jobs creation act of 2004” the american jobs creation act the act was signed into law by president bush in october 2004 the act includes a special oneyear 85 percent deduction for qualifying dividends repatriated from foreign operations generally the special 2005 repatriation rules are only beneficial on very lowtaxed foreign earnings we are studying the possible application of these rules to some foreign joint venture repatriations up to approximately 40 million that could potentially reduce our 2005 income tax provision by 5 million to 10 million 

accounting pronouncements issued but not yet effective 

in november 2004 the fasb issued sfas 151 “inventory costs—an amendment of arb no 43 chapter 4” sfas 151 clarifies that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense freight handling costs and spoilage should be expensed as incurred and not included in overhead as an inventory cost the new statement also requires that allocation of fixed production overhead costs to conversion costs should be based on normal capacity of the production facilities the provisions in sfas 151 must be applied prospectively and become effective for us beginning january 1 2006 we do not expect the adoption of sfas 151 will have a material impact on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

in december 2004 the fasb published sfas 123 revised 2004 “sharebased payment” sfas 123r this statement requires financial statement recognition of compensation cost related to sharebased payment transactions sharebased payment transactions within the scope of sfas 123r include stock options restricted stock plans performancebased awards stock appreciation rights and employee share purchase plans the provisions of sfas 123r are effective for the first interim period beginning after june 15 2005 accordingly we will implement the revised standard in the third quarter of 2005 currently we account for stockbased employee awards using the fair value method preferred by sfas 123 and therefore we do not expect this standard to have a material impact on our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

in december 2004 the fasb issued sfas 153 “exchanges of nonmonetary assets an amendment of apb opinion no 29” this statement amends apb opinion 29 “accounting for nonmonetary 

transactions” to eliminate the exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that have no commercial substance under sfas 153 if a nonmonetary exchange of similar productive assets meets a commercialsubstance criterion and fair value is determinable the transaction must be accounted for at fair value resulting in recognition of any gain or loss sfas 153 is effective for nonmonetary transactions in fiscal periods that begin after june 15 2005 and becomes effective for us beginning july 1 2005 we do not expect the adoption sfas 153 to have a material impact on our financial position results of operations or cash flows

 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

we are exposed to financial risk resulting from changes in foreign exchange rates interest rates and commodity prices this risk is closely monitored and managed through the use of financial derivative instruments including commodity price swaps forward contracts and interest rate swaps as clearly stated in our policies and procedures financial instruments are used expressly for hedging purposes and under no circumstances are they used for speculative purposes our hedging transactions are entered into with banking institutions that have strong credit ratings and thus the credit risk associated with these transactions is not considered significant the results and status of our hedging transactions are reported to senior management on a monthly and quarterly basis further information regarding financial instruments and risk management is contained in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements 

the following describes our risk exposures and provides results of sensitivity analyses performed as of december 31 2004 the sensitivity analysis assumes instantaneous parallel shifts in foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices 

foreign exchange rates 

we are exposed to foreign currency exchange risk as a result of our international business presence we transact extensively in foreign currencies and have significant assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies as a result our earnings experience some volatility related to movements in foreign currency exchange rates in order to benefit from global diversification and after considering naturally offsetting currency positions we enter into forward contracts to minimize our existing exposures recognized asset and liability and hedge forecasted transactions the objective of our hedging program is to reduce the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on earnings by essentially creating offsetting currency exposures 

as of december 31 2004 the potential gain or loss in the fair value of our outstanding foreign currency contracts assuming a hypothetical 10 percent fluctuation in the currencies of such contracts would be approximately 24 million the sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates assumes the notional value to remain constant for the next 12 months the analysis ignores the impact of foreign exchange movements on our competitive position and potential changes in sales levels it should be noted that any change in the value of the contracts real or hypothetical would be significantly offset by an inverse change in the value of the underlying hedged items see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements  

interest rates 

we are also exposed to interest rate risk as a result of our indebtedness our objective in managing our exposure to changes in interest rates is to limit the effect of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower our overall cost of borrowing to achieve this objective we primarily use interest rate swap agreements to manage exposure to interest rate changes related to our borrowing arrangements 

in november 2002 we terminated an interest rate swap relating to our 645 notes that mature in 2005 the swap converted 225 million notional amount from fixed rate debt into floating rate debt that matures in 2005 the termination of this swap resulted in a 12 million gain the gain is being amortized to earnings as a reduction of interest expense over the remaining life of the debt the amount of gain recognized during 2004 2003 and 2002 was 5 million 5 million and 1 million respectively the remaining balance of the deferred gain is included in “shortterm borrowings” on our consolidated balance sheets 

in march 2001 we terminated three fixedtofloating interest rate swap agreements related to our 625 notes with principal amount of 125 million due in 2003 and 645 notes with principal amount of 

225 million due in 2005 the termination of these swaps resulted in a 9 million gain the gain is being amortized to earnings as a reduction of interest expense over the remaining life of the debt the amount of gain recognized during 2004 2003 and 2002 was 1 million 2 million and 3 million respectively the remaining balance of the deferred gain is included in “shortterm borrowings” on our consolidated balance sheets see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements  as of december 31 2004 all of our interest rate swap agreements were terminated 

commodity prices 

we are also exposed to fluctuations in commodity prices through the purchase of raw materials as well as contractual agreements with component suppliers to reduce the effect of raw material price changes for select commodities we periodically enter into commodity swap contracts with designated banks to hedge a portion of our anticipated raw material purchases 

as of december 31 2004 the potential gain or loss related to the outstanding commodity swap contracts assuming a hypothetical 10 fluctuation in the price of such commodities was not material the sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in commodity prices assumes the notional value to remain constant for the next 12 months the analysis ignores the impact of commodity price movements on our competitive position and potential changes in sales levels it should be noted that any change in the value of the swaps real or hypothetical would be significantly offset by an inverse change in the value of the underlying hedged items see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

m anagement is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting the company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and preparation of the company’s 

consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america

overview 

cummins inc cummins the company we our or us is a global power leader that designs manufactures distributes and services diesel and natural gas engines electric power generation systems and enginerelated products including filtration and emissions solutions fuel systems controls and air handling systems we were founded in 1919 as one of the first manufacturers of diesel engines and are headquartered in columbus in we sell our products to original equipment manufacturers oems distributors and other customers worldwide we have longstanding relationships with many of the leading manufacturers in the markets we serve including daimlerchryslerag daimlerchrysler volvo ab paccar inc international truck and engine corporation navistar international corporation cnh global nv and scania ab 

our financial performance depends in large part on varying conditions in the markets we serve particularly the automotive construction and general industrial markets demand in these markets tends to fluctuate in response to overall economic conditions and is particularly sensitive to changes in interest rate levels and fuel costs oem inventory levels production schedules and work stoppages also impact our sales economic downturns in the markets we serve generally result in reduced sales which affect our profits and cash flow 

since 2000 the markets we serve in north america have experienced a downturn primarily in the markets for heavyduty trucks mediumduty trucks and construction equipment these conditions had a negative impact particularly on the performance of our engine business in addition weak conditions in the markets served by our power generation business have resulted in reduced demand and high inventory levels which have negatively affected our performance in this segment during the fourth quarter of 2000 the first quarter of 2001 and the second quarters of 2001 and 2002 we recorded restructuring charges as a result of the downturn in the north american heavyduty truck market and several other endmarkets these actions were necessary in order to achieve lower production costs and improve operating efficiencies under difficult economic conditions the charges related to the programs included staffing reorganizations and reductions in our business segments asset impairment writedowns for manufacturing equipment and facility closure and consolidation costs all activities associated with the 2000 and 2001 restructuring actions were completed as of december 31 2002 and activities related to our 2002 restructuring actions were completed as of december 31 2003 

in the fourth quarter of 2002 we announced plans to consolidate our heavyduty engine assembly and test operations at our jamestown ny engine plant approximately 200 positions in the heavyduty business were eliminated as a result of the consolidation which was completed by the end of the first quarter 2003 

competitive strengths 

we believe the following competitive strengths are instrumental to our success 

• leading brands our product portfolio includes products marketed under the following brands each of which holds a leading position in its respective market • cummins engines electric power generation systems components and parts • onan generator sets • newage products sold under the stamford avk and markon brands • fleetguard filtration systems and components • nelson intake and exhaust systems and components • kuss automotive intank fuel filtration 3 

• universal silencer large filtration systems and silencers • holset turbochargers while our portfolio of brands contains a number of market leaders we operate in a highly competitive sector and our brands compete with the brands of other manufacturers and distributors that produce and sell similar products a potential customer could select products of our competitors in the event of actual or perceived superiority of the cost initial purchase and operating delivery performance quality fuel economy serviceability and customer support of those products when compared to ours 

• customers and partners to maintain technology leadership and a global presence in a costeffective manner we have established strategic alliances with a number of our leading customers these partnerships provide us with a knowledge and understanding of our customers technology and business needs and enable us to develop products and services which better meet their requirements at lower costs for example we have both customer and supplier arrangements with komatsu ltd including multiple manufacturing joint ventures and a product development joint venture through which we have partnered in the development of several engines we are also the exclusive supplier of engines for komatsu mining equipment in addition we have been the exclusive diesel engine supplier to daimlerchrysler for its dodge ram truck since 1988 and in 2003 our exclusivity agreement was extended beyond model year 2007 we have longterm agreements with volvo paccar and international truck and engine corporation for the supply of heavyduty truck engines these agreements afford us longterm price stability and eliminate certain dealer and enduser discounts as well as offer closer integration on product development we also have multiple international joint ventures to manufacture midrange engines including partnerships with tata engineering and locomotive company the leading truck manufacturer in india and dongfeng automotive corporation the engine supplier to the second largest truck manufacturer in china • global presence we have a strong global presence including a world class distribution system manufacturing and engineering facilities around the world and a network of global supply sources our worldwide presence has enabled us to take advantage of growth opportunities in international markets with our sales outside the us growing from 39 percent of total sales in 1999 to 47 percent of total sales in 2003 in the last 45 years we have developed a distribution and service network that includes more than 680 companyowned and independent distributor locations and 5000 independent dealers located throughout 137 countries and territories we also have manufacturing operations and product engineering centers around the world with facilities in the united kingdom uk brazil mexico canada france australia china india south africa and singapore in addition we have developed a global network of highquality lowcost supply sources to support our manufacturing base • leading technology we have an established reputation for delivering highquality technologically advanced products we continuously work with our customers to develop new products that improve the performance of their vehicles equipment or systems at competitive cost levels we are a leader in developing technologies to reduce diesel engine emissions a key concern of our customers and regulators around the world we were the first company to develop engines that were certified to meet new emissions standards governing onhighway heavyduty diesel engines these standards went into effect for cummins in the us on october 1 2002 we also developed lowemission highperformance natural gas engines as an alternative fuel option for the onhighway industrial and power generation markets our technology leadership enables us to develop integrated product solutions for the power generation and filtration markets allowing our customers to use a single highperformance lowcost system as opposed to multiple components from different suppliers 4 

business strategy 

the three key elements of our business strategy are as follows 

• aggressively pursue cost leadership in many of our markets product or system cost is a critical performance parameter for our customers to achieve cost leadership we will continue to leverage our innovative technology economies of scale global presence and customer partnerships beginning in 2000 we launched several focused initiatives to dramatically reduce costs and lower our breakeven point • six sigma this is the cornerstone of our cost reduction effort since the programs inception in 2000 we have trained 1600 belts a person trained in the tools of six sigma who manages the project and implements the improvements who continue to deliver savings simplify processes and have substantially improved product and service quality • directindirect purchasing  our cost reduction efforts in supply chain management have resulted in significantly reducing the cost of purchased materials and services during the last five years • restructuring since january 1 2000 we have closed six plants consolidated multiple operations and reduced our global headcount by approximately 2600 positions these efforts resulted in savings of more than 90 million we will continue to pursue cost reduction opportunities through our six sigma initiatives global sourcing consolidation of operations and product design and quality improvement 

• expand into related markets we will grow in related businesses where we can use our existing investments in products or technology leading brand names or market presence to establish a competitive advantage we will target related markets that will offer us higher rates of growth attractive returns and more stable cash flows through product and end market diversity for example our engine business has made a significant investment in our north american distributors engines for the growing oil and gas markets and service and maintenance contracts our international distributor business is growing through the expansion of our aftermarket parts and service business by capitalizing on our global customer base through our emission solutions business we will leverage our filtration exhaust and engine technologies to provide integrated solutions for our customers and meet increasingly stringent emissions requirements our power generation business is focused on increasing sales of power electronics and controls such as transfer switches and switchgear • maximize return on capital return on capital specifically return on average net assets roana is our primary measure of financial performance each of our business segments has roana targets and we allocate capital based on segment performance against those targets we calculate roana as segment ebit divided by segment net assets as a result of our intense focus on roana we have been able to reduce capital spending while still funding key development programs including the completion of a full range of emissioncompliant engines in 2003 and 2002 we reduced our capital expenditure requirements over 100 million each year compared to the average of capital expenditures in the previous three years prior to that time our annual capital expenditures were significant as we launched new engine platforms and related tooling capital expenditures in the future are expected to be concentrated on maintaining our existing manufacturing capacity 

one of our goals is to regain an investment grade credit rating from the rating agencies to achieve this goal we have put significant management focus on increasing earnings improving cash flow and reducing financial leverage 

our business segments 

we operate four complementary business segments that share technology customers strategic partners brands and our distribution network to gain a competitive advantage in their respective markets with our size and global presence we provide worldclass products service and support to our customers in a costeffective manner in each of our business segments we compete worldwide with a number of other manufacturers and distributors that produce and sell similar products our products primarily compete on the basis of price performance fuel economy speed of delivery quality and customer support

international distributor business 

in the fourth quarter of 2001 we realigned our reporting structure and created the international distributor business as a result of the growing size and importance of the retail distribution business in 2003 international distributor business sales accounted for 10 percent of our total net sales compared to 9 percent in 2002 our international distributor business consists of 18 companyowned distributors and two joint ventures that distribute the full range of our products and services to endusers at 111 locations in 50 countries and territories through this network our trained personnel 

provide parts and service to our customers as well as fullservice solutions including maintenance contracts engineering services and integrated products where we customize our products to cater to specific endusers our companyowned distributors are located in key markets including india china japan australia the uk and south africa our distributors also serve the dealers and endusers in their territories by providing product maintenance repair and overhaul services 

our international distributor business serves a highly diverse customer base consisting of various endusers in the specific geographic markets in which our distributors are located 

in our international distributor business each distributor that we own or operate in a particular geographic region competes with other distributors and dealers that offer similar products within that region in many cases competing distributors and dealers are owned by or affiliated with oems of those competing products 

segment financial information 

financial information about our business segments is incorporated by reference from note 17 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

supply 

we have developed and maintain a world class supply base in terms of technology quality and cost we source our materials and manufactured components from leading suppliers both domestically and internationally and we have adequate sources of supply of raw materials and components we machine and assemble many of the components used in our engines including blocks heads rods turbochargers crankshafts and fuel systems we also have arrangements with certain suppliers who are the sole source for specific products or supply items between 75 and 85 percent of our total raw material and component purchases in 2003 were purchased from suppliers who are the sole source of supply for a particular supply item although we elect to source a relatively high proportion of our total raw materials and component requirements from sole suppliers the majority of these supply items can be purchased from alternate suppliers if required our supply agreements vary according to the particular supply item however these agreements typically include standard terms relating to cost including cost reduction targets quality and delivery our supply agreements also typically include customary intellectual property provisions that contain prohibitions on the use of our intellectual property by the suppliers for any purpose other than their performance of the supply agreements and indemnity covenants from suppliers for breach by them of intellectual property rights of third parties in performance of the agreements the duration of our more important supply agreements varies but typically ranges between 3 and 5 years and some extend through 2010 many of our supply agreements include early termination provisions related to failure to meet quality and delivery requirements our business is not substantially dependent on any one of our supply agreements however the raw materials and components from these suppliers are single sourced and are important to our business because delays involved in resourcing these raw materials and components could be costly 

patents and trademarks 

we own or control a significant number of patents and trademarks relating to the products we manufacture these have been granted and registered over a period of years although these patents and trademarks are generally considered beneficial to our operations we do not believe any patent group of patents or trademark other than our leading brand house trademarks is considered significant in relation to our business 

seasonality 

while individual product lines may experience modest seasonal declines in production there is no material effect on the demand for the majority of our products on a quarterly basis however our power generation business normally experiences seasonal declines in the first quarter of the fiscal year 

due to general declines in construction spending and our international distributor business normally experiences seasonal declines in first quarter business activity due to holiday periods in asia and australia 

largest customer 

we have thousands of customers around the world and have developed longstanding business relationships with many of them daimlerchrysler is our largest customer accounting for approximately 15 percent of our total net sales in 2003 primarily relating to sales of our isb engine for use in dodge ram trucks and sales of our mediumduty engines to the freightliner division of daimlerchrysler while a significant number of our sales to daimlerchrysler are under longterm supply agreements these agreements provide for the supply of daimlerchryslers engine requirements for particular models and not a specific number of engines daimlerchrysler is our only customer accounting for more than 10 percent of our net sales in 2003 the loss of this customer or a significant decline in the production level of daimlerchrysler vehicles that use our engines would have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition we have been supplying engines to daimlerchrysler for more than 14 years a summary of principal customers for each business segment is included in our segment discussion 

in addition to our agreements with daimlerchrysler we have longterm heavyduty engine supply agreements with international truck and engine corporation paccar and volvo trucks north america collectively our net sales to these three customers was less than 15 of total net sales in 2003 and individually was less than 6 of total net sales for each customer as with daimlerchrysler these agreements contain standard purchase and sale agreement terms covering engine and engine parts pricing quality and delivery commitments as well as engineering product support obligations the basic nature of our agreements with oem customers is that they are longterm generally five years or longer price and operations agreements that assure the availability of our products to each customer through the duration of the respective agreements there are no guarantees or commitments by these customers of any kind regarding volumes or market shares except in the case of daimlerchrysler which has committed that we will be its exclusive diesel engine supplier for the dodge ram heavyduty pickup truck agreements with oems contain bilateral termination provisions giving either party the right to terminate in the event of a material breach change of control or insolvency or bankruptcy of the other party 

backlog 

while we have supply agreements with some truck and offhighway equipment oems most of our business is transacted through open purchase orders these open orders are historically subject to monthtomonth releases and may be canceled on reasonable notice without cancellation charges and therefore are not considered firm 

distribution 

over the last 45 years we have developed a distribution and service network that includes more than 680 distributor locations and 5000 dealers in 137 countries and territories this network is comprised of independent distributors as well as distributors that are partiallyor whollyowned by us each distributor sells the full range of our products as well as complementary products and services our international distributor business operates within this network operating 18 companyowned distributors in 111 locations across 50 countries and territories 

our agreements with independent and partiallyowned distributors generally have a threeyear term and are exclusive with respect to specified territories our distributors develop and maintain the network of dealers with which we have no direct relationship the distributors are permitted to sell other noncompetitive products only with our consent we license all of our distributors to use our name and logo in connection with the sale and service of our products with no right to assign or 

sublicense the marks except to authorized dealers without our consent products are sold to the distributors at standard domestic or international distributor net prices as applicable net prices are wholesale prices we establish to permit our distributors an adequate margin on their sales we can refuse to renew these agreements at will and we may terminate them upon 90day notice for inadequate sales change in principal ownership and certain other reasons distributors also have the right to terminate the agreements upon 60day notice without cause or 30day notice for cause upon termination or failure to renew we are required to purchase the distributors current inventory and may but are not required to purchase other assets of the distributor 

our distribution capability is a key element of our business strategy and competitive position particularly in our efforts to increase customer access to aftermarket replacement parts and repair service there are approximately 8900 locations in north america primarily owned and operated by oems or their dealers at which cummins trained service personnel and parts are available to service maintain and repair our engines we also have parts distribution centers located strategically throughout the world in order to serve our customers 

we consolidate the financial results of all whollyowned distributors and account for partiallyowned distributors using the equity method of accounting see note 1 and note 5 of the notes to consolidated financial statements  

research and development 

our research and engineering program is focused on product improvements innovations and cost reductions for our customers in 2003 our research and engineering expenditures were 200 million compared to 201 million in 2002 of this amount approximately 11 percent or 22 million was directly related to the development of engines that are designed to comply with the 1998 consent degree 

in the engine business we continue to invest in system integration and in technologies to meet increasingly more stringent emissions standards we have focused our engine technology development on five critical subsystems combustion air handling fuel systems electronic controls and exhaust aftertreatment we were the first diesel engine manufacturer to have an engine certified by the epa as being in compliance with the current epa standards we were the first engine manufacturer to announce a lowcost combustiononly emission solution for tier iii industrial diesel engines that does not require exhaust gas recirculation nor exhaust aftertreatment we are also the first company to demonstrate a prototype vehicle that meets epa 2007 gasolineequivalent tier ii bin 5 emission levels we offer both diesel and alternative fuel engines 

in power generation our product engineering focus is best performance at lowest cost for our customers our power electronics technology development is aimed at applying digital electronics to eliminate multiple genset controllers and achieve higher levels of system integration and control we meet the most advanced emission standards around the world employing both combustion and exhaust aftertreatment technologies looking to future lowemission power generation technologies we have a doefunded program to develop a solid oxide fuel cell system for vehicle auxiliary power generation and for smaller stationary power generation applications 

in filtration we are building on our strengths in design integration to develop modules that integrate multiple filtration functions into a single engine subsystem component we are developing new filter media and technologies that support low emission engines including exhaust aftertreatment closed crankcase ventilation and centrifugal soot removal 

in 2003 we established cummins research and technology indian private ltd crti this whollyowned subsidiary provides analytical services such as structural dynamics computational fluid dynamics and design to all cummins entities crti has selected satyam computer services limited to provide startup services in the form of engineering staff and leased work space crti is located in pune india

employees 

as of december 31 2003 we employed approximately 24200 persons worldwide approximately 9300 of our employees are represented by various unions under collective bargaining agreements that expire between 2004 and 2008 we believe that we have a good working relationship with our employees 

environmental compliance 

product environmental compliance 

our engines are subject to extensive statutory and regulatory requirements that directly or indirectly impose standards governing emissions and noise our products comply with emissions standards that the environmental protection agency epa the california air resources board carb and other state regulatory agencies as well as other regulatory agencies around the world have established for heavyduty onhighway diesel and gas engines and offhighway engines produced through 2004 our ability to comply with these and future emissions standards is an essential element in maintaining our leadership position in regulated markets we have made and will continue to make significant capital and research expenditures to comply with these standards failure to comply with these standards could result in adverse effects on our future financial results 

epa engine certifications 

in the fourth quarter 2002 we implemented new onroad emissions standards these were implemented in accordance with the terms of a 1998 consent decree that we and a number of other engine manufacturers entered into with the epa the us department of justice and carb the consent decree was in response to concerns raised by these agencies regarding the level of nitrogen oxide emissions from heavyduty diesel engines 

epa regulations governing our operations also establish several means for the epa to ensure and verify compliance with emissions standards including tests of new engines as they come off the 

assembly line selective enforcement audits seas and tests of field engines inuse compliance tests the epa has used the sea provisions for several years to verify the compliance of heavyduty engines in the product development process we anticipate sea requirements when we set emissions design targets if we fail an sea we might be required to cease production of any noncompliant engines and recall engines produced prior to the audit none of our engines was chosen for inuse compliance testing in 2003 the epa will increase the inuse test rate in future years and one or more of our engines may be selected 

federal and california regulations require manufacturers to report failures of emissionsrelated components to the epa and carb when the failure rate reaches a specified level at higher failure rates a product recall may be required in 2003 we submitted reports to the carb and epa none of which has led either agency to require a recall 

a second element of the consent decree requires us to pull forward by one year to january 1 2005 the implementation of tier iii emissions standards for offroad engines in the 300 to 749 horsepower range when the development of tier iii compliant engines is near completion we will commence a certification process with the epa this process involves testing compiling and analyzing data and providing information to the epa and the carb once this testing and data preparation is finalized we will file a certification application with the epa the epa must approve our application as part of the certification process before we will be able to sell offroad engines in the horsepower range from 300 to 749 in the united states less than 2 of our 2003 revenue was derived from the sale of these types of offroad engines in the united states development and testing is well advanced and we anticipate achieving the january 1 2005 milestone for engines in this horsepower range 

not all of our competitors are signatories to the consent decree and therefore were not required to undertake the capital and research expenditures that we have undertaken in the same time frame this has provided some of our competitors with a competitive advantage the majority of the impact the consent decree has had on our business is reflected in the results we have reported over the past four years the pull ahead of emission standards has put us at a disadvantage compared to manufacturers who did not sign the consent decree relative to the fifteenmonth pull ahead of the 2004 emission standards for engines used in onhighway applications the companys heavyduty engine families isx and ism compete primarily against engines produced by other consent decree signing manufacturers however daimlerchrysler one of our competitors who did not sign the consent decree introduced a new engine into this segment of the market during this period and thereby enjoyed a competitive advantage our medium heavyduty engines were also at a disadvantage compared to manufacturers who did not sign the consent decree as this fifteen month pull ahead time period is nearly over the majority of the impact has already occurred the situation is similar for the twelvemonth pull ahead from january 1 2006 to january 1 2005 of the nonroad tier iii standards for engines used in construction and agricultural applications our qsm qsx and qsk19 engine families participate in this market segment most of the competitive engines in this horsepower range are produced by other consent decree signing manufacturers that are subject to the pull ahead there are some participants in this market that are not consent decree signers that would have a competitive advantage during this one year period 

emissions standards in international markets including europe and japan are becoming more stringent we believe that our experience in meeting us emissions standards leaves us well positioned to take advantage of opportunities in these markets as the need for emissions control capability grows 

in december 2003 we announced that we will meet the 2007 us epa heavyduty onhighway emissions standards by combining our existing cooled exhaust gas recirculation technology with particulate matter pm filters cooled egr is the same technology that we have used since april 2002 and was selected after reviewing other aftertreatment technologies such as nox adsorbers and selective catalytic reduction scr our experience with particulate filters and the availability of ultralowsulfur diesel fuel combine to give us the confidence in meeting these tough standards in the us additionally while the egrpm filter combination is the right solution for 2007 in the us we have selected scr 

as the right technology to meet onhighway euro iv emissions standards and certain offhighway applications 

other environmental statutes and regulations 

we believe we are in compliance in all material respects with laws and regulations applicable to our plants and operations during the last five years expenditures for environmental control activities and environmental remediation projects at our facilities in the us have not been a substantial portion of annual capital outlays and are not expected to be material in 2004 pursuant to notices received from federal and state agencies andor defendant parties in site environmental contribution actions we have been identified as potentially responsible parties prps under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of 1980 as amended or similar state laws at approximately 13 waste disposal sites 

we are unable to determine the aggregate cost of remediation at these sites however for each site we have attempted to estimate our liability by analyzing the amounts and constituents of waste we contributed to the sites the estimated costs for remediation at the sites the number and identities of other prps and the level of our insurance coverage at some of these sites we will be released from liability at the site as a de minimis prp for a nominal amount with respect to some sites at which we have been named as a prp we cannot accurately estimate the future remediation costs at several sites the remedial action has not been determined in other cases we have only recently been named a prp and we are collecting information on the site finally in some cases we believe we have no liability at the site and are actively contesting our designation as a prp for further discussion regarding these waste disposal sites see item 3 legal proceedings 

based upon our experiences at similar sites however we believe that our aggregate future remediation costs will not be significant we believe that we have good defenses to liability at several of the sites while our percentage contribution at other sites is likely to be insignificant and that other prps will bear most of the future remediation costs at the sites where we could have liability because environmental laws impose joint and several liability our liability may be based upon many factors outside our control however and could be material if we become obligated to pay a significant portion of expenses that would otherwise be the responsibility of other prps possibly resulting in a default under the indenture governing our 9 1  2  senior notes based upon information presently available we believe that such an outcome is unlikely at any site for which we have been named a prp

overview 

cummins is a global power leader comprised of four reportable complementary business segments engine power generation filtration and other and international distributors our businesses design manufacture distribute and service diesel and natural gas engines and related technologies including fuel systems controls air handling and filtration emissions solutions and electrical power generation systems our products are sold to original equipment manufacturers oems distributors and other customers worldwide major oem customers include daimlerchrysler paccar international truck and engine corporation navistar volvo komatsu ford volkswagen and cnh global we serve our customers through more than 680 companyowned and independent distributor locations in 137 countries and territories our business units share technology customers strategic partners brands and our distribution network 

our financial performance is affected by the cyclical nature and varying conditions of the markets we serve particularly the automotive construction and general industrial markets demand in these markets fluctuates in response to overall economic conditions and is particularly sensitive to changes in the price of crude oil fuel costs freight tonnage interest rate levels nonresidential construction spending and general industrial capital spending economic downturns in the markets we serve generally result in reductions in sales and pricing of our products and reduce our earnings and cash flow since 2000 our north american markets have experienced a downturn most notably in the heavyduty trucks mediumduty trucks and construction equipment markets these conditions have adversely impacted the performance of our engine business in addition weak conditions in the standbybackup power generation markets resulting in decreased demand and high inventory levels have also had a negative impact on the performance of our power generation business 

many of the markets in which the engine business operates are highly competitive our products compete worldwide with a number of other manufacturers and distributors that produce and sell similar products primarily on the basis of price performance fuel economy reliability delivery quality and customer service and support some of our competitors are companies or operating units or divisions of companies that have consolidated with other companies and have become powertrain integrated for example two of the worlds largest truck manufacturers have made recent acquisitions that increase their enginemaking capacity in north america—daimlerchrysler acquired detroit diesel and volvo acquired mack trucks inc 

other competitors have greater financial and other resources than we do as a result our competitive position within the heavyduty truck market has weakened over the last decade due to 

market share losses and the changing dynamics of the industry in response to these conditions we have entered into separate longterm supply agreements with navistar paccar and volvo to provide longterm stable pricing for our engines and eliminate certain dealer and enduser discounts these agreements also provide for closer integration of product design testing and development in addition we reduced our heavyduty engine manufacturing capacity by consolidating our heavyduty engine assembly and test operations at our jamestown new york facility we expect stable pricing from the longterm agreements our heavyduty engine assembly consolidation savings from six sigma projects and previous restructuring actions to improve our profitability in this market without being dependent upon a material gain in market share 

in 2003 our first quarter performance was impacted by the significant prebuy of existing engine models that occurred ahead of the october 1 2002 emissions rule changes and the overall weak freight environment by the second half of the year the truck tonnage index was increasing and most of our markets were beginning to recover as general economic conditions improved and all of our business segments returned to profitability earlier this year we celebrated the shipment of our 1000000 th 59liter diesel engine for the dodge ram truck which is manufactured at our walesboro in facility highlighting 14 years of partnership with the chrysler group of daimlerchrysler in october we extended our exclusive supply agreement with the chrysler group for diesel engines used in the dodge ram truck and in december wards communications  a leading provider of automotive industry news data and analysis named the cummins 59liter engine for the dodge ram truck as one of the 10 best engines for 2004 in october we announced that our isb engine will become available in thomas built buses beginning in january 2004 thomas built buses a leading manufacturer of school buses in north america and a member of the daimlerchrysler freightliner group is the first school bus manufacturer to offer the new emissions compliant isb engine the isb was selected because of its quiet operation and low operating costs 

our 2003 performance in the power generation business was adversely affected by excess inventory in the market coupled with extreme pricing pressure and low volumes but was partially offset by improved sales of our mobile generator sets to the recreational vehicle market in august our power generation business and our cummins distributor network responded to emergency power needs resulting from the blackout that affected much of the northeast region of the us and parts of canada during the height of this crisis which helped absorb some of the industry capacity we had more than 100 megawatts of rental power operating in the northeast region 

our filtration and other business performed well in 2003 with sales exceeding 1 billion including strong sales growth from our new fleetguard emissions solutions business in 2003 fleetguard signed multiple longterm supply agreements with major oems and opened a new 200000 square foot manufacturing facility in waynesboro georgia to support the growing small engine and recreational vehicle exhaust market in the southeastern us 

net sales and earnings of our joint ventures and alliances increased significantly during 2003 primarily from the expansion of our joint venture in china dongfeng cummins engine company this joint venture which is a supplier to chinas second largest truck manufacturer now has access to the most advanced fullelectronic diesel engine platforms that cummins provides 

in december 2003 we announced that we will meet the 2007 us epa heavyduty onhighway emissions standards by combining our existing cooled exhaust gas recirculation egr technology with particulate matter pm filters cooled egr is the same technology that we have used since april 2002 and was selected after reviewing other aftertreatment technologies such as nox adsorbers and selective catalytic reduction scr our experience with particulate filters and the availability of ultralowsulfur diesel fuel combine to give us the confidence in meeting these tough standards in the us additionally while the egrpm filter combination is the right solution for 2007 in the us we 

have selected scr as the right technology to meet onhighway euro iv emissions standards and certain offhighway applications 

results of operations 

our net earnings were 50 million or 127 per share on sales of 630 billion in 2003 compared to net earnings of 82 million or 213 per share on sales of 585 billion in 2002 net earnings in 2003 included a fourth quarter aftertax charge of 4 million or 09 per share for the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle resulting from the consolidation of a variable interest entity a majority of our 2003 earnings were delivered in the fourth quarter as business conditions and our profitability improved significantly in the second half of the year fourth quarter net earnings were 43 million in 2003 or 100 per share compared to net earnings of 46 million or 110 per share in the fourth quarter of 2002 our earnings from joint ventures and alliances were a record 26 million in the fourth quarter of 2003 compared to 6 million in the fourth quarter of 2002 net earnings in 2002 include a pretax credit of 8 million for costs associated with restructuring actions an 8 million pretax charge related to early extinguishment of debt and a 3 million aftertax credit for the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle net earnings in 2002 also reflected a onetime 57 million favorable tax adjustment related to the settlement of income tax audits for the years 1994 through 1999 in 2001 we incurred a net loss of 103 million or 270 per share including a net aftertax charge of 84 million related to restructuring actions 

net sales 

the table below sets forth net sales for each of our key business segments during the last three years 



sales increased in all of our business segments in 2003 compared to 2002 with a majority of the increase occurring in the second half of the year as economic conditions strengthened sales of our engine business increased 196 million or 6 percent primarily from higher sales to the chrysler group for the dodge ram truck power generation sales increased 103 million or 8 percent compared to the prior year buoyed by strong fourth quarter demand sales in the filtration and other business reached the 1 billion level up 105 million or 11 percent yearoveryear reflecting demand improvement and increased market penetration sales in our international distributor business increased 95 million or 17 percent compared to 2002 primarily from strong engine and parts sales at our distributorships in australia dubai and south africa 

net sales for 2002 were 585 billion an increase of 172 million or 3 percent compared to net sales in 2001 a majority of the increase was attributable to our engine business which experienced a strong prebuy of onhighway heavyduty engines in advance of the october 1 2002 epa emissions deadline and higher sales of midrange engines for the dodge ram truck 

gross margin 

our gross margin was 112 billion in 2003 105 billion in 2002 and 101 billion in 2001 with related gross margin percentages of 178 percent 179 percent and 178 percent respectively compared to 2002 our 2003 gross margin percentage was relatively flat on a net sales increase of 443 million our gross margin on the new emissions compliant engine models was essentially flat compared to the preemission engines as the effect of a pricing increase on the new engine models was offset by incremental costs of new parts and components and higher product coverage costs however our gross margin percentage appears lower as the gross margin dollar amount is now measured against a higher sales value due to the pricing action product coverage costs as a percentage of total net sales were flat yearoveryear at 34 percent in 2003 and 2002 

in 2002 our gross margin was 105 billion compared to 101 billion in 2001 with related gross margin percentages of 179 percent and 178 percent respectively gross margin in 2002 was relatively flat compared to 2001 on a net sales increase of 172 million reflecting changes in sales mix as we transitioned from mature engines to new engines in the latter half of the year margins on our new engine models are typically lower at introduction compared to mature engines in addition 2002 gross margin was also affected by lower fixed cost absorption in our power generation business due to a significant sales decline as a result of weak power generation demand product coverage costs were flat yearoveryear at 34 percent of total net sales in 2002 and 2001 

selling and administrative expenses 

total selling and administrative expenses were 830 million 132 percent of net sales in 2003 compared to 736 million 126 percent of net sales in 2002 included in the increase is 28 million from the impact of foreign exchange rate changes at our foreign entities of the total increase approximately 56 million was related to selling expenses and 38 million to administrative expenses the increase in selling expense is primarily attributable to higher compensation expense from incremental sales staffing 13 million funding of growth initiatives including outside consulting services 11 million increases in fringe expenses including pensions 9 million increases in variable incentive compensation due to higher segment earnings 7 million and other volume variable expenses that individually are not material the increase in administrative expenses resulted from higher fringe benefit expenses primarily pensions 9 million increases in audit and nonaudit services primarily resulting from a reaudit of the 2001 and 2000 consolidated financial statements 9 million increases in legal fees 7 million higher salaries and wages from staffing increases 5 million and other miscellaneous items that individually are not material 

selling and administrative expenses were 736 million in 2002 an increase of 15 million or 2 percent compared to 721 million 127 percent of net sales in 2001 the increase in selling and administrative expenses yearoveryear is primarily a result of volume variable expenditures funding of focused growth initiatives and higher variable compensation expense due to improved earnings partially offset by cost reduction actions 

research and engineering expenses 

research and engineering expenses were 200 million 32 percent of net sales in 2003 compared to 201 million 34 percent of net sales in 2002 or a decrease of 1 million yearoveryear salary and wages were lower 10 million as spending was reduced on heavyduty development work following the launch of our new emissions compliant engines introduced in 2002 14 million and from decreased expenses related to development costs of our european engine alliance joint venture 10 million this reduction in spending was partially offset by increased development work and testing on euro emissions and on tier ii and iii industrial emissions engines 20 million increased fringe expenses primarily pension expense 5 million and other expenses that individually were not material 

research and engineering expenses in 2002 were 201 million a decrease of 19 million or 9 percent compared to 220 million 39 percent of net sales in 2001 overall research and engineering expenses were lower due to the cancellation of a major engine development program in the second quarter of 2001 and other productivity improvement and cost reduction actions partially offset by higher engineering costs related to the development of our 2002 emissions products 

equity royalty and other income from investees 

earnings from our joint ventures and alliances were 70 million in 2003 compared to 22 million in 2002 an increase of 48 million the yearoveryear increase was attributable to improved earnings across most of our joint ventures primarily dongfeng cummins engine company ltd 20 million our north american distributor joint ventures 9 million the european engine alliance 5 million chongqing cummins engine company ltd 4 million our joint ventures in india primarily tata holset and tata cummins ltd 4 million and our marine joint venture cummins mercruiser 3 million royalty income from joint ventures and alliances increased 3 million in 2003 compared to 2002 

in april 2003 dongfeng automobile company ltd which is a manufacturing licensee of our b series engine and a subsidiary of dongfeng motor company chinas second largest truck manufacturer and our wholly owned subsidiary cummins xiangfan machining company ltd a manufacturer of b series cylinder blocks and cylinder heads were integrated into the existing cummins and dongfeng joint venture dongfeng cummins engine company ltd the expanded joint venture with a capacity in excess of 130000 units produces cummins b c and l series fourto nineliter mechanical and fullelectronic diesel engines with a power range from 100 to 370 horsepower the increase in 2003 earnings reflects improvements in efficiency and lower production costs as a result of the integration 

in 2002 our income from joint ventures and alliances was 22 million compared to 10 million of income in 2001 the increase was a result of improved earnings across most of our joint ventures particularly our joint ventures in china earnings at our partiallyowned distributor locations in north america and our marine joint venture with mercury marine a division of brunswick corporation cummins mercruiser diesel 

restructuring asset impairment and other charges 

through the end of 2002 we continued a restructuring program initiated in 1998 to improve our cost structure the charges related to this program included staffing reorganizations and reductions in various business segments asset impairment writedowns for manufacturing equipment facility closure and consolidation costs dissolution costs and restructuring actions related to joint venture operations cancellation of a new engine development program and exit costs related to several small business operations 

our 2002 results include a net 8 million credit related to restructuring actions comprised of a net 2 million charge in the second quarter and a 10 million reversal of excess accruals in the fourth quarter the net 2 million charge in the second quarter included 16 million for restructuring actions recognized in that quarter offset by a reversal of 14 million of excess accruals the reversal of excess accruals in the second and fourth quarters was primarily a result of 2001 and 2000 restructuring actions that were realigned or cancelled 

in 2001 we recorded a net restructuring and other charge of 126 million related to the downturn in the north american heavyduty truck market and several other endmarkets this action was necessary to achieve lower production costs and improve operating efficiencies under difficult economic conditions the charge included staffing reorganizations and reductions in various business segments asset impairment writedowns for manufacturing equipment cancellation of a new engine development 

program facility closure and consolidation costs and other exit costs related to small business operations 

note 7 of the consolidated financial statements includes schedules that present by major cost component and by year of expense activities related to restructuring actions for the years 2001 through 2003 including adjustments to the original charges all activities associated with our 2001 and 2002 restructuring actions were completed as of december 31 2002 and december 31 2003 respectively 

a discussion of our restructuring actions during this period follows 

2002 restructuring actions 

in the second quarter of 2002 we announced further restructuring actions precipitated by weak market conditions related primarily to our engine and power generation businesses and recorded additional restructuring charges of 16 million the charges included 11 million attributable to workforce reduction actions 3 million for asset impairments and 2 million related to facility closures and consolidations of this charge 5 million was associated with our engine business 4 million with power generation 3 million with filtration and other and 4 million with the international distributor business 

the charges included severance costs and related benefits of terminating approximately 220 salaried and 350 hourly employees and were based on amounts pursuant to established benefit programs or statutory requirements of the affected operations these actions reflect overall reductions in staffing levels due to closing operations and moving production to available capacity the asset impairment charge related to equipment available for disposal the carrying value of the equipment and the effect of suspending depreciation on the equipment were not significant in the fourth quarter of 2002 the number and mix of employees terminated under this plan differed from our original estimate as a result approximately 1 million of excess accruals related to severance costs and related benefits were reversed as of december 31 2003 approximately 210 salaried and 350 hourly employees had been separated or terminated under this plan 

this restructuring action was completed as of december 31 2003 and approximately 2 million in liabilities related to this action were paid in 2003 

2001 restructuring actions 

in the first half of 2001 we announced further restructuring actions as a result of the continuing downturn in the north american heavyduty truck market and several other endmarkets and recorded restructuring charges of 128 million most of which was recorded in the second quarter the charges included 18 million for workforce reduction actions 68 million for asset impairment and 42 million related to cancellation of purchase commitments for capital and tooling equipment in addition we recorded a 1 million charge related to the divestiture of a small business operation these charges were reduced by a 3 million reversal of excess accruals recorded in our 2000 restructuring action of the net 126 million charge 113 million was associated with the engine business 8 million with the power generation business 4 million with the filtration and other business and 1 million with the international distributor business 

the workforce reduction actions included overall reductions in staffing levels and the impact of divesting a small business operation the charges included severance costs and related benefits of terminating approximately 500 salaried and 350 hourly employees and were based on amounts pursuant to established benefit programs or statutory requirements of the affected operations all employees affected by this workforce reduction plan and the subsequent fourth quarter 2001 realignment plan were terminated by the end of the fourth quarter of 2002 

the asset impairment charge and the charges for cancelled purchased commitments were related to an investment supporting a new engine development program that was cancelled in the second quarter of 2001 the charges included the cost of manufacturing equipment previously capitalized and cancellation charges for capital and tooling purchase commitments the charge was reduced by the estimated salvage value related to the planned equipment disposals during 2002 we recovered 9 million of salvage proceeds on planned equipment disposals in addition we reversed 6 million of the original restructuring accrual as we settled our equipment commitments for less than our original estimate in the fourth quarter 2002 we transferred 3 million of previously impaired manufacturing equipment to another plant as a result of a subsequent decision to consolidate our isx assembly and test operations and realigned our workforce reduction plan these actions resulted in the reversal of an additional 12 million in excess charges related to this plan 

this restructuring action was completed as of december 31 2002 and approximately 511 salaried and 540 hourly employees were separated or terminated under the workforce reduction actions of this plan 

interest expense 

interest expense was 90 million in 2003 compared to 61 million in 2002 most of the increase resulted from higher debt levels 15 million and borrowing rates 7 million of our 95 senior notes issued in november 2002 and the required presentation of dividends on our preferred securities as interest expense 11 million effective july 1 2003 in accordance with a new accounting standard see note 1 recently adopted accounting pronouncements previously the dividends on our preferred securities were classified separately in our consolidated statements of earnings the preferred securities are now classified as longterm debt in our consolidated statements of financial position and were previously classified in our consolidated statements of financial position between longterm debt and shareholders equity 

interest expense was 61 million in 2002 compared to 77 million in 2001 a decrease of 16 million a majority of the decrease is a result of lower borrowings due to the issuance of our preferred securities in 2001 and lower interest rates on borrowings 

the amount of interest expense paid in 2003 2002 and 2001 was 90 million 52 million and 80 million respectively 

loss on early retirement of debt 2002 

in november 2002 we elected to repay all of the outstanding 561 notes issued by our employee stock ownership plan esop trust these notes would have matured in 2010 the election to repay the notes early was a result of a covenant conflict with our revolving credit facility that was entered into in november 2002 the aggregate repayment of the notes was approximately 51 million plus an 8 million premium for early repayment and approximately 1 million of accrued interest the 8 million premium for early repayment of the notes has been classified in our consolidated statements of earnings as loss on early retirement of debt see note 1 of the consolidated financial statements for additional information related to this transaction 

other income and expense 

other income and expense was a net 18 million of income in 2003 compared to a net 9 million of income in 2002 or a 9 million increase most of the increase is attributable to losses from foreign currency exchange transactions in 2002 14 million primarily the uk pound sterling brazilian real and the argentine peso 

in 2002 other income and expense was a net 9 million of income compared to net amount of 0 million in 2001 a majority of the increase is a result of the discontinuance of goodwill amortization in accordance with a newly adopted accounting standard see note 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements  

other income and expense includes several transactions comprising foreign currency exchange interest income and other miscellaneous items the major components of other income and expense segregated between operating items and nonoperating items are disclosed in note 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

provision for income taxes 

our income tax provision in 2003 was 12 million compared to income tax benefits of 38 million in 2002 and 44 million in 2001 the 2002 income tax benefit included a onetime 57 million favorable tax adjustment credit related to the settlement of us internal revenue service income tax audits for tax years 1994 through 1999 our effective income tax rate for all years 2001 through 2003 was lower than the 35 percent us corporate income tax rate because of reduced taxes on export sales research tax credits and dividends on preferred securities which are tax deductible as interest expense we expect our 2004 effective tax rate to be higher than the 2003 effective tax rate but still below the 35 percent us corporate income tax rate the 2002 effective tax rates were 34 percent for restructuring credits and 35 percent for the loss on early retirement of debt the effective tax rate in 2001 was 33 percent for restructuring charges the amount of income taxes paid in 2003 2002 and 2001 was 50 million 30 million and 20 million respectively please refer to note 12 of the consolidated financial statements for a more complete disclosure of our income taxes including a reconciliation of the income tax provision benefit that would be expected using the 35 percent us federal income tax rate to the actual income tax provision benefit recorded 

minority interests in earnings of consolidated subsidiaries 

minority interests in our consolidated operations were 14 million in 2003 compared to 16 million in 2002 and 15 million in 2001 the decrease in 2003 compared to 2002 is a result of lower earnings at cummins india limited a 51 percentowned subsidiary and wuxi holset ltd a 55 percentowned subsidiary partially offset by income from our 60 percentowned subsidiary in brazil cummins powerent comericio e locação ltda the increase in 2002 minority interests over 2001 is primarily from higher earnings in the operating results of cummins india limited and wuxi holset ltd 

dividends on preferred securities 

dividends on our preferred securities were 11 million in 2003 compared to 21 million in 2002 and 11 million in 2001 we issued our preferred securities in june 2001 through a whollyowned subsidiary and accordingly results in 2001 included dividend payments for only the last two quarters in 2002 results included four quarters of dividend payments while 2003 results included dividend payments for only the first two quarters due to the adoption of a new accounting standard effective july 1 2003 dividends on our preferred securities were prospectively classified as interest expense in our consolidated statements of earnings in accordance with this new standard see note 1 recently adopted accounting pronouncements a description of our obligation relating to these preferred securities is provided in note 9 convertible preferred securities of subsidiary trust of our consolidated financial statements 

cumulative effect of change in accounting principles 

consolidation of a variable interest entity—2003 

as disclosed in our third quarter form 10q we have subsequently evaluated the impact of adopting fasb interpretation no 46 consolidation of variable interest entities fin 46 as it relates to a saleleaseback transaction entered into in 2001 with a variable interest entity vie under the provisions of fin 46 we determined that we are the primary beneficiary of the vie due to a residual value guarantee obligation at the end of the lease term accordingly we have recorded the cumulative effect of consolidating the vie into our consolidated financial statements as a change in accounting principle as of december 31 2003 the cumulative effect of the change was a 6 million charge 4 million aftertax or 009 per share and represents the reversal of the original saleleaseback transaction as if it had not occurred and the consolidation of the vie from the inception of the lease the effect of consolidating the vie into our consolidated statements of financial position was to increase property plant and equipment by a net 92 million its current carrying value as if it had been depreciated since the lease inception and a net increase in longterm debt other liabilities and minority interests by 98 million this transaction is discussed in note 2 of the consolidated financial statements and a description of our leasing transactions is provided in note 18 the consolidation of the vie had no impact on our 2003 consolidated statements of earnings other than the reported cumulative effect at december 31 2003 

change in pension measurement date—2002 

during the fourth quarter of 2002 we changed the measurement date for measuring the investment return on assets invested in our pension plans and our minimum liability for pension plan obligations from september 30 to november 30 this change in measurement date aligns more closely with our fiscal yearend  and we believe provides a more current measurement of plan obligations and investment return on plan assets than previously presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles we have reported this change in our consolidated statements of earnings as a change in accounting principle the cumulative aftertax effect of the change was a 3 million increase in earnings or 007 per share and was recorded as of january 1 2002 see note 1 of the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of this change 

net earnings loss 

net earnings in 2003 were 50 million or 127 per share compared to net earnings of 82 million or 213 per share in 2002 and a net loss of 103 million or 270 per share in 2001 net earnings in 2003 included a net aftertax charge of 4 million for the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle resulting from the consolidation of a financing variable interest entity net earnings in 2002 included a onetime 57 million favorable tax adjustment related to the settlement of income tax audits for the years 1994 through 1999 a pretax credit of 8 million for costs associated with restructuring actions a pretax charge of 8 million related to early retirement of debt and a 3 million aftertax credit for the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle for pensions absent the effects of the onetime tax adjustment the restructuring credit and the charge for early retirement of debt our performance in 2003 improved over 2002 primarily due to higher sales volume and the resulting margin and higher earnings at our joint ventures partially offset by increased selling and administrative expenses and higher interest expense 

net earnings for 2001 included a net aftertax charge of 84 million related to restructuring actions excluding the effects of the onetime tax adjustment restructuring credits loss on early retirement of debt and the cumulative effect of an accounting principle change a majority of the increase in 2002 net earnings compared to 2001 net earnings is attributable to higher sales volume and improved overhead absorption at our manufacturing plants earnings improvement in our filtration and 

other business improved earnings at our joint ventures and alliances and the discontinuance of goodwill amortization partially offset by losses in our power generation business 

business segment results 

we have four reportable business segments engine power generation filtration and other and international distributors this reporting structure is organized according to the products and markets each segment serves and allows management to focus its efforts on providing enhanced service to a wide range of customers we evaluate the performance of each of our business segments based on earnings before interest taxes minority interests and cumulative effect of accounting changes segment ebit and return on average net assets excluding debt taxes and minimum pension liability adjustment 

prior to january 1 2004 intersegment transactions between the engine segment and the power generation segment and between the filtration and other segment and the engine segment have been reported as a transfer at cost and no sale reported by the transferor segment beginning in the first quarter of 2004 such intersegment activity will be reflected at a transfer price which is based upon market pricing discounted for certain items as a result sales in the engine segment and the filtration and other segment are expected to increase as will the amount reflected in eliminations the expected impact on segment ebit cannot be determined since it will depend upon actual volumes and results 

engine business 

the net sales and segment ebit for the engine business segment for the last three years were as follows 



total net sales for the engine business in 2003 increased 196 million or 6 percent compared to 2002 the increase was primarily due to strong sales of our isb engine for the dodge ram truck total automotiverelated engine sales were 71 percent of engine business sales in 2003 compared to 71 percent in 2002 and 67 percent in 2001 

net sales in 2002 increased 314 million or 10 percent compared to net sales in 2001 primarily due to an upturn in demand from heavyduty truck oems prior to the october 1 2002 new emissions standards and strong sales of our midrange engine for the dodge ram truck 

segment ebit increased 21 million in 2003 or 43 percent compared to 2002 the yearoveryear improvement in earnings was primarily a result of higher engine volumes and the accompanying benefits of fixed cost absorption at our manufacturing plants and our consolidation of heavyduty test and assembly operations 20 million higher earnings from joint ventures and alliances 41 million and reduced spending for research and development 7 million partially offset by increases in selling and administrative expenses 38 million the increase in joint venture income was attributable to higher volumes and earnings from our recently expanded china joint venture dongfeng cummins engine co ltd and earnings from our north american distributorships the decrease in research and development expenses was a result of lower spending following the product launch of our 2002 emissionscompliant engines the increase in selling and administrative expenses resulted from higher pension cost and higher variable compensation expense as a consequence of the earnings improvement 

segment ebit in 2002 improved 257 million over the loss incurred in 2001 operating results for 2001 included a 113 million pretax charge for restructuring actions the yearoveryear improvement was primarily attributable to better absorption of fixed costs as a result of higher engine volumes and 

benefits from cost reduction projects during 2002 and 2001 the engine business lowered its breakeven level through restructuring actions and costreduction efforts that were necessary to better align production costs with expected industry demand levels 

a summary and discussion of net sales for the engine business by market follows 



unit shipments for the engine business were 317800 units in 2003 an increase of 9600 units or 3 percent compared to unit shipments a year earlier unit shipments in 2002 were 308200 an increase of 24000 units or 8 percent compared to 2001 shipments a summary of unit shipments by engine category for the last three years follows 



heavyduty truck 

sales to the heavyduty truck market were 11 billion in 2003 up 31 million or 3 percent compared to sales in 2002 the increase was primarily attributable to modest recovery in the north american truck industry evidenced by strong fourth quarter demand as sales increased 15 percent compared to the previous quarter unit shipments of heavyduty truck engines declined 14 percent in 2003 compared 2002 the decrease in 2003 shipments compared to 2002 was a result of the large prebuy activity prior to the north american october 1 2002 epa emissions standards the decline in 2003 volumes was more than offset by the unit price increase in our new isx and ism emissions compliant engines and increased part sales 

in 2002 sales of heavyduty truck engines increased 129 million or 14 percent compared to 2001 the increased sales were primarily in response to accelerated purchases prior to the october 1 2002 date of the new epa emissions standards unit shipments of heavyduty truck engines were 43400 units in 2002 compared to 37900 units in 2001 an increase of 15 percent yearoveryear 

mediumduty truck and bus 

mediumduty truck and bus revenues declined 39 million or 7 percent in 2003 compared to 2002 the majority of the decrease was a result of lower bus engine sales as engine sales for mediumduty trucks were essentially flat compared to 2002 worldwide bus engine sales declined 37 percent in 2003 and unit shipments declined 39 percent primarily in north america due to a decline in market share from a major bus oem and lower engine sales to a china bus oem that were replaced by sales from one of our joint ventures in china 

sales to the mediumduty truck and bus markets increased 22 million or 4 percent in 2002 compared to 2001 reflecting a slight increase in demand as a result of the october 1 2002 emissions standards unit shipments to north american mediumduty truck oems declined 24 percent in 2002 compared to 2001 while shipments to international oems increased 10 percent primarily in asia sales of bus engines declined 8 percent globally compared to 2001 while unit shipments declined 11 percent primarily to international oems as shipments to north american oems declined 3 percent

sales from our lightduty automotive market increased 154 million or 20 percent in 2003 compared to 2002 revenues total unit shipments were 150300 up 21 percent compared to the prior year engine shipments to daimlerchrysler for the dodge ram truck set a record in 2003 increasing 28 percent compared to the prior year primarily driven by increased demand and market share improvement unit shipments of mediumduty engines to the recreational vehicle market declined 13 percent yearoveryear reflecting a prebuy of engine models in 2002 prior to the new emissions standards 

sales to the lightduty automotive market in 2002 increased 205 million or 36 percent compared to 2001 sales total unit shipments increased 27 percent compared to the prior year with shipments to daimlerchrysler up 31 percent primarily driven by the introduction of the new dodge ram truck model in midyear 2002 unit shipments to recreational vehicle oems increased 38 percent yearoveryear from previously weak demand levels reflecting some recovery in consumer markets and growth in the dieselpowered segment of this market 

industrial 

total industrial sales in 2003 to the construction mining marine agricultural oil and gas government and rail markets increased 50 million or 5 percent compared to 2002 while unit shipments declined 2 percent yearoveryear reflecting a change in sales mix to higherpriced engines approximately 39 percent of total industrial unit shipments were to north american markets and 61 percent to international markets sales to the construction segment of this market increased 9 percent yearoveryear with unit shipments to north american oems down 10 percent and shipments to international oems up 9 percent 

unit shipments of our k and q series highhorsepower engines to mine equipment oems in north america declined 6 percent in 2003 while unit shipments to international oems increased 44 percent primarily from gains in market share engine shipments to the marine market declined 20 percent in 2003 compared to 2002 partially as a result of our new joint venture with brunswick corporation cummins mercruiser diesel marine llc sales of our midrange and heavyduty engines for recreational marine applications are now recorded by the joint venture unit shipments of heavyduty engines to the recreational marine market increased 32 percent in 2003 

engine shipments to the agricultural equipment market increased 9 percent compared to 2002 as the 10 percent decline in shipments to north american oems was more than offset by a 32 percent increase in shipments to international oems in latin america engine shipments to the recently entered oil and gas market increased significantly in 2003 compared to a low base in 2002 primarily due to market share penetration in north america with our k series engine sales of highhorsepower engines to the government market primarily v series military applications increased 59 percent in 2003 compared to 2002 unit shipments of our highhorsepower k series engines to the rail equipment market primarily international railcar builders declined 30 percent in 2003 as a result of weakening demand 

industrial engine sales in 2002 declined 42 million or 4 percent compared to 2001 with declines in all major markets with the exception of agricultural which experienced strong demand from sales to 

latin america a majority of the decline in the industrial engine markets was attributable to lower capital spending as oems adjusted to weak market conditions 

consolidation of heavyduty engine assembly 2002 

in the fourth quarter of 2002 we consolidated our heavyduty engine assembly and test operations at our jamestown ny plant this action was part of our continuing effort to reduce production costs approximately 200 positions in the heavyduty engine business at our columbus in plant were eliminated as a result of the consolidation the consolidation was completed during the first quarter of 2003 and the costs of the consolidation were absorbed by current operations 

power generation business 

the net sales and ebit for the power generation business for the last three years were as follows 



net sales in our power generation business were up 103 million or 8 percent compared to 2002 a majority of the sales increase occurred in the second half of the year as general economic conditions improved and demand for commercial power equipment began to recover overall sales of generator drives increased 22 percent alternator sales increased 24 percent sales of small generator sets to the consumer mobilerv market increased 8 percent and sales of commercial generator sets were flat yearoveryear 

power generation net sales in 2002 were down 196 million or 14 percent compared to 2001 a majority of the decline was a result of slow economic growth and weak market demand in the commercial sector as generator set sales declined 26 percent and generator drive sales decreased 24 percent the sales decline was partially offset by increased sales to the consumer mobilerv market up 22 percent compared to 2001 

a summary of engine shipments for power generation by engine category follows 



total unit sales for power generation in 2003 increased 800 units or 3 percent compared to 2002 and 2002 unit sales decreased 4000 units or 14 percent compared to 2001 sales of generator drive units powered by midrange engines were flat compared to 2002 while unit sales of generator sets powered by midrange engines increased 1 percent total sales of heavyduty engines increased 1000 units or 23 percent compared to 2002 shipments of heavyduty powered generator drive units increased 23 percent from a year ago while shipments of heavyduty powered generator sets increased 17 percent highhorsepower unit sales which typically have higher margins decreased 200 units or 4 percent compared to 2002 unit sales of highhorsepower generator drive units increased 5 percent yearoveryear while unit sales of highhorsepower generator sets decreased 15 percent from the prior period the overall increase in 2003 unit sales of generator drive and generator sets is attributable to improvement in commercial markets during the second half of the year sales of power generation equipment in north america were flat in 2003 compared to 2002 with sales to international locations 

up 11 percent primarily in india south pacific brazil mexico and europe alternator sales increased 24 percent in 2003 compared to 2002 while sales of small generator sets for the consumer mobilerv market increased 8 percent reflecting strong demand in this segment and penetration of the consumertowable rv market 

total unit sales to power generation markets in 2002 decreased 4000 units or 14 percent compared to 2001 generator drive units powered by midrange engines increased 18 percent over the same period while unit sales of generator sets powered by midrange engines were down 15 percent total unit sales of heavyduty engines decreased 2600 units or 38 percent compared to 2001 shipments of heavyduty powered generator drive units were down 45 percent from a year ago while shipments of heavyduty powered generator sets decreased 21 percent yearoveryear highhorsepower unit sales decreased 1600 units or 23 percent compared to 2001 unit sales of highhorsepower generator drive units declined 11 percent yearoveryear while unit sales of highhorsepower generator sets decreased 34 percent from the prior period the overall decline in 2002 unit sales of generator drive and generator sets was attributable to weak demand in commercial markets most of the decline in generator drive units for stationary power occurred in north america latin america and europe and was offset by slight increases in shipments to india and southeast asia markets a majority of the decline in generator set units was attributable to weak demand in north america latin america and europe sales of alternators increased 6 percent in 2002 compared to 2001 while sales of small generator sets for the consumer mobilerv market increased 22 percent reflecting strong demand in this segment 

in 2003 power generation incurred a loss before interest and taxes of 15 million compared to a 25 million loss before interest and taxes in 2002 an improvement of 10 million yearoveryear the improvement was attributable to an increase in gross margin on higher sales during the second half of the year 16 million and improved earnings at joint ventures 4 million partially offset by increased selling and administrative expenses 17 million and other items that individually were not material the increase in sales was a result of modest demand improvement primarily in the second half of the year as overall economic conditions began to improve 

in 2002 power generation incurred a loss before interest and taxes of 25 million compared to segment ebit of 74 million in 2001 the overall decline in earnings before interest and taxes yearoveryear was attributable to a number of factors first was the decline in volume due to weak market conditions second was a shift in sales mix with a decline in unit shipments of higher margin heavyduty and highhorsepower products to midrange powered products third the overall decline in sales volume resulted in underabsorption of fixed overhead costs at our manufacturing facilities fourth excess inventory in the marketplace continued to create pricing pressures resulting in heavier discounting to retain market share finally utilization of power generations rental fleet was lower in 2002 compared to 2001 due to overall weak demand resulting in lower profitability of our rental fleet business 

filtration and other business 

the net sales and segment ebit for the filtration and other business segment for the three years ended december 31 2003 were as follows 



the filtration and other business achieved record net sales in 2003 topping the 1 billion mark as sales increased 105 million or 11 percent compared to 2002 sales of filtration products in the us increased 63 million or 12 percent compared to 2002 sales while sales to international locations also 

increased 12 percent most notably in europe asia australia and south africa partially offset by sales declines in canada and mexico the increase in sales was primarily volume related and reflected higher oem demand and increased aftermarket sales of filtration products sales of holset turbochargers increased 22 percent in 2003 compared to 2002 with strong demand from oems aftermarket sales and sales to joint ventures partially offset by sales declines in china due to lower market share caused by local sourcing 

filtration and other business sales in 2002 were up 62 million or 7 percent compared to 2001 sales revenues from filtration products in the us increased 30 million or 6 percent over 2001 reflecting demand improvement and increased market penetration at north american oems sales to oems in europe australia mexico and other international locations also increased in 2002 compared to 2001 sales of holset turbochargers increased 15 percent compared to 2001 primarily from strong demand in china approximately 27 percent of the increase in 2002 net sales for this segment is attributable to holset products 

segment ebit for the filtration and other business declined 8 million or 9 percent compared to 2002 earnings were lower in 2003 primarily from higher selling and administrative expenses 19 million and research and engineering expenses 5 million offset by volume driven improvement in gross margin 13 million and improved earnings at joint ventures 2 million most of the increase in selling and administrative expenses was attributable to the incremental costs of funding targeted growth initiatives increased logistics costs and higher employee benefit costs including pensions 

segment ebit for the filtration and other business in 2002 was up 30 million or 47 percent compared to 2001 the improved profitability was driven by increased volumes and the discontinuance of approximately 9 million in goodwill amortization in addition benefits from restructuring actions and six sigma cost reduction efforts helped to offset incremental startup expenses from this segments new emission solutions business 

international distributor business 

the net sales and segment ebit for the international distributor business segment for the three years ended december 31 2003 were as follows 



2003 was a record sales year for our international distributor business aided by strong fourth quarter sales sales increased 95 million in 2003 or 17 percent compared to 2002 engine sales were relatively flat yearoveryear while part sales increased 31 percent in 2003 and sales of power generation equipment increased 50 percent primarily at our dubai distributor sales increased at all distributor locations with the exception of hong kong and zimbabwe with significant increases in australia india south africa dubai and central europe primarily the uk and ireland 

net sales in the international distributor business increased 12 million in 2002 or 2 percent compared to 2001 sales of parts and engines increased at distributor locations in australia east and southeast asia partially offset by sales declines in latin america primarily argentina and central europe predominantly germany sales in 2001 included 42 million of sales to certain oems that are now classified and reported as sales in the engine business this reporting change did not affect earnings results in either business segment 

segment ebit for the international distributor business increased 11 million in 2003 or 38 percent compared to 2002 the increase in earnings was attributable to improved gross margin from higher sales volumes 24 million partially offset by increases in volume variable expenditures 

primarily selling and administrative expenses 19 million the 3 million earnings improvement in 2002 compared to 2001 was primarily a result of increased engine parts and service sales at our distributors in east asia southeast asia and south pacific offset by lower sales from distributors in central europe primarily germany 

geographic markets 

sales to international markets in 2003 were 294 billion or 47 percent of total net sales compared to 265 billion or 45 percent of total net sales in 2002 and 264 billion or 46 percent of total net sales in 2001 a summary of our net sales by geographic territory for the last three years follows 



shipments of heavyduty truck engines to international markets in 2003 were relatively flat compared to a year ago down 1 percent primarily in central europe partially offset by increased sales to oems in mexico and asia shipments of midrange automotive engines to international markets increased 14 percent in 2003 compared to 10 percent growth in 2002 primarily to oems in latin america and brazil engine shipments to international bus markets increased 5 percent compared to a year ago primarily to europe and china shipments of lightduty automotive engines to international markets increased 4 percent in 2003 compared to 2002 industrial engine shipments to international locations increased 5 percent in 2003 compared to 2002 primarily to agricultural oems up 32 percent on strong demand in latin america and to construction equipment markets up 9 percent primarily in asia engine shipments to international mining markets increased 44 percent and shipments to rail markets decreased 29 percent from the prior year 

sales to the asiaaustralia region increased 89 million or 9 percent compared to 2002 primarily from increased demand for engines and generator drives sales at our australian distributorship and the favorable impact of currency changes sales to europecis representing 28 percent of international sales and 13 percent of total sales in 2003 increased 8 percent compared to the prior year mostly in the midrange truck markets in the uk and our distribution business in the uk and ireland sales in mexico and latin america increased 52 million or 12 percent in 2003 compared to 2002 primarily from higher sales to agricultural oems and higher power generation revenues sales to canada representing 10 percent of international sales and 5 percent of total sales in 2003 increased 3 percent compared to 2002 sales to africa and the middle east increased 75 million or 47 percent in 2003 compared to 2002 primarily from engine and parts sales at our distributors in dubai and south africa 

net sales to international markets increased 15 million or less than 1 percent in 2002 compared to 2001 sales decreased in all geographic regions in 2002 with the exception of asia and australia up 122 million or 14 percent primarily driven by higher sales to china and higher sales at our distributor locations in those regions and asia africa and the middle east where sales increased 30 million or 23 percent 

liquidity and capital resources 

overview of capital structure 

since fiscal 2000 we have made a strategic effort to improve our cost structure and improve efficiencies from continuing operations through monetization of assets and restructuring actions as a result we have undertaken various initiatives to improve cash flow reduce debt obligations and improve our financial flexibility our operations have historically generated sufficient cash to fund our businesses capital expenditures research and development and dividend payments cash provided by continuing operations is a major source of our working capital funding at certain times cash provided by operations is subject to seasonal fluctuations and as a result we use periodic borrowings primarily our receivable securitization program and our revolving credit facility to fund our working capital requirements 

we entered into our receivable securitization program in the fourth quarter of 2000 to provide a costeffective method to fund our trade accounts receivable this program diversified our funding base by providing a flexible source of funding that is not reported on our balance sheet in december 2003 this program expired and there were no amounts outstanding under the program as of december 31 2003 in january 2004 we entered into a similar type of program with a different financial institution a more complete description of this accounts receivable securitization program which discloses certain cash flows related to the program is found below under the caption off balance sheet financing—accounts receivable securitization program and in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements  we have available various short and longterm credit arrangements which are discussed below and disclosed in note 8 borrowing arrangements of our consolidated financial statements  

we believe our cash generated from operations credit arrangements and our accounts receivable securitization program provide the financial flexibility required to satisfy future shortterm funding requirements for our debt service obligations capital spending pension funding and projected working capital requirements our next major fixed cash payment obligation occurs in march 2005 when our 645 notes with principal amount of 225 million mature we expect to refinance or repay all or a portion of the principal amount of these notes prior to their maturity date as of december 31 2003 our total debt including convertible subordinated debentures was 1429 billion compared to 1428 billion including our preferred securities of subsidiary trust at december 31 2002 included in longterm debt at december 31 2003 is 90 million attributable to consolidating a leasing entity in which we have a variable interest see notes 2 and 8 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements  total debt including our convertible subordinated debentures and in 2002 our preferred securities of subsidiary trust as a percentage of our total capital including total longterm debt was 601 percent at december 31 2003 compared to 629 percent at december 31 2002 based on projected cash flows from operations and existing credit facilities management believes the company has sufficient liquidity to meet anticipated capital debt and dividend requirements in the foreseeable future 

restructuring actions 

during 2000 2001 and 2002 we recorded significant charges to restructure our operations largely focused in our engine business these actions and the resulting charges were primarily taken in response to the downturn in the north american trucking industry and related conditions and included workforce reductions asset impairment losses termination of a new engine development program and other charges total net cash outflows associated with these actions approximated 91 million including 2 million in 2003 25 million in 2002 and 59 million in 2001 the associated annual savings of these restructuring actions were estimated at 97 million the restructuring actions we have taken during the last three years are described in note 7 to the consolidated financial statements  all of our 

restructuring actions are complete and there are no future cash payment obligations related to these programs 

2002 financing activity 

in november 2002 we issued 250 million of unsecured 95 senior notes that mature in 2010 proceeds from the issuance were approximately 244 million net of debt issue costs and were used to repay our 125 million 625 notes that matured in march 2003 and for general corporate purposes including repayment of balances outstanding at the end of 2002 under our receivable securitization program interest on the notes is payable on june 1 and december 1 each year we can redeem the notes in whole or in part at any time after december 1 2006 at a premium value equal to 10475 of par declining to par in 2008 plus accrued interest 

in connection with the 2002 senior notes offering we agreed to file an exchange offer registration statement with the sec and complete that offer no later than may 19 2003 as a result of the delay in filing our 2002 annual report on form 10k with the sec we were unable to complete the exchange offer and became contractually obligated to pay additional interest on the notes for each 90day delay in the completion of the exchange offer the premium interest rate on the notes increased by an additional 025 per annum up to a 1 maximum increase until such time as the exchange offer is completed as of december 31 2003 we were paying an additional 075 interest on the notes and the total amount of premium paid in 2003 was 07 million the exchange offer registration statement was declared effective on february 24 2004 upon completion of the exchange offer expected in march 2004 the interest rate on the notes will return to 95 a more complete description of our senior notes is disclosed in note 8 of the consolidated financial statements  

available credit capacity 

the following table provides the components of available credit capacity as of december 31 2003 



1 our receivable program expired in december 2003 in january 2004 we entered into a new threeyear agreement for a similar revolving accounts receivable program with a different financial institution see discussion below under the caption off balance sheet financing—accounts receivable securitization program cash flows 

the following table summarizes the key elements of our cash flows for the last three years 



operating activities net cash provided by operating activities declined 35 million in 2003 the decrease was largely due to lower net earnings down 32 million yearoveryear partially offset by 21 million of noncash reversal of restructuring actions in 2002 in addition net noncash adjustments for equity in earnings of investees decreased 45 million yearoveryear due to higher joint venture earnings while noncash adjustments for minority interests declined 2 million cash from operations benefited by receiving 22 million from joint ventures in 2003 compared to 12 million of cash received in 2002 cash from operations was also impacted by contributions to our pension plans of 118 million in 2003 compared to 81 million in 2002 or an incremental cash outflow of 37 million net changes in working capital consumed 95 million of cash during 2003 compared to 126 million in 2002 or an improvement in net cash used for working capital of 38 million the change in net cash used for working capital was comprised of a reduction in accounts receivable of 23 million and a 55 million decrease in the repayment of sold receivables which improved working capital yearoveryear by 78 million part of this improvement was offset by a 63 million increase in inventory compared to a 46 million decrease in inventory a year ago or a net use of 109 million in working capital most of the increase in inventory is a result of higher production levels necessary to meet increased demand accounts payable accrued expenses and other items provided 32 million of working capital in 2003 compared to a use of 30 million in 2002 with most of the increase resulting from higher pension liabilities and variable compensation 

investing activities net cash used in investing activities was 135 million in 2003 compared to 152 million a year ago or a decrease of 17 million a majority of the decrease was from lower investments in and advances to our joint ventures down 56 million in 2003 compared to 2002 the advances include both longterm investment and shortterm funding for working capital needs of our joint ventures earnings at our joint ventures improved significantly in 2003 compared to 2002 requiring less funding partially offsetting the higher advances to joint ventures in 2002 were 32 million in proceeds from business dispositions cash outflows for capital expenditures and software increased 21 million and 9 million respectively in 2003 compared to 2002 primarily in the second half of the year as business conditions improved and spending levels increased cash outflows for capital expenditures are expected to range between 125 million and 135 million in 2004 purchases of marketable securities used 137 million of cash during 2003 compared to 116 million in purchases a year ago or a 21 million cash outflow from investing activities primarily at cummins india limited cil this decrease however was more than offset by 134 million in cash proceeds from the sale of marketable securities in 2003 compared to 86 million in cash proceeds from securities sales a year ago or a net cash inflow of 27 million yearoveryear again primarily from investing activities at cil 

financing activities during 2003 our financing activities resulted in a cash outflow of 145 million compared to a cash inflow of 131 million a year ago a majority of the cash inflow in 2002 resulted from the issuance of our 250 million 95 senior notes during the fourth quarter net proceeds from this issuance were used to repay borrowings under our accounts receivable securitization program at the end of 2002 and for payment of our 125 million 625 notes that matured in march 2003 net borrowings of less than 90 days under our shortterm credit arrangements provided 7 million of cash in 2003 compared to a net 4 million cash outflow in 2002 cash proceeds from the issuance of common stock were 52 million in 2003 compared to 15 million in 2002 or an increase of 37 million the increase is attributable to the exercise of a significant number of common stock options during the second half of the year due to favorable market conditions additional cash outflows from financing activities during 2003 and 2002 were 50 million in dividend payments on common stock other financing transactions used 23 million in cash in 2003 compared to 1 million used in 2002 or a net cash ouflow of 22 million primarily from dividends paid to minority shareholders and retirement of common stock 

cash and cash equivalents decreased 116 million during 2003 and were 108 million at the end of the year compared to 224 million at the beginning of the year cash and cash equivalents were higher 

in 2002 as a result of receiving 244 million in proceeds in the fourth quarter from the issuance of our 95 senior notes 

cash requirements 

a summary of payments due for our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december 31 2003 is shown in the tables below 

 1 pension funding obligations are included only for 2004 as the amount of our funding obligations beyond the next year are not yet determinable  financial covenants and credit rating 

a number of our contractual obligations and financing agreements such as our revolving credit facility and our equipment saleleaseback agreements have restrictive covenants andor pricing modifications that may be triggered in the event of downward revisions to our corporate credit rating our corporate credit rating is determined by independent credit rating agencies and comprises an annual assessment of the creditworthiness of our debt securities and other obligations it is intended to measure the probability of the timely repayment of principal and interest of our notes and shortterm debt generally a higher credit rating leads to a more favorable effect on the marketability of our debt instruments in the capital markets a credit rating of baa3 or higher by moodys or a rating of bbb or higher by standard  poors two of the major credit rating agencies is considered investment grade currently the corporate credit rating of our debt securities is below investment grade 

in april 2002 moodys lowered our longterm and shortterm debt ratings primarily as a result of the continued weakness in the north american heavyduty truck market our senior unsecured longterm debt rating was lowered from baa3 to ba1 with a stable outlook the shortterm rating which applies to our shortterm borrowings was lowered to notprime from prime3 at the same time standard  poors reaffirmed its rating of cummins debt at bbb and expected our liquidity and credit protection measures to remain satisfactory for the current rating 

in october 2002 moodys confirmed the longterm rating of our senior debt at ba1 but changed the outlook to negative from stable also in october standard  poors lowered our corporate credit rating to bb from bbb with a negative outlook primarily as a result of declining power generation sales and weak demand in the heavy and mediumduty truck industry in november 2002 moodys 

lowered our longterm senior unsecured debt rating from ba1 to ba2 as a result of our securing borrowings under the revolving credit facility also in november 2002 fitch initiated coverage of our debt and has not revised their rating since that time 

any rating can be revised upward or downward or withdrawn at any time by a rating agency if it decides the circumstances warrant that change and there can be no assurance that our debt ratings will not be lowered further or withdrawn by a rating agency any future lowering of our debt ratings could further increase the cost of our financing agreements and arrangements and may have a negative impact on our ability to access the capital markets or borrow funds at current rates we expect our corporate credit rating to be reviewed again in midyear 2004 

our current ratings and ratings outlook from each of the credit rating agencies are shown in the table below each of the ratings should be viewed independently of any other rating 



we do not believe a further downgrade of our credit rating will have a material impact on our financial results financial condition or access to sufficient liquidity however one of our goals is to regain an investment grade credit rating from the rating agencies to achieve that goal we have put significant management focus on increasing earnings improving cash flow and reducing financial leverage a discussion of the impact of the credit ratings on our financing arrangements follows 

revolving credit facility 

in november 2002 we entered into a new revolving credit facility that replaced our prior revolving credit facility the credit facility provides for aggregate borrowings of up to 385 million and is available on a revolving basis for a period of three years borrowings are primarily available in us dollars although up to 60 million of the new credit facility is available for multicurrency borrowing and letters of credit up to 150 million is available for letters of credit and up to 50 million is available for swingline loans we and a number of our subsidiaries are permitted to borrow and obtain letters of credit under the new revolving credit facility although the aggregate amount of borrowings by and letters of credit issued for the benefit of our subsidiaries under the new facility may not exceed 60 million 

we guarantee all borrowings of our subsidiaries under the revolving credit facility in addition our principal domestic subsidiaries guarantee all borrowings under the revolving credit facility although certain of those guarantees are limited by the terms of our existing public indenture which governs a number of our existing notes and debentures that restrict the ability of our subsidiaries to incur or guarantee indebtedness and are limited by similar terms in the indenture governing our 250 million senior notes 

borrowings under the revolving credit facility other than swingline loans bear interest at a rate equal to at our option 

• the london interbank offered rate libor plus a spread ranging from 0875 percent to 25 percent based on our credit rating and utilization of the credit facility or 39 

• the alternate base rate rate or abr which is the greater of the administrative agents prime rate and the federal funds effective rate plus 05 percent plus a spread ranging from 0 percent to 15 percent based on our credit rating and utilization of the credit facility following the november 2002 downgrade from moodys discussed above the effective rate of interest on our borrowings under the revolving credit facility increased from libor plus 175 basis points 175 to libor plus 200 basis points 20 the effective rate of interest on our borrowings under the revolving credit facility also increases 125 basis points 125 when more than onethird of our borrowing capacity is utilized in january 2004 we issued a letter of credit to a financial institution that resulted in the aggregate amount of letters of credit outstanding under this facility to exceed onethird of our borrowing base as a result interest on our borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility increased from libor plus 200 basis points 20 to libor plus 2125 basis points 2125 

swingline loans bear interest at the abr plus a spread based on our credit rating and utilization of the new revolving credit facility or such other rate as is agreed to by us and the swingline lender we are required to pay quarterly facility fees on unused commitments under the new revolving credit facility which fees are based upon our credit rating we also are required to pay an annual administration fee to the administrative agent for the facility 

our obligations and the obligations of our subsidiaries under the revolving credit facility are collateralized by security interests in substantially all of our assets and the assets of our domestic subsidiaries that guarantee obligations under the facility other than shares of stock or indebtedness of our subsidiaries that are restricted subsidiaries under the terms of our existing public indenture and other than assets that are considered principal properties of ours or of our restricted subsidiaries under the terms of our existing public indenture 

the terms of the revolving credit facility contain covenants that restrict our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to among other things incur liens enter into sale and leaseback transactions enter into merger consolidation or asset sale transactions dispose of capital stock of subsidiaries incur subsidiary indebtedness and enter into swap transactions the revolving credit facility also restricts our ability to under the terms of our existing public indenture redesignate unrestricted subsidiaries as restricted subsidiaries or designate future subsidiaries as restricted subsidiaries the revolving credit facility also contains the following financial covenants 

• we may not permit our net worth which as defined in the credit agreement excludes the minimum pension liability and other adjustments to fall below an amount equal to the sum of 1 115 billion and 2 25 percent of the sum of our consolidated net earnings for each of the fiscal quarters commencing after september 29 2002 to and including the most recent fiscal quarter prior to the date on which the net worth calculation is made and 3 75 percent of the amount by which our net worth has increased as a result of our issuance of capital stock after september 29 2002 • we may not permit the ratio of 1 the sum of our consolidated indebtedness and our securitization financings to 2 the sum of our consolidated indebtedness securitization financings and net worth to be equal to or greater than 055 to 10 and • we may not permit the ratio of 1 our consolidated ebitda minus capital expenditures to 2 our consolidated interest expense for any period of four consecutive quarters to be less than 150 to 10 for purposes of the financial covenants described above net worth consolidated net income consolidated indebtedness consolidated ebitda consolidated interest expense and other financial measurements are calculated in the manner provided by the terms of the revolving credit facility agreement 

as of december 31 2003 there were no borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility and we were in compliance with all of the covenants of that agreement 

off balance sheet financing 

sale of accounts receivable 

we entered into our accounts receivable securitization program in december 2000 under the terms of this program we were required to maintain a minimum investment grade credit rating in our longterm senior unsecured debt as a result of the moodys downgrade in april 2002 we renegotiated the terms of the securitization agreement and amended the requirement to maintain a minimum investment grade credit rating the terms of the amendment provided for an increase in the interest rate and fees under the program of approximately 05 million annually at then current funding levels as of december 31 2003 and 2002 there were no proceeds outstanding under this program 

in december 2003 this program expired and in january 2004 we entered into a similar agreement with a different financial institution for a threeyear revolving accounts receivable program under the terms of the new agreement we sell an interest in a designated pool of trade receivables to a new whollyowned special purpose subsidiary cummins trade receivables llc ctr the program is similar to our previous program except that the financial institution purchases an interest in the receivables directly rather than utilizing a commercial paper conduit the maximum amount of trade receivables that can be sold and outstanding at any point in time is limited to the lesser of 200 million or the amount of eligible receivables held by ctr there are no provisions in the new agreement that require us to maintain a minimum investment credit rating however the terms of the agreement contain the same financial covenants as those described above under our revolving credit facility 

saleleaseback transactions 

in 2001 we entered into a saleleaseback agreement with a variable interest entity vie whereby we sold certain manufacturing equipment and leased it back under an operating lease as a result of the moodys downgrade in april 2002 and the standard  poors downgrade in october 2002 we were required under the lease agreement to obtain irrevocable unconditional standby letters of credit in an amount of 64 million the letters of credit were posted to the benefit of the equipment lessor and lenders and will remain in effect until we achieve and maintain a minimum investment grade credit rating for 12 consecutive months if we had been unable to obtain these letters of credit we would have satisfied our obligation under the lease agreement by borrowing funds under our revolving credit facility and posting the proceeds as collateral the november 2002 downgrade by moodys had no effect on this agreement note 18 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements describes the saleleaseback transaction 

in december 2003 we evaluated the impact of adopting fasb interpretation no 46 consolidation of variable interest entities fin 46 as it relates to the saleleaseback transaction described above under the provisions of fin 46 we determined that we had a variable interest in the lessor entity by virtue of our guaranteeing the residual value of the equipment at the end of the lease term and were deemed the primary beneficiary of the vie as a result we have consolidated the vie in our consolidated financial statements and recorded the cumulative effect of this change as a change in accounting principle effective december 31 2003 the cumulative effect of this change was 6 million before related tax effects of 2 million see note 2 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements  the consolidation of the vie had no affect on our current credit rating 

in september 2001 we entered into two saleleaseback transactions with an aggregate value of 18 million whereby we sold and leased back two aircraft the leases were accounted for as operating leases the transactions resulted in the recording of a pretax deferred gain of 8 million that is being amortized over the life of the leases as a reduction in rent expense the base lease term for both leases 

is 124 months and provides for an early buyout option in january 2009 at expected fair market value or we may purchase the aircraft at the end of the lease term for its then fair market value 

powerrent business 

in 1999 our power generation business entered into an ongoing leasing program in which it builds and sells power generation equipment inventory to a financial institution and leases the equipment and related components back under a threemonth noncancelable lease arrangement with subsequent renewals on a monthly basis up to a maximum of 36 months the equipment is sold at cost and pursuant to lease accounting rules the excess of the fair value of the equipment sold over its cost is recognized as prepaid rent and reflects the normal profit margin that would have been realized at the time of sale the margins on the equipment sales are deferred and the leases recorded as operating leases the prepaid rent is amortized ratably over the accounting lease term upon termination of the leases through a sale of the equipment to a third party the previously deferred margins on the sale to the financial institution are recorded as income we sublease the equipment to customers under shortterm rental agreements with terms that vary based upon customer and geographic region 

during 2002 and 2003 we entered into new leases for portions of the equipment 29 million in 2002 and 34 million in 2003 with a different lessor the new leases had a minimum twoyear noncancellable lease term with monthly renewal options for the 2002 transaction and four sixmonth renewal options for the 2003 transaction the deferred margin associated with the equipment that transferred to the new lessors remains unchanged as there was not an ultimate sale to a third party 

at the end of the renewal terms we may either negotiate a lease extension with the lessor purchase the equipment based on rates derived from the equipments expected residual value or arrange the sale of the equipment to an unrelated third party for fair market value when the equipment is sold we are obligated to pay the lessor the difference if any between the sales proceeds of the equipment and the lessors unamortized value of the equipment up to the maximum amount of the residual guarantee for one lessor the residual guarantee is equal to 87 percent of the current unamortized balance for the second lessor the residual guarantee ranges from 64 percent to 78 percent of the equipments original cost the maximum amount of the guarantees at december 31 2003 at the end of the respective minimum legal lease terms was 106 million the lessor or we may terminate the leasing program at any time with respect to any equipment not yet leased in the event of such termination we must arrange for and effect not later than one year from the termination date or upon expiration of the lease term whichever occurs first a termination of all leased equipment and a sale of all equipment provided that in the event the program is terminated or the equipment is sold the unguaranteed residual value of the equipment shall equal 0 should the lessor terminate the leasing program we have the right to purchase all of the equipment at its then unamortized value not later than one year from the termination date or upon expiration of the lease term whichever occurs first since the inception of the rental program we have not incurred any losses on equipment sales under this program 

financing arrangements for related parties 

in accordance with the provisions of various joint venture agreements we may purchase products and components from the joint ventures sell products and components to the joint ventures and the joint ventures may sell products and components to unrelated parties the transfer price of products purchased from the joint ventures may differ from normal selling prices certain joint ventures agreements transfer product to us at cost some transfer product to us on a costplus basis and other agreements provide for the transfer of products at market value 

we purchase significant quantities of midrange diesel and natural gas engines components and service parts from consolidated diesel company cdc an unconsolidated general partnership the partnership was formed in 1980 with j i case case to jointly fund engine development and 

manufacturing capacity cummins and case now cnh global nv are general partners and each partner shares 50 percent ownership in cdc under the terms of the agreement cdc is obligated to make its entire production of diesel engines and related products available solely to the partners each partner is entitled to purchase up to onehalf of cdcs actual production and a partner may purchase in excess of onehalf of actual production to the extent productive capacity is available beyond the other partners purchase requirement the partners are each obligated unconditionally and severally to purchase annually at least one engine or engine kit produced by cdc provided a minimum of one engine or engine kit is produced the transfer price of cdcs engines to the partners must be sufficient to cover its manufacturing cost in such annual accounting period including interest and financing expenses but excluding depreciation expense other than scheduled depreciation expense as defined in the agreement in addition each partner is obligated to contribute onehalf of the capital investment required to maintain plant capacity and each partner has the right to invest unilaterally in plant capacity which additional capacity is available to the other partner for a fee to date neither partner has made a unilateral investment in plant capacity at cdc 

we are not a guarantor of any of cdcs obligations or commitments however we are required as a partner to provide up to 50 percent of cdcs base working capital as defined by the agreement the amount of base working capital is calculated each quarter and if supplemental funding greater than the base working capital amount is required the amount is funded through third party financing arranged by cdc or we may elect to fund the requirement although we are under no obligation to do so to date when supplemental funding is required above the base working capital amount we have elected to provide that funding to cdc if the amount of supplemental funding required is less than the base working capital amount it is funded equally by the partners excess cash generated by cdc is remitted to cummins until cdcs working capital amount is reduced to the base working capital amount any further cash remittances from cdc to the partners are shared equally by the partners 

financing arrangements and guarantees of distributors residual value guarantees and other guarantees and indemnifications 

north american distributors 

we have entered into an operating agreement with a financial institution that requires us to guarantee revolving loans equipment term loans and leases real property loans and letters of credit made by the financial institution to certain independent cummins and onan distributors in the united states and to certain distributors in which we own an equity interest under the terms of the operating agreement our guarantee of any particular financing is limited to the amount of the financing in excess of a particular distributors borrowing base the borrowing base is equal to the amount that the distributor could borrow from the financial institution without cummins guarantee 

under the terms of the operating agreement if any distributor is in default under any financing or if we default under the financial covenants of our 385 million revolving credit agreement we will be required to guarantee the entire amount of each distributor financing if our senior unsecured debt has a credit rating of less than ba2 from moodys or less than bb from standard  poors we will be required to pay to the financial institution a monthly fee equal to 050 percent per annum on the daily average outstanding balance of each financing arrangement further if any distributor defaults under any financing arrangement then we will also be required to purchase the assets of that distributor 

in january 2004 we issued a letter of credit to the financial institution in the amount of 30 million covering the distributor borrowings in excess of their borrowing base as a result we are no longer subject to the credit ratings trigger contained in the operating agreement provided we maintain and annually renew this letter of credit 

the operating agreement will continue in effect until february 7 2007 and may be renewed for additional oneyear terms as of december 31 2003 we had 25 million of guarantees outstanding under the operating agreement relating to distributor borrowings of 119 million 

we have entered into a guarantee agreement with a canadian financial institution in which we have agreed to guarantee borrowings of an independent distributor in canada under the terms of the agreement our guarantee of any individual financing arrangement between the distributor and the financial institution is limited to 50 percent of the aggregate principal amount of the financing as of december 31 2003 we had 9 million of guarantees outstanding under this guarantee agreement relating to the distributors borrowings of 17 million 

residual value guarantees—leased equipment 

as more fully discussed in note 18 of the notes to consolidated financial statements  we have various residual value guarantees on equipment leased under operating leases the amounts of those guarantees at december 31 2003 are summarized as follows 



other guarantees 

in addition to the guarantees discussed above from time to time we enter into other guarantee arrangements including sale of foreign receivables with recourse and other miscellaneous guarantees of third party debt the maximum potential loss related to these other guarantees is 23 million at december 31 2003 

indemnifications 

periodically we enter into various contractual arrangements where we agree to indemnify a third party against certain types of losses common types of indemnifications include 

• product liability and license patent or trademark indemnifications as discussed more fully in note 1 of our consolidated financial statements • asset sale agreements where we agree to indemnify the purchaser against future environmental exposures related to the asset sold and • any contractual agreement where we agree to indemnify the counterparty for losses suffered as a result of a misrepresentation in the contract because the indemnifications are not related to specific known liabilities and due to their uncertain nature we are unable to estimate the maximum amount of the potential loss associated with these indemnifications 

application of critical accounting policies 

a summary of our significant accounting policies is included in note 1 of our consolidated financial statements of this annual report we believe the application of our accounting policies on a consistent basis enables us to provide financial statement users with useful reliable and timely information about our earnings results financial position and cash flows 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles that often require management to make judgments estimates and assumptions regarding uncertainties that affect the reported amounts presented and disclosed in the financial statements our management reviews these estimates and assumptions based on historical experience 

changes in business conditions and other relevant factors they believe to be reasonable under the circumstances in any given reporting period our actual results may differ from the estimates and assumptions used in preparing our consolidated financial statements 

critical accounting policies are those that may have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and also require management to exercise significant judgment due to a high degree of uncertainty at the time estimates are made our senior management has discussed the development and selection of our accounting policies related accounting estimates and the disclosures set forth below with the audit committee of our board of directors we believe our critical accounting policies include those addressing the estimation of liabilities for product coverage programs accounting for income taxes and pension benefits and estimates under our powerrent program 

product coverage costs 

we estimate and record a liability for product coverage programs other than product recalls at the time our products are sold our estimates are based on historical experience and reflect managements best estimates of expected costs at the time products are sold and subsequent adjustment to those expected costs when actual costs differ as a result of uncertainty surrounding the nature and frequency of product recall programs the liability for such programs is recorded when the recall action is announced our warranty liability is affected by component failure rates repair costs and the time of failure future events and circumstances related to these factors could materially change our estimates and require adjustments to our liability new product launches require a greater use of judgment in developing estimates until historical experience becomes available product specific experience is typically available four or five quarters after product launch with a clear experience trend evident eight quarters after launch we record product coverage expense for new products upon shipment using a factor based upon historical experience only in the first year a blend of actual product and historical experience in the second year and product specific experience thereafter note 1 of the consolidated financial statements contains a summary of the activity in our product coverage liability account for 2003 and 2002 including adjustments to preexisting warranties 

accounting for income taxes 

we determine our provision for income taxes using the asset and liability method under this method deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax effects of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases future tax benefits of tax loss and credit carryforwards are also recognized as deferred tax assets we evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets each quarter by assessing the likelihood of future profitability and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize our net deferred tax assets at december 31 2003 the company has recorded net deferred tax assets of 843 million these assets include 381 million for the value of tax loss and credit carryforwards that generally have a limited life and begin expiring in 2008 the ultimate realization of our net deferred tax assets will require a higher level of profitability than the company has achieved in recent years having assessed the future profit plans and tax planning strategies together with the years of expiration of carryforward benefits a valuation allowance of 43 million has been recorded to reduce the tax assets to the net value management believes is more likely than not to be realized should the companys operating performance not improve future assessments could conclude that a larger valuation allowance will be needed to further reduce the deferred tax assets factors that may affect our ability to achieve a higher level of profitability include but are not limited to a decline in sales or gross margin loss of market share increased competition and existing and future regulatory emissions standards in addition we operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and are subject to tax audits in these jurisdictions these audits can involve complex issues which may require an extended period of time to resolve however we believe we have made adequate provision for income taxes for 

all years that are subject to audit a more complete description of our income taxes and the future benefits of our tax loss and credit carryforwards are disclosed in note 12 to the consolidated financial statements  

pension benefits 

we sponsor a number of pension plans in the us the uk and various other countries in the us and the uk we have several major defined benefit plans that are separately funded we account for our pension programs in accordance with sfas no 87 employers accounting for pensions which requires that amounts recognized in financial statements be determined using an actuarial basis as a result our pension benefit programs are based on a number of statistical and judgmental assumptions that attempt to anticipate future events and are used in calculating the expense and liability related to our plans these assumptions include discount rates used to value liabilities assumed rates of return on plan assets future compensation increases and employee turnover rates in addition there are also subjective actuarial assumptions relating to retirement age mortality rates and participant withdrawals the actuarial assumptions we use may differ significantly from actual results due to changing economic conditions participant life span and withdrawal rates these differences may result in a material impact to the amount of pension expense to be recorded in our consolidated financial statements in the future  

the table below presents the key components that have impacted our pension liability for the three previous years 



as a result of lower investment returns experienced in 2001 and 2002 we changed our pension plan asset return assumptions which had an impact on pension expense and pension liability in 2003 our expected longterm rate of return on assets was lowered to 85 percent in the us and 844 percent for nonus plans with consultation from and the concurrence of our actuaries the effect of lowering this rate of return assumption increased our 2003 pension expense as measured in accordance with sfas no 87 by approximately 30 million compared to the amount recorded in 2002 total pension expense increased 40 million in 2003 compared to 2002 during 2002 the actual asset returns for our pension plans was a negative 140 percent and was adversely affected by the decline in equity markets in 2003 our actual return on plan assets was 308 percent and was affected by favorable equity markets we do not expect to change our rate of return assumption on pension plan assets for 2004 in addition the discount rate for our us plans declined from 70 percent at november 30 2002 to 625 percent at november 30 2003 and from 591 percent at november 30 2002 to 566 percent at november 30 2003 for our nonus plans 

pension expense in any given period is determined based upon the value of pension plan assets as compared to the service cost of pension liabilities the actuarial cost of benefits earned during the period and the interest on those liabilities the expected longterm rate of return on plan assets is applied to a calculated value of plan assets that recognizes changes in fair value over a fiveyear period this practice is intended to reduce yeartoyear volatility in recorded pension expense but it can also have the effect of delaying the recognition of differences between the actual return on plan assets and 

the expected return based on longterm rate of return assumptions as a result of this practice prior period reductions in the value of plan assets may continue to impact pension expense in future periods 

our pension expense was 61 million in 2003 while 2004 pension expense is expected to be approximately 85 million our 2004 pension expense will depend upon a number of variables and assumptions including discount rates actual asset returns and other factors as previously discussed the table below sets forth the estimated impact on our 2004 pension expense relative to a change in the discount rate while we do not presently anticipate further adjustments to our expected rate of return on plan assets the following table also illustrates the impact on expected 2004 pension expense relative to a change in the expected rate of return on plan assets 



below is a summary of how our pension plan assets were allocated as of november 30 2003 and 2002 our investment policy provides a range of plus or minus 3 percent from the target allocation 

 actual cash funding for our pension plans is governed by employee benefit and tax laws and the job creation and worker assistance act of 2002 jcwaa this act included temporary rules allowing companies to use for funding purposes discount rates for 2002 and 2003 equal to 120 percent of the weighted average 30year us treasury bond yield during 2003 and 2002 we made cash contributions to our pension plans of 118 million and 81 million respectively and we expect to make cash contributions of approximately 120 million during 2004 

note 11 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements provides a summary of our pension benefit plan activity the funded status of our plans and the amounts recognized in our consolidated financial statements  

powerrent program 

our power generation operating segment offers containerized generator sets for rent in its powerrent program the generator sets originally manufactured by the company are sold to a financial institution and leased back for utilization in the rental fleet the rental fleet is worldwide and leases are with multiple parties the leases have residual value guarantees most leases are operating leases for accounting purposes and this accounting determination must be continually assessed 

accounting principles for leases require management to periodically assess certain assumptions including the accounting lease term business dynamics can influence this judgment specifically management must assess the likelihood at each lease renewal date whether future renewals are reasonably assured and should be included in the accounting lease term as a part of this assessment 

management must determine the time period it would expect to dispose of the associated equipment and this judgment is influenced by market factors information available to management includes historical sales activity and current quoting activity for used equipments sales in addition the underlying terms of rental agreements by customers of the rental fleet are a consideration to this judgment and these terms are also impacted by market conditions the duration of such rental agreements is a consideration in the determination of the lease term 

as we provide a residual value guarantee to the lessor management must also periodically assess the likelihood of payments under these guarantees upon the termination of the lease if management determines that a payment under the residual guarantee is probable the estimated exposure must be accrued over the accounting lease term our estimated exposure under the residual value guarantee is dependent upon our ability to estimate the likely value of the equipment at the end of the accounting lease term managements assessment is dependent upon expectations in the marketplace as well as specifics about the units such as the type size and amount of equipment in the fleet and the age and hours of use of the equipment while we have not had a loss under the residual guarantee in the past future assessments may result in a different conclusion 

in summary market conditions can impact the determination that these leases are operating leases a change in market conditions could impact managements assessment and it is possible that a portion of the leases for the powerrent equipment could become capital leases at a particular renewal date as noted in liquidity and capital resources the company currently has contractual provisions which limit the amount of such indebtedness 

disclosure regarding forward looking statements 

certain parts of this annual report contains forwardlooking statements that are based on current expectations estimates and projections about the industries in which we operate and managements beliefs and assumptions forwardlooking statements are generally accompanied by words such as anticipates intends plans believes seeks estimates or similar expressions these statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks uncertainties and assumptions which we refer to as future factors which are difficult to predict therefore actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or forecasted in such forwardlooking statements future factors that could cause our results to differ materially from the results discussed in such forwardlooking statements are discussed below we undertake no obligation to update publicly any forwardlooking statements whether as a result of new information future events or otherwise future factors that could affect the outcome of forward looking statements include the following 

• price and product competition by foreign and domestic competitors including new entrants • rapid technological developments of diesel engines • the ability to continue to introduce competitive new products in a timely costeffective basis • the sales mix of products • the achievement of lower costs and expenses • domestic and foreign governmental and public policy changes including environmental regulations • protection and validity of patent and other intellectual property rights • reliance on large customers • technological implementation and costfinancial risks in increasing use of large multiyear contracts 48 

• the cyclical nature of our business • the outcome of pending and future litigation and governmental proceedings and • continued availability of financing financial instruments and financial resources in the amounts at the times and on the terms required to support our future business in addition such statements could be affected by general industry and market conditions and growth rates general domestic and international economic conditions including interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations and other future factors 

business outlook 

following three consecutive years of belowtrend demand in our businesses most economic indicators point toward strong improvement in cummins 2004 performance we expect heavyduty truck sales and production to increase significantly as aging fleets begin to replace older equipment and demand for freight capacity improves resulting in increased sales of our new emissionsmandated heavyduty engines our isx engine was the first heavyduty truck engine to be certified and compliant to the 2004 epa standards when first introduced in april 2002 since then more than 34000 isx and ism engines have been shipped and have accumulated in excess of 14 billion miles of service these new engines all of which use egr to meet emissions standards have been performing as expected and are being well received among fleet owners in the industry currently we are estimating heavyduty truck production in north america at 200000 to 205000 units or approximately 25 percent higher than 2003 production levels we also expect increased sales of our emissions compliant midrange engines to the mediumduty truck bus and recreational vehicle markets in 2004 as economic indicators for these markets historically correlate with those of the heavyduty market currently we estimate worldwide mediumduty truck demand to increase 12 percent in 2004 in january 2004 we began supplying our reengineered 59 liter turbo diesel engine to the 2004 1  2 model year dodge ram truck this new truck model offers best in class 600 lbft of torque and 325 horsepower and we expect the launch of this popular vehicle will result in strong sales volumes as demand for dieselpowered light vehicles continues to increase 

most economists are forecasting that 2004 will be the first year of recovery for nonresidential construction spending following the domestic recovery with lower interest rates we expect overall demand among equipment oems to increase resulting in higher sales of our industrial engines our power generation business experienced peak demand for stationary generator sets and standby generator sets in 19992001 reflecting y2k fears and other factors as energy prices began to fall in 2001 and 2002 and the economy slowed inventory levels remained high resulting in excess capacity and market pricing pressures while we believe demand for power generation equipment has bottomed and the 2003 northeast blackout accelerated some capacity absorption we are anticipating a slow recovery in 2004 however we expect profitability to return to this segment based on benefits from our restructuring actions and continued progress on cost reduction 

in our filtration and other business we expect the market opportunity to more than double by 2007 based upon the worldwide implementation of new emissions standards for gas and diesel engines our international distributor business which is retailoriented and comprised of 18 companyowned distributors and two joint ventures in key geographical markets has historically demonstrated steady sales growth and stable profit margins as the worldwide economy continues to improve and our engine population increases we expect sales growth and profit margins to continue in this segment as we capitalize on a growing global customer base 

as part of our longterm business strategy we have actively pursued and secured multiple international joint ventures and alliances to increase our market penetration through the manufacture of our engines and other products streamlining our supply chain management and developing new 

technologies our joint ventures and alliances generated 70 million of operating income in 2003 22 million in 2002 and 10 million in 2001 we expect business growth in our joint ventures to continue in 2004 particularly in asia where we recently expanded capacity through our partnership that sells engines to the second largest truck manufacturer in china 

we expect to generate sufficient cash from operations to fund our businesses capital expenditures research and development pension funding and dividend payments in 2004 we have available various short and longterm credit arrangements which are discussed above and disclosed in note 8 borrowing arrangements of our consolidated financial statements  these credit arrangements and other programs such as our accounts receivable securitization program provide the financial flexibility to satisfy future shortterm funding requirements of our debt service obligations and projected working capital requirements when needed with the exception of payments required under our operating lease agreements principal and interest payments on notes issued by a consolidated vie and our pension funding commitments there are no major fixed cash payment obligations occurring until march 2005 when our 645 notes with principal amount of 225 million mature we expect to repay or refinance all or a part of the principal amount of these notes prior to their maturity date based on projected cash flows from operations and existing credit facilities we believe we will have sufficient liquidity in 2004 to meet anticipated capital pension and dividend funding requirements and reduce our debt obligations 

recently adopted accounting pronouncements 

in april 2002 the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard no 145 rescission of fasb statements no 4 44 and 64 amendment of fasb statement no 13 and technical corrections since fasb statement no 4 has been rescinded retirements of debt are no longer automatically classified as an extraordinary item rather retirements of debt are only classified as extraordinary to the extent the specified criteria in accounting principles board opinion no 30 reporting the results of operations—reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business and extraordinary unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions apb no 30 are met we adopted this statement on january 1 2002 in november 2002 we repaid all of the outstanding 561 notes due 2010 issued by the esop trust the aggregate redemption price was approximately 51 million plus accrued interest and an 8 million redemption premium the loss due to the redemption premium is reflected as loss on early retirement of debt on our consolidated statements of earnings the loss from the early retirement of our esop notes was not classified as extraordinary as we believe it did not meet the criteria of apb no 30 

in november 2002 the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 45 guarantors accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others fin 45 fin 45 elaborates on the disclosures to be made by a guarantor about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued in addition this interpretation will require a guarantor to recognize at the inception of a guarantee a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee see note 19 for a discussion of our guarantees existing at december 31 2003 we adopted the recognition provisions of fin 45 for new or modified guarantees issued on or after january 1 2003 the adoption of this statement did not have a material effect on our financial statements 

in may 2003 the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard no 150 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity sfas 150 sfas 150 establishes standards for how companies classify and measure certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity sfas 150 requires financial instruments meeting certain criteria to be reported as liabilities that were previously reflected as equity or in between liabilities and equity we adopted sfas 150 for our existing financial instruments on july 1 2003 the adoption of this statement resulted in the classification of our obligations associated with the 

convertible preferred securities of subsidiary trust as a liability and resulted in the classification of the dividend payments on these securities as interest expense in our consolidated statements of earnings beginning july 1 2003 the adoption of this statement did not impact net earnings on december 31 2003 due to the adoption of fin 46 we no longer report the preferred securities as a liability rather we now report the junior convertible subordinated debentures as a liability as more fully discussed in note 2 of the consolidated financial statements

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to financial risk resulting from changes in foreign exchange rates interest rates and commodity prices this risk is closely monitored and managed through the use of financial derivative instruments including commodity price swaps forward contracts and interest rate swaps as clearly stated in our policies and procedures financial instruments are used expressly for hedging purposes and under no circumstances are they used for speculative purposes our hedging transactions are entered into with banking institutions that have strong credit ratings and thus the credit risk associated with these transactions is not considered significant the results and status of our hedging transactions are reported to senior management on a monthly and quarterly basis note 13 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements contains further information regarding financial instruments and risk management 

the following describes our risk exposures and provides results of sensitivity analyses performed on december 31 2003 the sensitivity test assumes instantaneous parallel shifts in foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices 

foreign exchange rates 

we are exposed to foreign currency exchange risk as a result of our international business presence we transact extensively in foreign currencies and have significant assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies as a result our earnings experience some volatility related to movements in foreign currency exchange rates in order to benefit from global diversification and after considering naturally offsetting currency positions we enter into forward contracts to minimize our existing exposures recognized asset and liability and hedge forecasted transactions the objective of our hedging program is to reduce the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on earnings by essentially creating offsetting currency exposures 

as of december 31 2003 the potential gain or loss in the fair value of our outstanding foreign currency contracts assuming a hypothetical 10 percent fluctuation in the currencies of such contracts would be approximately 3 million the sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates assumes the notional value to remain constant for the next 12 months the analysis ignores the impact of foreign exchange movements on our competitive position and potential changes in sales levels it should be noted that any change in the value of the contracts real or hypothetical would be significantly offset by an inverse change in the value of the underlying hedged items see note 13 derivatives and other financial instruments of the consolidated financial statements  

interest rates 

we are also exposed to interest rate risk as a result of our indebtedness our objective in managing our exposure to changes in interest rates is to limit the effect of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower our overall cost of borrowing to achieve this objective we primarily use interest rate swap agreements to manage exposure to interest rate changes related to our borrowing arrangements 

in november 2002 we terminated an interest rate swap relating to our 645 notes that mature in 2005 the swap converted 225 million notional amount from fixed rate debt into floating rate debt that would have matured in 2005 the termination of this swap resulted in a 123 million gain the gain is being amortized to earnings as a reduction of interest expense over the remaining life of the debt the amount of gain recognized during 2003 and 2002 was 53 million and 09 million respectively the remaining balance of the deferred gain is classified as longterm debt in our consolidated statement of financial position  

in march 2001 we terminated three fixedtofloating interest rate swap agreements related to our 625 notes with principal amount of 125 million due in 2003 and 645 notes with principal amount of 225 million due in 2005 the termination of these swaps resulted in a 90 million gain the gain is being amortized to earnings as a reduction of interest expense over the remaining life of the debt the amount of gain recognized during 2003 and 2002 was 18 million and 29 million respectively the remaining balance of the deferred gain is classified as longterm debt in our consolidated statements of financial position  

as of december 31 2003 we do not own any interest rate swap agreements see note 13 of the consolidated financial statements  

commodity prices 

we are also exposed to fluctuations in commodity prices through the purchase of raw materials as well as contractual agreements with component suppliers to reduce the effect of raw material price changes for select commodities we enter into commodity swap contracts to hedge a portion of our anticipated raw material purchases 

as of december 31 2003 the potential gain or loss related to the outstanding commodity swap contracts assuming a hypothetical 10 fluctuation in the price of such commodities would be approximately 03 million the sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in commodity prices assumes the notional value to remain constant for the next 12 months the analysis ignores the impact of commodity price movements on our competitive position and potential changes in sales levels it should be noted that any change in the value of the swaps real or hypothetical would be significantly offset by an inverse change in the value of the underlying hedged items see note 13 of the consolidated financial statements  




 item 9 changes in and disagreements with accountants on accounting and financial disclosure 

none

because of the companys global business activities its operations are subject to risks such as currency controls and fluctuations import restrictions and changes in national governments and policies

research and development

cummins conducts an extensive research and engineering program to achieve product improvements innovations and cost reductions for its customers as well as to satisfy legislated emissions requirements the company is nearing completion of a program to renew and extend its engine range cummins has introduced a variety of concepts in the diesel industry that combine electronic controls computing capability and information technology the company also offers alternatefueled engines for certain markets as disclosed in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements research and development expenditures were 204 million in 2001 224 million in 2000 and 218 million in 1999 the company continues to invest in technologies to meet increasingly more stringent emissions standards

page 8

sales and distribution

while the company has entered into supply agreements with some customers for cummins engines in both on and offhighway markets a majority of the companys business is based upon open purchase orders these purchase orders usually may be canceled on reasonable notice without cancellation charges therefore while incoming orders generally are indicative of anticipated future demand the actual demand for the companys products may change at any time while the company typically does not measure backlog customers provide information about future demand which is used by the company for production planning lead times for the companys engines are dependent upon the customer market and application

while individual product lines may experience modest seasonal declines in production there is no material effect on the demand for the majority of cummins products on a quarterly basis however the power generation business normally experiences seasonal declines in the first quarter of the fiscal year

the companys products compete on a number of factors including price performance fuel economy delivery quality and customer support cummins believes that its continued focus on cost quality and delivery extensive emissions technology and other technical investment full product line and customerfocused support programs are key elements of its competitive position

cummins warrants its engines subject to proper use and maintenance against defects in factory workmanship or materials for either a specified time period or mileage or hours of use warranty periods vary by engine family and market application 

there are approximately 8900 locations in north america primarily owned and operated by oems or their dealers at which cumminstrained service personnel and parts are available to service maintain and repair cummins engines the companys parts distribution centers are located strategically throughout the world

cummins also sells engines parts and related products through distributorships worldwide the company believes its distribution system is an important part of its marketing strategy and competitive position most of its north american distributors are independently owned and operated the company has agreements with each of these distributors which typically are for a term of three years subject to certain termination provisions upon termination or expiration of the agreement the company is obligated to purchase various assets of the distributorship the purchase obligation of the company relates primarily to inventory of the companys products which can be resold by the company over a reasonable period of time in the event the company had been required to fulfill its obligations to purchase assets from all distributors simultaneously at december 31 2001 the aggregate cost would have been approximately 377 million management believes it is unlikely that a significant number of distributors would terminate their agreements at the same time requiring the company to fulfill its purchase obligation

supply

cummins machines and assembles many of the components used in its engines including blocks heads rods turbochargers crankshafts and fuel systems cummins has adequate sources of supply of raw materials and components required for its operations the company has arrangements with certain suppliers who are the sole sources for specific products while the company believes it has adequate assurances of continued supply the inability of a supplier to deliver could have an adverse effect on production at certain of the companys manufacturing locations

employment

the company has other labor agreements covering employees in north america south america mexico the united kingdom and india

environmental compliance

product environmental compliance

cummins engines are subject to extensive statutory and regulatory requirements that directly or indirectly impose standards with respect to emissions and noise cummins products comply with emissions standards that the us environmental protection agency epa and california air resources board carb as well as other regulatory agencies around the world have established for heavyduty onhighway diesel and gas engines and offhighway engines produced through 2002 cummins ability to comply with these and future emissions standards is an essential element in maintaining its leadership position in regulated markets the company has made and will make significant capital and research expenditures to comply with these standards failure to comply could result in adverse effects on future financial results

the products cummins produces today are certified by the epa and carb all of these products underwent extensive laboratory and field testing prior to their release these products will be replaced with new products meeting a more stringent emission standard as provisions of a consent decree go into effect beginning october 1 2002 in october 1998 cummins and other engine manufacturers of onroad heavyduty diesel engines entered into a consent decree with the epa the u s department of justice and the carb related to concerns they had raised regarding the level of nitrogen oxide nox emissions from diesel engines under certain driving conditions the heart of this settlement the consent decree is the agreement by the manufacturers to implement in october 2002 the new and lower emissions standards planned for 2004 25 gram nox  nmhc nonmethane hydrocarbon and others the terms of the consent decree are a matter of public record additionally four separate court actions were filed as a result of allegations of the diesel emissions matter and to date the company has prevailed in every action 

over the past four years cummins has executed extensive corporate action plans to comply with all the aspects of the consent decree analysis is being conducted through the companys value package introduction system to ensure the reliability and durability of the new products on or before october 2002 the company will release certain 2002 models for engine families subject to the consent decree

an important final hurdle for release of october 2002compliant engines will be the approval by epa of the companys certification applications this includes certain auxiliary emissions control devices aecds as a result of regular efforts over the past three years including extensive technical efforts in the past year cummins has recently presented its final applications to epa the company anticipates approval of the companys first certification applications this spring prior to the release date of the first 2002compliant engine model 

page 10

in january 2002 epa initiated rulemaking applicable to engine manufacturers subject to a consent decree that will not be able to produce 25 gram nox  nmhc engines by october 2002 at that time epa released a notice of proposed rulemaking for nonconformance penalties ncps this feature of the epas proposed regulations enables a nonconforming party to continue to produce and sell products by paying a financial penalty for each engine sold ncps are intended to encourage compliance and remove any competitive disadvantage that might otherwise accrue to a manufacturer that is complying with the new standards the new ncps are based in part on the cost to develop field operate and support the technology that is expected for the consent decree engines because of the level of investment that cummins has made to develop these engines the company will meet all of the requirements of the consent decree and does not expect to pay ncps in any material amount for 2002 and beyond 

contained in the environmental regulations are several means for the epa to ensure and verify compliance with emissions standards two of the principal means are tests of new engines as they come off the assembly line referred to as selective enforcement audits sea and tests of field engines commonly called inuse compliance tests the epa has used the sea provisions for several years to verify the compliance of heavyduty engines in 2001 no such audit test was performed on cummins engines the failure of a sea could result in cessation of production of any noncompliant engines and the recall of engines produced prior to the audit in the product development process cummins anticipates sea requirements when it sets emissions design targets

no cummins engines were chosen for inuse compliance testing in 2001 it is anticipated that the epa will increase the inuse test rate in future years raising the probability that one or more of the companys engines will be selected

in 1988 carb promulgated a rule that necessitates the reporting of failures of emissionsrelated components when the failure rate reaches a specified level 25 component failures or one percent of build whichever is greater at somewhat higher failure rates 50 components or four percent of build a recall may be required in 2001 no emissionsrelated component failure reports were submitted 

heavyduty engines used in construction agricultural and certain mining applications are also subject to emission regulations in the united states the first tier of such nonroad standards began phasingin in 1996 the phasein of the second tier of these standards began in 2001 late last year in the midst of the companys recertification effort epa requested additional information regarding the companys nonroad engines that use electronic fuel injection systems the gathering of the requested information has taken more time than was available before last years certificates expired conditional certificates have been issued pending communication of the requested information and the agencys review of this information these conditional certificates allow the company to continue to produce nonroad engines while we assemble this information in other parts of the world similar nonroad standards are applied all of the companys nonroad products have undergone extensive laboratory and field tests prior to their release

epas audit provisions cover certified nonroad engines in 2001 no cummins nonroad engines were selected for such audit testing

the company along with other engine manufacturers the industrys engine manufacturers association and various petroleum producing interests have petitioned the courts to remand the epa final rule on 2007 emissions standards which was promulgated in 2001 oral arguments on this case are scheduled for february 2002 it is currently uncertain when a final decision of the court will be rendered

emissions standards in international markets including europe and japan are becoming more stringent given the companys experience in meeting us emissions standards it believes that it is well positioned to take advantage of opportunities in these markets as the need for emissionscontrol capability grows

there are several federal and state regulations which encourage and in some cases mandate the use of alternate fueled heavyduty engines through cummins westport inc a joint venture of cummins inc and westport innovations inc the company currently offers natural gas fueled versions of its b59 and c83 engines ranging from 150 to 280 horsepower as well as a propanefueled version of its b59 engine rated at 195 horsepower

vehicles and certain industrial equipment in which diesel engines are installed must meet federal noise standards the company believes that applications in which its engines are now installed meet those noise standards and that future installations also will be in compliance

page 11

other environmental statutes and regulations

cummins believes it is in compliance in all material respects with laws and regulations applicable to the plants and operations of the company and its subsidiaries during the past five years expenditures for environmental control activities and environmental remediation projects at the companys operating facilities in the united states have not been a major portion of annual capital outlays and are not expected to be material in 2002

pursuant to notices received from federal and state agencies andor defendant parties in site environmental contribution actions the company and its subsidiaries have been identified as potentially responsible parties prps under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of 1980 as amended or similar state laws at a number of waste disposal sites under such laws prps typically are jointly and severally liable for any investigation and remediation costs incurred with respect to the sites therefore the companys ultimate responsibility for such costs could be a percentage greater than the percentage of waste actually contributed to the site by the company

the sites at which the company or its subsidiaries are currently named as a prp are the following old city landfill columbus indiana white house waste oil pits jacksonville florida seaboard chemical jamestown north carolina double eagle refinery oklahoma city oklahoma wastex research east st louis illinois north hollywood dump memphis tennessee commercial oil oregon ohio berliner  ferro swartz creek michigan schnitzer iron  metal st paul minnesota four county landfill culver indiana schumann site south bend indiana great lakes asphalt zionsville indiana third site zionsville indiana autoion kalamazoo michigan pcb treatment inc kansas city kansas enrx buffalo new york uniontown landfill uniontown indiana sand springs oklahoma united steel drum east st louis illinois putnam county landfill cookeville tennessee enterprise oil detroit michigan wayne reclamation  recycling ft wayne indiana and casmalia disposal site santa barbara california the company presently is contesting its status as a prp at several of these sites at some of these sites the company will be released from liability at the site as a de minimis prp for a nominal amount

while the company is unable at this time to determine the aggregate cost of remediation at these sites it has attempted to analyze its proportionate and actual liability by analyzing the amounts of waste contributed to the sites by the company the estimated costs for total remediation at the sites the number and identities of other prps and the level of insurance coverage with respect to some sites at which the company or its subsidiaries have been named as prps the company cannot accurately estimate the future remediation costs at several sites the remedial action to be implemented has not been determined for the site in other cases the company or its subsidiary has only recently been named as a prp and is collecting information on the site finally in some cases the company believes it has no liability at the site and is actively contesting designation as a prp

based upon the companys prior experiences at similar sites however the aggregate future cost to all prps to remediate these sites is not likely to be significant in each of these cases the company believes that it has good defenses at several of the sites that its percentage contribution at other sites is likely to be de minimis or that other prps will bear most of the future remediation costs however the environmental laws impose joint and several liability and consequently the companys ultimate responsibility may be based upon many factors outside the companys control and could be material in the event that the company becomes obligated to pay a significant portion of these expenses based upon information presently available the company believes that such an outcome is unlikely and that its actual and proportionate costs of participating in the remediation of these sites will not be material

results of operations 

net sales

in 2001 cummins net sales were 57 billion compared to 66 billion in 2000 and 66 billion in 1999 the net sales decrease of 9 billion is attributable to a reduction in engine business sales which declined 23 percent compared to 2000 and 26 percent compared to 1999 revenues from the engine business were 55 percent of net sales in 2001 compared to 61 percent in 2000 and 64 percent in 1999 the decrease in engine business sales resulted primarily from lower shipments to north american oems original equipment manufacturers which were effected by the sharp downturn in the north american automotive industry and construction markets 

the companys reporting structure is organized primarily by the markets served and secondarily by products and geographical territories in the fourth quarter of 2001 cummins realigned its reporting structure and created a new business segment international distributor business as a result of the size and growing importance of the retail distribution business previously the retail distribution business had been combined within the filtration and other business segment accordingly certain historical business segment data has been restated and reclassified to reflect this change a more complete disclosure of information regarding the companys business segments can be found in note 13 to the consolidated financial statements

restructuring asset impairment and other charges 

beginning in the second half of 2000 cummins experienced a decline in demand for its products in several north american end markets these markets included heavyduty trucks mediumduty trucks construction equipment and a number of consumer demand driven segments such as the dodge ram pickup truck recreational vehicles and exhaust systems for offroad recreational and lawn equipment in response to the downturn and continuing market deterioration cummins announced a fourth quarter restructuring program designed to consolidate operations and reduce costs the program resulted in a 160 million pretax charge 103 million after tax the restructuring program focused largely but not exclusively on the companys engine business segment and included charges for workforce reductions asset writedowns of certain equipment related to heavyduty engine production and information technology software and other costs associated with closing consolidating or exiting a number of smaller businesses the company expects the restructuring actions to result in annual savings of approximately 55 million upon completion

in the second quarter of 2001 as a result of the further downturn in the north american trucking industry and other markets and the decision to terminate the development of a new engine program the company announced further restructuring actions and recorded charges of 125 million 84 million after tax the charges were attributable to workforce reduction actions asset impairment charges related to tooling and investment in the new engine development program and charges to divest a small business operation the company expects to complete these restructuring actions in 2002 and expects benefits of 35 million upon completion 

a more complete discussion and disclosure of the companys restructuring actions during the last three years is included in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements 

provision for income taxes

the companys income tax provision in 2001 was a benefit of 42 million combining a negative effective tax rate of 17 percent from operations and an effective tax rate of 33 percent from restructuring charges the effective tax rate from operations in 2001 reflected reduced taxes on export sales research tax credits and dividends on preferred securities which are deductible as interest expense for federal tax purposes in 2000 the companys tax benefit was 19 million reflecting an effective tax rate from operations of 23 percent and an effective tax rate of 35 percent from restructuring charges in 1999 the companys tax provision was 55 million reflecting an effective tax rate of 25 percent for both operations and restructuring charges note 9 to the consolidated financial statements contains a more complete disclosure of the companys income taxes the amount of income taxes paid in 2001 2000 and 1999 is disclosed in the consolidated statement of cash flows 

minority interest 

minority interest in cummins net earnings of consolidated entities was 15 million in 2001 an increase of 1 million from 2000 and an increase of 9 million from 1999 the increase from 2000 was primarily due to higher earnings attributable to minority partners of cummins india limited and improved performance from the companys fuel systems joint venture with scania

liquidity and capital resources

since fiscal 2000 the company has made a strategic effort to reduce its borrowings improve its cost structure and improve efficiencies from continuing operations through monetization of assets and restructuring actions as a result cummins management has undertaken various initiatives to improve cash flow reduce debt obligations and improve financial flexibility during that period 

during the fourth quarter of 2000 the company entered into a receivable securitization program which provides a costeffective method to fund trade accounts receivables this program diversifies the companys funding base by providing a flexible source of funding that is not reported on the companys balance sheet note 2 to the consolidated financial statements contains a more complete description of the securitization program and discloses certain cash flows related to the program 

page 18 

in the second quarter of 2001 cummins capital trust a whollyowned subsidiary issued 6 million shares of cumulative convertible preferred securities subject to mandatory redemption the net proceeds from the issuance 291 million were used to repay outstanding indebtedness under the companys revolving credit agreement dividends on the preferred securities are payable at an annual rate of 7 of the 50 liquidation preference on march 15 june 15 september 15 and december 15 of each year or approximately 53 million in each quarter a complete description of the preferred securities is disclosed in note 7 to the consolidated financial statements 

during the second and third quarters of 2001 the company entered into three saleleaseback agreements whereby it sold certain manufacturing equipment and aircraft and received 143 million in proceeds from the transactions the leases were accounted for as operating leases proceeds from the transactions were used to reduce indebtedness and fund working capital requirements note 14 to the consolidated financial statements contains a description of the saleleaseback transactions 

during 2000 and 2001 the company recorded significant charges to restructure its operations largely focused in the engine business these actions and the resulting charges were taken in response to the downturn in the north american trucking industry and related conditions and included workforce reductions asset impairment losses termination of a new engine development program and other charges total cash outflows associated with these actions approximated 104 million the majority of which has already been expended the associated annual savings of these restructuring actions are estimated at 90 million upon completion note 3 to the consolidated financial statements describes in more detail the restructuring actions the company has taken during the last three years 

cummins operations have historically generated sufficient cash to fund its businesses capital expenditures and dividend payments cash provided by continuing operations is a major source of working capital funding at certain times the companys cash provided by operations is subject to seasonal fluctuations and as a result periodic borrowings are used to fund working capital requirements the company has available various short and longterm bank credit arrangements which are more fully disclosed in note 6 of the consolidated financial statements these credit arrangements and the receivable securitization program provide the financial flexibility cummins requires to satisfy future short and longterm funding requirements 

key elements of the companys cash flows for the last three years follows

 net cash provided by operating activities was 144 million for 2001 compared with 388 million for 2000 and 307 million for 1999 the decrease was largely due to the decline in net earnings repayment of funding under the receivable securitization program and a reduction in accounts payable and accrued expenses offset by a reduction in inventory cash flows provided by the reduction in receivables was 202 million and net of the 164 million securitization repayment was 38 million in 2001 compared to 273 million in the prior year

net cash used in investing activities was 86 million in 2001 down 226 million from 2000 and down 80 million from 1999 most of the decline in cash used in investing activities was a result of 143 million cash inflows from the sale and leaseback transactions and a reduction in business acquisitions in 2001 compared to 2000 in 2000 the company acquired a distributorship in south africa and purchased assets from the dissolved wärtsilä joint venture capital expenditures in 2001 decreased 22 million compared to 2000 and 9 million below 1999 as the company reduced spending levels to improve cash flows 

net cash used in financing activities was 27 million in 2001 compared to 86 million in 2000 and 105 million in 1999 cash uses were for dividend payments and payments on borrowings reduced by proceeds from the preferred securities issuance net payments on borrowings were 257 million in 2001 as the company used proceeds from the preferred securities issuance to reduce indebtedness the company did not repurchase any of its common stock during 2001 as a result the amount of cash used in financing activities was reduced compared to common stock repurchases of 16 million in 2000 and 34 million in 1999 

cash and cash equivalents increased 30 million during the year and were 92 million at the end of 2001 based on projected cash flows from operations and existing credit facilities management believes the company has available sufficient liquidity to meet anticipated capital debt and dividend requirements in the foreseeable future

contractual obligations and commercial commitments

a summary of payments due by period of the companys contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december 31 2001 are shown in the tables below a more complete description of these obligations and commitments is included in the notes to the consolidated financial statements as referenced below

 the above contractual obligations contain financial covenants that require the company to maintain certain financial ratios and minimum net worth levels as defined in the agreements and minimum credit ratings related to the companys unsecured debt several of the agreements covering bank loans credit agreements and leases contain rating triggers which typically provide creditors with certain rights in the event that cummins credit ratings change to predetermined levels these rights include but are not limited to increases in loan pricing and requirements to provide letters of credit following is a discussion of cummins financial arrangements that contain rating triggers

accounts receivable securitization program  this shortterm financing arrangement requires cummins to maintain a minimum investment grade credit rating for its longterm unsecured debt should events cause cummins credit ratings to be lowered below investment grade lenders would no longer be obligated to provide future funds against the companys receivable balance the program would be discontinued as the receivables are collected and lenders repaid as of december 31 2001 55 million was funded under this program a more complete disclosure of this program is disclosed in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements

financing arrangements for independent distributors  cummins is a guarantor for certain independent distributors revolving loans term loans and leases in excess of a specified borrowing base the financing arrangement for us distributors requires cummins to maintain a minimum investment grade credit rating for its longterm unsecured debt should events cause cummins credit ratings to be lowered below investment grade the lending institutions would no longer be obligated to provide funding to us distributors under the current terms of the agreement as of december 31 2001 the amount of cummins guarantee related to financing arrangements for us distributors was 30 million the amount of guarantees related to financing arrangements for international distributors which is not affected by rating triggers is 19 million 

the company maintains a 500 million revolving credit agreement with a group of banks the interest rate applicable to borrowings under the agreement is based on the companys credit rating should events cause cummins credit rating to be lowered the company would experience an increase in interest rates under this agreement as of december 31 2001 there were no outstanding borrowings under this agreement note 6 to the consolidated financial statements contains a more complete description of cummins revolving credit agreement

legalenvironmental matters the company and its subsidiaries are defendants in a number of pending legal actions that arise in the normal course of business including environmental claims and actions related to use and performance of the companys products such matters are more fully described in note 16 to the consolidated financial statements in the event the company is determined to be liable for damages in connection with such actions or proceedings the unreserved portion of any such liability is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the companys results of operations cash flows or financial condition

market risk the company is exposed to financial risk resulting from changes in foreign exchange rates interest rates and commodity prices this risk is closely monitored and managed through the use of financial instruments including interest rate swaps options forwards and other derivative contracts as clearly stated in the companys policies and procedures financial instruments are used expressly for hedging purposes and under no circumstances are they used for speculative purposes transactions are only entered into with banking institutions that have strong credit ratings and thus the credit risk associated with these transactions is not considered significant the results and status of hedging transactions are reported to senior management on a monthly and quarterly basis note 10 to the consolidated financial statements contains further information regarding financial instruments and risk management 

the following describes the companys risk exposures and provides results of sensitivity analyses performed on december 31 2001 the sensitivity tests assumed instantaneous parallel shifts in foreign currency exchange rates interest rate yield curves and commodity prices

foreign exchange rates

cummins is exposed to foreign currency exchange risk as a result of its international business presence the company transacts extensively in foreign currencies and has significant assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies as a result corporate earnings experience some volatility related to movements in foreign currency exchange rates in order to benefit from global diversification and naturally offsetting currency positions foreign exchange balance sheet exposures are aggregated and hedged at the corporate level primarily through the use of foreign exchange forward contracts the objective of the hedging program is to reduce the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on earnings resulting from the translation of net foreign exchange balance sheet positions 

a uniform 10 percent adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the us dollar would decrease net earnings by approximately 5 million for the year ending december 31 2001 the sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates ignores the impact of foreign exchange movements on cummins competitive position potential changes in sales levels and the offsetting impact on income of the revaluation of the underlying balance sheet exposures 

interest rates

the company is also exposed to interest rate risk as result of its indebtedness the companys objectives in managing its exposure to changes in interests rates are to limit the effect of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower the overall cost of borrowing funds to achieve its objectives the company primarily uses interest rate swap agreements to manage exposure to interest rate changes related to its borrowing arrangements a uniform 10 percent increase in interest rates which would remain fixed at the new higher level for a oneyear period would result in a decrease in net earnings of 2 million this sensitivity analysis does not consider the change in the companys competitive environment indirectly related to changes in interest rates and managements response to these changes

commodity prices

the company is also exposed to fluctuations in commodity prices through the purchase of raw materials as well as contractual agreements with component suppliers given the historical volatility of commodity prices this exposure can significantly impact product costs to reduce the effect of changing raw material prices for select commodities cummins has entered into commodity swap agreements to hedge a portion of its anticipated raw material purchases on selected commodities a uniform 10 percent increase in the price of commodities covered by commodity swap agreements with prices then remaining fixed for a 12month period would result in a decrease of net earnings of 1 million

business operations


     international
     

the company has manufacturing facilities worldwide including major
operations in europe india mexico and brazil  parts distribution
centers in brazil mexico australia singapore china india and belgium
are strategically located to supply service parts to maintain and repair
cummins engines

the company has entered into alliances with business partners in various
areas of the world

in 1997 the company acquired an additional 1 percent of the outstanding
shares of kirloskar cummins limited becoming the majority owner and
changed the name to cummins india limited  this business is now
consolidated into cummins financial statements

page 7

in 1996 a joint venture was formed with two of the fiat group companies 
iveco trucks and buses and new holland agricultural equipment  to
design and manufacture the next generation of 4 5 and 6liter engines
based on cummins 4 and 6liter b series engines  operations of dong feng
in china were expanded to form a joint venture for production of a c
series engine in addition to the license for b series engines

in 1995 the company formed a joint venture with china national heavy duty
truck corporation in chongqing previously a cummins licensee to
manufacture a broad line of diesel engines in china

cummins and scania have a joint venture to produce a fuel system for heavy
duty diesel engines  cummins also has a joint venture with telco to
manufacture the cummins b series engines in india for telco trucks
cummins and komatsu have formed joint ventures to manufacture the b series
engines in japan and highhorsepower komatsu designed engines in the
united states  in 1997 a third joint venture with komatsu to design next
generation industrial engines was announced

cummins has entered into license agreements that provide for the
manufacture and sale of the companys products in turkey china pakistan
south korea indonesia and other countries

several of the companys subsidiaries have operations throughout the
world

because of the companys global business activities its operations are
subject to risks such as currency controls and fluctuations import
restrictions and changes in national governments and policies

     research and development
     

cummins conducts an extensive research and engineering program to achieve
product improvements innovations and cost reductions for its customers
as well as to satisfy legislated emissions requirements  the company is
nearing completion of a program to renew and extend its engine range
cummins has introduced a variety of concepts in the diesel industry that
combine electronic controls computing capability and information
technology  the company also offers alternate fueled engines for certain
of its markets  as disclosed in note 1 to the consolidated financial
statements research and development expenditures approximated 220
million in 2000 220 million in 1999 and 230 million in 1998  the
company continues to invest in technologies to meet increasingly more
stringent emissions standards

     sales and distribution
     

while the company has supply agreements with some customers for cummins
engines in both on and offhighway markets most of the companys
business is done on open purchase orders  these purchase orders usually
may be canceled on reasonable notice without cancellation charges
therefore while incoming orders generally are indicative of anticipated
future demand the actual demand for the companys products may change at
any time  while the company typically does not measure backlog customers
provide information about future demand which is used by the company for
production planning  lead times for the companys engines are dependent
upon the customer market and application

while individual product lines may experience modest seasonal declines in
production there is no material effect on the demand for the majority of
cummins products on a quarterly basis  the power generation business
however normally encounters seasonal declines in the first quarter of the
year

the companys products compete on a number of factors including
performance price delivery quality and customer support  cummins
believes that its continued focus on cost quality and delivery extensive
technical investment full product line and customerled support programs
are key elements of its competitive position

page 8

cummins warrants its engines subject to proper use and maintenance
against defects in factory workmanship or materials for either a specified
time period or mileage or hours of use  warranty periods vary by engine
family and market segment

there are approximately 8900 locations in north america primarily owned
and operated by oems or their dealers at which cumminstrained service
personnel and parts are available to maintain and repair cummins engines
the companys parts distribution centers are located strategically
throughout the world

cummins also sells engines parts and related products through
distributorships worldwide  the company believes its distribution system
is an important part of its marketing strategy and competitive position
most of its north american distributors are independently owned and
operated  the company has agreements with each of these distributors
which typically are for a term of three years subject to certain
termination provisions  upon termination or expiration of the agreement
the company is obligated to purchase various assets of the
distributorship  the purchase obligation of the company relates primarily
to inventory of the companys products which can be resold by the company
over a reasonable period of time  in the event the company had been
required to fulfill its obligations to purchase assets from all
distributors simultaneously at december 31 2000 the aggregate cost would
have been approximately 362 million  management believes it is unlikely
that a significant number of distributors would terminate their agreements
at the same time requiring the company to fulfill its purchase
obligation

     supply
     

the company manufactures many of the components used in its engines
including blocks heads rods turbochargers crankshafts and fuel
systems  cummins has adequate sources of supply of raw materials and
components required for its operations  the company has arrangements with
certain suppliers who are the sole sources for specific products  while
the company believes it has adequate assurances of continued supply the
inability of a supplier to deliver could have an adverse effect on
production at certain of the companys manufacturing locations

     employment
     

at december 31 2000 cummins employed 28000 persons worldwide
approximately 10700 of whom are represented by various unions

the diesel workers union dwu represents employees at several southern
indiana plants under two contracts  in 1993 members of the dwu working
in a majority of the companys southern indiana manufacturing facilities
ratified an agreement that extends until the year 2004  in 2000 members
of the dwu at the companys midrange engine plant ratified a fouryear

products plant in cookeville tennessee under a threeyear agreement
ratified in 1999

the company has other labor agreements covering employees in north
america south america the united kingdom and india

environmental compliance


     product environmental compliance
     

cummins engines are subject to extensive statutory and regulatory
requirements that directly or indirectly impose standards with respect to
emissions and noise  cummins products comply with emissions standards
that the us environmental protection agency epa and california air
resources board carb as well as other regulatory agencies around the
world have established for heavyduty onhighway diesel and gas engines
and offhighway engines produced through 2001  cummins ability to comply
with these and future emissions standards is an essential element in
maintaining its leadership position in regulated markets  the company
will make significant capital and research expenditures to comply with
these standards  failure to comply could result in adverse effects on
future financial results

cummins has successfully completed the certification of its 2001 on
highway products which include both midrange and heavyduty engines  all
of these products underwent extensive laboratory and field testing prior
to their release

in october 1998 cummins and other manufacturers of heavyduty diesel
engines entered into a consent decree with the epa the u s department
of justice and the carb related to concerns they had raised regarding the
level of nitrogen oxide nox emissions from diesel engines under certain
driving conditions  the terms of that consent decree are a matter of
public record  cummins has developed extensive corporate action plans to
comply with all aspects of the consent decree  additionally four
separate court actions have been filed as a result of allegations of the
diesel emissions matter  the new york supreme court ruled in favor of the
company  an appeal was filed and the appellate division ruled in favor of
the company and other defendants  two courts in california ruled in favor
of the company  a fourth action was filed in us district court for the
district of columbia  this case was dismissed in september 2000

the company is taking steps to review the timing of the introduction of
the 25 gram nox  nmhc nonmethane hydrocarbon engines under the
consent decree  analysis conducted through the companys value package
introduction system indicates that significant field testing at this point
is still needed   without this important testing there will be
reliability and durability risks to consider if the products were released
by the consent decree date of october 2002  this delay in field testing
of a stable and mature product design has been caused by significant
component development issues in the exhaust gas recirculation system and
because epa has failed until recently to provide confirmation of the
auxiliary emissions control structure for the product  discussions are on
going with appropriate epa and carb technical and policy offices to
explore later dates for introduction

model year 1998 marked the latest major change in promulgated emissions
requirements for heavyduty onhighway diesel engines when the oxides of
nitrogen standard was lowered from 50 to 40 gbhphr

contained in the environmental regulations are several means for the epa
to ensure and verify compliance with emissions standards  two of the
principal means are tests of new engines as they come off the assembly
line referred to as selective enforcement audits sea and tests of
field engines commonly called inuse compliance tests  the sea
provisions have been used by the epa to verify the compliance of heavy
duty engines for several years  in 2000 no such audit test was performed
on cummins engines  the failure of a sea could result in cessation of
production of the noncompliant engines and the recall of engines produced
prior to the audit  in the product development process cummins
anticipates sea requirements when it sets emissions design targets

page 10

no cummins engines were chosen for inuse compliance testing in 2000  it
is anticipated that the epa will increase the inuse test rate in future
years raising the probability that one or more of the companys engines
will be selected

in 1988 carb promulgated a rule that necessitates the reporting of
failures of emissionsrelated components when the failure rate reaches a
specified level 25 component failures or one percent of build whichever
is greater  at somewhat higher failure rates 50 components or four
percent of build a recall may be required  in october 1999 the company
communicated to carb that a failure of the oxidation catalyst used with
certain urban bus engines had experienced failures at a level that
necessitates a report  this failure has now reached the level that could
require a recall  cummins has initiated activities to correct these
failures on all affected engines in california as well as those in other
states

heavyduty engines used in construction agricultural and certain mining
applications are also subject to emission regulations  in the united
states such standards began phasingin in 1996  in other parts of the
world similar standards are applied  cummins has successfully completed
certification of its engines used in these nonroad applications  all of
these products have undergone extensive laboratory and field tests prior
to their release

epas audit provisions cover certified nonroad engines  in 2000 no
cummins engines were selected for such audit testing

emissions standards in international markets including europe and japan
are becoming more stringent  given the companys experience in meeting us
emissions standards it believes that it is well positioned to take
advantage of opportunities in these markets as the need for emissions
control capability grows

there are several federal and state regulations which encourage and in
some cases mandate the use of alternate fueled heavyduty engines  the
company currently offers natural gas fueled versions of its b59 and c83
engines ranging from 150 to 280 horsepower as well as a propanefueled
version of its b59 engine rated at 195 horsepower

vehicles and certain industrial equipment in which diesel engines are
installed must meet federal noise standards  the company believes that
applications in which its engines are now installed meet those noise
standards and that future installations also will be in compliance

     other environmental statutes and regulations
     

cummins believes it is in compliance in all material respects with laws
and regulations applicable to the plants and operations of the company and
its subsidiaries  during the past five years expenditures for
environmental control activities and environmental remediation projects at
the companys operating facilities in the united states have not been a
major portion of annual capital outlays and are not expected to be
material in 2000

pursuant to notices received from federal and state agencies andor
defendant parties in site environmental contribution actions the company
and its subsidiaries have been identified as potentially responsible
parties prps under the comprehensive environmental response
compensation and liability act of 1980 as amended or similar state laws
at a number of waste disposal sites  under such laws prps typically are
jointly and severally liable for any investigation and remediation costs
incurred with respect to the sites  therefore the companys ultimate
responsibility for such costs could be a percentage greater than the
percentage of waste actually contributed to the site by the company

the sites at which the company or its subsidiaries are currently named as
a prp are the following old city landfill columbus indiana white house
waste oil pits jacksonville florida seaboard chemical jamestown north
carolina double eagle refinery oklahoma city oklahoma wastex research
east st louis illinois north hollywood dump memphis tennessee
commercial oil oregon ohio berliner  ferro swartz creek michigan
schnitzer iron  metal st paul minnesota four county landfill culver
indiana schumann site south bend indiana great lakes asphalt
zionsville indiana third site zionsville indiana autoion kalamazoo
michigan pcb treatment inc kansas city kansas enrx buffalo new
york uniontown landfill uniontown indiana sand springs oklahoma
united steel drum east st louis illinois putnam county landfill
cookeville tennessee enterprise oil detroit michigan wayne
reclamation  recycling ft wayne indiana and casmalia disposal site
santa barbara california  the company presently is contesting its status
as a prp at several of these sites  at some of these sites the company
will be released from liability at the site as a de minimis prp for a
nominal amount

page 11

while the company is unable at this time to determine the aggregate cost
of remediation at these sites it has attempted to analyze its
proportionate and actual liability by analyzing the amounts of waste
contributed to the sites by the company the estimated costs for total
remediation at the sites the number and identities of other prps and the
level of insurance coverage  with respect to other sites at which the
company or its subsidiaries have been named as prps the company cannot
accurately estimate the future remediation costs  at several sites the
remedial action to be implemented has not been determined for the site
in other cases the company or its subsidiary has only recently been named
as a prp and is collecting information on the site  finally in some
cases the company believes it has no liability at the site and is
actively contesting designation as a prp

based upon the companys prior experiences at similar sites however the
aggregate future cost to all prps to remediate these sites is not likely
to be significant  in each of these cases the company believes that it
has good defenses at several of the sites that its percentage
contribution at other sites is likely to be de minimis or that other prps
will bear most of the future remediation costs  however the
environmental laws impose joint and several liability and consequently
the companys ultimate responsibility may be based upon many factors
outside the companys control and could be material in the event that the
company becomes obligated to pay a significant portion of these expenses
based upon information presently available the company believes that such
an outcome is unlikely and that its actual and proportionate costs of
participating in the remediation of these sites will not be material

in 2000 various plants and facilities of the company commenced
development and implementation of iso 14001 standards for an environmental
management system  this activity will continue in 2001  the company
anticipates that four of its central area plants and five of its north
american plants will be certified to iso 14001 within the next two years

compensation plans principally retirement savings plans  shares of
the common stock held by this trust are not used in the calculation of
the companys earnings per share until distributed from the trust and
allocated to a benefit plan

certain of the companys loan indentures and agreements contain
provisions which permit the holders to require the company to
repurchase the obligations upon a change of control of the company as
defined in the applicable debt instruments

page 13

the company has a shareholders rights plan which it first adopted in
1986  the rights plan provides that each share of the companys
common stock has associated with it a stock purchase right  the
rights plan becomes operative when a person or entity acquires 15
percent of the companys common stock or commences a tender offer to
purchase 20 percent or more of the companys common stock without the
approval of the board of directors  in the event a person or entity
acquires 15 percent of the companys common stock each right except
for the acquiring persons rights can be exercised to purchase 400
worth of common stock for 200  in addition for a period of 10 days
after such acquisition the board of directors can exchange such right
for a new right which permits the holders to purchase one share of the
companys common stock for 1 per share  if a person or entity
commences a tender offer to purchase 20 percent or more of the
companys common stock unless the board of directors redeems the
rights within 10 days of the event each right can be exercised to
purchase one share for 200  the plan also allows holders of the

cummins engine business the companys largest business segment
produces engines and parts for sale to customers in both automotive
and industrial markets  engine business customers are serviced
through the companys worldwide distributor network  the engines are
used in trucks of all sizes buses and recreational vehicles as well
as a variety of industrial applications including construction
mining agriculture marine rail and military  engine business
revenues were 40 billion in 2000 a 4 percent decrease from 1999 and
a 2 percent increase over 1998  the 2000 discussion and analysis of
results has been aligned to reflect the organization structure of the
engine business in addressing its markets

sales of 21 billion in the bus and truck markets were 13 percent
lower than in 1999 and 5 percent lower than in 1998  in 2000 heavy
duty truck engine revenues of 14 billion were 19 percent lower than
1999 and 7 percent lower than 1998 reflecting the downturn in the
north american heavyduty truck market where shipments were down 35
percent from 1999  this was partially offset by increases in
international heavyduty markets where shipments increased 34 percent
from 1999

page 15

mediumduty truck and bus engine revenues of 662 million were 4
percent higher than in 1999 and flat compared to 1998  in 2000
mediumduty truck engine volumes were 5 percent lower than in 1999 and
reflect a 29 percent decline in north american volumes  this decline
was partially offset by a 14 percent shipment increase in
international mediumduty truck markets  bus engine shipments were 41
percent higher than in 1999

sales of 830 million in the light commercial vehicle market were 7
percent higher than in 1999 and 16 percent higher than in 1998
reflecting an increase in engine shipments from 1999  record unit
shipments in 2000 to daimlerchrysler for the dodge ram pickup while
including a sharp downturn in the fourth quarter were 16 percent
higher than in 1999 for the full year

sales of 873 million to the construction agriculture and marine
markets were 4 percent higher than in 1999 and 3 percent higher than
in 1998  in 2000 shipments were 4 percent higher than in 1999
driven by increases in the construction and marine markets  shipment
declines in north america were more than offset by increases in
international markets

sales of 241 million to the high horsepowermining market were 32
percent higher than in 1999 and 16 percent higher than in 1998
engine shipments were 36 percent higher than in 1999 with higher
demand in international markets accounting for much of the increase

revenues of 14 billion in 2000 for the power generation business
were 3 percent higher than in 1999 and 13 percent higher than in 1998
sales of the companys generator sets in 2000 were flat compared to
1999 engine sales to generator set assemblers were up 17 percent from
the prior year  alternator sales decreased 7 percent as compared to
1999 sales of small generator sets for recreational vehicles and
other consumer applications were flat compared to last year

sales of 12 billion in 2000 for the filtration business and other were 9
percent higher than in 1999 and 1998  in 2000 fleetguardnelson revenues
increased 2 percent but reflected a drop in demand for oem truck and
construction equipment products as well as reduced sales to consumer
oriented small engine and equipment manufacturers  international
distributor sales included in this segment increased 13 percent from 1999
while sales of holset turbochargers increased 26 percent as compared to a
year ago

     gross margin
     

the companys gross margin percentage was 191 percent in 2000 214
percent in 1999 and 214 percent in 1998 excluding the special
charges recorded for product coverage and inventory writedowns in
1998  the gross margin percent in 1998 including the special charges
was 199 percent  gross margins in 2000 were impacted by lower cost
absorption in the companys heavyduty plants changes in product mix
foreign exchange and higher product coverage costs  product coverage
costs were 42 percent of net sales in 2000 compared to 37 percent
in 1999 and 33 percent in 1998 excluding the special charges
including special charges product coverage costs were 45 percent of
net sales in 1998

page 16

     operating expenses
     

selling and administrative expenses were 118 percent of net sales in
2000 compared to 118 percent in 1999 and 125 percent in 1998

research and engineering expenses were 37 percent of net sales in
2000 compared to 37 percent in 1999 and 41 percent in 1998

the companys income from joint ventures and alliances was 9 million
in 2000 compared to losses of 28 million in 1999 and losses of 30
million in 1998  this improvement resulted from the dissolution of
the wartsila joint venture at the end of 1999

in the past three years cummins has recorded restructuring and other
charges to reflect business improvement initiatives committed to by
the companys management

as disclosed in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements the
company recorded charges of 160 million 103 million after tax or
271 per share reflecting restructuring actions asset impairments
and other activities largely focused in the engine business  these
actions are taken in response to the downturn in the north american
heavyduty truck market and related conditions  the charges include
42 million attributable to employee severance actions 72 million
for impairment of equipment and other assets 30 million for
impairment of software developed for internal use where the programs
were cancelled prior to implementation and 16 million associated with
exit costs to close or consolidate a number of smaller business
operations  of the 160 million charge 131 million was assigned to
the engine business 19 million to the power generation business and
10 million to the filtration business and other

workforce reduction actions included overall cutbacks in staffing
levels plus the impacts of closing and consolidating operations
restructuring charges for workforce reductions included the severance
costs and related benefits of terminating 600 salaried employees and
830 hourly employees  costs for workforce reductions were based on
amounts pursuant to benefit programs or statutory requirements of the
affected operations

the asset impairment loss of 72 million was calculated in accordance
with the provisions of sfas 121  asset impairment of equipment from
discontinuing operations was primarily for engine assembly and fuel
system manufacturing equipment to be disposed of upon the closure or
consolidation of production operations  the asset impairment charge
included a writedown of 38 million for manufacturing equipment that
will continue to be used for approximately two years  depreciation
will continue on these assets over that period of time  the expected
recovery value of equipment to be disposed of was based on estimated
salvage value and was excluded from the writedown  the charge also
included 11 million for equipment available for disposal 6 million
for properties available for disposal 10 million for investments and
7 million for intangibles and minority interest positions related to
divesting smaller operations and investments  the carrying value of
assets held for disposal and the effect from suspending depreciation
on such assets is immaterial

the asset impairment charge of 30 million consisted of capitalized
softwareinprocess being developed for internal use  the charge was
related to manufacturing financial and administrative information
technology programs cancelled during program development and prior to
implementation

exit costs of 16 million to close or consolidate a number of small
businesses and operations included 6 million for equipment removal
costs 5 million to satisfy contractual obligations and 5 million
for other exit costs  as the restructuring actions consist primarily
of the closing or consolidation of smaller operations the company
does not expect these actions to have a material effect on future
revenues

approximately 73 million primarily related to the writedown of
impaired equipment and software and employee severance payments has
been charged to the restructuring liabilities as of december 31 2000
of the total charges associated with the restructuring activities
cash outlays will approximate 54 million  the actions will be
completed in 2001 and 2002 with the majority of the cash outlays in
2001  the associated annual savings are estimated at 55 million upon
completion of the actions

page 17

in december 1999 the company recorded a charge of 60 million in
connection with the dissolution of the cummins wartsila joint venture
the joint venture termination was effective december 31 1999 with
the company taking over the operations and assets of the product line
manufactured in daventry england

the company recorded charges in 1998 totaling 125 million comprised
of 100 million of costs associated with the companys plan to
restructure consolidate and exit certain business activities and 25
million for a civil penalty resulting from an agreement reached with
the us environmental protection agency epa and the department of
justice regarding diesel engine emissions  in addition the company
recorded special charges of 14 million for inventory writedowns
associated with restructuring actions

the company is concluding the restructuring plan implemented in the
third quarter of 1998  in the third quarter of 2000 the company
reversed excess accruals from 1998 of 7 million and recorded 7
million of charges related to new actions committed to during the
quarter  inclusive of the third quarter action as of december 31
2000 approximately 127 million has been charged against the
liabilities associated with these actions  the company funded the
restructuring actions using cash generated from operations  the
remaining actions to be completed consist primarily of the payment of
severance commitments to terminated employees in early 2001 and the
final epa payment to be made in july 2001

     other
     

interest expense of 86 million was 11 million higher than in 1999
and 15 million higher than in 1998  higher borrowing levels in 2000
accounted for the increase from 1999  increased borrowings and lower
capitalization of interest accounted for the increase as compared to
1998  as disclosed in note 5 to the consolidated financial
statements other income and expense went from 8 million of expense
in 1999 to 1 million of income in 2000 primarily due to non
recurring transactions recorded in both years

     provision for income taxes
     

the companys income tax provision in 2000 was a benefit of 19
million combining an effective tax rate of 23 percent from operations
and an effective tax rate of 35 percent from special charges  the
effective tax rate from operations in 2000 reflected reduced taxes on
export sales and research tax credits  in 1999 the companys tax
provision was 55 million reflecting an effective tax rate of 25
percent  in 1998 the companys tax provision was 4 million with
the tax benefits from export sales and the research credit more than
offset by the unfavorable tax effects of nondeductible losses in
foreign joint ventures and nondeductible epa penalty and goodwill
amortization

     minority interest
     

minority interest in net earnings of consolidated entities was 14
million in 2000 an increase of 8 million from 1999 and an increase
of 3 million from 1998  the increase from 1999 was primarily due to
higher earnings attributable to minority partners of cummins india
limited and improved performance of the joint venture with scania

page 18

during 2000 net cash provided from operating activities was 388
million reflecting the companys decline in net earnings and the non
cash effect of depreciation and amortization reduced by increases in
working capital  as disclosed in note 1 to the consolidated financial
statements the company sold receivables in 2000 in a securitization
program which yielded proceeds of 219 million  the company is funding
the cash requirements for restructuring actions using cash generated from
operations with the majority of the cash requirement expected to occur in
2001  net cash used in investing activities in 2000 was 312 million and
included planned capital expenditures of 228 million  capital
expenditures were 215 million in 1999 and 271 million in 1998  the
higher level of net cash requirements in 1998 was due primarily to the
acquisition of nelson acquisitions in 2000 included the south africa
distributorship and the purchase of assets from the dissolution of the
wartsila joint venture investments in joint ventures and alliances in
2000 of 53 million reflected the net effect of capital contributions and
cash generated by certain joint ventures

net cash used in financing activities was 86 million in 2000  this cash
was used for dividend payments repurchases of the companys stock and
payments on borrowings  as disclosed in note 7 to the consolidated
financial statements the company issued 765 million face amount of
notes and debentures in 1998 under a 1 billion registration statement
filed with the securities and exchange commission in december 1997  the
net proceeds were used to finance the acquisition of nelson and to pay
down other indebtedness outstanding at december 31 1997  based on the
companys projected cash flows from operations and existing credit
facilities management believes that sufficient liquidity is available to
meet anticipated capital and dividend requirements in the foreseeable
future

     legalenvironmental matters
     

the company and its subsidiaries are defendants in a number of pending
legal actions that arise in the normal course of business including
environmental claims and actions related to use and performance of the
companys products  such matters are more fully described in note 17 to
the consolidated financial statements  in the event the company is
determined to be liable for damages in connection with such actions or
proceedings the unreserved portion of such liability is not expected to
have a material adverse effect on the companys results of operations
cash flows or financial condition

     market risk
     

the company is exposed to financial risk resulting from volatility in
foreign exchange rates interest rates and commodity prices  this
risk is closely monitored and managed through the use of derivative
contracts  as clearly stated in the companys policies and
procedures financial derivatives are used expressly for hedging
purposes and under no circumstances are they used for speculating or
for trading  transactions are entered into only with banking
institutions with strong credit ratings and thus  the credit risk
associated with these contracts is considered immaterial  hedging
program results and status are reported to senior management on a
monthly and quarterly basis

the following section describes the companys risk exposures and
provides results of sensitivity analyses performed on december 31
2000  the sensitivity tests assumed instantaneous parallel shifts in
foreign currency exchange rates commodity prices and interest rate
yield curves

a  foreign exchange rates

due to its international business presence the company transacts
extensively in foreign currencies  as a result corporate earnings
experience some volatility related to movements in exchange rates  in
order to exploit the benefits of global diversification and naturally
offsetting currency positions foreign exchange balance sheet
exposures are aggregated and hedged at the corporate level through the
use of foreign exchange forward contracts  the objective of the
foreign exchange hedging program is to reduce earnings volatility
resulting from the translation of net foreign exchange balance sheet
positions  a hypothetical instantaneous 10 percent adverse movement
in the foreign currency exchange rates would decrease earnings by
approximately 4 million in the current reporting period  the
sensitivity analysis ignores the impact of foreign exchange movements
on cummins competitive position as well as the remoteness of the
likelihood that all foreign currencies will move in tandem against the
us dollar  the analysis also ignores the offsetting impact on
income of the revaluation of the underlying balance sheet exposures

page 19

b  interest rates

the company currently has in place three interest rate swaps that
effectively convert fixedrate debt into floatingrate debt  the
objective of the swaps is to more efficiently balance borrowing costs
and interest rate risk  a sensitivity analysis assumed a
hypothetical instantaneous 100 basispoint parallel increase in the
floating interest rate yield curve after which rates remained fixed
at the new higher level for a oneyear period  this change in yield
curve would correspond to a 4 million increase in interest expense
for the oneyear period  this sensitivity analysis does not account
for the change in the companys competitive environment indirectly
related to changes in interest rates and the potential managerial
action taken in response to these changes

c  commodity prices

the company is exposed to fluctuation in commodity prices through the
purchase of raw materials as well as contractual agreements with
component suppliers  given the historically volatile nature of
commodity prices this exposure can significantly impact product
costs  the company uses commodity swap agreements to partially hedge
exposures to changes in copper and aluminum prices  given a
hypothetical instantaneous 10 percent depreciation of the underlying
commodity price with prices then remaining fixed for a 12month
period the company would experience a loss of approximately 1
million for the annual reporting period  this amount excludes the
offsetting impact of decreases in commodity costs

               notes to consolidated financial statements
               


note 1  accounting policies

principles of consolidation  the consolidated financial statements
include all significant majorityowned subsidiaries  affiliated
companies in which cummins does not have a controlling interest or
for which control is expected to be temporary are accounted for using
the equity method  use of estimates and assumptions as determined by
management is required in the preparation of consolidated financial
statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles  actual results could differ from these estimates and
assumptions

revenue recognition  the company recognizes revenues on the sale of
its products net of estimated costs of returns allowances and sales
incentives when the products are shipped to customers  the company
generally sells its products on open account under credit terms
customary to the region of distribution  the company performs ongoing
credit evaluations of its customers and generally does not require
collateral to secure its customers receivables

foreign currency  assets and liabilities of foreign entities where
the local currency is the functional currency have been translated at
yearend exchange rates and income and expenses have been translated
to us dollars at averageperiod rates  adjustments resulting from
translation have been recorded in shareholders investment and are
included in net earnings only upon sale or liquidation of the
underlying foreign investment

for foreign entities where the us dollar is the functional currency
including those operating in highly inflationary economies inventory
property plant and equipment balances and related income statement
accounts have been translated using historical exchange rates  the
resulting gains and losses have been credited or charged to net
earnings and were net losses of 14 million in 2000 2 million in
1999 and 5 million in 1998

derivative instruments  the company makes use of derivative
instruments in its foreign exchange commodity price and interest rate
hedging programs  derivatives currently in use are commodity and
interest rate swaps as well as foreign currency forward contracts
these contracts are used strictly for hedging and not for speculative
purposes  refer to note 10 for more information on derivative
financial instruments

the company enters into commodity swaps to offset the companys
exposure to price volatility for certain raw materials used in the
manufacturing process  as the company has the discretion to settle
these transactions either in cash or by taking physical delivery
these contracts are not considered financial instruments for
accounting purposes  these commodity swaps are accounted for as
hedges

in june 1998 the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no
133 on accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities
the statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after june 15
2000  the company will adopt this statement at the beginning of
fiscal 2001 and has evaluated and modified its hedging strategy as it
applies to the new statement  the statement will not have a material
effect on the companys results of operations

other costs  estimated costs of commitments for product coverage
programs are charged to earnings at the time the company sells its
products

research  development expenditures net of contract reimbursements
are expensed when incurred and were 224 million in 2000 218 million
in 1999 and 228 million in 1998

maintenance and repair costs are charged to earnings as incurred

cash equivalents  cash equivalents include all highly liquid
investments with an original maturity of three months or less at the

circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may be
impaired  in accordance with sfas no 121 if the quoted market price
or if not available the undiscounted cash flows are not sufficient
to support the recorded asset value an impairment loss is recorded to
reduce the carrying value of the asset to the amount of expected
discounted cash flows this same policy is followed for goodwill

software  internal and external software costs excluding research
reengineering and training are capitalized and amortized generally
over 5 years  capitalized software net of amortization was 110
million at december 31 2000 110 million at december 31 1999 and
75 million at december 31 1998  total software amortization expense
was 27 million in 2000 18 million in 1999 and 8 million in 1998

earnings per share  basic earnings per share of common stock are computed
by dividing net earnings by the weightedaverage number of shares
outstanding for the period  diluted earnings per share are computed by
dividing net earnings by the weightedaverage number of shares assuming the
exercise of stock options when the effect of their exercise is dilutive
shares of stock held by the employee benefits trust are not included in
outstanding shares for eps until distributed from the trust

note 3  special charges  in 1998 the company recorded special
charges of 92 million for product coverage costs and inventory write
downs  the product coverage special charges of 78 million included
43 million primarily attributable to the recent experience of higher
than anticipated base warranty costs to repair certain automotive
engines manufactured in previous years and 35 million related to a
revised estimate of product coverage cost liability primarily for
extended warranty programs  the special charges also included 14
million for inventory writedowns associated with the companys
restructuring and exit activities  these writedowns related to
amounts of inventory rendered excess or unusable due to the closing or
consolidation of facilities

note 4  restructuring asset impairment and other special charges
the 2000 financial results included charges of 160 million 103
million after tax or 271 per share reflecting restructuring
actions asset impairments and other activities largely focused in the
engine business  these actions were taken in response to the downturn
in the north american heavyduty truck market and related conditions
the charges included 42 million attributable to employee severance
actions 72 million for impairment of equipment and other assets 30
million for impairment of software developed for internal use where
the programs were cancelled prior to implementation and 16 million
associated with exit costs to close or consolidate a number of smaller
business operations

of the 160 million charge 131 million was assigned to the engine
business 19 million to the power generation business and 10 million
to the filtration business and other

workforce reduction actions included overall cutbacks in staffing
levels plus the impacts of closing and consolidating operations
restructuring charges for workforce reductions included the severance
costs and related benefits of terminating 600 salaried employees and
830 hourly employees  costs for workforce reductions were based on
amounts pursuant to benefit programs or statutory requirements of the
affected operations

the asset impairment loss of 72 million was calculated in accordance
with the provisions of sfas 121  asset impairment of equipment from
discontinuing operations was primarily for engine assembly and fuel
system manufacturing equipment to be disposed of upon the closure or
consolidation of production operations  the asset impairment charge
included a writedown of 38 million for manufacturing equipment that
will continue to be used for approximately two years  depreciation
will continue on these assets over that period of time  the expected
recovery value of equipment to be disposed of was based on estimated
salvage value and was excluded from the writedown  the charge also
included 11 million for equipment available for disposal 6 million
for properties available for disposal 10 million for investments and
7 million for intangibles and minority interest positions related to
divesting smaller operations and investments  the carrying value of
assets held for disposal and the effect from suspending depreciation
on such assets is immaterial

the asset impairment charge of 30 million consisted of capitalized
softwareinprocess being developed for internal use  the charge was
related to manufacturing financial and administrative information
technology programs cancelled during program development and prior to
implementation

exit costs of 16 million to close or consolidate a number of small
businesses and operations included 6 million for equipment removal
costs 5 million to satisfy contractual obligations and 5 million
for other exit costs  as the restructuring actions consist primarily
of the closing or consolidation of smaller operations the company
does not expect these actions to have a material effect on future
revenues

approximately 73 million primarily related to the writedown of impaired
equipment and software and employee severance payments has been charged to
the restructuring liabilities as of december 31 2000  of the total
charges associated with the restructuring activities cash outlays will
approximate 54 million  the actions will be completed in 2001 and 2002
with the majority of the cash outlays in 2001  the associated annual
savings are estimated at 55 million upon completion of the actions

activities in the major components of these charges is as follows

note 10  financial instruments and risk management  the company is
exposed to financial risk resulting from volatility in foreign
exchange rates and interest rates  this risk is closely monitored and
managed through the use of financial derivative contracts  as clearly
stated in the companys policies and procedures financial derivatives
are used expressly for hedging purposes and under no circumstances
are they used for speculating or trading  transactions are entered
into only with banking institutions with strong credit ratings and
thus the credit risk associated with these contracts is considered
immaterial  hedging program results and status are reported to senior
management on a periodic basis

foreign exchange rates
due to its international business presence the company uses foreign
exchange forward contracts to manage its exposure to exchange rate
volatility  foreign exchange balance sheet exposures are aggregated
and hedged at the corporate level  maturities on these instruments
generally fall within the onemonth and sixmonth range  the
objective of the hedging program is to reduce earnings volatility
resulting from the translation of net foreign exchange balance sheet
positions  the total notional amount of these forward contracts
outstanding at december 31 was as follows

interest rates
the company manages its exposure to interest rate fluctuations through
the use of interest rate swaps  currently the company has in place
three interest rate swaps that effectively convert fixedrate debt
into floatingrate debt  the objective of the swaps is to more
efficiently balance borrowing costs and interest rate risk  the
contracts were established during 1998 and 1999 and have a total
notional value of 350 million

fair value of financial instruments
based on borrowing rates currently available to the company for bank
loans with similar terms and average maturities the fair value of total
debt including current maturities at december 31 2000 approximated
1138 million  the carrying value at that date was 1196 million  at
december 31 1999 the fair and carrying values of total debt including
current maturities were 1104 million and 1215 million respectively
the carrying values of all other receivables and liabilities approximated
fair values

note 11  retirement plans  the company has various contributory and
noncontributory pension plans covering substantially all employees
cummins common stock represented 9 percent of pension plan assets at
december 31 2000

cummins also provides various health care and life insurance benefits
to eligible retirees and their dependents but reserves the right to
change benefits covered under these plans  the plans are contributory
with retirees contributions adjusted annually and they contain other
costsharing features such as deductibles coinsurance and spousal
contributions  the general policy is to fund benefits as claims and
premiums are incurred

the projected benefit obligation accumulated benefit obligation and
fair value of plan assets for plans with accumulated benefit obligations
in excess of plan assets were 697 million 682 million and 558
million respectively as of december 31 2000 and 651 million 636
million and 513 million respectively as of december 31 1999  the
assumed longterm rate of compensation increase for salaried plans was
525 percent in 2000 and 1999  other significant assumptions for the
companys principal plans were

longterm rate of return on plan assets     100    90

for measurement purposes a 7 percent annual increase in health care
costs was assumed for 2001 decreasing gradually to 55 percent in five
years and remaining constant thereafter

increasing the health care cost trend rate by 1 percent would increase
the obligation by 48 million and annual expense by 4 million
decreasing the health care cost trend rate by 1 percent would decrease
the obligation by 43 million and annual expense by 3 million
