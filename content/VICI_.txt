our portfolio also includes three real estate loan investments that we have originated for strategic reasons in connection with transactions that may provide the potential to convert our investment into the ownership of certain of the underlying real estate in the future in addition we own approximately 34 acres of undeveloped or underdeveloped land on and adjacent to the las vegas strip that is leased to caesars which we may look to monetize as appropriate we also own and operate four championship golf courses located near certain of our properties two of which are in close proximity to the las vegas strip 

we lease our properties to subsidiaries of or entities managed by caesars penn national seminole hard rock century casinos jack entertainment ebci and apollo with caesars being our largest tenant and subsequent to the mgp transactions mgm and caesars being our largest tenants we believe we have a mutually beneficial relationship with each of our tenants all of which are leading owners and operators of gaming entertainment and leisure properties our longterm triplenet lease agreements with our tenants provide us with a highly predictable revenue stream with embedded growth potential we believe our geographic diversification limits the effect of changes in any one market on our overall performance we are focused on driving longterm total returns through managing experiential asset growth and allocating capital diligently maintaining a highly productive tenant base and optimizing our capital structure to support external growth as a growth focused public real estate investment trust with longterm investments we expect our relationship with our partners will position us for the acquisition of additional properties across leisure and hospitality over the long term despite the ongoing impact and uncertainty of the covid19 pandemic we continue to evaluate and may opportunistically pursue accretive acquisitions or investments that may arise in the market  

our portfolio is competitively positioned and wellmaintained pursuant to the terms of the lease agreements which require our tenants to invest in our properties and in line with our tenants’ commitment to build guest loyalty we anticipate our tenants will continue to make strategic valueenhancing investments in our properties over time helping to maintain their competitive position in addition given our scale and deep industry knowledge we believe we are wellpositioned to execute highly complementary singleasset and portfolio acquisitions as well as other investments to augment growth as market conditions allow with a focus on disciplined capital allocation 

we conduct our operations as a real estate investment trust “reit” for us federal income tax purposes we generally will not be subject to us federal income taxes on our taxable income to the extent that we annually distribute all of our net taxable income to stockholders and maintain our qualification as a reit we believe our election of reit status combined with the income generation from the lease agreements will enhance our ability to make distributions to our stockholders providing investors with current income as well as longterm growth subject to the current macroeconomic impact of the covid19 pandemic and market conditions more broadly we conduct our real property business through our operating partnership and our golf course business through a taxable reit subsidiary a “trs” vici golf 

impact of the covid19 pandemic on our business 

since the emergence of the covid19 pandemic in early 2020 among the broader public health societal and global impacts the pandemic has resulted in governmental andor regulatory actions imposing temporary closures or restrictions from time to time on our tenants’ operations at our properties and our golf course operations although all of our leased properties and our golf courses are currently open and operating without restriction in some jurisdictions they remain subject to any current or future operating limitations restrictions or closures imposed by governmental andor regulatory authorities while our tenants’ recent performance at many of our leased properties has been at or above prepandemic levels our tenants may continue to face additional challenges and uncertainty due to the impact of the covid19 pandemic such as complying with operational and capacity restrictions and ensuring sufficient employee staffing and service levels and the sustainability of maintaining improved operating margins and financial performance the ongoing nature of the pandemic including the impact of emerging variants may further adversely affect our tenants’ businesses and accordingly our business and financial performance could be

adversely affected in the future 

all of our tenants have fulfilled their rent obligations through february 2022 and we regularly engage with our tenants in connection with their business performance operations liquidity and financial results as a triplenet lessor we believe we are generally in a strong creditor position and structurally insulated from operational and performance impacts of our tenants both positive and negative however the full extent to which the covid19 pandemic continues to adversely affect our tenants and ultimately impacts us depends on future developments which cannot be predicted with confidence including the actions taken to contain the pandemic or mitigate its impact including the availability distribution public acceptance and efficacy of approved vaccines new or mutated variants of covid19 including vaccineresistant variants or a similar virus the direct and indirect economic effects of the pandemic and containment measures on our tenants our tenants’ financial performance and any future operating limitations or closures for more information refer to “ part i – item 1a risk factors ” included in this annual report on form 10k 

our competitive strengths 

we believe the following strengths effectively position us to execute our business and growth strategies 

• leading portfolio of highquality experiential gaming hospitality entertainment and leisure assets our portfolio features caesars palace las vegas harrah’s las vegas and the venetian resort and marketleading urban destination and regional properties with significant scale our properties are wellmaintained and leased to leading brands such as venetian caesars harrah’s harvey’s horseshoe margaritaville greektown jack hard rock century and mountaineer these brands seek to drive loyalty and value with guests through superior service and products and continuous innovation our portfolio benefits from its strong mix of demand generators including casinos guest rooms restaurants entertainment facilities bars and nightclubs and convention space we believe our properties are generally wellinsulated from incremental competition as a result of high replacement costs as well as regulatory restrictions and longlead times for new development the high quality of our properties appeals to a broad base of customers stimulating traffic and visitation 

our portfolio is anchored by our las vegas properties caesars palace las vegas harrah’s las vegas and the venetian resort which are located at the center of the las vegas strip w e believe las vegas is historically a market characterized by steady economic growth and high consumer and business demand with limited new supply although such characteristics have been negatively impacted due to the covid19 pandemic our las vegas properties which are two of the most iconic entertainment facilities in las vegas feature gaming entertainment largescale hotels extensive food and beverage options stateoftheart convention facilities retail outlets and entertainment showrooms 

our portfolio also includes marketleading regional resorts and destinations that we believe are benefiting from significant invested capital over recent years the regional properties we own include awardwinning casinos hotels and entertainment facilities that are generally market leaders within their respective regions 

subsequent to the closing of the mgp transactions which we anticipate will occur in the first half of 2022 we will add 15 highquality properties seven of which are located on the las vegas strip and eight of which are regional gaming destinations 

under the terms of the lease agreements our tenants are required to continue to invest in our properties which we believe enhances the value of our properties and maintains their competitive market position 

• our properties feature diversified sources of revenue on both a business and geographic basis our portfolio includes 28 geographically diverse casino resorts that serve numerous metropolitan statistical areas “msas” nationally this diversity reduces our exposure to adverse events that may affect any single market this also allows our tenants to derive multiple revenue streams from an economically diverse set of customers and services to such customers these include gaming food and beverage entertainment hospitality and other sources of revenue we believe that this geographic diversity and the diversity of revenue sources that our tenants derive from our leased properties improves the stability of rental revenue subsequent to the closing of the mgp transactions we will add 15 highquality properties to our portfolio serving three additional msas nationally

risks related to our business and operations 

we are and will always be significantly dependent on our tenants for our revenues an event that has a material adverse effect on any of our significant tenants’ businesses financial condition liquidity results of operations or prospects could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition liquidity results of operations and prospects 

we depend on our tenants to operate the properties that we own in a manner that generates revenues sufficient to allow the tenants to meet their obligations to us currently a significant percentage of our revenue comes from caesars comprising 84 of our total revenues for the year ended december 31 2021 and following the closing of the venetian acquisition and the completion of the pending mgp transactions from caesars and mgm with caesars representing approximately 42 of total estimated annualized cash rent and mgm representing approximately 36 of total estimated annualized cash rent after taking into account mgm’s pending sale of the operations of the mirage hotel  casino in las vegas because the leases are triplenet leases in addition to the rent payment obligations for these tenants we will depend on these tenants to pay substantially all insurance taxes utilities and maintenance and repair expenses in connection with these leased properties and to indemnify defend and hold us harmless from and against various claims litigation and liabilities arising in connection with their businesses there can be no assurance that our significant tenants will have sufficient assets income or access to financing to enable them to satisfy their payment and other obligations under their leases with us or that the applicable guarantor will be able to satisfy its guarantee of the applicable tenant’s obligations 

our tenants rely on the properties they or their respective subsidiaries own andor operate for income to satisfy their obligations including their debt service requirements and rental and other payments due to us or others for example caesars relies on our properties the caesars forum convention center and their other operations to satisfy their payment obligations under the caesars lease agreements and the forum convention center mortgage loan if income at these properties were to decline for any reason including as a result of the covid19 pandemic or if a tenant’s debt service requirements were to increase or if their creditworthiness were to become impaired for any reason a tenant or the applicable guarantor may become unable or unwilling to satisfy its payment and other obligations under their leases or other agreements with us the inability or unwillingness of a significant tenant to meet its payment or other obligations under a lease or other payment obligation with us could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition liquidity results of operations and prospects including our ability to make distributions to our stockholders 

the gaming and entertainment industry is highly competitive and our tenants’ failure to continue to compete successfully could adversely affect their businesses financial conditions results of operations and cash flows in particular our tenants’ businesses may be adversely impacted by the reinvestment and expansion by competitors in existing jurisdictions an expansion of gaming in existing jurisdictions or into new jurisdictions in which gaming was not previously permitted which would result in increased competition in these jurisdictions additionally the casino entertainment industry represents a significant source of tax revenues to the various jurisdictions in which casinos operate from time to time various state and federal legislators and officials have proposed changes in tax laws or in the administration of such laws including increases in tax rates which would affect the industry if adopted such changes could adversely impact the business financial condition and results of operations of our significant tenants 

due to our dependence on rental and other payments from our significant tenants as our primary source of revenue we may be limited in our ability to enforce our rights under our leases or other agreements with our significant tenants or terminate such 

table of contents 

other agreements or due to our predominantly master lease structure certain leases with respect to any particular property failure by our significant tenants to comply with the terms of their respective leases or to comply with the gaming regulations to which the leased properties are subject could result in among other things the termination of an applicable ground lease requiring us to find another tenant for such property to the extent possible and there could be a decrease or cessation of rental payments by such tenants as the case may be in such event we may lose our interest in a property subject to an applicable ground lease or be unable to locate a suitable creditworthy tenant at similar rental rates or at all which would have the effect of reducing our rental revenues and could have a material adverse effect on us 

the covid19 pandemic has adversely impacted our tenants’ operations and financial performance as well as global and us economic activity and market performance which could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition liquidity results of operations and prospects 

since the emergence of the covid19 pandemic in early 2020 covid19 has spread globally and created considerable health risks in the united states and around the world resulting in severely adversely impacted global national and regional economic activity several countries including the united states have instituted and continue to institute various restrictions on travel and large gatherings in connection with these actions state governments andor regulatory authorities issued various directives mandates orders or similar actions which resulted in temporary closures of our tenants’ operations at all of our properties and our golf course operations relevant authorities may issue additional directives mandates orders or similar actions which could result in additional closures of our tenants’ operations and our golf course operations 

in addition our tenants have experienced a substantial number of cancellations and reductions in events and reservations in connection with the ongoing pandemic including as a result of the most recent emergence of new variants and may in the future experience similar cancellations and reductions this reduced customer activity adversely affected our tenants’ financial performance and any similar future impacts could be material to us depending on the ultimate duration of the pandemic and the magnitude of any future reductions in our tenants’ customer activity and engagement 

although all of our leased properties and our golf courses are currently open and operating without restriction in some jurisdictions they remain subject to any current or future operating limitations restrictions or closures imposed by state and local governments andor regulatory authorities while our tenants’ recent performance at many of our leased properties has been at or above prepandemic levels our tenants may continue to face additional challenges and uncertainty due to the impact of the covid19 pandemic such as complying with operational and capacity restrictions ensuring sufficient employee staffing and service levels and maintaining improved operating margins and financial performance the ongoing nature of the pandemic including the impact of emerging variants may further adversely affect our tenants’ businesses and accordingly our business and financial performance could be adversely affected in the future 

we cannot predict with confidence whether government or regulatory orders or travel and other restrictions including orders and restrictions reimposed in connection with the increase in the covid19 infection rate that began in late 2021 and early 2022 as a result of an emerging variant will end or whether such regulations and restrictions will affect our tenants’ performance in addition due to the current volatility in the debt and equity markets we may be unable to obtain financing for future acquisitions on satisfactory terms or at all increased disruption and instability in the global financial markets or a deterioration in credit and financing conditions may affect our access to debt and equity capital in order to fund business operations if necessary or address maturing liabilities on a timely basis as well as our tenants’ ability to fund their business operations meet their obligations to us and secure financing for any future or pending transactions 

the full extent to which our business and results of operations will ultimately be affected by the covid19 pandemic and any resulting negative economic impacts and the extent to which such factors continue to adversely affect our tenants will largely depend on future developments including the duration of the pandemic the actions taken to contain the pandemic or mitigate its impact including the availability distribution and efficacy of one or more vaccines new or mutated strains of covid19 or a similar virus including vaccineresistant strains and the direct and indirect economic effects of the pandemic and containment measures on our tenants including the length of time our tenants’ operations at our properties remain restricted or whether the properties are required to partially or fully close again in the future and our tenants’ financial performance while open and during any such closures in addition new information may continue to emerge concerning the covid19 pandemic and actions required or recommended to be undertaken to contain the covid19 pandemic or address its future impact including the response of the us and global economies and the short and longterm impact of the covid19 pandemic on our tenants’ operations at our properties could further materially and adversely impact our business and results and operations 

the occurrence of any of the foregoing events or any other related matters could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition liquidity results of operations prospects and the value of our common stock

because a concentrated portion of our revenues are generated from the las vegas strip we are subject to greater risks than a company that is more geographically diversified 

our properties on the las vegas strip generated approximately 32 of our total revenues for the year ended december 31 2021 and subsequent to the venetian acquisition and mgp transactions are expected to generate approximately 45 of our total estimated annualized cash rent and we expect this concentration to continue in the foreseeable future therefore our business may be significantly affected by risks common to the las vegas tourism industry for example the cost and availability of air services and the impact of any events that disrupt air travel to and from las vegas including the impact of measures implemented to address the covid19 pandemic can adversely affect the business of our tenants we cannot control the number or frequency of flights to or from las vegas but our largest tenant caesars relies on air traffic for a significant portion of their visitors to these properties reductions in flights by major airlines as a result of higher fuel prices lower demand labor shortages or public health considerations including as a result of the covid19 pandemic has impacted and may continue to impact the number of visitors to our properties additionally there is one principal interstate highway between las vegas and southern california where a large number of the customers that frequent our properties on the las vegas strip reside any limitations on travel from southern california to our properties on the las vegas strip such as capacity constraints of that highway or any other traffic disruptions may also affect the number of customers who visit our facilities moreover due to the importance of our three properties and following the completion of the pending mgp transactions ten properties on the las vegas strip we may be disproportionately affected by general risks such as acts of terrorism natural disasters including major fires floods and earthquakes and severe or inclement weather including as a result of climate change should such developments occur in or nearby las vegas in addition a material adverse impact on caesars and following the completion of the pending mgp transactions mgm even unrelated to their operations in las vegas that negatively affects their financial condition could materially and adversely affect us given our reliance on their performance as tenants in our properties on the las vegas strip 

our significant tenants and their subsidiaries are required to pay a significant portion of their cash flow from operations to us pursuant to and subject to the terms and conditions of our respective lease agreements and loan and other agreements with them as well as interest payments on their outstanding indebtedness which could adversely affect our significant tenants’ business and operating condition as well as their ability to satisfy their contractual payment obligations to us 

our significant tenants are obligated to pay us rent under our lease agreements for the duration of the respective terms for example caesars which is our largest tenant and subsequent to the mgp transactions will be one of our largest tenants with mgm is obligated to pay us in the aggregate approximately 57 billion in fixed annual rents under the caesars lease agreements payments under the forum convention center mortgage loan and golf course membership fees under the golf course use agreement over the next five years subject to certain escalators and adjustments under the applicable agreements 

in addition annual rent escalations under our lease agreements over specified periods will continue to apply regardless of the amount of cash flows generated by the properties that are subject to such lease agreements through our partner property growth fund we may also agree with our tenants to fund capital improvements in exchange for increased rent under the applicable lease agreement which would increase the amount of such tenant’s rent obligations to us in accordance with the terms of the funding accordingly if the cash flows generated by such properties decrease do not increase at the same rate as the rent escalations or do not increase as anticipated in connection with any such capital improvements the rents payable under such lease agreements will comprise a higher percentage of the cash flows generated by the applicable tenant and its subsidiaries which could make it more difficult for the applicable subsidiaries to meet their payment obligations to us under the lease agreements and could ultimately adversely affect the applicable guarantor’s ability to satisfy their respective obligations to us under the related guarantees see item 1 “businessour lease agreement s ” and item 1 “businessour relationship with caesars ” for additional information regarding such agreements if our significant tenants’ businesses and properties fail to generate sufficient earnings they may be unable to satisfy their or their subsidiaries’ obligations under their respective lease agreements and loan and other agreements including related guarantees 

additionally these obligations may limit our significant tenants’ ability to fund their operations or development projects raise capital make acquisitions and otherwise respond to competitive and economic changes by making investments to maintain and grow their portfolio of businesses and properties which may adversely affect their competitiveness and the ability of their applicable subsidiaries and guarantors to satisfy their obligations to us under the applicable lease agreements and the related guarantees respectively moreover given the importance of our significant tenants to our business a failure on the part of a significant tenant to maintain its business performance or experience any deterioration of its creditworthiness could materially and adversely affect us even in the absence of a default under our agreements with such tenant 

in addition our significant tenants’ indebtedness and the fact that a significant portion of their cash flow may be used to make interest payments could adversely affect their ability to satisfy their obligations to us under the applicable lease agreements and other agreements for example as disclosed in caesars’ quarterly report on form 10q for the quarter ended september 

table of contents 

30 2021 caesars’ consolidated estimated debt service including principal and interest for 2022 will be approximately 880 million and 178 billion thereafter to maturity as a result a significant portion of caesars’ liquidity needs are for debt service including significant interest payments such substantial indebtedness and the restrictive covenants under the agreements governing such indebtedness could limit the ability of the applicable tenants and borrower to satisfy their respective obligations to us under the applicable lease agreements and other agreements with us such as the forum convention center mortgage loan and the ability of the guarantors of our significant tenants to satisfy their obligations under the related guarantees 

we are dependent on the gaming industry and may be susceptible to the risks associated with it including due to the impact of the covid19 pandemic which could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition liquidity results of operations and prospects 

as the landlord and owner of gaming facilities we are impacted by the risks associated with the gaming industry therefore so long as our investments are concentrated in gamingrelated assets our success is dependent on the gaming industry which could be adversely affected by economic conditions in general changes in consumer trends and preferences and other factors over which we and our tenants have no control including the ongoing effects of the covid19 pandemic such as labor shortages travel restrictions supply chain disruptions and property closures as we are subject to risks inherent in substantial investments in a single industry a decrease in the gaming business would likely have a greater adverse effect on us than if we owned a more diversified real estate portfolio particularly because a component of the rent under the lease agreements will be based over time on the performance of the gaming facilities operated by our tenants on our properties and such effect could be material and adverse to our business financial condition liquidity results of operations and prospects 

the gaming industry is characterized by a high degree of competition among a large number of participants including landbased casinos riverboat casinos dockside casinos video lottery sweepstakes and poker machines not located in casinos native american gaming emerging varieties of internet gaming sports betting and other forms of gaming in the united states and in a broader sense gaming operators face competition from all manner of leisure and entertainment activities gaming competition is intense in most of the markets where our facilities are located recently there has been additional significant competition in the gaming industry as a result of the upgrading or expansion of facilities by existing market participants the entrance of new gaming participants into a market internet gaming or legislative changes in various jurisdictions as competing properties and new markets are opened we may be negatively impacted 

in addition the covid19 pandemic has had a severe and unprecedented impact on the gaming industry during this period many gaming companies have faced heightened financial uncertainty or generated substantially reduced revenue and have sought or taken measures intended to maintain liquidity and solvency including employee furloughs and layoffs reduced operating and capital expenditure budgets and contractual relief or other accommodations sought with creditors lenders and other counterparties there is no guarantee that existing governmentimposed restrictions on travel and social gatherings including restrictions imposed in late 2021 in response to an emerging variant will be lifted in the near term that additional governmentimposed restrictions will not be implemented or that previous restrictions that were lifted or modified will not be reinstated moreover the ultimate impact of the covid19 pandemic on the gaming industry the timing and extent of governmentimposed restrictions and the performance of gaming facilities is highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence 

historically economic indicators such as gdp growth consumer confidence and employment are correlated with demand for gaming entertainment and leisure properties such as casinos and racetracks and economic recessions contractions or slowdowns have generally led to a decrease in discretionary spending on associated leisure activities longterm impacts of the covid19 pandemic such as decreases in discretionary spending or changing consumer preferences brought about by global public health concerns and instability in global national and regional economic activity and financial markets could have a longterm material adverse effect on leisure and business travel discretionary spending and other areas of economic behavior that directly impact the gaming industry additionally decreases in discretionary consumer spending brought about by weakened general economic conditions such as but not limited to the impact of the covid19 pandemic lackluster recoveries from recessions contractions high unemployment levels higher income taxes inflation low levels of consumer confidence weakness in the housing market cultural and demographic changes and increased stock market volatility may negatively impact our revenues and operating cash flows because we are dependent on the gaming industry the immediate and longterm effects of the covid19 pandemic on the gaming industry could be material and adverse to our business financial condition liquidity results of operations and prospects

the ownership operation and management of gaming and racing facilities are subject to extensive regulation by one or more gaming authorities in each applicable jurisdiction where gaming and racing facilities are permitted these gaming and racing regulations impact our gaming and racing tenants and persons associated with our gaming and racing facilities which in many jurisdictions include us as the landlord and owner of the real estate certain gaming authorities in the jurisdictions in which we hold properties may require us andor our affiliates to maintain a license as a principal key business entity or supplier because of our status as landlord gaming authorities also retain great discretion to require us to be found suitable as a landlord and certain of our stockholders officers and directors may be required to be found suitable as well regulatory authorities also have broad powers with respect to the licensing of casino operations and may revoke suspend condition or limit the gaming or other licenses of our tenants impose substantial fines or take other actions any one of which could adversely impact the business financial condition and results of operations of our tenants in addition in many jurisdictions licenses are granted for limited durations and require renewal from time to time 

in many jurisdictions gaming laws can require certain of our stockholders to file an application be investigated and qualify or have such person or entity’s suitability determined by gaming authorities gaming authorities have very broad discretion in determining whether a stockholder is required to file an application and whether an applicant should be deemed suitable subject to certain administrative proceeding requirements the gaming regulators have the authority to deny any application or limit condition restrict revoke or suspend any license registration finding of suitability or approval or fine any person licensed registered or found suitable or approved for any cause deemed reasonable by the gaming authorities 

gaming authorities may conduct investigations into the conduct or associations of our directors officers key employees or investors to ensure compliance with applicable standards if we are required to be found suitable and are found suitable as a landlord we will be registered as a public company with the gaming authorities and will be subject to disciplinary action if after we receive notice that a person is unsuitable to be a stockholder or to have any other relationship with us we 

• pay that person any distribution or interest upon any of our securities 

• allow that person to exercise directly or indirectly any voting right conferred through securities held by that person 

• pay remuneration in any form to that person for services rendered or otherwise or 

• fail to pursue all lawful efforts to require such unsuitable person to relinquish his or her securities including if necessary the immediate redemption of such securities in accordance with our charter 

many jurisdictions also require any person who acquires beneficial ownership of more than a certain percentage of voting securities of a gaming company and in some jurisdictions nonvoting securities typically 5 of a publicly traded company to report the acquisition to gaming authorities and gaming authorities may require such holders to apply for qualification licensure or a finding of suitability subject to limited exceptions for “institutional investors” that hold a company’s securities for passive investment purposes only our outstanding shares of capital stock are held subject to applicable gaming laws any person owning or controlling at least 5 of the outstanding shares of any class of our capital stock is required to promptly notify us of such person’s identity and apply for qualification licensure finding of suitability or an institutional investor waiver as applicable some jurisdictions may also limit the number of gaming licenses in which a person may hold an ownership or a controlling interest 

further certain of our directors officers key employees and investors in our shares must meet approval standards of certain gaming regulatory authorities depending on the jurisdiction if such gaming regulatory authorities were to find such a person or investor unsuitable we may be required to sever our relationship with that person or the investor may be required to dispose of his her or its interest in us our charter provides that all of our shares held by investors who are found to be unsuitable by regulatory authorities are subject to redemption upon our receipt of notice of such finding 

additionally because we and our tenants are subject to regulation in numerous jurisdictions and because regulatory agencies within each jurisdiction review compliance with gaming laws in other jurisdictions it is possible that gaming compliance issues in one jurisdiction may lead to reviews and compliance issues in other jurisdictions the loss of gaming licenses by our tenants could result in the cessation of operations at one or more of the facilities we lease to such tenants the loss of gaming licenses by us could result in an event of default under certain of our indebtedness and crossdefault provisions in our debt agreements could cause an event of default under one debt agreement to trigger an event of default under our other debt agreements 

finally substantially all material loans significant acquisitions leases sales of securities and similar financing transactions by us and our subsidiaries must be reported to and in some cases approved by gaming authorities in advance of the transaction

which may include a public offering of certain securities changes in control through merger consolidation stock or asset acquisitions management or consulting agreements or otherwise may be subject to receipt of prior approval of certain gaming authorities entities seeking to acquire control of us or one of our subsidiaries and certain of our affiliates must satisfy gaming authorities with respect to a variety of stringent standards prior to assuming control failure to satisfy the stringent licensing standards may preclude entities from acquiring an ownership or a controlling interest in us or one of our subsidiaries and certain of our affiliates andor require the entities to divest such interest 

required regulatory approvals can delay or prohibit transfers of our gaming properties or the consummation of other pending transactions including consummation of the mergers which could result in periods in which we are unable to receive rent for such properties or otherwise realize the benefits of such transactions which may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition liquidity results of operations and prospects 

our tenants are and any pending and future tenants of our gaming properties will be required to be licensed under applicable law in order to operate any of our properties as gaming facilities if the lease agreements or any future lease agreement we enter into are terminated which could be required by a regulatory agency or expire any new tenant must be licensed and receive other regulatory approvals to operate our properties as gaming facilities any delay in or inability of the new tenant to receive required licenses and other regulatory approvals from the applicable state and county government agencies may prolong the period during which we are unable to collect the applicable rent further in the event that the lease agreements or future lease agreements are terminated or expire and a new tenant is not licensed or fails to receive other regulatory approvals the properties may not be operated as gaming facilities and we will not be able to collect the applicable rent moreover we may be unable to transfer or sell the affected properties as gaming facilities which could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition liquidity results of operations and prospects in addition given the highly regulated nature of the gaming industry any future transactions we enter into are likely to be subject to regulatory approval in one or more jurisdictions including with respect to any transfers in ownership operating licensure or other regulatory considerations if the consummation of a pending transaction including with respect to the future entry into a new lease agreement such as the consummation of the mergers is delayed or prohibited by regulatory authorities we may be limited or otherwise unable to realize the benefits of the proposed transaction 

consummation of the mergers is conditioned on the receipt of approvals from a number of gaming regulatory authorities such gaming regulatory authorities may impose conditions on the granting of such approvals and findings such conditions and the process of obtaining such regulatory approvals could have the effect of delaying or impeding consummation of the mergers or of imposing additional costs or limitations on us following the mergers in addition to the extent any of our officers or a member of our board of directors is found unsuitable we would need to find a replacement which may take time and could adversely impact our financial and operational performance including our ability to successfully consummate the mergers and integrate mgp into vici any such finding of unsuitability by regulatory authorities and resulting resignation or removal of an officer of vici or a member of our board of directors could also impact our governance structure following the mergers 

our longterm triplenet leases may not result in fair market lease rates over time which could negatively impact our results of operations and cash flows and reduce the amount of funds available to make distributions to stockholders 

all of our rental revenue and a substantial majority of our total revenue is generated from the lease agreements which are longterm triplenet leases and provide greater flexibility to the respective tenants related to the use of the applicable leased property than would be the case with ordinary property leases such as the right to sublease certain portions of each leased property to make alterations in the leased premises and to terminate the lease prior to its expiration under specified circumstances furthermore consistent with typical net leases our lease agreements have longer lease terms and thus there is an increased risk that contractual rental increases in future years will fail to result in fair market rental rates during those years as a result our results of operations and cash flows and distributions to our stockholders could be lower than they would otherwise be if we did not enter into longterm triple net leases inflation in december 2021 was at its highest level in approximately 40 years while certain of our lease agreements contain escalation provisions that are tied to changes in the consumer price index “cpi” these escalators in some cases do not apply until the future for example under the regional master lease agreement the escalator is 15 for the second through fifth years of the lease and for the remainder of the term the escalator is cpi subject to a 20 floor certain of these escalators are subject to a maximum cap which could result in lower rent escalation than any such cpi increase in a single year or over a longer period as a result our results of operations and cash flows and distributions to our stockholders could be lower than they would otherwise be if we did not enter into longterm triple net leases 

tenants may choose not to renew the lease agreements 

we enter into longterm lease agreements with our tenants consisting of an initial lease term with the potential for the tenant to extend for multiple additional terms which may be subject to additional terms and conditions for example each of the caesars 

table of contents 

lease agreements has an initial lease term of 15 years with the potential for up to four additional fiveyear term extensions thereafter with the initial lease term under each of the caesars lease agreements extended in connection with the eldorado transaction to expire in july 2035 with respect to the properties under the regional master lease agreement the aggregate lease term including renewals may be cut back to the extent it would otherwise exceed 80 of the remaining useful life of the applicable leased property solely at the option of the tenants at the expiration of the initial lease term or of any additional renewal term thereafter our tenants may choose not to renew the applicable lease agreement if a lease agreement expires without renewal and we are not able to find suitable creditworthy tenants to replace the previous tenants on the same or more attractive terms our business financial condition liquidity results of operations and prospects may be materially and adversely affected including our ability to make distributions to our stockholders at the then current level or at all in particular with respect to the coterminous nature of the caesars lease agreements this risk would be exacerbated if caesars elected not to renew all such lease agreements at any one time 

our ability to sell or dispose of our properties may be limited by the contractual terms of our lease agreements or other agreements with our tenants or otherwise impacted by matters relating to our real estate ownership 

our ability to sell or dispose of our properties may be hindered by among other things the fact that such properties are subject to the lease agreements as the terms of the lease agreements require that a purchaser assume the lease agreements or in certain cases enter into a severance lease with the tenants for the sold property on substantially the same terms as contained in the applicable lease agreement which may make our properties less attractive to a potential buyer than alternative properties that may be for sale 

in connection with the mgp transactions we have agreed with mgm to enter into the mgm tax protection agreement upon consummation of such transactions pursuant to which we have agreed subject to certain exceptions to indemnify mgm and certain other parties for certain tax liabilities resulting from among other things the sale transfer exchange or other disposition of certain properties during a specified period in addition the breit jv previously entered into a tax protection agreement with mgm with respect to builtin gain and debt maintenance related to mgm grand las vegas and mandalay bay which is effective through mid2029 and by acquiring mgp we will bear mgp’s approximate 501 proportionate share in the breit jv of any indemnity under this existing tax protection agreement in the event that we breach restrictions in these agreements we will be liable for grossedup tax amounts associated with the income or gain recognized as a result of such breach therefore although it may be in the best interests of our stockholders for us to sell a certain property it may be economically prohibitive for us to do so during the specified period because of these indemnity obligations see “—risks related to an investment in vici following the mgp transactions—the mgm tax protection agreement during its term imposes certain limits on our operations and could require new vici operating company to indemnify mgm for certain tax liabilities” 

any improvements to a property could also cause mechanic’s liens or similar liens to attach to and constitute liens on our interests in the properties to the extent that such liens are recorded against any of our current or future properties they may restrict our ability to sell or dispose of such properties while they remain in place in addition the holders of such liens may enforce them by court action and courts may cause the applicable properties to be sold to satisfy such liens which could negatively impact our revenues results of operations cash flows and distributions to our stockholders further holders of such liens could have priority over our stockholders in the event of bankruptcy or liquidation and as a result a trustee in bankruptcy may have difficulty realizing or foreclosing on such properties in any such bankruptcy or liquidation and the amount of distributions our stockholders could receive in such bankruptcy or liquidation could be reduced 

if caesars declares bankruptcy and such action results in a lease being recharacterized as a disguised financing transaction in its bankruptcy proceeding our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 

if caesars declares bankruptcy our business could be materially and adversely affected if a bankruptcy court recharacterizes the cplv additional rent acquisition or the hlv additional rent acquisition as a disguised financing transaction in the event of recharacterization our claim under a lease agreement with respect to the additional rent acquired in the hlv additional rent acquisition and cplv additional rent acquisition could either be secured or unsecured generally the leases permit us to take steps to create and perfect a security interest in the leased property but such attempts could be subject to challenge by the tenant or its creditors and with respect to the cplv additional rent acquisition and the hlv additional rent acquisition there is no assurance that a court would find that portion of our claim to be secured the bankrupt lessee and other affiliates of caesars and their creditors under this scenario might have the ability to restructure the terms including the amount owed to us under the applicable lease with respect to the additional rent if approved by the bankruptcy court we could be bound by the new terms and prevented from collecting such additional rent acquired in the cplv additional rent acquisition and hlv additional rent acquisition and our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected

properties within our portfolio are and properties that we may acquire in the future are likely to be operated and promoted under certain trademarks and brand names that we do not own 

most of the properties within our portfolio are currently operated and promoted under trademarks and brand names not owned by us including caesars harrah’s harvey’s horseshoe margaritaville greektown jack hard rock century and mountaineer in addition properties that we may acquire in the future may be operated and promoted under these same trademarks and brand names or under different trademarks and brand names we do not or will not own during the term that our properties are managed by our tenants we will be reliant on our tenants to maintain and protect the trademarks brand names and other licensed intellectual property used in the operation or promotion of the leased properties operation of the leased properties as well as our business and financial condition could be adversely impacted by infringement invalidation unauthorized use or litigation affecting any such intellectual property moreover if any of our properties are rebranded unsuccessfully it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition liquidity results of operations and prospects as we may not enjoy comparable recognition or status under a new brand a transition of management away from one of our tenants could also have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition liquidity results of operations and prospects 

we may not be able to purchase properties pursuant to our rights under certain agreements including putcall and right of first refusal agreements if we are unable to obtain additional financing in addition pursuant to one such agreement we may be forced to dispose of harrah’s las vegas to caesars possibly on disadvantageous terms 

pursuant to the ar convention center putcall agreement the caesars indianapolis putcall agreement the las vegas strip assets rofr agreement the horseshoe baltimore rofr agreement and the danville rofr agreement we have certain rights to purchase the properties subject to these agreements subject to the terms and conditions included in each agreement with respect to each property in order to exercise these rights and any similar rights we obtain in the future or to fulfill our obligations with respect to certain put rights we would likely be required to secure additional financing and our substantial level of indebtedness or other factors could limit our ability to do so on attractive terms or at all if we are unable to obtain financing on terms acceptable to us we may not be able to exercise these rights and acquire these properties including the caesars forum convention center or to fulfill our obligations with respect to certain put rights even if financing with acceptable terms is available to us there can be no assurance that we will exercise any of these rights further each of the transactions remains subject to the terms and conditions of the applicable agreements including with respect to due diligence applicable regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions 

these agreements are subject to additional terms and conditions that may impact our ability to acquire such properties for example the ar convention center putcall agreement also provides that if caesars exercises the convention center put right and among other things the sale of the caesars forum convention center to us does not close under certain circumstances a repurchase right in favor of caesars which if exercised would result in the sale of the harrah’s las vegas property by us to caesars such a sale may be at disadvantageous terms and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition liquidity results of operations and prospects 

the bankruptcy or insolvency of any tenant borrower or guarantor could result in the termination of the lease agreements the related guarantees or loan agreements and material losses to us 

we are subject to the credit risk of our tenants and borrowers we cannot provide assurances that our tenants and borrowers will not default on their obligations and fail to make payments to us in particular disruptions in the financial and credit markets local economic conditions and other factors affecting the gaming industry including the covid19 pandemic may affect our tenants’ and borrowers’ ability to obtain financing to operate their businesses or continue to profitability execute their business plans this in turn may cause our tenants and borrowers to be unable to meet their financial obligations including making rental or loan payments to us as applicable which may result in their bankruptcy or insolvency in addition in the event of a bankruptcy of our tenants borrowers or their respective guarantors any claim for damages under the applicable lease loan agreement or guarantee may not be paid in full for these and other reasons the bankruptcy of one or more of our tenants borrowers or their respective guarantors could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition liquidity results of operations and prospects 

furthermore with respect to tenants whose obligations are guaranteed by a single guarantor including caesars and following the closing of the mgp transactions mgm although the tenants’ performance and payments are guaranteed a default by the applicable tenant or by the guarantor with regard to its guarantee may cause a default under certain circumstances with regard to the entire portfolio covered by the respective lease agreements in event of such a default there can be no assurances that the tenants or the guarantor would assume the applicable lease agreements or the related guarantees and if such lease agreements or guarantees were rejected the tenant or the guarantor as applicable may not have sufficient funds to pay the

damages that would be owed to us as a result of the rejection and we might not be able to find a replacement tenant on the same or better terms 

our pursuit of investments in and acquisitions of additional properties and other strategic opportunities may be unsuccessful or fail to meet our expectations 

we intend to continue to pursue acquisitions of additional properties and seek acquisitions investments and other strategic opportunities accordingly we may often be engaged in evaluating potential transactions and other strategic alternatives including through discussions with potential counterparties that may result in one or more transactions in addition from time to time we have entered and may in the future enter into strategic arrangements with counterparties which arrangements may be nonbinding or subject to conditions including the negotiation of definitive documentation although there is uncertainty that any of these discussions or arrangements will result in definitive agreements the completion of any transaction or the realization of the anticipated benefits of any transaction we may devote a significant amount of our management resources to such a transaction which could negatively impact our operations we may incur significant costs in connection with seeking acquisitions or other strategic opportunities regardless of whether the transaction is completed and to the extent applicable in combining our operations if such a transaction is completed 

we operate in a highly competitive industry and face competition from other reits investment companies private equity firms and hedge funds sovereign funds lenders gaming companies and other investors some of whom are significantly larger and have greater resources access to capital and lower costs of capital increased competition will make it more challenging to identify and successfully capitalize on acquisition opportunities that meet our investment objectives if we cannot identify and purchase or make investments in a sufficient quantity of gaming properties and other experiential properties at favorable prices or if we are unable to finance acquisitions on commercially favorable terms our business financial condition liquidity results of operations and prospects could be materially and adversely affected additionally the fact that we must distribute 90 of our reit taxable income in order to maintain our qualification as a reit may limit our ability to rely upon rental payments from our leased properties or subsequently acquired properties in order to finance acquisitions as a result if debt or equity financing is not available on acceptable terms further acquisitions might be limited or curtailed 

investments in and acquisitions of gaming properties and other experiential properties as well as investments in our existing properties through our partner property growth fund entail risks associated with real estate investments generally including that the investment’s performance will fail to meet expectations that the cost estimates for necessary property improvements will prove inaccurate or the operator or manager will underperform in addition we may not realize the benefits of our partner property growth fund opportunities on a timely basis or at all and such opportunities may be dependent upon independent decisions made by our tenants with respect to any capital improvement projects and the source of funds for such projects as well as the total funding ultimately requested under such arrangements in addition our partner property growth fund opportunities may be subject to the negotiation of definitive documentation or other conditions or additional terms and conditions pursuant to our existing lease agreements or separate agreements we may enter into with our tenants with respect to such opportunities 

further even if we were able to acquire or invest in additional properties in the future there is no guarantee that such properties would be able to maintain their historical performance or achieve their projected performance which may prevent the ability of our tenants to pay the partial or total amount of the required lease payments under the respective lease agreements or our borrowers to fulfill their payment obligations under the applicable agreement in addition our financing of these acquisitions and investments could negatively impact our cash flows and liquidity require us to incur substantial debt or involve the issuance of substantial new equity which would be dilutive to existing stockholders due to market considerations and in light of the timing typically required to obtain regulatory approvals for gaming transactions any such financing may take place substantially in advance of closing of such transaction and the receipt of rent or other payments under a lease or other applicable agreement and negatively impact our operating results during such period in addition we cannot make assurances that we will be successful in implementing our business and growth strategies or that any expansion will improve operating results the failure to identify and acquire or invest in new properties effectively or the failure of any acquired properties to perform as expected could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition liquidity results of operations and prospects and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders 

we may sell or divest different properties or assets after an evaluation of our portfolio of businesses such sales or divestitures could affect our costs revenues results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

from time to time we may evaluate our properties and may as a result sell or attempt to sell divest or spinoff different properties or assets subject to the terms of the lease agreements for example in 2020 and 2021 we together with caesars sold harrah’s reno bally’s atlantic city and harrah’s louisiana downs these sales or divestitures could affect our costs revenues results of operations financial condition liquidity and our ability to comply with financial covenants divestitures

have inherent risks including possible delays in closing transactions including potential difficulties in obtaining regulatory approvals the risk of lowerthanexpected sales proceeds for the divested businesses and potential postclosing claims for indemnification in addition current economic conditions at the time and relatively illiquid real estate markets may result in fewer potential bidders and unsuccessful sales efforts 

our properties and the properties securing our loans are subject to risks from climate change natural disasters such as earthquakes hurricanes and other extreme weather conditions and terrorist attacks or other acts of violence the occurrence of which may adversely affect our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

our properties and our borrowers’ properties secured as collateral are located in areas that may be subject to climate change and other natural disasters such as earthquakes and extreme weather conditions including but not limited to hurricanes and flooding such natural disasters or extreme weather conditions may interrupt operations at the casinos damage our properties and reduce the number of customers who visit our facilities in such areas a severe earthquake could damage or destroy our properties in addition our operations could be adversely impacted by a drought or other cause of water shortage a severe drought of extensive duration experienced in las vegas or in the other regions in which we operate could adversely affect the business and financial results at our properties located in such regions although the tenants and borrowers as applicable are required to maintain both property and business interruption insurance coverage such coverage is subject to deductibles and limits on maximum benefits including limitation on the coverage period for business interruption and we cannot make assurances that we or our tenants will be able to fully insure such losses or fully collect if at all on claims resulting from such climate change natural disasters and extreme weather conditions while the lease agreements and loan agreements require and new lease agreements and loan agreements are expected to require that comprehensive insurance and hazard insurance be maintained by the tenants and borrowers as applicable there are certain types of losses generally of a catastrophic nature such as earthquakes hurricanes and floods that may be uninsurable or not economically insurable insurance coverage may not be sufficient to pay the full current market value or current replacement cost of a loss inflation changes in building codes and ordinances environmental considerations and other factors also might make it infeasible to use insurance proceeds to replace the property after such property has been damaged or destroyed under such circumstances the insurance proceeds received might not be adequate to restore the economic position with respect to such property if we experience a loss that is uninsured or that exceeds our policy coverage limits we could lose the capital invested in the damaged properties as well as the anticipated future cash flows from those properties furthermore under such circumstances we may be required under the terms of our debt financing agreements to contribute all or a portion of insurance proceeds to the repayment of such debt which may prevent us from restoring such properties to their prior state if the insurance proceeds after any such required repayment were insufficient to make the repairs necessary to restore the damaged properties to a condition substantially equivalent to its state immediately prior to the casualty we may not have sufficient liquidity to otherwise fund the repairs and may be required to obtain additional financing which could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition liquidity results of operations and prospects 

additionally changes to applicable building and zoning laws ordinances and codes since the initial construction of our properties may limit a tenant’s ability to restore the premises of a property to its previous condition in the event of a substantial casualty loss with respect to the property or the ability to refurbish expand or renovate such property to remain compliant or increase the cost of construction in order to comply with changes in building or zoning codes and regulations if a tenant is unable to restore a property to its prior use after a substantial casualty loss or is required to comply with more stringent building or zoning codes and regulations we may be unable to release the space at a comparable effective rent or sell the property at an acceptable price which may materially and adversely affect our business financial condition liquidity results of operations and prospects 

terrorist attacks or other acts of violence may result in declining economic activity which could harm the demand for services offered by our tenants and the value of our properties or collateral either generally or with respect to a specific region or property and might adversely affect the value of an investment in our common stock such a resulting decrease in demand could make it difficult for us to renew or release our properties to suitable creditworthy tenants at lease rates equal to or above historical rates terrorist activities or violence also could directly affect the value of our properties through damage destruction or loss and the availability of insurance for such acts or of insurance generally might be lower or cost more which could increase our operating expenses and adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows to the extent that any of our tenants or borrowers are affected by future terrorist attacks or violence its business similarly could be adversely affected including the ability of our tenants or borrowers to continue to meet their obligations to us these events might erode business and consumer confidence and spending and might result in increased volatility in national and international financial markets and economies any one of these events might decrease demand for real estate decrease or delay the occupancy of our new or redeveloped properties and limit our access to capital or increase our cost of raising capital

in addition the regional master lease agreement and the las vegas master lease agreement allow the tenant to remove a property from such lease agreement and each of our other lease agreements may be terminated by the applicable tenant if i a casualty event occurs a in the case of the caesars lease agreements during the final two years of the term and b in the case of the hard rock cincinnati lease agreement the century portfolio lease agreement the jack clevelandthistledown lease agreement and the ebci lease agreement the final year of the term and ii the cost to rebuild or restore the applicable property in connection with a casualty event exceeds 25 or in the case of the century portfolio lease agreement and the ebci lease agreement 50 of such property’s total property fair market value similarly if a condemnation event occurs that renders a facility unsuitable for its primary intended use i the applicable tenants may remove the property from the regional master lease agreement and may terminate the las vegas master lease agreement the joliet lease agreement the hard rock cincinnati lease agreement the century portfolio lease agreement or the jack clevelandthistledown lease agreement as the case may be and ii the ebci lease agreement shall terminate as of the date before the date of such condemnation the penn national lease agreements allows the tenants to terminate their respective leases during the final year of the lease term if 50 or more of the square feet of the improvements are destroyed by a casualty event such that the improvements are rendered substantially untenantable if a condemnation event occurs that renders margaritaville or greektown reasonably uneconomical for the operation of the improvements thereon on a commercially practicable basis for their permitted use as rentable facilities capable of producing a fair and reasonable net income therefrom the tenant may terminate the margaritaville lease agreement or the greektown lease agreement respectively if a property is removed from the regional master lease agreement or if the las vegas master lease agreement the joliet lease agreement the penn national lease agreements the hard rock cincinnati lease agreement the century portfolio lease agreement the jack thistledowncleveland lease agreement or the ebci lease agreement as the case may be is terminated we will lose the rent associated with the related facility which would have a negative impact on our financial results in this event following termination of the lease of a property even if we are able to restore the affected property we could be limited to selling or leasing such property to a new tenant in order to obtain an alternate source of revenue which may not happen on comparable terms or at all 

climate change may adversely affect our business 

climate change including rising sea levels extreme weather and changes in precipitation and temperature may result in physical damage to a decrease in demand for andor a decrease in rent from and value of our properties located in the areas affected by these conditions for example we own a number of assets in lowlying areas close to sea level making those assets susceptible to damage or other negative effects resulting from a rise in sea level or acute extreme weather events such as storms or floods we also currently own three properties in las vegas and following the completion of the pending mgp transactions will own ten properties in las vegas which are susceptible to any droughts water shortages or similar conditions that may arise in the region if either of these or other relevant eventualities were to occur we may incur material costs to address these conditions and protect such assets to the extent not covered by our tenants under the terms of our leases or may sustain damage a decrease in value or total loss of such assets 

in addition climate change may result in reduced economic activity in these areas which could harm the operations of our tenants and reduce the demand at our properties which could reduce the rent payable to us under our triplenet leases and make it difficult for us to renew or release our properties on favorable lease terms or at all furthermore our insurance premiums may increase as a result of the threat of climate change or the effects of climate change may not be covered by our insurance policies in addition changes in federal and state legislation and regulations on climate change could result in increased capital expenditures to improve the energy efficiency of our existing properties or other related aspects of our properties in order to comply with such regulations or otherwise adapt to climate change any of the above could have a material and adverse effect on our business financial condition liquidity results of operations and prospects 

certain properties are subject to restrictions pursuant to reciprocal easement agreements operating agreements or similar agreements 

many of the properties that we own or that serve as collateral under our loan agreements are and properties that we may acquire or lend against in the future may be subject to use restrictions andor operational requirements imposed pursuant to ground leases restrictive covenants or conditions reciprocal easement agreements or operating agreements or other instruments that could among other things adversely affect our ability to lease space to third parties enforce our rights as a lender and otherwise realize additional value from these properties such property restrictions could include the following limitations on alterations changes expansions or reconfiguration of properties limitations on use of properties limitations affecting parking requirements or restrictions on exterior or interior signage or facades in certain cases consent of the other party or parties to such agreements may be required when altering reconfiguring expanding or redeveloping failure to secure such consents when necessary may harm our ability to execute leasing strategies which could adversely affect us

the loss of the services of key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business 

our success and ability to grow depends in large part upon the leadership and performance of our executive management team particularly our chief executive officer our president and chief operating officer our chief financial officer and our general counsel any unforeseen loss of our executive officers’ services or any negative market or industry perception with respect to them or arising from their loss could have a material adverse effect on our business we do not have key man or similar life insurance policies covering members of our senior management we have employment agreements with our executive officers but these agreements do not guarantee that any given executive will remain with us and there can be no assurance that any such officers will remain with us in addition the appointment or replacement of certain key members of our executive management team is subject to regulatory approvals based upon suitability determinations by gaming regulatory authorities in the jurisdictions where our properties are located if any of our executive officers is found unsuitable by any such gaming regulatory authorities or if we otherwise lose their services we would have to find alternative candidates and may not be able to successfully manage our business or achieve our business objectives which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition liquidity results of operations and prospects 

environmental compliance costs and liabilities associated with real estate properties owned by us may materially impair the value of those investments 

as an owner of real property we are subject to various federal state and local environmental and health and safety laws and regulations although we do not operate or manage most of our properties as they are subject to triplenet leases we may be held primarily or jointly and severally liable for costs relating to the investigation and cleanup of any property from which there has been a release or threatened release of a regulated material as well as other affected properties regardless of whether we knew of or caused the release and to preserve claims for damages further some environmental laws create a lien on a contaminated site in favor of the government for damages and the costs the government incurs in connection with such contamination 

although under the lease agreements the tenants are required to indemnify us for certain environmental liabilities including environmental liabilities they cause the amount of such liabilities could exceed the financial ability of the applicable tenants or guarantors to indemnify us in addition the presence of contamination or the failure to remediate contamination may adversely affect our ability to sell or lease our properties or to borrow using our properties as collateral 

if our separation from ceoc together with certain related transactions does not qualify as a transaction that is generally taxfree for us federal income tax purposes ceoc could be subject to significant tax liabilities and in certain circumstances we could be required to indemnify ceoc for material taxes pursuant to indemnification obligations under the tax matters agreement 

in connection with our separation from ceoc in 2017 the irs issued a private letter ruling with respect to certain relevant issues including relating to the separation and certain related transactions as taxfree for us federal income tax purposes under certain provisions of the code the irs ruling does not address certain requirements for taxfree treatment of the separation ceoc received from its tax advisors a tax opinion substantially to the effect that with respect to such requirements on which the irs did not rule such requirements should be satisfied the irs ruling and the tax opinion that ceoc received relied on among other things certain representations assumptions and undertakings including those relating to the past and future conduct of our business and the irs ruling and the opinion would not be valid if such representations assumptions and undertakings were incorrect in any material respect 

notwithstanding the irs ruling and the tax opinion the irs could determine the separation should be treated as a taxable transaction for us federal income tax purposes if it determines any of the representations assumptions or undertakings that were included in the request for the irs ruling are false or have been violated or if it disagrees with the conclusions in the opinion that are not covered by the irs ruling 

if the reorganization fails to qualify for taxfree treatment in general ceoc would be subject to tax as if it had sold our assets to us in a taxable sale for their fair market value and ceoc’s creditors who received shares of our common stock pursuant to the plan of reorganization would be subject to tax as if they had received a taxable distribution in respect of their claims equal to the fair market value of such shares 

under the tax matters agreement that we entered into with caesars we generally are required to indemnify caesars against any tax resulting from the separation to the extent that such tax resulted from certain of our representations or undertakings being incorrect or violated our indemnification obligations to caesars are not limited by any maximum amount as a result if we are required to indemnify caesars or such other persons under the circumstances set forth in the tax matters agreement we may be subject to substantial liabilities

risks related to our indebtedness and financing 

we have a substantial amount of indebtedness and expect to incur additional indebtedness in the future including in connection with the consummation of the mgp transactions our substantial indebtedness exposes us to the risk of default under our debt obligations limits our operating flexibility increases the risks associated with a downturn in our business or in the businesses of our tenants and requires us to use a substantial portion of our cash to service our debt obligations 

we have a substantial amount of indebtedness and debt service requirements as of december 31 2021 we had approximately 475 billion in longterm indebtedness consisting of 

• 7500 million of outstanding 2025 notes 

• 125 billion of outstanding 2026 notes 

• 7500 million of outstanding 2027 notes 

• 10 billion of outstanding 2029 notes and 

• 10 billion of outstanding 2030 notes 

in connection with the mgp transactions we have agreed to assume approximately 57 billion of mgp’s outstanding indebtedness upon closing of the transaction including the 15 billion pro rata share of the breit jv’s outstanding indebtedness we also anticipate incurring approximately 44 billion in debt in connection with the redemption of a majority of new vici operating company units held by mgm andor its subsidiaries in connection with the closing of the mgp transactions see “risks related to the company following the mgp transactions – our anticipated level of indebtedness will increase upon completion of the mgp transactions and will increase the related risks we now face” 

as of december 31 2021 we also had 10 billion of available capacity to borrow under our secured revolving credit facility subsequent to year end on february 8 2022 we terminated the secured revolving credit facility and entered into the revolving credit facility in an amount of 25 billion which matures on march 31 2026 and the delayed draw term loan in the amount of 10 billion which matures on march 31 2025 on february 18 2022 we drew on the revolving credit facility in the amount of 6000 million to fund a portion of the purchase price of the venetian acquisition in addition the credit facilities include the option to increase commitments by up to 10 billion in the aggregate for both the revolving credit facility and delayed draw term loan to the extent that any one or more lenders from the syndicate or otherwise agree to provide such additional credit extensions 

payments of principal and interest under this indebtedness or any other instruments governing debt we may incur in the future may leave us with insufficient cash resources to pursue our business and growth strategies or to pay the distributions currently contemplated or necessary to qualify or maintain qualification as a reit our substantial outstanding indebtedness or future indebtedness and the limitations imposed on us by our debt agreements could have other significant adverse consequences including the following 

• our cash flow may be insufficient to meet our required principal and interest payments 

• our vulnerability to adverse economic industry or competitive developments including as a result of covid19 may be increased 

• we may be unable to borrow additional funds as needed or on favorable terms which could among other things adversely affect our ability to capitalize upon emerging acquisition opportunities including exercising our rights of first refusal and call rights described herein or meet operational needs 

• we may be unable to refinance our indebtedness at maturity or the refinancing terms may be less favorable than the terms of our original indebtedness 

• we may be forced to dispose of one or more of our properties if permitted under the lease agreements possibly on disadvantageous terms or at a loss 

• the ability of the operating partnership to distribute cash to us may be limited or prohibited which would materially and adversely affect our ability to make distributions on our common stock 

• we may fail to comply with the payment and restrictive covenants in our loan documents which would entitle the lenders to accelerate payment of outstanding loans and 

• we may be unable to hedge floating rate debt counterparties may fail to honor their obligations under our hedge agreements and these agreements may not effectively hedge interest rate fluctuation risk 

if any one of these events were to occur our financial condition results of operations cash flows the market price of our common stock and our ability to satisfy our debt service obligations pay distributions to our stockholders or refinancing 

table of contents 

existing or future indebtedness could be materially and adversely affected in addition the foreclosure on our properties could create reit taxable income without accompanying cash proceeds which could result in entity level taxes to us or could adversely affect our ability to meet the distribution requirements necessary to qualify or maintain qualification as a reit 

in addition the code generally requires that a reit distribute annually to its stockholders at least 90 of its reit taxable income with certain adjustments determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gains and that it pay tax at regular corporate rates to the extent that it distributes annually less than 100 of its reit taxable income including capital gains vici golf is also subject to us federal income tax at regular corporate rates on any of its taxable income in order to maintain our status as a reit and avoid or otherwise minimize current entitylevel us federal income taxes a substantial portion of our cash flow after operating expenses and debt service will be required to be distributed to our stockholders 

because of the limitations on the amount of cash available to us after satisfying our debt service obligations and our distribution obligations to maintain our status as a reit and avoid or otherwise minimize current entitylevel us federal income taxes our ability to pursue our business and growth strategies may be limited 

adverse changes in our credit rating may affect our borrowing capacity and borrowing terms 

our outstanding debt is periodically rated by nationally recognized credit rating agencies the credit ratings are based upon our operating performance liquidity and leverage ratios overall financial condition and other factors viewed by the credit rating agencies as relevant to both our industry and the economic outlook our credit rating may affect the amount of capital we can access as well as the terms of any financing we obtain because we rely in part on debt financing to fund growth the absence of an investment grade credit rating or any credit rating downgrade or negative outlook may have a negative effect on our future growth by increasing our financing costs or limiting our access to financing sources in the event that we are rated investment grade by one or more nationally recognized credit rating agencies there is no guarantee that we will realize increased access to capital or improved terms with respect to any financing we obtain or that we will be able to maintain such investment grade credit rating 

we will have future capital needs and may not be able to obtain additional financing on favorable terms if at all 

we expect to incur additional indebtedness in the future to refinance our existing indebtedness to finance newly acquired assets or investments in our existing properties through our partner property growth fund or for general corporate or other purposes any significant additional indebtedness could require a substantial portion of our cash flow to make interest and principal payments due on our indebtedness greater demands on our cash resources may reduce funds available to us to pay distributions make capital expenditures and acquisitions or carry out other aspects of our business and growth strategies increased indebtedness can also limit our ability to adjust rapidly to changing market industry or economic conditions limit our ability to access the capital markets to refinance maturing debt or to fund acquisitions or emerging businesses make us more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions including interest rate increases and create competitive disadvantages for us compared to other companies with relatively lower debt levels increased future debt service obligations may limit our operational and financial flexibility further to the extent we were required to incur indebtedness our future interest costs would increase thereby reducing our earnings and cash flows from what they otherwise would have been the impact of any of these potential adverse consequences could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

moreover our ability to obtain additional financing and satisfy our financial obligations under indebtedness outstanding from time to time will depend upon our future operating performance which is subject to then prevailing general economic and credit market conditions including interest rate levels and the availability of credit generally and financial business and other factors many of which are beyond our control the prolonged continuation or worsening of current credit market conditions would have a material adverse effect on our ability to obtain financing on favorable terms if at all 

we may be unable to obtain additional financing or financing on favorable terms or our operating cash flow may be insufficient to satisfy our financial obligations under indebtedness outstanding from time to time if any among other things the absence of an investment grade credit rating or any credit rating downgrade or negative outlook could increase our financing costs and could limit our access to financing sources if financing is not available when needed or is available on unfavorable terms we may be unable to pursue our business and growth strategies or otherwise take advantage of new business opportunities or respond to competitive pressures any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition liquidity results of operations and prospects we may raise additional funds in the future through the issuance of equity securities and as a result our stockholders may experience significant dilution which may adversely affect the market price of our common stock and make it more difficult for our stockholders to sell our shares at a time and price that they deem appropriate and could impair our future ability to raise capital through an offering of our equity securities 

table of contents 

covenants in our debt agreements limit our operational flexibility and a covenant breach or default could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition liquidity results of operations and prospects 

the agreements governing our indebtedness contain customary covenants including restrictions on our ability to grant liens on our assets incur indebtedness sell assets make investments engage in acquisitions mergers or consolidations engage in transactions with affiliates and pay certain dividends and other restricted payments in addition we are required to comply with certain financial maintenance covenants a breach of any of these covenants or covenants under any other agreements governing our indebtedness could result in an event of default crossdefault provisions in our debt agreements could cause an event of default under one debt agreement to trigger an event of default under our other debt agreements upon the occurrence of an event of default under any of our debt agreements our debt holders could elect to declare all outstanding debt under such agreements to be immediately due and payable defaults under our debt instruments could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition liquidity results of operations and prospects 

a rise in interest rates may increase our overall interest rate expense and could adversely affect our stock price 

in 2022 interest rates are expected to rise from historic lows a rise in interest rates may increase our overall interest rate expense and have an adverse impact on our ability to pay distributions to our stockholders this risk can be managed or mitigated by utilizing interest rate protection products including interest rate swaps and forward starting interest rate swaps although we have previously used and currently use such products with respect to a portion of our indebtedness there is no assurance that we will use such products in the future we will utilize any of these products effectively or that such products will be available to us in addition in the event of a rise in interest rates new debt whether fixed or variable is likely to be more expensive which could among other things make the financing of any acquisition or investment more expensive and we may be unable to incur new debt or replace maturing debt with new debt at equal or better interest rates 

further the dividend yield on our common stock ie the annualized distributions per share of our common stock as a percentage of the market price per share of our common stock will influence the market price of such common stock thus an increase in market interest rates may lead prospective purchasers of our common stock to expect a higher dividend yield in addition higher interest rates would likely increase our borrowing costs and potentially decrease our cash available for distribution thus higher market interest rates could also cause the market price of shares of our common stock to decline 

we have engaged and may engage in hedging or other derivative transactions that may limit gains or result in losses 

we use derivatives from time to time to hedge certain of our liabilities and anticipated liabilities although the counterparties of these arrangements are major financial institutions we are exposed to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties this has certain risks including losses on a hedge position which may reduce the return on our investments such losses may exceed the amount invested in such instruments in addition counterparties to a hedging arrangement could default on their obligations we may have to pay certain costs such as transaction fees or breakage costs related to hedging transactions any such reduced gains or losses from these derivatives may adversely affect our business or financial condition 

future incurrences of debt which would be senior to our shares of common stock upon liquidation andor issuance of preferred equity securities which may be senior to our shares of common stock for purposes of distributions or upon liquidation could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

upon the consummation of the mgp transactions we anticipate incurring approximately 44 billion in debt in connection with the redemption of a majority of new vici operating company units held by mgm andor its subsidiaries as a result of which we anticipate that our total pro forma consolidated indebtedness will be after consummation of the mgp transactions approximately 155 billion inclusive of 15 billion of our pro rata share of indebtedness of breit jv we may in the future attempt to increase our capital resources by incurring additional debt including mediumterm notes trust preferred securities and senior or subordinated notes or issuing preferred shares if a liquidation event were to occur holders of our debt securities and preferred shares and lenders with respect to other borrowings will receive distributions of our available assets prior to the holders of our shares of common stock in addition our preferred stock if issued would likely limit our ability to make liquidating or other distributions to the holders of shares of our common stock under certain circumstances any future common stock offerings may dilute the holdings of our existing stockholders or reduce the market price of our common stock or both holders of shares of our common stock are not entitled to preemptive rights or other protections against dilution since our decision to issue debt securities incur other forms of indebtedness or to issue additional common stock or preferred stock in the future will depend on future developments market conditions and other factors beyond our control we cannot predict or estimate the amount timing nature or success of our future offerings thus our stockholders bear the risk of our issuing senior securities incurring other senior obligations or issuing additional common stock in the future which may reduce the market price of shares of our common stock reduce cash available for distribution to common stockholders or dilute their stockholdings in us

risks related to the company following the mgp transactions 

our anticipated level of indebtedness will increase upon completion of the mgp transactions and will increase the related risks we now face 

contemporaneously with the execution of the mgp master transaction agreement we entered into the mgp transactions commitment letter with the mgp transactions bridge lender pursuant to which it has committed to provide the operating partnership with bridge financing for the mgp transactions in the amount of 50 billion after taking into account the termination of 42 billion in committed financing representing the second tranche of the mgp transactions bridge facility in accordance with the terms of the mgp transactions commitment letter in connection with the mgp transactions we will also assume andor refinance approximately 57 billion of outstanding indebtedness of mgp including its pro rata share of 15 billion in indebtedness of breit jv upon the consummation of the mgp transactions we also anticipate incurring approximately 44 billion in debt in connection with the redemption of a majority of new vici operating company units held by mgm andor its subsidiaries and as a result we anticipate that our total pro forma consolidated indebtedness will be after consummation of the mgp transactions approximately 155 billion inclusive of our pro rata share of 15 billion in indebtedness of breit jv and we will be subject to increased risks associated with debt financing including an increased risk that our cash flow could be insufficient to meet required payments on our debt 

our increased indebtedness could have important consequences to holders of our common stock including 

• increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions 

• limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital capital expenditures and other general corporate requirements 

• with respect to floating rate indebtedness risks associated with increases in interest rates 

• requiring the use of a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations for the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness thereby reducing our ability to use our cash flow to fund working capital acquisitions capital expenditures and general corporate requirements 

• limiting our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders 

• limiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and our industry and 

• putting us at a disadvantage compared to our competitors with less indebtedness 

following the mergers we may be unable to realize the anticipated benefits of the mgp transactions or do so within the anticipated timeframe 

in connection with the mgp transactions the mergers involve the cessation of mgp as an independent public company and the integration of mgp’s assets into our existing operations we are expected to benefit from the elimination of duplicative costs associated with general and administrative expenses including those related to supporting a public company platform and the leveraging of technology and systems however we will be required to devote significant management attention and resources to integrating the assets and asset management functions of mgp into vici potential difficulties we may encounter in the integration process include among others the following 

• the inability to successfully integrate the assets and associated management oversight of such assets of mgp in a manner that permits us to realize the anticipated benefits of the mgp transactions in the timeframe currently anticipated or at all 

• the additional complexities of increasing the number of properties owned by us all of which are operated by a new tenant including additional time and attention required by management 

• failure to retain key employees of vici and 

• additional complexities of integrating two companies with different histories regulatory restrictions markets and tenants 

for all these reasons it is possible that the integration process could result in the distraction of our management the disruption of our ongoing business or inconsistencies in our operations services standards controls procedures and policies any of which could adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with tenants partners borrowers and employees or to achieve the anticipated benefits of the mergers could otherwise adversely affect our business and financial results and may cause the market price of our stock to decline 

in addition we have incurred and expect to incur substantial expenses in completing the mgp transactions and integrating the assets business operations and systems of mgp with our own while we have assumed that a certain level of expenses would 

table of contents 

be incurred there are a number of factors beyond our control that could affect the total amount or the timing of the expenses relating to the completion of the mgp transactions and the integration of our and mgp’s operations many of the expenses that will be incurred by their nature are difficult to estimate accurately at the present time as a result the expenses associated with the mgp transactions could particularly in the near term reduce the savings that we expect to achieve from the elimination of duplicative expenses and the realization of economies of scale and cost savings following the completion of the mgp transactions and impact our business and operations and the market price of our common stock 

counterparties to certain significant agreements with mgp may exercise contractual rights under such agreements in connection with the mergers 

mgp is a party to certain agreements that give the applicable counterparty certain rights following a “change in control” such as debt instruments and derivative arrangements in certain of these agreements such rights may be triggered upon the closing of the mergers and may trigger a consent or the right to terminate the agreement it is not a condition to completion of the mergers that the counterparties consent to the mergers or waive their contractual rights certain counterparties may also require modifications to their respective agreements or the execution of new agreements as a condition to granting a waiver or consent under their agreement the pursuit of such rights by the counterparties may result in us suffering a loss of potential future revenue or incurring liabilities and may result in the loss or modification of rights that are material to our business there can be no assurances that such counterparties will not exercise their rights under these agreements including termination rights where available or that the exercise of any such rights under or modification of these agreements will not adversely affect our business or operations 

risks related to an investment in vici following the mgp transactions 

following the mgp transactions we may not continue to pay dividends at or above the rate we currently pay 

following the mgp transactions our stockholders may not receive dividends at the same rate they received dividends as our stockholders prior to the mgp transactions for various reasons including the following 

• we may not have enough cash to pay such dividends due to changes in our cash requirements capital spending plans cash flow or financial position 

• decisions on whether when and in which amounts to make any future distributions will remain at all times entirely at the discretion of our board of directors which reserves the right to change our current dividend practices at any time and for any reason 

• we may desire to retain cash to maintain or improve our credit ratings and 

• the amount of dividends that our subsidiaries may distribute to us may be subject to restrictions imposed by state law and restrictions imposed by the terms of any current or future indebtedness that these subsidiaries may incur 

our stockholders will have no contractual or other legal right to dividends that have not been declared by our board of directors 

the mgm tax protection agreement during its term imposes certain limits on our operations and could require new vici operating company to indemnify mgm for certain tax liabilities 

we have agreed with mgm to enter into the mgm tax protection agreement pursuant to which new vici operating company will agree subject to certain exceptions to indemnify the protected parties as defined in the mgm tax protection agreement for certain tax liabilities resulting from during the protected period as defined in the mgm tax protection agreement 1 the sale transfer exchange or other disposition of protected property as defined in the mgm tax protection agreement 2 a merger consolidation or transfer of all of the assets of or certain other transactions undertaken by new vici operating company pursuant to which the ownership interests of the protected parties in new vici operating company are required to be exchanged in whole or in part for cash or other property 3 the failure of new vici operating company to maintain approximately 85 billion of nonrecourse indebtedness allocable to the protected parties which amount may be reduced over time in accordance with the mgm tax protection agreement and 4 the failure of new vici operating company or us to comply with certain tax covenants that would impact the tax liabilities of the protected parties in the event that we or new vici operating company breach restrictions in the mgm tax protection agreement new vici operating company will be liable for grossedup tax amounts based on an assumed effective tax rate associated with the income or gain recognized as a result of such breach in addition the breit jv previously entered into a tax protection agreement with mgm with respect to builtin gain and debt maintenance related to mgm grand las vegas and mandalay bay which is effective 

table of contents 

through mid2029 and by acquiring mgp we will bear mgp’s approximate 501 proportionate share in the breit jv of any indemnity under this existing tax protection agreement 

therefore although it may be in the best interests of our stockholders for us to sell a protected property enter into certain significant transactions involving new vici operating company reduce nonrecourse indebtedness of new vici operating company allocable to mgm or otherwise not comply with certain tax covenants it may be economically prohibitive for us to do so during the protected period because of these indemnity obligations 

risks related to the mergers 

failure to complete the mergers in a timely manner or at all could adversely affect our business and operations and negatively affect our stock price 

under the mgp master transaction agreement we are subject to certain restrictions on the conduct of our business prior to completing the mergers these restrictions the waiver of which are subject to the written consent of the other party and subject to certain exceptions and qualifications may prevent us from pursuing certain strategic transactions acquiring and disposing of assets undertaking certain capital expenditure projects undertaking certain financing transactions and otherwise pursuing other actions that are not in the ordinary course of business even if such actions could prove beneficial additionally the pendency of the mergers may cause distractions from our strategies and daytoday operations for employees and management 

delays in completing the mergers or the failure to complete the mergers at all could adversely affect our business and operations and in that event the market price of shares of our common stock may decline significantly particularly to the extent that the current market price reflects a market assumption that the mergers will be completed if the mergers are not completed for any reason we will not achieve the expected benefits thereof in addition we will be required to pay certain costs relating to the mergers whether or not the mergers are completed 

the exchange ratio is fixed and will not be adjusted in the event of any change in the stock price of either us or mgp 

at the effective time of the reit merger each outstanding mgp common share other than shares held by mgp or any whollyowned subsidiary of mgp will be converted into the right to receive the reit merger consideration consisting of 1366 shares of our common stock plus the right if any to receive cash in lieu of fractional shares of our common stock into which such mgp common shares would have been converted pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the mgp master transaction agreement 

the exchange ratio of 1366 shares of our common stock per mgp common share was fixed in the mgp master transaction agreement and except for certain adjustments on account of changes in the capitalization of us or mgp or the payment of certain dividends by us or mgp that are necessary to maintain our or mgp’s respective status as a reit will not be adjusted for changes in the market prices of our common stock or mgp common shares changes in the market price of shares of our common stock prior to the mergers will affect the market value of the reit merger consideration that mgp shareholders will be entitled to receive on the closing date of the mergers stock price changes may result from a variety of factors many of which are beyond the control of us and mgp including the following 

• changes in the respective businesses operations assets liabilities and prospects of us and mgp 

• changes in market assessments of the business operations financial position and prospects of us or mgp 

• market assessments of the likelihood that the mergers will be completed 

• interest rates general market and economic conditions and other factors generally affecting the market prices of our common stock and mgp common shares 

• federal state and local legislation governmental regulation and legal developments in the business in which we and mgp operate and 

• other factors including those described or referred to elsewhere under this item 1a “risk factors” 

the market price of our common stock at the closing of the mergers may vary from its price on the date the mgp master transaction agreement was executed and on the date of the special meeting of our stockholders in connection with the mergers which was held on october 29 2021 and may be greater than less than or the same as the price per share of our common stock at each of the aforementioned times as a result the market value of the reit merger consideration represented by the exchange ratio will also vary 

table of contents 

because the exchange ratio is fixed 

• if the price of our common stock increases between the date the mgp master transaction agreement was executed and the closing of the mergers mgp shareholders will receive shares of our common stock that have a market value upon completion of the mergers that is greater than the market value of such shares calculated pursuant to the exchange ratio on the date the mgp master transaction agreement was executed and 

• if the price of our common stock declines between the date the mgp master transaction agreement was executed and the closing of the mergers mgp shareholders will receive shares of our common stock that have a market value upon the completion of the mergers that is less than the market value of such shares calculated pursuant to the exchange ratio on the date the mgp master transaction agreement was executed 

therefore while the number of shares of our common stock to be issued per mgp common share is fixed vici stockholders cannot be sure of the market value of the reit merger consideration that mgp shareholders will receive upon the closing of the reit merger the market price of our common stock is subject to general price fluctuations in the market for publicly traded equity securities and has experienced volatility in the past 

there may be unexpected delays in the completion of the mergers or the mergers may not be completed at all 

the mergers are currently expected to close in the first half of 2022 assuming that all of the conditions in the mgp master transaction agreement are either satisfied or waived the mgp master transaction agreement provides that either we or mgp may terminate the mgp master transaction agreement subject to certain conditions set forth in the mgp master transaction agreement if the mergers have not occurred on or before the fifteen month anniversary of the date of the mgp master transaction agreement which is november 4 2022 the “outside date” certain events may delay the completion of the mergers or result in a termination of the mgp master transaction agreement some of these events are outside the control of vici and mgp 

we may incur significant additional costs in connection with any delay in completing the mergers or the termination of the mgp master transaction agreement in addition to significant transaction costs including legal financial advisory accounting and other costs we have already incurred in addition if the mergers are terminated under certain circumstances specified in the mgp master transaction agreement we will be required to pay to mgp a termination fee of up to 7090 million we cannot make assurances that the conditions to the completion of the mgp master transaction agreement will be satisfied or waived or that any adverse change effect event circumstance occurrence or state of facts that could give rise to the termination of the mgp master transaction agreement will not occur 

our stockholders will have a substantially smaller ownership and voting interest in vici upon completion of the mergers compared to their ownership and voting interest in vici prior to the mergers 

upon completion of the mergers based on the number of mgp common shares and shares of our common stock outstanding on december 31 2021 we estimate that after giving effect to the settlement of the march 2021 forward sale agreements and the september 2021 forward sale agreements each as defined in note 11  stockholders equity  on february 18 2022 continuing stockholders will own approximately 78 of the issued and outstanding shares of our common stock and former mgp shareholders will own approximately 22 of the issued and outstanding shares of our common stock accordingly our current stockholders will exercise significantly less influence over us after the mergers relative to their influence over us prior to the mergers and thus will have a less significant impact on the approval or rejection of our future proposals submitted to a stockholder vote 

there can be no assurance that we will be able to secure the financing in connection with the redemption on acceptable terms in a timely manner or at all and therefore may be compelled to consummate the mgp transactions without obtaining financing on attractive terms 

we are required to finance the cash required in connection with the redemption with longterm debt financing or proceeds from the mgp transactions bridge facility in accordance with the terms of the mgp transactions commitment letter the mgp transactions commitment letter provides for funding to the operating partnership of up to 50080 million which can be used to fund the redemption and pay transaction costs following the termination of 42420 million in committed financing representing the second tranche of the mgp transactions bridge facility in accordance with the terms of the mgp transactions commitment letter additionally we may continue to evaluate alternative financing structures and amounts based on our needs and capital markets conditions the availability of the borrowings under the mgp transactions bridge facility is subject to the satisfaction of certain customary conditions including the substantially concurrent consummation of the mergers 

table of contents 

the consummation of the mgp transactions is not conditioned on our ability to obtain financing or on the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the mgp transactions commitment letter if we are unable to obtain funding contemplated by the mgp transactions commitment letter from our financing sources for the cash required in connection with the redemption we may be compelled to specifically perform our obligations to consummate the mgp transactions with financing that is not on attractive terms or could otherwise be subject to claims under the mgp master transaction agreement each of which could have a material adverse effect on us 

the mgp master transaction agreement contains provisions that could discourage a potential acquirer of the company from making a favorable proposal could result in any such proposal being at a lower price than it might otherwise be and in specified circumstances could require us to make a substantial termination payment to mgp 

pursuant to the mgp master transaction agreement we and mgp have subject to certain exceptions agreed not to i solicit proposals relating to certain alternative transactions ii enter into discussions or negotiations or provide nonpublic information concerning proposals relating to an alternative business combination transaction iii approve or recommend any agreements providing for any such alternative business combination transaction iv enter into any letter of intent agreement in principle merger agreement or other similar definitive agreements related to an alternative business combination transaction v grant any waiver amendment or release of any standstill under any standstill or confidentiality agreement or any takeover statute or vi agree to do any of the foregoing the mgp master transaction agreement also provides that in connection with the termination of the mgp master transaction agreement by us under certain specified circumstances we will be required to pay to mgp a termination fee of up to 7090 million these provisions could discourage a potential acquirer that might have an interest in acquiring all or a significant part of the company from considering or proposing such an acquisition or might result in a potential acquirer proposing to pay a lower per share value than it might otherwise have proposed to pay because of the added expense of the termination fee that may become payable in certain circumstances under the mgp master transaction agreement 

if the mergers are not consummated by the outside date either we or mgp may terminate the mgp master transaction agreement 

either we or mgp may terminate the mgp master transaction agreement if the mergers have not been consummated by the outside date which is november 4 2022 however this termination right will not be available to a party if that party’s failure to comply with any provision of the mgp master transaction agreement has been the principal cause of or resulted in the failure of the mergers to occur by the outside date in the event the mgp master transaction agreement is terminated by either party due to the failure of the mergers to close by the outside date we will have incurred significant costs and will have diverted significant management focus and resources from other strategic opportunities without realizing the anticipated benefits of the mergers 

an adverse judgment in any litigation challenging the mergers may prevent the mergers from becoming effective or from becoming effective within the expected timeframe 

securities class action lawsuits and derivative lawsuits are often brought against companies that have entered into merger agreements or other agreements similar to the mgp master transaction agreement as of the date of this annual report on form 10k three lawsuits were filed by purported mgp shareholders and six lawsuits were filed by purported vici stockholders challenging the disclosures made as applicable in the registration statement on form s4 filed on september 8 2021 and the prospectus filed on september 23 2021 each in connection with the mergers additional lawsuits arising out of the mergers may be filed in the future for a more detailed description of this litigation see “ item 3 – legal proceedings ” and “litigation” in note 10  commitments and contingent liabilities to our financial statements included in this annual report 

although these nine lawsuits have each been dismissed the parties have not resolved plaintiffs’ requests for attorneys’ fees and thus we cannot make assurances as to the ultimate outcome of these lawsuits or any other lawsuits that may be filed including the amount of costs associated with defending these claims or any other liabilities that may be incurred in connection with the litigation of these claims if any of the plaintiffs in future lawsuits are successful in obtaining an injunction prohibiting the parties from completing the mgp transactions on the agreedupon terms such an injunction may delay the consummation of the mgp transactions in the expected timeframe or could indefinitely enjoin the mgp transactions from being consummated altogether whether or not any plaintiff’s claim is successful this type of litigation may result in significant costs and divert management’s attention and resources which could adversely affect the operation of our business 

if the reit merger does not qualify as a reorganization there may be adverse tax consequences 

the parties intend that the reit merger will be treated as a reorganization within the meaning of section 368a of the code and it is a condition to the consummation of the mergers that we and mgp receive opinions from hogan lovells us llp and 

table of contents 

weil gotshal  manges llp respectively to the effect that for us federal income tax purposes the reit merger will constitute a reorganization within the meaning of section 368a of the code these tax opinions represent the legal judgment of counsel rendering the opinion and are not binding on the internal revenue service the “irs” or the courts if the reit merger were to fail to qualify as a reorganization us holders of mgp common shares generally would recognize gain or loss as applicable equal to the difference between i the sum of the fair market value of our common stock and the cash in lieu of fraction shares if any received by such holder in the reit merger and ii such holder’s adjusted tax basis in its mgp common shares 

risks related to our status as a reit 

we may incur adverse tax consequences if we have failed or fail or after consummation of the mgp transactions mgp has failed to qualify as a reit for us federal income tax purposes 

the code generally requires that a reit distribute annually to its stockholders at least 90 of its reit taxable income with certain adjustments determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gains and that it pay tax at regular corporate rates to the extent that it distributes annually less than 100 of its reit taxable income including capital gains in addition a reit is required to pay a 4 nondeductible excise tax on the amount if any by which the distributions it makes in a calendar year are less than the sum of 85 of its ordinary income 95 of its capital gain net income and 100 of its undistributed income from prior years as a result in order to avoid or otherwise minimize current entity level us federal income taxes a substantial portion of our cash flow after operating expenses and debt service will be required to be distributed to our stockholders 

we have operated in a manner that we believe has allowed us to qualify as a reit for us federal income tax purposes under the code and intend to continue to do so through the time of the reit merger furthermore we intend to operate in a manner that we believe allows us to qualify as a reit after the reit merger neither we nor mgp have requested or plan to request a ruling from the irs that we or mgp qualify as a reit qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex code provisions for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations the complexity of these provisions and of the applicable treasury regulations that have been promulgated under the code is greater in the case of a reit that holds its assets through a partnership such as we will after the mergers the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within the control of us or mgp may affect its ability to qualify as a reit in order to qualify as a reit each of us and mgp must satisfy a number of requirements including requirements regarding the ownership of its stock and the composition of its gross income and assets also a reit must make distributions to stockholders aggregating annually at least 90 of its net taxable income excluding any net capital gains 

if we lose our reit status or are determined to have lost our reit status in a prior year such loss or failure would have a material and adverse effect on us additionally we will face material tax consequences that would substantially reduce our cash available for distribution including cash available to pay dividends to our stockholders because 

• we would be subject to us federal income tax and state and local income taxes on our net income at regular corporate rates for the years we did not qualify for taxation as a reit and for such years would not be allowed a deduction for dividends paid to stockholders in computing our taxable income 

• unless we are entitled to relief under applicable statutory provisions neither we nor any “successor” corporation trust or association could elect to be taxed as a reit until the fifth taxable year following the year during which we were disqualified 

• if we were to reelect reit status we would have to distribute all earnings and profits from nonreit years before the end of the first new reit taxable year and 

• for the five years following reelection of reit status upon a taxable disposition of an asset owned as of such reelection we would be subject to corporatelevel tax with respect to any builtin gain inherent in such asset at the time of reelection 

even if we retain our reit status if mgp loses its reit status for a taxable year ending on or before the effective time of the reit merger we would be subject to adverse tax consequences that would substantially reduce our cash available for distribution including cash available to pay dividends to our stockholders because 

• unless we are entitled to relief under applicable statutory provisions vici as the “successor” by merger to mgp for us federal income tax purposes could not elect to be taxed as a reit until the fifth taxable year following the year during which mgp was disqualified 

• vici as the successor by merger to mgp would be subject to any corporate income tax liabilities of mgp including penalties and interest 

table of contents 

• assuming that we otherwise maintained our reit qualification we would be subject to corporatelevel tax on the builtin gain in each asset of mgp existing at the time of the reit merger if we were to dispose of such mgp asset during the fiveyear period following the reit merger and 

• assuming that we otherwise maintained our reit qualification we would succeed to any earnings and profits accumulated by mgp for taxable periods that it did not qualify as a reit and we would have to pay a special dividend andor employ applicable deficiency dividend procedures including interest payments to the irs to eliminate such earnings and profits or if we do not timely distribute those earnings and profits we could fail to qualify as a reit 

in addition if there is an adjustment to mgp’s taxable income or dividends paid deductions we could elect to use the deficiency dividend procedure in order to maintain mgp’s reit status that deficiency dividend procedure could require us to make significant distributions to our stockholders and to pay significant interest to the irs 

as a result of these factors our failure before or after the reit merger or mgp’s failure before the reit merger to qualify as a reit could impair our ability after the reit merger to expand our business and raise capital and would materially adversely affect the market value of our common stock 

qualification to be taxed as a reit involves highly technical and complex provisions of the code and violations of these provisions could jeopardize our reit qualification 

qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex code provisions for which only limited judicial and administrative authorities exist even a technical or inadvertent violation could jeopardize our reit qualification our qualification as a reit depends on our satisfaction of certain asset income organizational distribution stockholder ownership and other requirements on a continuing basis in addition our ability to satisfy the requirements to qualify as a reit may depend in part on the actions of third parties over which we have no control or only limited influence including in cases where we own an equity interest in an entity that is classified as a partnership for us federal income tax purposes 

we may in the future choose to pay dividends in the form of our own common stock in which case stockholders may be required to pay income taxes in excess of the cash dividends they receive 

we may seek in the future to distribute taxable dividends that are payable in cash or our common stock taxable stockholders receiving such dividends will be required to include the full amount of the dividend as ordinary income to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits for us federal income tax purposes as to which noncorporate stockholders will generally be eligible for a deduction equal to 20 of such distributions as a result stockholders receiving dividends in the form of common stock may be required to pay income taxes with respect to such dividends in excess of the cash dividends received if any if a us stockholder sells the common stock that it receives as a dividend in order to pay this tax the sales proceeds may be less than the amount included in income with respect to the dividend depending on the market price of our common stock at the time of the sale in addition in such case a us stockholder could have a capital loss with respect to the common stock sold that could not be used to offset such dividend income moreover with respect to certain nonus stockholders we may be required to withhold us federal income tax with respect to such dividends including in respect of all or a portion of such dividend that is payable in common stock furthermore such a taxable share dividend could be viewed as equivalent to a reduction in our cash distributions and that factor as well as the possibility that a significant number of our stockholders determine to sell our common stock in order to pay taxes owed on dividends may put downward pressure on the market price of our common stock 

changes to the us federal income tax laws including the enactment of certain tax reform measures could have a material and adverse effect on us 

us federal income tax laws governing reits and other corporations and the administrative interpretations of those laws may be amended at any time potentially with retroactive effect changes to the us federal income tax laws including the possibility of major tax legislation could have a material and adverse effect on us or our stockholders we cannot predict whether when to what extent or with what effective dates new us federal tax laws regulations interpretations or rulings will be issued prospective investors are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding the effect of potential changes to the us federal tax laws on an investment in our common stock 

we could fail to qualify to be taxed as a reit if income we receive from our tenants is not treated as qualifying income 

under applicable provisions of the code we will not be treated as a reit unless we satisfy various requirements including requirements relating to the sources of our gross income the complexity of these provisions of the code and of the applicable treasury regulations that have been promulgated under the code is greater in the case of a reit that holds its assets through a 

table of contents 

partnership such as we will after the mergers rents received or accrued by us from our tenants will not be treated as qualifying rent for purposes of these requirements if the leases are not respected as true leases for us federal income tax purposes and instead are treated as service contracts joint ventures financings or some other type of arrangement if some or all of our leases are not respected as true leases for us federal income tax purposes we may fail to qualify to be taxed as a reit furthermore our qualification as a reit will depend on our satisfaction of certain asset income organizational distribution stockholder ownership and other requirements on a continuing basis our ability to satisfy the asset tests depends upon our analysis of the characterization and fair market values of our assets some of which are not susceptible to a precise determination and for which we may not obtain independent appraisals 

in addition subject to certain exceptions rents received or accrued by us from any tenant or affiliated tenants will not be treated as qualifying rent for purposes of these requirements if we or an actual or constructive owner of 10 or more of our stock actually or constructively owns 10 or more of the total combined voting power of all classes of such tenant’s stock entitled to vote or 10 or more of the total value of all classes of such tenant’s stock our charter provides restrictions on ownership and transfer of our shares of stock including restrictions on such ownership or transfer that would cause the rents received or accrued by us from tenants to be treated as nonqualifying rent for purposes of the reit gross income requirements nevertheless there can be no assurance that such restrictions will be effective in ensuring that rents received or accrued by us from tenants will not be treated as qualifying rent for purposes of reit qualification requirements 

reit distribution requirements could adversely affect our ability to execute our business plan 

we generally must distribute annually to our stockholders at least 90 of our reit taxable income with certain adjustments determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding any net capital gains in order for us to qualify as a reit so that us federal corporate income tax does not apply to our earnings that we distribute to the extent that we satisfy this distribution requirement and qualify for taxation as a reit but distribute less than 100 of our reit taxable income determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and including any net capital gains we will be subject to us federal corporate income tax on any undistributed portion of such taxable income in addition we will be subject to a 4 nondeductible excise tax if the actual amount that we distribute to our stockholders in a calendar year is less than a minimum amount specified under us federal tax laws we intend to make distributions to our stockholders to comply with the reit requirements of the code and to avoid or otherwise minimize paying entity level federal or excise tax other than at any taxable reit subsidiary of ours we may generate taxable income greater than our income for financial reporting purposes prepared in accordance with gaap further we may generate taxable income greater than our cash flow from operations after operating expenses and debt service as a result of differences in timing between the recognition of taxable income and the actual receipt of cash or the effect of nondeductible capital expenditures the creation of reserves or required debt or amortization payments in order to avoid or otherwise minimize current entity level us federal income taxes we will generally be required to distribute sufficient cash flow after operating expenses and debt service payments to satisfy the reit distribution requirements while we intend to make distributions to our stockholders to comply with the reit requirements of the code we may not have sufficient liquidity to meet the reit distribution requirements if our cash flow is insufficient to satisfy the reit distribution requirements we could be required to raise capital on unfavorable terms sell assets at disadvantageous prices distribute amounts that would otherwise be invested in future acquisitions or issue dividends in the form of shares of our common stock to make distributions sufficient to enable us to pay out enough of our reit taxable income to satisfy the reit distribution requirement and to avoid or otherwise minimize corporate income tax and the 4 excise tax in a particular year these alternatives could increase our costs or change the value of our equity thus compliance with the reit requirements may hinder our ability to grow which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

even if we qualify as a reit we may face other tax liabilities that reduce our cash flow 

even if we qualify for taxation as a reit we may be subject to certain us federal state and local taxes on our income and assets including taxes on any undistributed income and state or local income property and transfer taxes for example in order to meet the reit qualification requirements we currently hold and expect in the future to hold some of our assets and conduct certain of our activities through one or more taxable reit subsidiaries or other subsidiary corporations that will be subject to federal state and local corporatelevel income taxes as regular c corporations ie corporations generally subject to corporatelevel income tax under subchapter c of chapter 1 the code in addition we may incur a 100 excise tax on transactions with a taxable reit subsidiary if they are not conducted on an arm’s length basis any of these taxes would decrease cash available for distribution to our stockholders 

complying with reit requirements may cause us to liquidate or forgo otherwise attractive opportunities and limit our expansion opportunities 

to qualify as a reit for us federal income tax purposes we must continually satisfy tests concerning among other things our sources of income the nature of our investments in real estate and related assets the amounts we distribute to our 

table of contents 

stockholders and the ownership of our stock we may also be required to make distributions to stockholders at disadvantageous times or when we do not have funds readily available for distribution 

as a reit we must ensure that at the end of each calendar quarter at least 75 of the value of our assets consists of cash cash items government securities and “real estate assets” as defined in the code including certain mortgage loans and securities the remainder of our investments other than government securities qualified real estate assets and securities issued by a taxable reit subsidiary generally cannot include more than 10 of the outstanding voting securities of any one issuer or more than 10 of the total value of the outstanding securities of any one issuer in addition in general no more than 5 of the value of our total assets other than government securities qualified real estate assets and securities issued by a taxable reit subsidiary can consist of the securities of any one issuer and no more than 20 of the value of our total assets can be represented by securities of one or more taxable reit subsidiaries in addition not more than 25 of our total assets may be represented by debt instruments issued by publicly offered reits that are “nonqualified” debt instruments if we fail to comply with these requirements at the end of any calendar quarter we must correct the failure within 30 days after the end of the calendar quarter or qualify for certain statutory relief provisions to avoid losing our reit qualification and suffering adverse tax consequences as a result we may be required to liquidate from our portfolio or contribute to a taxable reit subsidiary or forgo otherwise attractive investments in order to maintain our qualification as a reit these actions could have the effect of reducing our income and amounts available for distribution to our stockholders in addition to the asset tests set forth above to qualify as a reit we must continually satisfy tests concerning among other things the sources of our income the amounts we distribute to our stockholders and the ownership of our stock we may be unable to pursue investments that would be otherwise advantageous to us in order to satisfy the sourceofincome or assetdiversification requirements for qualifying as a reit thus compliance with the reit requirements may hinder our ability to make certain attractive investments 

we may be subject to builtin gains tax on the disposition of certain of our properties 

if we acquire certain properties in taxdeferred transactions which properties were held by one or more c corporations before they were held by us we may be subject to a builtin gain tax on future disposition of such properties this is the case with respect to all or substantially all of the properties acquired from ceoc pursuant to the formation transactions as well as certain other properties we have acquired and may acquire in the future if we dispose of any such properties during the fiveyear period following acquisition of the properties from the respective c corporation ie during the fiveyear period following ownership of such properties by a reit we will be subject to us federal income tax and applicable state and local taxes at the highest corporate tax rates on any gain recognized from the disposition of such properties to the extent of the excess of the fair market value of the properties on the date that they were contributed to or acquired by us in a taxdeferred transaction over the adjusted tax basis of such properties on such date which are referred to as builtin gains similarly if we recognize certain other income considered to be builtin income during the fiveyear period following the property acquisitions described above we could be subject to us federal tax under the builtingains tax rules we would be subject to this corporatelevel tax liability without the benefit of the deduction for dividends paid even if we qualify and maintain our status as a reit any recognized builtin gain will retain its character as ordinary income or capital gain and will be taken into account in determining reit taxable income and the reit distribution requirements any tax on the recognized builtin gain will reduce reit taxable income we may choose to forego otherwise attractive opportunities to sell assets in a taxable transaction during the fiveyear builtingain recognition period in order to avoid this builtingain tax however there can be no assurance that such a taxable transaction will not occur the amount of any such builtingain tax could be material and the resulting tax liability could have a negative effect on our cash flow and limit our ability to pay distributions required to qualify and maintain our status as a reit 

complying with reit requirements may limit our ability to hedge effectively and may cause us to incur tax liabilities 

the reit provisions of the code substantially limit our ability to hedge our assets and liabilities income from certain hedging transactions that we may enter into to manage risk of interest rate changes with respect to borrowings made or to be made to acquire or carry real estate assets or from transactions to manage risk of currency fluctuations with respect to any item of income or gain that satisfy the reit gross income tests including gain from the termination of such a transaction does not constitute “gross income” for purposes of the 75 or 95 gross income tests that apply to reits provided that certain identification requirements are met to the extent that we enter into other types of hedging transactions or fail to properly identify such transaction as a hedge the income is likely to be treated as nonqualifying income for purposes of both of the gross income tests as a result of these rules we may be required to limit our use of advantageous hedging techniques or implement those hedges through a taxable reit subsidiary this could increase the cost of our hedging activities because the taxable reit subsidiary may be subject to tax on gains or expose us to greater risks associated with changes in interest rates that we would otherwise want to bear in addition losses in the taxable reit subsidiary will generally not provide any tax benefit except that such losses could theoretically be carried back or forward against past or future taxable income of the taxable reit subsidiary

if we are required to make a purging distribution we may pay such purging distribution in a combination of common stock and cash 

in order to qualify as a reit we must distribute any “earnings and profits” as defined in the code accumulated by us during any period for which we did not qualify as a reit or by any entity whose accumulated earnings and profits we acquire during any period for which such entity did not qualify as a reit such distribution requirement applied to any earnings and profits that were allocated from ceoc to us in connection with the formation transactions by the end of the first taxable year in which we elected reit status based on our analysis we do not believe that any earnings and profits were allocated to us in connection with the formation transactions or any other transaction to which we are party and therefore did not make a purging distribution and do not currently intend to make any purging distribution with respect to transactions to which we are a party if we are required to make a purging distribution in the future we may pay the purging distribution to our stockholders in a combination of cash and shares of our common stock each of our stockholders will be permitted to elect to receive the stockholder’s entire entitlement under the purging distribution in either cash or shares of our common stock subject to a cash limitation if our stockholders elect to receive a portion of cash in excess of the cash limitation each such electing stockholder will receive a pro rata portion of cash corresponding to the stockholder’s respective entitlement under the purging distribution declaration the irs has issued a revenue procedure that provides that so long as a reit complied with certain provisions therein certain distributions that are paid partly in cash and partly in stock will be treated as taxable dividends that would satisfy the reit distribution requirements and qualify for the dividends paid deduction for us federal income tax purposes in a purging distribution if any a stockholder of our common stock will be required to report dividend income equal to the amount of cash and common stock received as a result of the purging distribution even though we may distribute no cash or only nominal amounts of cash to such stockholder 

the cash available for distribution to stockholders may not be sufficient to pay dividends at expected levels nor can we make assurances of our ability to make distributions in the future we may use borrowed funds to make distributions 

if cash available for distribution is less than the amount necessary to make cash distributions our inability to make the expected distributions could result in a decrease in the market price of our common stock all distributions will be made at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon various factors including but not limited to our historical and projected financial condition cash flows results of operations and reit taxable income limitations contained in financing instruments debt service requirements operating cash inflows and outflows including capital expenditures and acquisitions limitations on our ability to use cash generated in one or more taxable reit subsidiaries if any to fund distributions and applicable law we may not be able to make distributions in the future in addition some of our distributions may include a return of capital to the extent that we decide to make distributions in excess of our current and accumulated earnings and profits in the future such distributions would generally be considered a return of capital for federal income tax purposes to the extent of the holder’s adjusted tax basis in their shares a return of capital is not taxable but it has the effect of reducing the holder’s adjusted tax basis in our common stock to the extent that such distributions exceed the adjusted tax basis of a holder’s shares they will be treated as gain from the sale or exchange of such stock if we borrow to fund distributions our future interest costs would increase thereby reducing our earnings and cash available for distribution from what they otherwise would have been 

for purposes of satisfying the minimum distribution requirement to qualify for and maintain reit status our reit taxable income will be calculated without reference to our cash flow consequently under certain circumstances we may not have available cash to make our required distributions and we may need to raise additional equity or debt in order to fund our intended distributions or we may distribute a portion of our distributions in the form of our common stock or debt instruments which could result in dilution or higher leverage while the irs has issued a revenue procedure indicating that certain distributions that are made partly in cash and partly in stock will be treated as taxable dividends that would satisfy that reit annual distribution requirement and qualify for the dividends paid deduction for us federal income tax purposes no assurance can be provided that we will be able to satisfy the requirements of the revenue procedure therefore it is unclear whether and to what extent we will be able to make taxable dividends payable inkind in addition to the extent we were to make distributions that include our common stock or debt instruments a stockholder of ours will be required to report dividend income as a result of such distributions even though we distributed no cash or only nominal amounts of cash to such stockholder 

the us federal income tax treatment of the cash that we might receive from cash settlement of a forward sale agreement is unclear and could jeopardize our ability to meet the reit qualification requirements 

we enter into forward sale agreements from time to time and subject to certain conditions we have the right to elect physical cash or net share settlement under these agreements at any time and from time to time in part or in full in the event that we elect to settle a forward sale agreement for cash and the settlement price is below the forward sale price we would be entitled to receive a cash payment from the applicable forward purchasers under section 1032 of the code generally no gains and losses are recognized by a corporation in dealing in its own shares including pursuant to a “securities futures contract” as defined in the code by reference to the exchange act although we believe that any amount received by us in exchange for our 

table of contents 

shares of common stock would qualify for the exemption under section 1032 of the code because it is not entirely clear whether a forward sale agreement qualifies as “securities futures contracts” the us federal income tax treatment of any cash settlement payment we receive is uncertain in the event that we recognize a significant gain from the cash settlement of a forward sale agreement we might not be able to satisfy the gross income requirements applicable to reits under the code if we were to fail to satisfy one or both of the gross income tests for any taxable year we may nevertheless qualify as a reit for such year if we were entitled to relief under certain provisions of the code if these relief provisions were inapplicable we would not qualify to be taxed as a reit 

risks related to our organizational structure 

vici is a holding company with no direct operations and relies on distributions received from the operating partnership to make distributions to its stockholders 

vici is a holding company and conducts its operations through subsidiaries including the operating partnership and vici golf vici does not have apart from the units that it owns in the operating partnership and vici golf any independent operations as a result vici relies on distributions from its operating partnership to make any distributions to its stockholders it might declare on its common stock and to meet any of its obligations including any tax liability on taxable income allocated to it from the operating partnership which might not be able to make distributions to vici equal to the tax on such allocated taxable income in turn the ability of subsidiaries of the operating partnership to make distributions to the operating partnership and therefore the ability of the operating partnership to make distributions to vici depends on the operating results of these subsidiaries and the operating partnership and on the terms of any financing arrangements they have entered into in addition because vici is a holding company claims of common stockholders of vici are structurally subordinated to all existing and future liabilities and other obligations whether or not for borrowed money and any preferred equity of the operating partnership and its subsidiaries therefore in the event of our bankruptcy liquidation or reorganization vici’s assets and those of the operating partnership and its subsidiaries will be available to satisfy the claims of vici common stockholders only after all of vici’s the operating partnership’s and its subsidiaries’ liabilities and other obligations and any preferred equity of any of them have been paid in full 

the operating partnership may in connection with its acquisition of additional properties or otherwise issue additional common units or preferred units to third parties such issuances would reduce vici’s ownership in the operating partnership because stockholders of vici do not directly own common units or preferred units of the operating partnership they do not have any voting rights with respect to any such issuances or other partnership level activities of the operating partnership 

our rights and the rights of our stockholders to take action against our directors and officers are limited 

the maryland general corporation law the “mgcl” provides that a director has no liability in any action based on an act of the director if he or she has acted in good faith in a manner he or she reasonably believes to be in the corporation’s best interests and with the care that an ordinarily prudent person in a like position would use under similar circumstances as permitted by the mgcl our charter limits the liability of our directors and officers to our company and our stockholders for money damages to the maximum extent permitted by maryland law under maryland law our present directors and officers will not have any liability to us or our stockholders for money damages other than liability resulting from 

• actual receipt of an improper benefit or profit in money property or services or 

• a final judgment based upon a finding that his or her action or failure to act was the result of active and deliberate dishonesty by the director or officer and was material to the cause of action adjudicated 

our charter provides that we have the power to obligate ourselves and our amended and restated bylaws obligate us to indemnify our directors and officers for actions taken by them in those capacities and to pay or reimburse their reasonable expenses in advance of final disposition of a proceeding to the maximum extent permitted by maryland law in addition we have entered into indemnification agreements with our directors and executive officers that provide for indemnification and advancement of expenses to the maximum extent permitted by maryland law as a result we and our stockholders may have more limited rights against our directors and officers than might otherwise exist under common law 

our charter and bylaws contain provisions that may delay defer or prevent an acquisition of our common stock or a change in control 

our charter and bylaws contain provisions the exercise or existence of which could delay defer or prevent a transaction or a change in control that might involve a premium price for our stockholders or otherwise be in their best interests including the following 

• our charter contains restrictions on the ownership and transfer of our stock 

table of contents 

in order for us to qualify as a reit no more than 50 of the value of outstanding shares of our stock may be owned beneficially or constructively by five or fewer individuals or certain other persons at any time during the last half of each taxable year “closely held” subject to certain exceptions our charter prohibits any stockholder from owning beneficially or constructively with respect to any class or series of our capital stock more than 98 in value or by number of shares whichever is more restrictive of the aggregate of the outstanding shares of such class or series of our capital stock 

the constructive ownership rules under the code are complex and may cause the outstanding stock owned by a group of related individuals or entities to be deemed to be constructively owned by one individual or entity as a result the acquisition of 98 or less of the outstanding shares of a class or series of our stock by an individual or entity could cause that individual or entity or another individual or entity to own constructively in excess of the relevant ownership limits 

among other restrictions on ownership and transfer of shares our charter also prohibits any person from owning shares of our stock that would result in our being “closely held” under section 856h of the code or otherwise cause us to fail to qualify as a reit any attempt to own or transfer shares of our common stock or of any of our other capital stock in violation of these restrictions may result in the shares being automatically transferred to a charitable trust or may be void 

our charter provides that our board may grant exceptions to the 98 ownership limit subject in each case to certain initial and ongoing conditions designed to protect our status as a reit these ownership limits may prevent a thirdparty from acquiring control of us if our board of directors does not grant an exemption from the ownership limits even if our stockholders believe the change in control is in their best interests an exemption from the 98 ownership limit has previously been granted to certain stockholders and our board may in the future provide exceptions to the ownership limit for other stockholders subject to the aforementioned initial and ongoing conditions designed to protect our status as a reit 

• our board of directors has the power to cause us to issue and authorize additional shares of our capital stock without stockholder approval 

our charter authorizes us to issue authorized but unissued shares of common or preferred stock in addition to the shares of common stock issued and outstanding in addition our board of directors may without stockholder approval amend our charter to increase the aggregate number of our shares of stock or the number of shares of stock of any class or series that we have authority to issue and classify or reclassify any unissued shares of common or preferred stock and set the preferences rights and other terms of the classified or reclassified shares as a result our board of directors may establish a class or series of shares of common or preferred stock that could delay or prevent a transaction or a change in control that might involve a premium price for our shares of common stock or otherwise be in the best interests of our stockholders 

certain provisions of maryland law may limit the ability of a third party to acquire control of us 

certain provisions of the mgcl may have the effect of inhibiting a third party from acquiring us or of impeding a change of control under circumstances that otherwise could provide our common stockholders with the opportunity to realize a premium over the then prevailing market price of such shares including 

• “business combination” provisions that subject to limitations a prohibit certain business combinations between an “interested stockholder” defined generally as any person who beneficially owns 10 or more of the voting power of our outstanding shares of voting stock or an affiliate or associate of ours who at any time within the twoyear period immediately prior to the date in question was the beneficial owner of 10 or more of the voting power of our then outstanding shares of our common stock or an affiliate of any interested stockholder and us for five years after the most recent date on which the stockholder becomes an interested stockholder and b thereafter impose two supermajority stockholder voting requirements on these combinations and 

• “control share” provisions that provide that holders of “control shares” of our company defined as voting shares of stock that if aggregated with all other shares of stock owned or controlled by the acquirer except solely by virtue of a revocable proxy would entitle the acquirer to exercise one of three increasing ranges of voting power in electing directors acquired in a “control share acquisition” defined as the direct or indirect acquisition of ownership or control of “control shares” have no voting rights with respect to “control shares” except to the extent approved by our stockholders by the affirmative vote of at least twothirds of all of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter excluding all votes entitled to be cast by the acquirer of control shares and by any of our officers and employees who are also our directors 

our charter provides that notwithstanding any other provision of our charter or our bylaws the maryland business combination act title 3 subtitle 6 of the mgcl does not apply to any business combination between us and any interested stockholder or any affiliate of any interested stockholder of ours and that we expressly elect not to be governed by the provisions of section 3602 of the mgcl in whole or in part pursuant to the mgcl our bylaws contain a provision

impact of the covid19 pandemic on our business 

since the emergence of the covid19 pandemic in early 2020 among the broader public health societal and global impacts the pandemic has resulted in governmental andor regulatory actions imposing temporary closures or restrictions from time to time on our tenants’ operations at our properties and our golf course operations although all of our leased properties and our golf courses are currently open and operating without restriction in some jurisdictions they remain subject to any current or future operating limitations restrictions or closures imposed by governments andor regulatory authorities while our tenants’ recent performance at many of our leased properties has been at or above prepandemic levels our tenants may continue to face challenges and additional uncertainty due to the impact of the covid19 pandemic such as complying with operational and capacity restrictions and ensuring sufficient employee staffing and service levels and the sustainability of maintaining improved operating margins and financial performance the ongoing nature of the pandemic including the impact of emerging variants may further adversely affect our tenants’ businesses and accordingly our business and financial performance could be adversely affected in the future 

all of our tenants have fulfilled their rent obligations through february 2022 and we regularly engage with our tenants in connection with their business performance operations liquidity and financial results as a triplenet lessor we believe we are generally in a strong creditor position and structurally insulated from operational and performance impacts of our tenants both positive and negative however the full extent to which the covid19 pandemic continues to adversely affect our tenants and ultimately impacts us depends on future developments which cannot be predicted with confidence including the actions taken to contain the pandemic or mitigate its impact including the availability distribution public acceptance and efficacy of

we actively seek to grow our portfolio through acquisitions of and investments in experiential real estate in geographically diverse dynamic markets spanning hospitality entertainment food and beverage leisure and gaming properties we expect to grow our portfolio through a mix of acquisitions with new tenants and by pursuing opportunities to execute sale leaseback transactions with our existing tenants pursuant to our right of first refusal agreements and putcall agreements as well as the funding of “same store” capital improvements with certain of our tenants at our leased properties in exchange for increased rent pursuant to the terms of our existing lease agreements with such tenants through our partner property growth fund finally we believe the approximately 34 acres of undeveloped or underdeveloped land on and adjacent to the las vegas strip that we own may provide attractive opportunities for potential future expansion and development in pursuing external growth initiatives we will generally seek to acquire or invest in properties that can generate stable revenue through longterm leases with tenants with established operating histories and we will consider various factors when evaluating acquisitions and other investments including the ability to continue to diversify our tenant base and increasing our geographic diversification 

our operating and financial performance in the future will be significantly influenced by the success of our acquisition strategy and the timing and the availability and terms of financing of any acquisitions that we may complete as well as broader macroeconomic and other conditions that affect our tenants’ operating and financial performance including the impact of the covid19 pandemic such as inflation labor shortages travel restrictions and supply chain disruptions we can provide no assurance that we will exercise any of our contractual rights to purchase one or more properties from caesars that caesars or ebci as applicable will trigger the rights of first offer under the las vegas strip rofr agreement horseshoe baltimore rofr agreement or danville rofr agreement as applicable that we will otherwise be successful in acquiring any properties whether subject to the las vegas strip rofr agreement the horseshoe baltimore rofr agreement the danville rofr agreement or otherwise or that our tenants will utilize any available financing opportunities under the partner property growth fund additionally our ability to successfully implement our acquisition and investment strategy will depend upon the availability and terms of financing including debt and equity capital further the pricing of any acquisitions or other investments we may consummate and the terms of any leases that we may enter into will significantly impact our future results competition to enter into transactions including sale leaseback transactions with attractive properties and desirable tenants is intense and we can provide no assurance that any future acquisitions investments or leases will be on terms as favorable to us as those relating to recent or historical transactions we anticipate that we would seek to finance these acquisitions with a combination of debt and equity although no assurance can be given that we would be able to issue equity in such amounts on favorable terms or at all or that we would not determine to incur more debt on a relative basis at the relevant time due to market conditions or otherwise in addition to rent our current lease agreements require our tenants to pay the following 1 all facility maintenance 2 all insurance required in connection with the leased properties and the business conducted on the leased properties 3 taxes levied on or with respect to the leased properties other than taxes on our income and 4 all utilities and other services necessary or appropriate for the leased properties and the business conducted on the leased properties accordingly due to the “triplenet” structure of our leases we do not expect to incur significant propertylevel expenses

2 represents the harrah’s original call properties and the jack clevelandthistledown lease agreement both of which were sale leaseback transactions in accordance with asc 842 since the lease agreements were determined to meet the definition of a salestype lease and control of the asset is not considered to have transferred to us such lease agreements are accounted for as financings under asc 310 

3 amounts represent the noncash adjustment to income from salestype leases direct financing leases and lease financing receivables in order to recognize income on an effective interest basis at a constant rate of return over the term of the leases

income from loans 

income from loans increased 246 million during the year ended december 31 2021 compared to the year ended december 31 2020 the increase was driven by the addition to our investment portfolio of the amended and restated rov loan in july 2020 the chelsea piers mortgage loan in august 2020 the forum convention center mortgage loan in september 2020 and the great wolf mezzanine loan in june 2021

golf expenses 

expenses from golf operations increased 31 million during the year ended december 31 2021 compared to the year ended december 31 2020 the change was primarily driven by an increase in rounds of golf played across our golf courses additionally even though our courses were closed from midmarch 2020 until early to midmay as a result of the covid19 pandemic we continued to pay all of our golf course employees their full salaries and benefits for a period of time and accordingly the change in our golf course operating revenues during this time was not proportionately offset by the change in golf course operating expenses 

in addition 31 million and 37 million of depreciation expense was incurred primarily by the golf business during the year ended december 31 2021 and 2020 respectively 

change in allowance for credit losses 

under asu no 201613  financial instrumentscredit losses topic 326 we are required to record an estimated credit loss for our i investments in leases  salestype ii investments in leases  financing receivables and iii investments in loans during the year ended december 31 2021 we recognized a 196 million decrease in our allowance for credit losses primarily driven by i the decrease in the reasonable and supportable period probability of default of our tenants or borrowers and their parent guarantors as a result of an improvement in their economic outlook due to the reopening of all of their gaming operations and relative performance of such operations during 2021 ii the decrease in the long term period probability of default due to an upgrade of the credit rating of the senior secured debt used to determine the long term period probability of default for one of our tenants during 2021 and iii the decrease in the reasonable and supportable period probability of default and loss given default as a result of standard annual updates that were made to the inputs and assumptions in the model that we utilize to estimate our cecl allowance this decrease was partially offset by an increase in the existing amortized cost balances subject to the cecl allowance 

table o f contents 

during the year ended december 31 2020 we recognized a 2445 million increase in our allowance for credit losses primarily driven by the increase in investment balances subject to cecl specifically the increase was primarily attributable to i the increase in investment balances resulting from the eldorado transaction which includes a an initial cecl allowance on our 18 billion investment in the harrah’s original call properties b an additional cecl allowance on our aggregate 14 billion increased investment in the las vegas master lease agreement as a result of the cplv additional rent acquisition and hlv additional rent acquisition and c an additional cecl allowance on the 3334 million increased balance of our existing caesars lease agreements as a result of the mark to fair value in connection with the reassessment of lease classification ii an increase related to our initial investment in jack clevelandthistledown and the rov loan in january 2020 iii an increase in the shortterm probability of default of caesars as a result of the eldoradocaesars merger and iv an increase in the longterm probability of default of our tenants due to downgrades on certain of the credit ratings of our tenants’ senior secured debt in connection with the covid19 pandemic refer to note 5  allowance for credit losses for further details 

transaction and acquisition expenses 

transaction and acquisition costs increased 17 million during the year ended december 31 2021 compared to the year ended december 31 2020 changes in transaction and acquisition expenses are related to fluctuations in i costs incurred for investments during the period that are not capitalizable under gaap and ii costs incurred for investments that we are no longer pursuing 

nonoperating income and expenses 

for the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 our nonoperating income and expenses were comprised of the following items 



interest expense 

interest expense increased 838 million during the year ended december 31 2021 compared to the year ended december 31 2020 the increase is primarily driven by i the 642 million payment in connection with the early settlement of the outstanding interest rate swap agreements ii the amortization of the commitment fees associated with the venetian acquisition bridge facility and the mgp transactions bridge facility and iii the increase in aggregate debt of 25 billion from the february 2020 senior unsecured notes offering 

additionally the above increase was partially offset by i the redemption of the second lien notes in february 2020 ii the full repayment of the term loan b facility in september 2021 and iii a decrease in the weighted average annualized interest rate of our debt to 404 during the year ended december 31 2021 from 447 during the year ended december 31 2020 as a result of a the weighted average interest rate on the february 2020 senior unsecured notes being lower than the weighted average interest rate of the second lien notes and b a decrease in libor on the 6000 million portion of our variable rate debt that was not hedged for the portion of the period the term loan b facility was still outstanding 

interest income 

interest income decreased 67 million during the year ended december 31 2021 compared to the year ended december 31 2020 the decrease was primarily driven by an overall decrease in our cash on hand throughout the current year as compared to the prior year coupled with a decrease in the interest rates earned on our excess cash 

loss on extinguishment of debt 

during the year ended december 31 2021 we recognized a loss on extinguishment of debt of 156 million resulting from the writeoff of the unamortized deferred financing fees in connection with the full repayment of our term loan b facility in september 2021 during the year ended december 31 2020 we recognized a loss on extinguishment of debt of 391 million resulting from the full redemption of our second lien notes in february 2020

gain upon lease modification 

in 2020 in connection with the eldorado transaction and as required under asc 842 we reassessed the lease classification of the las vegas master lease agreement regional master lease agreement and joliet lease agreement and determined the leases meet the definition of a salestype lease including the land component of caesars palace las vegas as a result of the reclassifications of the caesars lease agreements from direct financing and operating leases to salestype leases in 2020 we recorded the investments at their estimated fair values as of the modification date and recognized a net gain equal to the difference in fair value of the assets and their carrying values immediately prior to the modification no such similar transaction occurred in the current year 

results of operations for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 

for a comparison of our results of operations for the fiscal years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 see “ part ii item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ” of our annual report on form 10k for the fiscal year ended december 31 2020 filed with the sec on february 18 2021 and incorporated by reference herein 

reconciliation of nongaap measures 

we present funds from operations “ffo” ffo per share adjusted funds from operations “affo” affo per share and adjusted ebitda which are not required by or presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states “gaap” these are nongaap financial measures and should not be construed as alternatives to net income or as an indicator of operating performance as determined in accordance with gaap we believe ffo ffo per share affo affo per share and adjusted ebitda provide a meaningful perspective of the underlying operating performance of our business 

ffo is a nongaap financial measure that is considered a supplemental measure for the real estate industry and a supplement to gaap measures consistent with the definition used by the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit we define ffo as net income or loss attributable to common stockholders computed in accordance with gaap excluding i gains or losses from sales of certain real estate assets ii depreciation and amortization related to real estate iii gains and losses from change in control and iv impairment writedowns of certain real estate assets and investments in entities when the impairment is directly attributable to decreases in the value of depreciable real estate held by the entity 

affo is a nongaap financial measure that we use as a supplemental operating measure to evaluate our performance we calculate affo by adding or subtracting from ffo noncash leasing and financing adjustments noncash change in allowance for credit losses noncash stockbased compensation expense transaction costs incurred in connection with the acquisition of real estate investments amortization of debt issuance costs and original issue discount other noncash interest expense nonreal estate depreciation which is comprised of the depreciation related to our golf course operations capital expenditures which are comprised of additions to property plant and equipment related to our golf course operations impairment charges related to nondepreciable real estate gains or losses on debt extinguishment and interest rate swap settlements other nonrecurring noncash transactions such as noncash gain upon lease modification and noncash adjustments attributable to noncontrolling interest with respect to certain of the foregoing 

we calculate adjusted ebitda by adding or subtracting from affo contractual interest expense and interest income collectively interest expense net and income tax expense 

these nongaap financial measures i do not represent cash flow from operations as defined by gaap ii should not be considered as an alternative to net income as a measure of operating performance or to cash flows from operating investing and financing activities and iii are not alternatives to cash flow as a measure of liquidity in addition these measures should not be viewed as measures of liquidity nor do they measure our ability to fund all of our cash needs including our ability to make cash distributions to our stockholders to fund capital improvements or to make interest payments on our indebtedness investors are also cautioned that ffo ffo per share affo affo per share and adjusted ebitda as presented may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other real estate companies including reits due to the fact that not all real estate companies use the same definitions our presentation of these measures does not replace the presentation of our financial results in accordance with gaap

as of december 31 2021 our available cash balances capacity under our secured revolving credit facility and additional available proceeds were as follows 



 

1 subsequent to year end on february 8 2022 we entered into the credit agreement providing for the credit facilities comprised of the revolving credit facility in the amount of 25 billion and the delayed draw term loan in the amount of 10 billion and concurrently terminated our secured revolving credit facility including the first priority lien on substantially all of vici propco’s and its existing and subsequently acquired wholly owned material domestic restricted subsidiaries’ material assets and existing credit agreement the credit facilities include the option to increase the revolving loan commitments by up to 10 billion and increase the delayed draw term loan commitments or add one or more new tranches of term loans by up to 10 billion in the aggregate in each case to the extent that any one or more lenders from the syndicate or otherwise agree to provide such additional credit extensions 

2 assumes the physical settlement of the 50000000 and 69000000 shares under the september 2021 forward sale agreements and march 2021 forward sale agreements respectively at the forward sale price of 2784 and 2653 respectively calculated as of december 31 2021 subsequent to year end on february 18 2022 we physically settled the september 2021 forward sale agreements and march 2021 forward sale agreements for total net proceeds of 32192 million based on the forward sale prices as of the date of settlement the proceeds from the settlement were used to pay for a portion of the purchase price of the venetian acquisition 

we believe that we have sufficient liquidity to meet our material cash requirements including our contractual obligations and commitments as well as our additional funding requirements primarily through currently available cash and cash equivalents cash received under our lease agreements existing borrowings from banks including our delayed draw term loan and undrawn capacity under our revolving credit facility and proceeds from future issuances of debt and equity securities including issuances under our atm agreement as defined below for the next 12 months and in future periods 

all of the lease agreements call for an initial term of between fifteen and thirty years with additional tenant renewal options and are designed to provide us with a reliable and predictable longterm revenue stream however the covid19 pandemic has adversely impacted our tenants and their financial condition and may continue to do so due to the impact of operating restrictions and limitations imposed from time to time as well as potential property reclosures in the event our tenants are unable to make all of their contractual rent payments as provided by the lease agreements we believe we have sufficient liquidity from the other sources discussed above to meet all of our contractual obligations for a significant period of time additionally we do not have any debt maturities until 2025 for more information refer to the risk factors in part i item 1a risk factors  

our cash flows from operations and our ability to access capital resources could be adversely affected due to uncertain economic factors and volatility in the financial and credit markets including as a result of the covid19 pandemic in particular in connection with the covid19 pandemic and its impact on our tenants’ operations and financial performance we can provide no assurances that our tenants will not default on their leases or fail to make full rental payments if their businesses become challenged due to among other things current or future adverse economic conditions in addition any such tenant default or failure to make full rental payments could impact our operating performance and result in us not satisfying the financial covenants applicable to our outstanding indebtedness which could result in us not being able to incur additional debt or result in a default further current or future economic conditions could impact our tenants’ ability to meet capital improvement requirements or other obligations required in our lease agreements that could result in a decrease in the value of our properties 

our ability to raise funds through the issuance of debt and equity securities and access to other thirdparty sources of capital in the future will be dependent on among other things uncertainties related to covid19 and the impact of our response and our tenants’ responses to covid19 general economic conditions general market conditions for reits market perceptions and the trading price of our stock we will continue to analyze which sources of capital are most advantageous to us at any particular point in time but the capital markets may not be consistently available on terms we deem attractive or at all

critical accounting estimates 

our financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap which requires us to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes we believe that the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting estimates which are those that have a significant level of estimation uncertainty requiring our most difficult subjective and complex judgments and significantly impacts the balance sheet and statement of operations in the reporting period actual results may differ from the estimates refer to note 2  summary of significant accounting poli cies for a full discussion of our accounting policies 

lease accounting 

we account for our investments in leases under asc 842 “leases” “asc 842” which requires significant estimates and judgments by management in its application upon lease inception or lease modification we assess the lease classification of both the land and building components of the property to determine whether each component should be classified as a direct financing salestype or operating lease the determination of lease classification requires the calculation of the rate implicit in the lease which is driven by significant estimates including the estimation of both the value assigned to the land and building property components upon acquisition and the estimation of the unguaranteed residual value of such components at the end of the noncancelable lease term if the lease component is determined to be a direct financing or salestype lease revenue is recognized over the life of the lease using the rate implicit in the lease 

management uses industry standard practices to estimate both the value assigned to the land and building property components upon acquisition and the unguaranteed residual value of such components including comparable sales and replacement cost analyses although management believes its estimate of both the value assigned to the land and building property components upon acquisition and the unguaranteed residual value of such components is reasonable no assurance can be given that such amounts will be correct in particular a change in the estimates could have a material impact on the lease classification determination and the timing and amount of income recognized over the life of the lease 

allowance for credit losses 

asc 326 “credit losses” “asc 326” requires that we measure and record current expected credit losses “cecl” for the majority of our investments the scope of which includes our investments in leases  salestype investments in leases  financing receivables and investments in loans we have elected to use a discounted cash flow model to estimate the allowance for credit losses or cecl allowance this model requires us to develop cash flows which project estimated credit losses over the life of the lease or loan and discount these cash flows at the asset’s effective interest rate we then record a cecl allowance equal to the difference between the amortized cost basis of the asset and the present value of the expected credit loss cash flows 

expected losses within our cash flows are determined by estimating the probability of default “pd” and loss given default “lgd” of our tenants and their parent guarantors over the life of each individual lease or financial asset the pd and lgd are estimated during a reasonable and supportable period for which we believe we are able to estimate future economic conditions the “rs period” and a longterm period for which we revert to longterm historical averages the “longterm period” we are unable to use our historical data to estimate losses as we have no loss history to date 

given the length of our leases the longterm period pd and lgd are the most material and significant drivers of the cecl allowance the pd and lgd for the longterm period are estimated using the average historical default rates and historical loss rates respectively of public companies over the past 35 years that have similar credit profiles or characteristics to our tenants and their parent guarantors we have engaged a nationally recognized data analytics firm to assist us with estimating both the pd and lgd of our tenants and their parent guarantors changes to the longterm period pd and lgd are generally driven by i updated studies from the nationally recognized data analytics firm we employ to assist us with calculating the allowance and ii changes in the credit rating assigned to our tenants and their parent guarantors 

table o f contents 

the following table illustrates the impact on the cecl allowance of our investment portfolio as a result of a 10 increase and decrease in the weighted average percentages used to estimate longterm pd and lgd of all of our tenants and their parent guarantors 



although management believes its estimate of the longterm pd and lgd described above is reasonable no assurance can be given that the longterm pd and lgd for our tenants or other drivers of the cecl allowance will be correct any significant variation of longterm pd or lgd from management’s expectations could have a material impact on our financial condition and operating results

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend

interest rate risk 

our interest rate risk management objective is to limit the impact of future interest rate changes on our earnings and cash flows to achieve this objective our consolidated subsidiaries primarily borrow on a fixedrate basis for longerterm debt issuances as of december 31 2021 we had 47500 million aggregate principal amount of outstanding indebtedness all of which has fixed rate interest 

additionally we are exposed to interest rate risk between the time we enter into a transaction and the time we finance the related transaction with longterm fixedrate debt in addition when that longterm debt matures we may have to refinance the real estate at a higher interest rate in a rising interest rate environment we have from time to time and may in the future seek to mitigate that risk by utilizing forwardstarting interest rate swap agreements and other derivative instruments market interest rates are sensitive to many factors that are beyond our control 

capital markets risks 

we are exposed to risks related to the equity capital markets and our related ability to raise capital through the issuance of our common stock or other equity instruments we are also exposed to risks related to the debt capital markets and our related ability to finance our business through longterm indebtedness borrowings under credit facilities or other debt instruments as a reit we are required to distribute a significant portion of our taxable income annually which constrains our ability to accumulate operating cash flow and therefore requires us to utilize debt or equity capital to finance our business we seek to mitigate these risks by monitoring the debt and equity capital markets to inform our decisions on the amount timing and terms of capital we raise

 item 1 business tableend

we are a maryland corporation that is primarily engaged in the business of owning and acquiring gaming hospitality and entertainment destinations subject to longterm triple net leases our national geographically diverse portfolio currently consists of 28 market leading properties including caesars palace las vegas and harrah’s las vegas two of the most iconic entertainment facilities on the las vegas strip our entertainment facilities are leased to leading brands that seek to drive consumer loyalty and value with guests through superior services experiences products and continuous innovation across over 47 million square feet our wellmaintained properties are curren tly located across urban destination and driveto markets in twelve states contain approximately 17800 hotel rooms and feature over 200 restaurants bars and nightclubs 

our portfolio also includes three secured real estate mortgages that we have originated for strategic reasons and were in connection with transactions that may provide the potential to convert our investment into the ownership of certain of the underlying real estate in the future in addition we own approximately 34 acres of undeveloped or underdeveloped land on and adjacent to the las vegas strip that is leased to caesars which we may look to monetize as appropriate we also own and operate four championship golf courses located near certain of our properties two of which are in close proximity to the las vegas strip 

we lease our properties to subsidiaries of caesars penn national hard rock century casinos and jack entertainment with caesars being our largest tenant we believe we have a mutually beneficial relationship with each of caesars penn national hard rock century casinos and jack entertainment all of which are leading owners and operators of gaming entertainment and leisure properties our longterm triplenet lease agreements with subsidiaries of our operators provide us with a highly predictable revenue stream with embedded growth potential we believe our geographic diversification limits the effect of changes in any one market on our overall performance we are focused on driving longterm total returns through managing experiential asset growth and allocating capital diligently maintaining a highly productive tenant base and optimizing our capital structure to support external growth as a growth focused public real estate investment trust with longterm investments we expect our relationship with our partners will position us for the acquisition of additional properties across leisure and hospitality over the long term despite the ongoing impact and uncertainty of the covid19 pandemic we continue to evaluate and may opportunistically pursue accretive acquisitions or investments that may arise in the market  

our portfolio is competitively positioned and wellmaintained pursuant to the terms of the lease agreements which require our tenants to invest in our properties subject in certain cases to temporary relief we granted certain tenants on a portion of their capital expenditure obligations in connection with the impact of the covid19 pandemic and in line with our tenants’ commitment to build guest loyalty we anticipate our tenants will continue to make strategic valueenhancing investments in our properties over time helping to maintain their competitive position in addition given our scale and deep industry knowledge we believe we are wellpositioned to execute highly complementary singleasset and portfolio acquisitions as well as other investments to augment growth as market conditions allow with a focus on disciplined capital allocation 

we conduct our operations as a real estate investment trust “reit” for us federal income tax purposes we generally will not be subject to us federal income taxes on our taxable income to the extent that we annually distribute all of our net taxable income to stockholders and maintain our qualification as a reit we believe our election of reit status combined with the income generation from the lease agreements will enhance our ability to make distributions to our stockholders providing investors with current income as well as longterm growth subject to the current macroeconomic impact of the covid19 pandemic and market conditions more broadly we conduct our real property business through our operating partnership and our golf course business through a taxable reit subsidiary a “trs” vici golf 

impact of the covid19 pandemic on our business 

on march 11 2020 the world health organization declared covid19 a pandemic and on march 13 2020 the united states declared a national emergency among the broader public health societal and global impacts the covid19 pandemic resulted in state governments andor regulatory authorities issuing various directives mandates orders or similar actions resulting in temporary closures of our tenants’ operations at all of our properties our golf course business has also been impacted with all four courses temporarily ceasing operations in march 2020 as a result of the covid19 pandemic although our golf courses were subsequently reopened in early to midmay 2020 in compliance with applicable regulations and restrictions although the operations of all of our properties are currently open they remain subject to any current or future operating limitations or closures imposed by state and local governments andor regulatory authorities as a result our tenants’ facilities at our properties are generally operating at reduced capacity and subject to additional operating restrictions and we cannot predict how long they will be required to operate subject to such operating restrictions or whether they will be subject to additional restrictions or forced to close again in the future the full extent to which the covid19 pandemic continues to adversely affect our tenants and ultimately impacts us depends on future developments which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence including the scope severity and duration of the pandemic the actions taken to contain the pandemic or mitigate its impact including the availability and efficacy of one or more approved vaccines and the direct and indirect economic effects of the pandemic and containment measures on our tenants including our tenants’ financial performance and the duration and extent of operating limitations reduced capacity requirements and any additional required closures we continue to closely monitor the impact of the covid19 pandemic on us and our tenants 

in addition to the closure and restriction of their operations our tenants have experienced a substantial number of cancellations and reductions in future events and reservations in connection with the uncertain duration of the covid19 pandemic our tenants have also faced additional challenges with respect to restoring operations customer engagement and financial performance although in many of our tenants’ regional markets their early operational performance following reopening has generally been at or near prioryear levels for such period more broadly the covid19 pandemic and the actions taken to contain the pandemic or mitigate its impact have resulted in a prolonged period of significant economic uncertainty as well as a global economic contraction which may continue through 2021 additional economic effects may continue well beyond the lifting or phasing out of governmental restrictions related to covid19 or the immediate public health crisis of the pandemic or may further impact certain regions such as las vegas nevada thereby negatively affecting an economic recovery in the gaming sector historically economic indicators such as gdp growth consumer confidence and employment are correlated with demand for gaming entertainment and leisure properties and economic recessions have led to a decrease in gaming revenue although the impact of such recessions have generally been less volatile than the impact on retail revenue and sp 500 revenue 

all of our tenants have fulfilled their rent obligations through february 2021 and we continue to engage with our tenants in connection with the ongoing covid19 pandemic and its impact on their businesses including with respect to their operations liquidity financial performance and contingency planning however in connection with the ongoing covid19 pandemic and its impact on our tenants’ operations and financial performance we have provided certain relief under the applicable lease agreements to some of our tenants while the relief we have provided has not deferred or reduced rent obligations for any of our tenants and we do not currently anticipate providing any such relief due to these factors and the continuing uncertainty of the ultimate impact of the covid19 pandemic there can be no assurance that our tenants will continue to fulfill their rent obligations in full make anticipated capital expenditures to maintain or improve our properties or fulfill their other contractual obligations under their lease agreements further current or future economic conditions could impact our tenants’ ability to meet capital improvement requirements or such other obligations required in our lease agreements that could result in a decrease in value of our properties 

in addition we cannot predict with confidence when our tenants’ operations at our properties will operate without restriction whether they will be forced to close again in the future or if and when they will return to prepandemic performance levels as the duration of the pandemic applicable operational restrictions and closures lengthen or if new operational restrictions or required closures are imposed our tenants’ liquidity positions may become more stressed which may cause one or more of our tenants to be unwilling or unable to meet their obligations to us in full or at all or to otherwise seek modifications to such obligations as a triplenet lessor we believe we are generally in a strong creditor position and structurally insulated from operational and performance impacts of our tenants both positive and negative however given the unprecedented nature of the covid19 pandemic we understand that working with our tenants in the short term to ensure their longterm financial health and performance may become necessary and should provide meaningful benefits to us as well over the longterm 

as described herein the full extent to which the covid19 pandemic continues to adversely affect our tenants and ultimately impacts us will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence including the scope severity and duration of the pandemic the actions taken to contain the pandemic or mitigate its impact including the availability distribution and efficacy of one or more approved vaccines the direct and indirect economic effects of the pandemic and containment measures on our tenants the length of time our tenants’ operations at our properties remain restricted or closed or are required to close again in the future our tenants’ financial performance and any future operating limitations these factors may contribute to increased uncertainty with respect to our business and operating results through 2021 and we will continue to closely monitor the impact of covid19 on us and our tenants for more information refer to “ part i – item 1a risk factors ” included in this annual report on form 10k 

our competitive strengths 

we believe the following strengths effectively position us to execute our business and growth strategies 

leading portfolio of highquality experiential gaming hospitality entertainment and leisure assets 

our portfolio features caesars palace las vegas and harrah’s las vegas and marketleading urban destination and regional properties with significant scale our properties are wellmaintained and leased to leading brands such as caesars harrah’s harvey’s horseshoe margaritaville greektown jack hard rock century and mountaineer these brands seek to drive loyalty and value with guests through superior service and products and continuous innovation our portfolio benefits from its strong mix of demand generators including casinos guest rooms restaurants entertainment facilities bars and nightclubs and convention space we believe our properties are generally wellinsulated from incremental competition as a result of high replacement costs as well as regulatory restrictions and longlead times for new development the high quality of our properties appeals to a broad base of customers stimulating traffic and visitation 

our portfolio is anchored by our las vegas properties caesars palace las vegas and harrah’s las vegas which are located at the center of the las vegas strip w e believe las vegas is historically a market characterized by steady economic growth and high consumer and business demand with limited new supply although such characteristics have been negatively impacted due to the covid19 pandemic our las vegas properties which are two of the most iconic entertainment facilities in las vegas feature gaming entertainment largescale hotels extensive food and beverage options stateoftheart convention facilities retail outlets and entertainment showrooms 

our portfolio also includes marketleading regional resorts and destinations that we believe are benefiting from significant invested capital over recent years the regional properties we own include awardwinning landbased and dockside casinos hotels and entertainment facilities that are generally market leaders within their respective regions the properties operate primarily under the caesars harrah’s harvey’s horseshoe margaritaville greektown jack hard rock century and mountaineer trademark and brand names which in many instances have marketleading brand recognition 

under the terms of the lease agreements our tenants are required to continue to invest in our properties which we believe enhances the value of our properties and maintains their competitive market position 

our properties feature diversified sources of revenue on both a business and geographic basis 

our portfolio includes 28 geographically diverse casino resorts that serve numerous metropolitan statistical areas “msas” nationally this diversity reduces our exposure to adverse events that may affect any single market this also allows our tenants to derive multiple revenue streams from an economically diverse set of customers and services to such customers these include gaming food and beverage entertainment hospitality and other sources of revenue we believe that this geographic diversity and the diversity of revenue sources that our tenants derive from our leased properties improves the stability of rental revenue 

our longterm lease agreements provide a highly predictable base level of rent with embedded growth potential 

our properties are 100 occupied pursuant to our longterm triplenet lease agreements with subsidiaries of caesars penn national hard rock century casinos and jack entertainment providing us with a predictable level of rental revenue to support future cash distributions to our stockholders 

all of our casino resort properties are established assets in most cases with extensive operating histories based on historical performance of the properties we expect that the properties will generate sufficient revenues for our tenants to pay to us all rent due under the lease agreements however in the shortterm our properties have been adversely impacted by the covid19 pandemic and the current operating results may not be indicative of longterm operating results 

we believe our relationship with caesars penn national hard rock century casinos and jack entertainment including our contractual agreements with them and their applicable subsidiaries will continue to drive significant benefits and mutual alignment of strategic interests in the future 

the payment obligations of our tenants are guaranteed by caesars penn national seminole hard rock century casinos and rock ohio ventures llc as applicable 

all of our existing properties are leased to subsidiaries of caesars penn national hard rock century casinos and jack entertainment caesars guarantees the payment obligations of our tenants under the caesars lease agreements penn national guarantees the payment obligations of our tenant under the penn national lease agreements seminole hard rock guarantees the payment obligations of our tenant under the hard rock cincinnati lease agreement century casinos guarantees the payment obligations of our tenant under the century portfolio lease agreement and rock ohio ventures llc guarantees the payment obligations of our tenants under the jack clevelandthistledown lease agreement

a diverse and independent board of directors with robust business and corporate governance experience 

our diverse and independent board of directors which is made up of highly skilled and seasoned real estate gaming hospitality consumer products and corporate professionals was originally established to ensure no overlap between our tenants and the companies with which our directors are affiliated and has continued to improve and mature since our formation in 2017 for example since formation we have increased diversity by adding three independent female directors to our board as of december 31 2020 50 of our independent directors are women one of whom is racially diverse robust corporate governance in the best interests of our stockholders is of central importance to the management of our company as we have a separate independent chairman of the board all members of our board except for our chief executive officer are independent and all members of our audit committee qualify as an “audit committee financial expert” as defined by the sec directors are elected in uncontested elections by the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast on an annual basis and stockholder approval is required prior to or in certain circumstances within twelve months following the adoption by our board of a stockholder rights plan

governmental regulation and licensing 

the ownership operation and management of gaming and racing facilities are subject to pervasive regulation each of our gaming and racing facilities is subject to regulation under the laws rules and regulations of the jurisdiction in which it is located gaming laws and regulations generally require gaming industry participants to

• maintain systems for reliable record keeping 

• file periodic reports with gaming regulators and 

• ensure that contracts and financial transactions are commercially reasonable reflect fair market value and are arm’s length transactions 

gaming laws and regulations primarily impact our business in two respects 1 our ownership of land and buildings in which gaming activities are operated by our tenants and 2 the operations of our tenants as operators in the gaming industry further many gaming and racing regulatory agencies in the jurisdictions in which our tenants operate require us and our affiliates to apply for and maintain a license as a key business entity or supplier because of our status as landlord 

our business and the businesses of caesars penn national hard rock century casinos and jack entertainment are also subject to various federal state and local laws and regulations in addition to gaming regulations these laws and regulations include but are not limited to restrictions and conditions concerning alcoholic beverages environmental matters labor and employees health care currency transactions taxation zoning and building codes and marketing and advertising such laws and regulations could change or could be interpreted differently in the future or new laws and regulations could be enacted material changes new laws or regulations or material differences in interpretations by courts or governmental authorities could adversely affect our operating results 

violations of gaming laws 

if we our subsidiaries or the tenants of our properties violate applicable gaming laws our gaming licenses could be limited conditioned suspended or revoked by gaming authorities and we and any other persons involved could be subject to substantial fines further a supervisor or conservator can be appointed by gaming authorities to operate our gaming properties or in some jurisdictions take title to our gaming assets in the jurisdiction and under certain circumstances earnings generated during such appointment could be forfeited to the applicable jurisdictions violations of laws in one jurisdiction could result in disciplinary action in other jurisdictions finally the loss of our gaming licenses could result in an event of default under certain of our indebtedness and crossdefault provisions in our debt agreements could cause an event of default under one debt agreement to trigger an event of default under our other debt agreements as a result violations by us of applicable gaming laws could have a material adverse effect on us 

review and approval of transactions

the lease agreements require the tenants to maintain with financially sound and reputable insurance companies and in certain cases subject to the right of the tenants to selfinsure insurance subject to customary deductibles and retentions in such amounts and against such risks as are customarily maintained by similarly situated companies engaged in the same or similar businesses operating in the same or similar locations the lease agreements generally provide that the amount and type of insurance that the tenants have in effect as of the commencement of the leases will satisfy for all purposes the requirements to insure the properties however such insurance coverage may not be sufficient to fully cover our losses 

environmental matters 

our properties are subject to environmental laws regulating among other things air emissions wastewater discharges and the handling and disposal of wastes including medical wastes certain of the properties we own utilize above or underground storage tanks to store heating oil for use at the properties other properties were built during the time that asbestoscontaining building materials were routinely installed in residential and commercial structures the lease agreements generally obligate our tenants to comply with applicable environmental laws and to indemnify us if their noncompliance results in losses or claims against us and we expect that any future leases will include the same provisions for other operators a tenant’s failure to comply could result in fines and penalties or the requirement to undertake corrective actions which may result in significant costs to the operator and thus adversely affect their ability to meet their obligations to us 

pursuant to federal state and local environmental laws and regulations a current or previous owner or operator of real property may be required to investigate remove andor remediate a release of hazardous substances or other regulated materials at or emanating from such property further under certain circumstances such owners or operators of real property may be held liable for property damage personal injury andor natural resource damage resulting from or arising in connection with such releases certain of these laws have been interpreted to be joint and several unless the harm is divisible and there is a reasonable basis for allocation of responsibility we also may be liable under certain of these laws for damage that occurred prior to our ownership of a property or at a site where we sent wastes for disposal the failure to properly remediate a property may also adversely affect our ability to lease sell or rent the property or to borrow funds using the property as collateral 

in connection with the ownership of our current properties and any properties that we may acquire in the future we could be legally responsible for environmental liabilities or costs relating to a release of hazardous substances or other regulated materials at or emanating from such property we are not aware of any environmental issues that are expected to have a material impact on the operations of any of our properties

risks related to our business and operations 

the covid19 pandemic has adversely impacted our tenants’ operations and financial performance as well as global and us economic activity and market performance which could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition liquidity results of operations and prospects 

since being initially reported in december 2019 the outbreak of covid19 has spread globally and created considerable health risks in the united states and around the world resulting in severely adversely impacted global national and regional economic activity and has contributed to significant volatility and negative pressure in financial markets on march 11 2020 the world health organization declared covid19 a pandemic and on march 13 2020 the us federal government declared a national emergency concerning the covid19 outbreak several countries including the united states took steps to restrict air travel and many state and local governments have instituted and continue to impose additional measures including quarantines states of emergency mandatory business and school closures “shelterathome” and similar orders and other restrictions on travel and large gatherings as well as initiatives such as “social distancing” guidelines in connection with these actions state governments andor regulatory authorities issued various directives mandates orders or similar actions that resulted in the closure of nonessential businesses which included substantially all of our tenants’ operations including at our properties as well as our golf courses while such governmental and regulatory measures have in many jurisdictions been lifted or modified resulting in the reopening of most of our tenants’ operations at our properties there can be no assurance that such restrictions will not be reinstated new restrictions will not be imposed or closures required as a result of an increase in covid19 infections or that other developments will not take place that would further limit our tenants’ operations including at our properties 

in addition our tenants have experienced a substantial number of cancellations and reductions in future events and reservations in connection with the uncertain duration of the covid19 pandemic and business closures following the reopening of our tenants’ businesses they faced and continue to face additional challenges with respect to restoring business activity operations and financial performance to prepandemic levels in particular as a result of changes in customer engagement this reduced business activity has and possible future closures may continue to adversely affect our tenants’ financial performance and such impact could be material to us depending on the ultimate duration of the pandemic and operational restrictions affecting our tenants’ ability to restore business activity and operations to prepandemic levels these closures operational restrictions and reduced business activity could also materially and adversely affect our tenants’ ability to meet their respective financial obligations going forward including their obligations under our leases to pay us rent and make capital expenditures which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and liquidity although all of our tenants have fulfilled their rent obligations in full through february we cannot predict with confidence future developments with respect to our tenants’ operations at our properties including the potential for further closures or restrictions or if and when they will return to prepandemic performance levels as the duration of the pandemic and operational restrictions lengthens our tenants’ liquidity positions may become more stressed which may cause one or more of our tenants to be unable to meet their obligations to us in full or at all or to otherwise seek modifications to such obligations any such modifications to our tenants’ obligations to us under our leases may have an adverse effect on our business even if our tenants are able to fulfill their obligations to us their inability to meet their financial obligations to their creditors or other counterparties could also have a material adverse effect on our business the financial impact of the covid19 pandemic including a failure of any of our tenants to make full rental payments or any other default by our tenants under our lease agreements could also negatively impact our or our tenants’ future compliance with financial covenants of existing and any future credit facilities and indebtedness and result in a default and potentially an acceleration event which noncompliance could negatively impact our or our tenants’ ability to make additional borrowings including borrowings under our revolving credit facility issue additional indebtedness and otherwise operate our respective businesses 

furthermore the outbreak has triggered an economic contraction in the united states and a material global economic slowdown which many experts predict may continue well beyond the lifting of governmental restrictions related to covid19 and result in changes to consumer behavior or other detrimental effects thereby negatively affecting an economic recovery in 

the gaming sector any sustained economic slowdown contraction or recession or the impact thereof such as through decreased rates of employment or broader changes in consumer behavior may further materially and adversely affect our tenants’ financial performance and ability to meet such obligations we cannot predict with confidence when applicable government or regulatory orders or travel and other restrictions including orders and restrictions reimposed in connection with the increase in the covid19 infection rate in the fourth quarter of 2020 will end or whether and on what timeline our tenants’ performance will improve or return to prepandemic levels in addition due to the current volatility in the debt and equity markets we may be unable to obtain financing for future acquisitions on satisfactory terms or at all continuing disruption and instability in the global financial markets or deteriorations in credit and financing conditions may affect our access to debt and equity capital in order to fund business operations if necessary or address maturing liabilities on a timely basis as well as our tenants’ ability to fund their business operations meet their obligations to us and secure financing for any future or pending transactions 

the full extent to which our business and results of operations will ultimately be affected by the covid19 pandemic and resulting economic slowdown contraction or recession and the extent to which such factors continue to adversely affect our tenants will largely depend on future developments including the duration of the pandemic the actions taken to contain the pandemic or mitigate its impact including the availability distribution and efficacy of one or more vaccines new or mutated strains of covid19 or a similar virus including vaccineresistant strains and the direct and indirect economic effects of the pandemic and containment measures on our tenants including the length of time our tenants’ operations at our properties remain restricted or whether the properties are required to partially or fully close again in the future and our tenants’ financial performance during such closure and following reopening in addition new information may continue to emerge concerning the covid19 pandemic such as the availability distribution and efficacy of one or more vaccines new or mutated strains of covid19 or a similar virus including vaccineresistant strains other actions required to be undertaken to contain the covid19 pandemic or address its future impact the response of the us and global economies and the short and longterm impact of the covid19 pandemic on our tenants’ operations at our properties which could further materially and adversely impact our business and results and operations 

the occurrence of any of the foregoing events or any other related matters could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition liquidity results of operations prospects and the value of our common stock 

the immediate and longterm effects of the covid19 pandemic on the gaming industry could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition liquidity results of operations and prospects 

the covid19 pandemic has had a severe and unprecedented impact on the gaming industry measures implemented to prevent its spread including mandatory closure of nonessential businesses and governmentimposed restrictions on travel and social gatherings have had a significant adverse effect on the gaming industry as a result of these measures gaming facilities throughout the united states including all of our tenants’ facilities at our properties were temporarily closed although such measures have in many jurisdictions been lifted or modified resulting in the resumption of our tenants’ operations at our properties although in many cases at reduced levels during this period many gaming companies face additional financial uncertainty or are generating substantially reduced revenue and have sought or taken measures intended to maintain liquidity and solvency including employee furloughs and layoffs reduced operating and capital expenditure budgets and contractual relief or other accommodations with creditors lenders and other counterparties there is no guarantee that existing governmentimposed restrictions on travel and social gatherings will be lifted in the near term that additional governmentimposed restrictions will not be implemented or that previous restrictions that were lifted or modified will not be reinstated moreover the ultimate impact of the covid19 pandemic on the gaming industry the timing and extent of governmentimposed restrictions and the performance of gaming facilities is highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence 

historically economic indicators such as gdp growth consumer confidence and employment are correlated with demand for gaming entertainment and leisure properties such as casinos and racetracks and economic recessions contractions or slowdowns have generally led to a decrease in discretionary spending on associated leisure activities longterm impacts of the covid19 pandemic such as decreases in discretionary spending or changing consumer preferences brought about by instability in global national and regional economic activity and financial markets as a result of the covid19 pandemic could have a material adverse effect on leisure and business travel discretionary spending and other areas of economic behavior that directly impact the gaming industry because we are dependent on the gaming industry the immediate and longterm effects of the covid19 pandemic on the gaming industry could be material and adverse to our business financial condition liquidity results of operations and prospects 

we are and will always be significantly dependent on our tenants for our revenues and unless or until we substantially diversify our portfolio an event that has a material adverse effect on any of our tenants’ businesses financial condition liquidity results of operations or prospects could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition liquidity results of operations and prospects 

we depend on our tenants to operate the properties that we own in a manner that generates revenues sufficient to allow the tenants to meet their obligations to us currently a substantial majority of our revenue comes from our leases with subsidiaries of caesars penn national hard rock jack entertainment and century casinos with the most significant percentage of our revenues coming from caesars because the leases are triplenet leases in addition to the rent these tenants will owe us we will depend on these tenants to pay substantially all insurance taxes utilities and maintenance and repair expenses in connection with these leased properties and to indemnify defend and hold us harmless from and against various claims litigation and liabilities arising in connection with their businesses there can be no assurance that our tenants will have sufficient assets income or access to financing to enable them to satisfy their payment and other obligations under their leases with us or that the applicable guarantor will be able to satisfy its guarantee of the applicable tenant’s obligations 

our tenants rely on the properties they or their respective subsidiaries own andor operate for income to satisfy their obligations including their debt service requirements and lease and other payments due to us or others in addition caesars relies on our properties the caesars forum convention center and their other operations to satisfy their payment obligations under the forum convention center mortgage loan as a result of the covid19 pandemic state governments andor regulatory authorities issued various directives mandates orders or similar actions resulting in the closure of nonessential businesses which included substantially all of our tenants’ operations including at our properties and the caesars forum convention center although such measures have generally been lifted or modified there is significant uncertainty regarding whether and to what extent similar measures will be reinstated limiting our tenants’ ability to operate their businesses including at our properties if income at these properties were to decline for any reason including as a result of the covid19 pandemic or if a tenant’s debt service requirements were to increase or if their creditworthiness were to become impaired for any reason a tenant or the applicable guarantor may become unable or unwilling to satisfy its payment and other obligations under their leases or other agreements with us the inability or unwillingness of a significant tenant to meet its payment or other obligations under a lease or other payment obligation with us could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition liquidity results of operations and prospects including our ability to make distributions to our stockholders 

the gaming and entertainment industry is highly competitive and our tenants’ failure to continue to compete successfully could adversely affect their businesses financial conditions results of operations and cash flows in particular our tenants’ businesses may be adversely impacted by the reinvestment and expansion by competitors in existing jurisdictions and expansion of gaming into new jurisdictions in which gaming was not previously permitted which would result in increased competition in these jurisdictions additionally the casino entertainment industry represents a significant source of tax revenues to the various jurisdictions in which casinos operate from time to time various state and federal legislators and officials have proposed changes in tax laws or in the administration of such laws including increases in tax rates which would affect the industry if adopted such changes could adversely impact the business financial condition and results of operations of our tenants 

due to our dependence on rental and other payments from our tenants as our primary source of revenue we may be limited in our ability to enforce our rights under the leases or other agreements with our tenants or terminate such other agreements or due to our master lease structure certain leases with respect to any particular property failure by our significant tenants to comply with the terms of their respective leases or to comply with the gaming regulations to which the leased properties are subject could result in among other things the termination of an applicable ground lease requiring us to find another tenant for such property to the extent possible and there could be a decrease or cessation of rental payments by such tenants as the case may be in such event we may lose our interest in a property subject to an applicable ground lease or be unable to locate a suitable creditworthy tenant at similar rental rates or at all which would have the effect of reducing our rental revenues and could have a material adverse effect on us 

because a concentrated portion of our revenues are generated from the las vegas strip we are subject to greater risks than a company that is more geographically diversified 

our properties on the las vegas strip generated approximately 30 of our lease revenue for the year ended december 31 2020 therefore our business may be significantly affected by risks common to the las vegas tourism industry for example the cost and availability of air services and the impact of any events that disrupt air travel to and from las vegas including the impact of measures implemented to address the covid19 pandemic can adversely affect the business of our tenants we cannot control the number or frequency of flights to or from las vegas but our largest tenant caesars relies on air traffic for a significant portion of their visitors to these properties reductions in flights by major airlines as a result of higher fuel prices or lower demand including as a result of the covid19 pandemic can impact the number of visitors to our properties 

additionally there is one principal interstate highway between las vegas and southern california where a large number of the customers that frequent our properties on the las vegas strip reside capacity constraints of that highway or any other traffic disruptions may also affect the number of customers who visit our facilities additionally travel from southern california to our properties on the las vegas strip may have been affected by the stay at home order announced by the governor of the state of california in december 2020 in response to increased covid19 infection rates and there can be no assurance that additional stayathome or similar orders will not be implemented by the state of california or other states moreover due to the importance of our two properties on the las vegas strip we may be disproportionately affected by general risks such as acts of terrorism natural disasters including major fires floods and earthquakes and severe or inclement weather including as a result of climate change should such developments occur in or nearby las vegas in addition a material adverse impact on caesars even unrelated to the company’s operations in las vegas that negatively affects caesars’ financial condition could materially and adversely affect us given our reliance on their performance as tenants in our properties on the las vegas strip 

caesars and its subsidiaries are party to certain leasing and financial commitments with us which may have a negative impact on caesars’ business and operating condition 

caesars andor its subsidiaries entered into certain leasing and financial commitments evidenced by agreements with us see item 1 “businessour relationship with caesars” for additional information regarding such agreements 

caesars which is our largest tenant is obligated to pay us in the aggregate approximately 62 billion in fixed annual rents under the caesars lease agreements payments under the forum convention center mortgage loan and golf course membership fees under the golf course use agreement over the next five years under the applicable agreements subject to certain escalators and adjustments if caesars’ businesses and properties fail to generate sufficient earnings caesars may be unable to satisfy its or its subsidiaries’ obligations under the caesars lease agreements the forum convention center mortgage loan the golf course use agreement and the related guarantees additionally these obligations may limit their ability to make investments to maintain and grow their portfolio of businesses and properties which may adversely affect their competitiveness and ability to satisfy their obligations to us 

in addition prior to the eldoradocaesars merger caesars publicly disclosed that it expects to achieve synergies as a result of the eldoradocaesars merger as a result of the covid19 pandemic or otherwise caesars may be unable to achieve such synergies during the time period that it expects to do so or at all and a failure to achieve these synergies may adversely affect caesars including its creditworthiness and impair its ability to meet its obligations to us moreover given caesars’ significance to our business a failure on the part of caesars to realize expected synergies and any related improvement to its creditworthiness or any deterioration of its creditworthiness could materially and adversely affect us even in the absence of a default under our agreements with caesars 

subsidiaries of caesars are required to pay a significant portion of their cash flow from operations to us pursuant to and subject to the terms and conditions of the caesars lease agreements and the forum convention center mortgage loan which could adversely affect caesars’ ability to fund its operations or development projects raise capital make acquisitions and otherwise respond to competitive and economic changes and its ability to satisfy its payment obligations to us under the lease agreements the forum convention center mortgage loan and the related guarantees 

subsidiaries of caesars are required to pay a significant portion of their cash flow from operations to us pursuant to and subject to the terms and conditions of the caesars lease agreements see item 1 “businessour lease agreementcaesars lease agreementsoverview” and item 1 “businessour relationship with caesars” as a result of this commitment caesars’ ability to fund its operations or development projects raise capital make acquisitions and otherwise respond to competitive and economic changes may be adversely affected which could adversely affect the ability of the applicable tenants to satisfy their obligations to us under the caesars lease agreements and the ability of caesars to satisfy its obligations to us under the related guarantees 

in addition during the initial seven years of the caesars lease agreements the annual rent escalations under the caesars lease agreements will continue to apply regardless of the amount of cash flows generated by the properties that are subject to the caesars lease agreements accordingly if the cash flows generated by such properties decrease or do not increase at the same rate as the rent escalations the rents payable under the caesars lease agreements will comprise a higher percentage of the cash flows generated by the subsidiaries of caesars which could make it more difficult for the applicable subsidiaries to meet their payment obligations to us under the caesars lease agreements and ultimately could adversely affect the applicable guarantor’s ability to satisfy their respective obligations to us under the related guarantees 

caesars’ indebtedness and the fact that a significant portion of its cash flow is used to make interest payments could adversely affect its ability to satisfy its obligations under the caesars lease agreements and the forum convention center mortgage loan 

as disclosed in its quarterly report on form 10q for the quarter ended september 30 2020 caesars’ consolidated estimated debt service including principal and interest for 2021 will be approximately 9170 million and 192 billion thereafter to maturity as a result a significant portion of caesars’ liquidity needs are for debt service including significant interest payments such substantial indebtedness and the restrictive covenants under the agreements governing such indebtedness could limit the ability of the applicable tenants and borrower to satisfy their respective obligations to us under the lease agreements and the forum convention center mortgage loan and the ability of caesars to satisfy its obligations under the related guarantees 

we are dependent on the gaming industry and may be susceptible to the risks associated with it which could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition liquidity results of operations and prospects 

as the landlord of gaming facilities we are impacted by the risks associated with the gaming industry therefore so long as our investments are concentrated in gamingrelated assets our success is dependent on the gaming industry which could be adversely affected by economic conditions in general changes in consumer trends and preferences and other factors over which we and our tenants have no control including the immediate and longterm effects of the covid19 pandemic as we are subject to risks inherent in substantial investments in a single industry a decrease in the gaming business would likely have a greater adverse effect on us than if we owned a more diversified real estate portfolio particularly because a component of the rent under the lease agreements will be based over time on the performance of the gaming facilities operated by our tenants on our properties and such effect could be material and adverse to our business financial condition liquidity results of operations and prospects 

the gaming industry is characterized by a high degree of competition among a large number of participants including riverboat casinos dockside casinos landbased casinos video lottery sweepstakes and poker machines not located in casinos native american gaming emerging varieties of internet gaming sports betting and other forms of gaming in the united states and in a broader sense gaming operators face competition from all manner of leisure and entertainment activities gaming competition is intense in most of the markets where our facilities are located recently there has been additional significant competition in the gaming industry as a result of the upgrading or expansion of facilities by existing market participants the entrance of new gaming participants into a market internet gaming or legislative changes as competing properties and new markets are opened we may be negatively impacted additionally decreases in discretionary consumer spending brought about by weakened general economic conditions such as but not limited to the impact of and recovery following the covid19 pandemic lackluster recoveries from recessions contractions high unemployment levels higher income taxes low levels of consumer confidence weakness in the housing market cultural and demographic changes and increased stock market volatility may negatively impact our revenues and operating cash flows 

we and our tenants face extensive regulation from gaming and other regulatory authorities and our charter provides that any of our shares held by investors who are found to be unsuitable by state gaming regulatory authorities are subject to redemption 

the ownership operation and management of gaming and racing facilities are subject to extensive regulation by one or more gaming authorities in each applicable jurisdiction where gaming and racing facilities are permitted these gaming and racing regulations impact our gaming and racing tenants and persons associated with our gaming and racing facilities which in many jurisdictions include us as the landlord and owner of the real estate certain gaming authorities in the jurisdictions in which we hold properties may require us andor our affiliates to maintain a license as a principal key business entity or supplier because of our status as landlord gaming authorities also retain great discretion to require us to be found suitable as a landlord and certain of our stockholders officers and directors may be required to be found suitable as well regulatory authorities also have broad powers with respect to the licensing of casino operations and may revoke suspend condition or limit the gaming or other licenses of our tenants impose substantial fines or take other actions any one of which could adversely impact the business financial condition and results of operations of our tenants in addition in many jurisdictions licenses are granted for limited durations and require renewal from time to time 

in many jurisdictions gaming laws can require certain of our stockholders to file an application be investigated and qualify or have his her or its suitability determined by gaming authorities gaming authorities have very broad discretion in determining whether a stockholder is required to file an application and whether an applicant should be deemed suitable subject to certain administrative proceeding requirements the gaming regulators have the authority to deny any application or limit condition restrict revoke or suspend any license registration finding of suitability or approval or fine any person licensed registered or found suitable or approved for any cause deemed reasonable by the gaming authorities 

gaming authorities may conduct investigations into the conduct or associations of our directors officers key employees or investors to ensure compliance with applicable standards if we are required to be found suitable and are found suitable as a landlord we will be registered as a public company with the gaming authorities and will be subject to disciplinary action if after we receive notice that a person is unsuitable to be a stockholder or to have any other relationship with us we 

• pay that person any distribution or interest upon any of our securities 

• allow that person to exercise directly or indirectly any voting right conferred through securities held by that person 

• pay remuneration in any form to that person for services rendered or otherwise or 

• fail to pursue all lawful efforts to require such unsuitable person to relinquish his or her securities including if necessary the immediate redemption of such securities in accordance with our charter 

many jurisdictions also require any person who acquires beneficial ownership of more than a certain percentage of voting securities of a gaming company and in some jurisdictions nonvoting securities typically 5 of a publiclytraded company to report the acquisition to gaming authorities and gaming authorities may require such holders to apply for qualification licensure or a finding of suitability subject to limited exceptions for “institutional investors” that hold a company’s securities for passive investment purposes only our outstanding shares of capital stock are held subject to applicable gaming laws any person owning or controlling at least 5 of the outstanding shares of any class of our capital stock is required to promptly notify us of such person’s identity and apply for qualification licensure finding of suitability or an institutional investor waiver as applicable some jurisdictions may also limit the number of gaming licenses in which a person may hold an ownership or a controlling interest 

further our directors officers key employees and investors in our shares must meet approval standards of certain gaming regulatory authorities if such gaming regulatory authorities were to find such a person or investor unsuitable we may be required to sever our relationship with that person or the investor may be required to dispose of his her or its interest in us our charter provides that all of our shares held by investors who are found to be unsuitable by regulatory authorities are subject to redemption upon our receipt of notice of such finding 

additionally because we and our tenants are subject to regulation in numerous jurisdictions and because regulatory agencies within each jurisdiction review compliance with gaming laws in other jurisdictions it is possible that gaming compliance issues in one jurisdiction may lead to reviews and compliance issues in other jurisdictions the loss of gaming licenses by our tenants could result in the cessation of operations at one or more of the facilities we lease to such tenants the loss of gaming licenses by us could result in an event of default under certain of our indebtedness and crossdefault provisions in our debt agreements could cause an event of default under one debt agreement to trigger an event of default under our other debt agreements 

finally substantially all material loans significant acquisitions leases sales of securities and similar financing transactions by us and our subsidiaries must be reported to and in some cases approved by gaming authorities in advance of the transaction which may include a public offering of certain securities changes in control through merger consolidation stock or asset acquisitions management or consulting agreements or otherwise may be subject to receipt of prior approval of certain gaming authorities entities seeking to acquire control of us or one of our subsidiaries and certain of our affiliates must satisfy gaming authorities with respect to a variety of stringent standards prior to assuming control failure to satisfy the stringent licensing standards may preclude entities from acquiring an ownership or a controlling interest in us or one of our subsidiaries and certain of our affiliates andor require the entities to divest such interest 

required regulatory approvals can delay or prohibit transfers of our gaming properties or the consummation of other pending transactions which could result in periods in which we are unable to receive rent for such properties or otherwise realize the benefits of such transactions which may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition liquidity results of operations and prospects 

our tenants are and any future tenants of our gaming properties will be required to be licensed under applicable law in order to operate any of our properties as gaming facilities if the lease agreements or any future lease agreement we enter into are terminated which could be required by a regulatory agency or expire any new tenant must be licensed and receive other regulatory approvals to operate our properties as gaming facilities any delay in or inability of the new tenant to receive required licenses and other regulatory approvals from the applicable state and county government agencies may prolong the period during which we are unable to collect the applicable rent further in the event that the lease agreements or future lease agreements are terminated or expire and a new tenant is not licensed or fails to receive other regulatory approvals the properties may not be operated as gaming facilities and we will not be able to collect the applicable rent moreover we may be unable to transfer or sell the affected properties as gaming facilities which could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition liquidity results of operations and prospects in addition given the highly regulated nature of the gaming industry any future transactions we enter into are likely to be subject to regulatory approval in one or more jurisdictions including with respect to any transfers in ownership operating licensure or other regulatory considerations if the consummation of a pending 

transaction including with respect to the future entry into a new lease agreement is delayed or prohibited by regulatory authorities we may be limited or otherwise unable to realize the benefits of the proposed transaction 

tenants may choose not to renew the lease agreements 

we enter into longterm lease agreements with our tenants consisting of an initial lease term with the potential for the tenant to extend for multiple additional terms which may be subject to additional terms and conditions for example each of the caesars lease agreements have an initial lease term of 15 years with the potential for up to four additional fiveyear term extensions thereafter with the initial lease term under each of the caesars lease agreements extended in connection with the eldorado transaction to expire in july 2035 with respect to the properties under the regional master lease agreement the aggregate lease term including renewals may be cutback to the extent it would otherwise exceed 80 of the remaining useful life of the applicable leased property solely at the option of the tenants at the expiration of the initial lease term or of any additional renewal term thereafter our tenants may choose not to renew the applicable lease agreement if a lease agreement expires without renewal and we are not able to find suitable creditworthy tenants to replace the previous tenants on the same or more attractive terms our business financial condition liquidity results of operations and prospects may be materially and adversely affected including our ability to make distributions to our stockholders at the then current level or at all in particular with respect to the coterminous nature of the caesars lease agreements this risk would be exacerbated if caesars elected not to renew all such lease agreements at any one time 

net leases may not result in fair market lease rates over time which could negatively impact our results of operations and cash flows and reduce the amount of funds available to make distributions to stockholders 

all of our rental revenue and a substantial majority of our total revenue is generated from the lease agreements which are triplenet leases and provide greater flexibility to the respective tenants related to the use of the applicable leased property than would be the case with ordinary property leases such as the right to freely sublease portions of each leased property to make alterations in the leased premises and to terminate the lease prior to its expiration under specified circumstances furthermore net leases typically have longer lease terms and thus there is an increased risk that contractual rental increases in future years will fail to result in fair market rental rates during those years as a result our results of operations and cash flows and distributions to our stockholders could be lower than they would otherwise be if we did not enter into a net lease 

the lease agreements may restrict our ability to sell the properties 

our ability to sell or dispose of our properties may be hindered by the fact that such properties are subject to the lease agreements as the terms of the lease agreements require that a purchaser assume the lease agreements or in certain cases enter into a severance lease with the tenants for the sold property on substantially the same terms as contained in the applicable lease agreement which may make our properties less attractive to a potential buyer than alternative properties that may be for sale 

if caesars declares bankruptcy and such action results in a lease being recharacterized as a disguised financing transaction in its bankruptcy proceeding our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 

if caesars declares bankruptcy our business could be materially and adversely affected if a bankruptcy court recharacterizes the cplv additional rent acquisition or the hlv additional rent acquisition as a disguised financing transaction in the event of recharacterization our claim under a lease agreement with respect to the additional rent acquired in the hlv additional rent acquisition and cplv additional rent acquisition could either be secured or unsecured generally the leases permit us to take steps to create and perfect a security interest in the leased property but such attempts could be subject to challenge by the tenant or its creditors and with respect to the cplv additional rent acquisition and the hlv additional rent acquisition there is no assurance that a court would find that portion of our claim to be secured the bankrupt lessee and other affiliates of caesars and their creditors under this scenario might have the ability to restructure the terms including the amount owed to us under the lease with respect to the additional rent if approved by the bankruptcy court we could be bound by the new terms and prevented from collecting such additional rent acquired in the cplv additional rent acquisition and hlv additional rent acquisition and our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 

properties within our portfolio are and properties that we may acquire in the future are likely to be operated and promoted under certain trademarks and brand names that we do not own 

most of the properties within our portfolio are currently operated and promoted under trademarks and brand names not owned by us including caesars harrah’s harvey’s horseshoe margaritaville greektown jack hard rock century and mountaineer in addition properties that we may acquire in the future may be operated and promoted under these same 

trademarks and brand names or under different trademarks and brand names we do not or will not own during the term that our properties are managed by our tenants we will be reliant on our tenants to maintain and protect the trademarks brand names and other licensed intellectual property used in the operation or promotion of the leased properties operation of the leased properties as well as our business and financial condition could be adversely impacted by infringement invalidation unauthorized use or litigation affecting any such intellectual property moreover if any of our properties are rebranded unsuccessfully it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition liquidity results of operations and prospects as we may not enjoy comparable recognition or status under a new brand a transition of management away from a caesars penn national hard rock century casinos or jack entertainment entity could also have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition liquidity results of operations and prospects 

we have a substantial amount of indebtedness and may incur additional indebtedness in the future our substantial indebtedness exposes us to the risk of default under our debt obligations limits our operating flexibility increases the risks associated with a downturn in our business or in the businesses of our tenants and requires us to use a substantial portion of our cash to service our debt obligations 

we have a substantial amount of indebtedness and debt service requirements as of december 31 2020 we had approximately 69 billion in longterm indebtedness consisting of 

• 21 billion of total indebtedness outstanding under our term loan b facility 

• 7500 million of outstanding 2025 notes 

• 125 billion of outstanding 2026 notes 

• 7500 million of outstanding 2027 notes 

• 10 billion of outstanding 2029 notes and 

• 10 billion of outstanding 2030 notes 

as of december 31 2020 we also have 10 billion of available capacity to borrow under our revolving credit facility 

our term loan b and revolving credit facility are collateralized by substantially all of our properties payments of principal and interest under this indebtedness or any other instruments governing debt we may incur in the future may leave us with insufficient cash resources to pursue our business and growth strategies or to pay the distributions currently contemplated or necessary to qualify or maintain qualification as a reit our substantial outstanding indebtedness or future indebtedness and the limitations imposed on us by our debt agreements could have other significant adverse consequences including the following 

• our cash flow may be insufficient to meet our required principal and interest payments 

• our vulnerability to adverse economic industry or competitive developments including as a result of covid19 may be increased 

• we may be unable to borrow additional funds as needed or on favorable terms which could among other things adversely affect our ability to capitalize upon emerging acquisition opportunities including exercising our rights of first refusal and call rights described herein or meet operational needs 

• we may be unable to refinance our indebtedness at maturity or the refinancing terms may be less favorable than the terms of our original indebtedness 

• we may be forced to dispose of one or more of our properties if permitted under the lease agreements possibly on disadvantageous terms or at a loss 

• the ability of the operating partnership to distribute cash to us may be limited or prohibited which would materially and adversely affect our ability to make distributions on our common stock 

• we may fail to comply with the payment and restrictive covenants in our loan documents which would entitle the lenders to accelerate payment of outstanding loans and foreclose on any properties servicing such loans and 

• we may be unable to hedge floating rate debt counterparties may fail to honor their obligations under our hedge agreements and these agreements may not effectively hedge interest rate fluctuation risk 

if any one of these events were to occur our financial condition results of operations cash flows the market price of our common stock and our ability to satisfy our debt service obligations and to pay distributions to our stockholders could be materially and adversely affected in addition the foreclosure on our properties could create reit taxable income without accompanying cash proceeds which could result in entity level taxes to us or could adversely affect our ability to meet the distribution requirements necessary to qualify or maintain qualification as a reit 

in addition the code generally requires that a reit distribute annually to its stockholders at least 90 of its reit taxable income with certain adjustments determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gains and that it pay tax at regular corporate rates to the extent that it distributes annually less than 100 of its reit taxable income including capital gains vici golf is also subject to us federal income tax at regular corporate rates on any of its taxable income in order to maintain our status as a reit and avoid or otherwise minimize current entitylevel us federal income taxes a substantial portion of our cash flow after operating expenses and debt service will be required to be distributed to our stockholders 

because of the limitations on the amount of cash available to us after satisfying our debt service obligations and our distribution obligations to maintain our status as a reit and avoid or otherwise minimize current entitylevel us federal income taxes our ability to pursue our business and growth strategies may be limited 

any mechanic’s liens or similar liens incurred by the tenants under the lease agreements may attach to and constitute liens on our interests in the properties 

to the extent the tenants under the lease agreements make any improvements these improvements could cause mechanic’s liens or similar liens to attach to and constitute liens on our interests in the properties to the extent that mechanic’s liens or similar liens are recorded against any of the properties or any properties we may acquire in the future the holders of such mechanic’s liens or similar liens may enforce them by court action and courts may cause the applicable properties or future properties to be sold to satisfy such liens which could negatively impact our revenues results of operations cash flows and distributions to our stockholders further holders of such liens could have priority over our stockholders in the event of bankruptcy or liquidation and as a result a trustee in bankruptcy may have difficulty realizing or foreclosing on such properties in any such bankruptcy or liquidation and the amount of distributions our stockholders could receive in such bankruptcy or liquidation could be reduced 

adverse changes in our credit rating may affect our borrowing capacity and borrowing terms 

our outstanding debt is periodically rated by nationally recognized credit rating agencies the credit ratings are based upon our operating performance liquidity and leverage ratios overall financial condition and other factors viewed by the credit rating agencies as relevant to both our industry and the economic outlook our credit rating may affect the amount of capital we can access as well as the terms of any financing we obtain because we rely in part on debt financing to fund growth the absence of an investment grade credit rating or any credit rating downgrade or negative outlook may have a negative effect on our future growth 

we will have future capital needs and may not be able to obtain additional financing on favorable terms if at all 

we may incur additional indebtedness in the future to refinance our existing indebtedness or to finance newly acquired assets or for general corporate or other purposes any significant additional indebtedness could require a substantial portion of our cash flow to make interest and principal payments due on our indebtedness greater demands on our cash resources may reduce funds available to us to pay distributions make capital expenditures and acquisitions or carry out other aspects of our business and growth strategies increased indebtedness can also limit our ability to adjust rapidly to changing market conditions make us more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions and create competitive disadvantages for us compared to other companies with relatively lower debt levels increased future debt service obligations may limit our operational and financial flexibility further to the extent we were required to incur indebtedness our future interest costs would increase thereby reducing our earnings and cash flows from what they otherwise would have been 

moreover our ability to obtain additional financing and satisfy our financial obligations under indebtedness outstanding from time to time will depend upon our future operating performance which is subject to then prevailing general economic and credit market conditions including interest rate levels and the availability of credit generally and financial business and other factors many of which are beyond our control the prolonged continuation or worsening of current credit market conditions would have a material adverse effect on our ability to obtain financing on favorable terms if at all 

we may be unable to obtain additional financing or financing on favorable terms or our operating cash flow may be insufficient to satisfy our financial obligations under indebtedness outstanding from time to time if any among other things the absence of an investment grade credit rating or any credit rating downgrade or negative outlook could increase our financing costs and could limit our access to financing sources if financing is not available when needed or is available on unfavorable terms we may be unable to pursue our business and growth strategies or otherwise take advantage of new business opportunities or respond to competitive pressures any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition liquidity results of operations and prospects we may raise additional funds in the future through the issuance of equity securities and as a result our stockholders may experience significant dilution which may adversely affect the market price of 

our common stock and make it more difficult for our stockholders to sell our shares at a time and price that they deem appropriate and could impair our future ability to raise capital through an offering of our equity securities 

our ability to refinance our indebtedness as it becomes due depends on many factors some of which are beyond our control 

our ability to refinance our existing indebtedness and any future indebtedness will depend in part on our current and projected financial condition liquidity and results of operations and economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors many of these factors are beyond our control we cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance any of our indebtedness as it becomes due on commercially reasonable terms or at all if we are not able to refinance our indebtedness as it becomes due we will be obligated to pay such indebtedness with cash from our operations and we may not have sufficient cash to do so which would have a material and adverse effect on us 

covenants in our debt agreements limit our operational flexibility and a covenant breach or default could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition liquidity results of operations and prospects 

the agreements governing our indebtedness contain customary covenants including restrictions on our ability to grant liens on our assets incur indebtedness sell assets make investments engage in acquisitions mergers or consolidations engage in transactions with affiliates and pay certain dividends and other restricted payments in addition we are required to comply with certain financial maintenance covenants these restrictions could seriously harm our business by among other things limiting our operational flexibility a breach of any of these covenants or covenants under any other agreements governing our indebtedness could result in an event of default crossdefault provisions in our debt agreements could cause an event of default under one debt agreement to trigger an event of default under our other debt agreements upon the occurrence of an event of default under any of our debt agreements the lenders could elect to declare all outstanding debt under such agreements to be immediately due and payable if we were unable to repay or refinance the accelerated debt the lenders could proceed against any assets pledged to secure any debt that is secured by such assets including foreclosing on or requiring the sale of our properties and our assets may not be sufficient to repay such debt in full covenants that limit our operational flexibility as well as defaults under our debt instruments could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition liquidity results of operations and prospects 

a rise in interest rates may increase our overall interest rate expense and could adversely affect our stock price 

a rise in interest rates may increase our overall interest rate expense and have an adverse impact on our ability to pay distributions to our stockholders the risk presented by holding variable rate indebtedness can be managed or mitigated by utilizing interest rate protection products although we currently use such products with respect to a portion of our indebtedness there is no assurance that we will utilize any of these products effectively will use such products in the future or that such products will be available to us in addition in the event of a rise in interest rates new debt whether fixed or variable is likely to be more expensive which could among other things make the financing of any acquisition or investment more expensive and we may be unable to incur new debt or replace maturing debt with new debt at equal or better interest rates 

further the dividend yield on our common stock ie the annualized distributions per share of our common stock as a percentage of the market price per share of our common stock will influence the market price of such common stock thus an increase in market interest rates which are currently at low levels relative to historical rates may lead prospective purchasers of our common stock to expect a higher dividend yield in addition higher interest rates would likely increase our borrowing costs and potentially decrease our cash available for distribution thus higher market interest rates could also cause the market price of shares of our common stock to decline 

we have engaged and may engage in hedging transactions that may limit gains or result in losses 

we use derivatives to hedge certain of our liabilities and we currently have interest rate swap agreements in place as of december 31 2020 we had in place six interest rate swap agreements with third party financial institutions having an aggregate notional amount of 20 billion subsequent to year end on january 22 2021 two of our interest rate swaps with a notional balance of 5000 million matured and as a result as of the date of this form 10k 15 billion of our total indebtedness was hedged the interest rate swap transactions are designated as cash flow hedges that effectively fix the libor component of the interest rate on a portion of the outstanding debt under the term loan b facility the counterparties of these arrangements are major financial institutions however we are exposed to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties this has certain risks including losses on a hedge position which may reduce the return on our investments such losses may exceed the amount invested in such instruments in addition counterparties to a hedging arrangement could default on their obligations we may have to pay certain costs such as transaction fees or breakage costs related to hedging transactions 

we may not be able to purchase the properties subject to the ar convention center putcall agreement the centaur properties putcall agreement the las vegas strip assets rofr agreement or the horseshoe baltimore rofr agreement if we are unable to obtain additional financing in addition we may be forced to dispose of harrah’s las vegas to caesars possibly on disadvantageous terms 

pursuant to the ar convention center putcall agreement the centaur properties putcall agreement the las vegas strip assets rofr agreement and the horseshoe baltimore rofr agreement we have certain rights to purchase the properties subject to these agreements subject to the terms and conditions included in each agreement with respect to each property in order to exercise these rights and any similar rights we obtain in the future or to fulfill our obligations with respect to certain put rights we would likely be required to secure additional financing and our substantial level of indebtedness or other factors could limit our ability to do so on attractive terms or at all if we are unable to obtain financing on terms acceptable to us we may not be able to exercise these rights and acquire these properties including the caesars forum convention center or to fulfill our obligations with respect to certain put rights even if financing with acceptable terms is available to us there can be no assurance that we will exercise any of these rights further each of the transactions remains subject to the terms and conditions of the applicable agreements including with respect to due diligence applicable regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions 

the ar convention center putcall agreement also provides that if caesars exercises the convention center put right and among other things the sale of the caesars forum convention center to us does not close under certain circumstances a repurchase right in favor of caesars which if exercised would result in the sale of the harrah’s las vegas property by us to caesars such a sale may be at disadvantageous terms and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition liquidity results of operations and prospects 

the bankruptcy or insolvency of any tenant borrower or guarantor could result in the termination of the lease agreements the related guarantees or loan agreements and material losses to us 

we are subject to the credit risk of our tenants and borrowers we cannot assure you that our tenants and borrowers will not default on their obligations and fail to make payments to us in particular disruptions in the financial and credit markets local economic conditions and other factors affecting the gaming industry including the covid19 pandemic may affect our tenants’ and borrowers’ ability to obtain financing to operate their businesses or continue to profitability execute their business plans this in turn may cause our tenants and borrowers to be unable to meet their financial obligations including making rental or loan payments to us as applicable which may result in their bankruptcy or insolvency in addition in the event of a bankruptcy of our tenants borrowers or their respective guarantors any claim for damages under the applicable lease loan agreement or guarantee may not be paid in full for these and other reasons the bankruptcy of one or more of our tenants borrowers or their respective guarantors could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition liquidity results of operations and prospects 

furthermore with respect to the caesars lease agreements although the tenants’ performance and payments are guaranteed by caesars a default by the applicable tenant under the caesars lease agreements or by caesars with regard to its guarantee may cause a default under certain circumstances with regard to the entire portfolio covered by the caesars lease agreements in event of such a bankruptcy there can be no assurances that the tenants or caesars would assume the caesars lease agreements or the related guarantees and if the caesars lease agreements or guarantees were rejected the tenant or caesars as applicable may not have sufficient funds to pay the damages that would be owed to us as a result of the rejection and we might not be able to find a replacement tenant on the same or better terms 

our pursuit of investments in and acquisitions of additional properties may be unsuccessful or fail to meet our expectations 

we intend to continue to pursue acquisitions of additional properties and seek acquisitions investments and other strategic opportunities accordingly we may often be engaged in evaluating potential transactions and other strategic alternatives in addition from time to time we may engage in discussions that may result in one or more transactions although there is uncertainty that any of these discussions will result in definitive agreements or the completion of any transaction we may devote a significant amount of our management resources to such a transaction which could negatively impact our operations we may incur significant costs in connection with seeking acquisitions or other strategic opportunities regardless of whether the transaction is completed and to the extent applicable in combining our operations if such a transaction is completed 

we operate in a highly competitive industry and face competition from other reits investment companies private equity firms and hedge funds sovereign funds lenders gaming companies and other investors some of whom are significantly larger and have greater resources access to capital and lower costs of capital increased competition will make it more challenging to identify and successfully capitalize on acquisition opportunities that meet our investment objectives if we cannot identify and purchase a sufficient quantity of gaming properties and other experiential properties at favorable prices or if we are unable to 

finance acquisitions on commercially favorable terms our business financial condition liquidity results of operations and prospects could be materially and adversely affected additionally the fact that we must distribute 90 of our reit taxable income in order to maintain our qualification as a reit may limit our ability to rely upon rental payments from our leased properties or subsequently acquired properties in order to finance acquisitions as a result if debt or equity financing is not available on acceptable terms further acquisitions might be limited or curtailed 

investments in and acquisitions of gaming properties and other experiential properties entail risks associated with real estate investments generally including that the investment’s performance will fail to meet expectations that the cost estimates for necessary property improvements will prove inaccurate or the operator or manager will underperform 

further even if we were able to acquire or invest in additional properties in the future there is no guarantee that such properties would be able to maintain their historical performance which may prevent the ability of our tenants to pay the partial or total amount of the required lease payments under the respective lease agreements or our borrowers to fulfill their payment obligations under the applicable agreement in addition our financing of these acquisitions and investments could negatively impact our cash flows and liquidity require us to incur substantial debt or involve the issuance of substantial new equity which would be dilutive to existing stockholders in addition we cannot assure you that we will be successful in implementing our business and growth strategies or that any expansion will improve operating results the failure to identify and acquire or invest in new properties effectively or the failure of any acquired properties to perform as expected could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition liquidity results of operations and prospects and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders 

we may sell or divest different properties or assets after an evaluation of our portfolio of businesses such sales or divestitures could affect our costs revenues results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

from time to time we may evaluate our properties and may as a result sell or attempt to sell divest or spinoff different properties or assets subject to the terms of the lease agreements for example in 2020 we together with caesars sold harrah’s reno and bally’s atlantic city and entered into definitive agreements to sell harrah’s louisiana downs these sales or divestitures could affect our costs revenues results of operations financial condition liquidity and our ability to comply with financial covenants divestitures have inherent risks including possible delays in closing transactions including potential difficulties in obtaining regulatory approvals the risk of lowerthanexpected sales proceeds for the divested businesses and potential postclosing claims for indemnification in addition current economic conditions at the time and relatively illiquid real estate markets may result in fewer potential bidders and unsuccessful sales efforts 

our properties and the properties securing our loans are subject to risks from natural disasters such as earthquakes hurricanes severe weather and terrorism 

our properties and our borrowers’ properties secured as collateral including the caesars forum convention center are located in areas that may be subject to natural disasters such as earthquakes and extreme weather conditions including but not limited to hurricanes such natural disasters or extreme weather conditions may interrupt operations at the casinos damage our properties and reduce the number of customers who visit our facilities in such areas a severe earthquake could damage or destroy our properties in addition our operations could be adversely impacted by a drought or other cause of water shortage a severe drought of extensive duration experienced in las vegas or in the other regions in which we operate could adversely affect the business and financial results at our properties although the tenants and borrowers as applicable are required to maintain both property and business interruption insurance coverage such coverage is subject to deductibles and limits on maximum benefits including limitation on the coverage period for business interruption and we cannot assure you that we or our tenants will be able to fully insure such losses or fully collect if at all on claims resulting from such natural disasters while the lease agreements and loan agreements require and new lease agreements and loan agreements are expected to require that comprehensive insurance and hazard insurance be maintained by the tenants and borrowers as applicable there are certain types of losses generally of a catastrophic nature such as earthquakes hurricanes and floods that may be uninsurable or not economically insurable insurance coverage may not be sufficient to pay the full current market value or current replacement cost of a loss inflation changes in building codes and ordinances environmental considerations and other factors also might make it infeasible to use insurance proceeds to replace the property after such property has been damaged or destroyed under such circumstances the insurance proceeds received might not be adequate to restore the economic position with respect to such property if we experience a loss that is uninsured or that exceeds our policy coverage limits we could lose the capital invested in the damaged properties as well as the anticipated future cash flows from those properties 

terrorist attacks or other acts of violence may result in declining economic activity which could harm the demand for goods and services offered by our tenants and the value of our properties or collateral and might adversely affect the value of an investment in our common stock such a resulting decrease in retail demand could make it difficult for us to renew or release our properties to suitable creditworthy tenants at lease rates equal to or above historical rates terrorist activities or violence 

also could directly affect the value of our properties through damage destruction or loss and the availability of insurance for such acts or of insurance generally might be lower or cost more which could increase our operating expenses and adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows to the extent that any of our tenants or borrowers are affected by future terrorist attacks or violence its business similarly could be adversely affected including the ability of our tenants or borrowers to continue to meet their obligations to us these events might erode business and consumer confidence and spending and might result in increased volatility in national and international financial markets and economies any one of these events might decrease demand for real estate decrease or delay the occupancy of our new or redeveloped properties and limit our access to capital or increase our cost of raising capital 

in addition the regional master lease agreement and the las vegas master lease agreement allow the tenant to remove a property from such lease agreement and each of our other lease agreements may be terminated by the applicable tenant if i a casualty event occurs a in the case of the caesars lease agreements during the final two years of the term and b in the case of the hard rock cincinnati lease agreement the century portfolio lease agreement and the jack clevelandthistledown lease agreement the final year of the term and ii the cost to rebuild or restore the applicable property in connection with a casualty event exceeds 25 or in the case of the century portfolio lease agreement 50 of such property’s total property fair market value similarly if a condemnation event occurs that renders a facility unsuitable for its primary intended use the applicable tenants may remove the property from the regional master lease agreement and may terminate the las vegas master lease agreement the joliet lease agreement the hard rock cincinnati lease agreement the century portfolio lease agreement or the jack clevelandthistledown lease agreement as the case may be the penn national lease agreements allows the tenants to terminate their respective leases during the final year of the lease term if 50 or more of the square feet of the improvements are destroyed by a casualty event such that the improvements are rendered substantially untenantable if a condemnation event occurs that renders margaritaville or greektown reasonably uneconomical for the operation of the improvements thereon on a commercially practicable basis for their permitted use as rentable facilities capable of producing a fair and reasonable net income therefrom the tenant may terminate the margaritaville lease agreement or the greektown lease agreement respectively if a property is removed from the regional master lease agreement or if the las vegas master lease agreement the joliet lease agreement the penn national lease agreements the hard rock cincinnati lease agreement the century portfolio lease agreement or the jack thistledowncleveland lease agreement as the case may be is terminated we will lose the rent associated with the related facility which would have a negative impact on our financial results in this event following termination of the lease of a property even if we are able to restore the affected property we could be limited to selling or leasing such property to a new tenant in order to obtain an alternate source of revenue which may not happen on comparable terms or at all 

changes in building andor zoning laws may require us to update a property in the event of recapture or prevent us from fully restoring a property in the event of a substantial casualty loss andor require us to meet additional or more stringent construction requirements 

due to changes in among other things applicable building and zoning laws ordinances and codes that may affect certain of our properties that have come into effect after the initial construction of the properties certain properties may not comply fully with current building andor zoning laws including electrical fire health and safety codes and regulations use lot coverage parking and setback requirements but may qualify as permitted nonconforming uses although the lease agreements require our tenants to pay for and ensure continued compliance with applicable law there is no assurance that future leases will be negotiated on the same basis or that our tenants will make any changes required by the terms of the lease agreements andor any future leases we may enter into in addition such changes may limit a tenant’s ability to restore the premises of a property to its previous condition in the event of a substantial casualty loss with respect to the property or the ability to refurbish expand or renovate such property to remain compliant or increase the cost of construction in order to comply with changes in building or zoning codes and regulations if a tenant is unable to restore a property to its prior use after a substantial casualty loss or is required to comply with more stringent building or zoning codes and regulations we may be unable to release the space at a comparable effective rent or sell the property at an acceptable price which may materially and adversely affect our business financial condition liquidity results of operations and prospects 

certain properties are subject to restrictions pursuant to reciprocal easement agreements operating agreements or similar agreements 

many of the properties that we own or that serve as collateral under our loan agreements are and properties that we may acquire or lend against in the future may be subject to use restrictions andor operational requirements imposed pursuant to ground leases restrictive covenants or conditions reciprocal easement agreements or operating agreements or other instruments that could among other things adversely affect our ability to lease space to third parties enforce our rights as a lender and otherwise realize additional value from these properties such property restrictions could include the following limitations on alterations changes expansions or reconfiguration of properties limitations on use of properties limitations affecting parking requirements or restrictions on exterior or interior signage or facades in certain cases consent of the other party or parties to 

such agreements may be required when altering reconfiguring expanding or redeveloping failure to secure such consents when necessary may harm our ability to execute leasing strategies which could adversely affect us 

the loss of the services of key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business 

our success and ability to grow depends in large part upon the leadership and performance of our executive management team particularly our chief executive officer our president and chief operating officer our chief financial officer and our general counsel any unforeseen loss of our executive officers’ services or any negative market or industry perception with respect to them or arising from their loss could have a material adverse effect on our business we do not have key man or similar life insurance policies covering members of our senior management we have employment agreements with our executive officers but these agreements do not guarantee that any given executive will remain with us and there can be no assurance that any such officers will remain with us in addition the appointment or replacement of certain key members of our executive management team is subject to regulatory approvals based upon suitability determinations by gaming regulatory authorities in the jurisdictions where our properties are located if any of our executive officers is found unsuitable by any such gaming regulatory authorities or if we otherwise lose their services we would have to find alternative candidates and may not be able to successfully manage our business or achieve our business objectives 

environmental compliance costs and liabilities associated with real estate properties owned by us may materially impair the value of those investments 

as an owner of real property we are subject to various federal state and local environmental and health and safety laws and regulations although we do not operate or manage most of our properties as they are subject to triplenet leases we may be held primarily or jointly and severally liable for costs relating to the investigation and cleanup of any property from which there has been a release or threatened release of a regulated material as well as other affected properties regardless of whether we knew of or caused the release and to preserve claims for damages further some environmental laws create a lien on a contaminated site in favor of the government for damages and the costs the government incurs in connection with such contamination 

although under the lease agreements the tenants are required to indemnify us for certain environmental liabilities including environmental liabilities it causes the amount of such liabilities could exceed the financial ability of the applicable tenants or guarantors to indemnify us in addition the presence of contamination or the failure to remediate contamination may adversely affect our ability to sell or lease our properties or to borrow using our properties as collateral 

we may be required to contribute insurance proceeds with respect to casualty events at our properties to the lenders under our debt financing agreements 

in the event that we were to receive insurance proceeds with respect to a casualty event at any of our properties we may be required under the terms of our debt financing agreements to contribute all or a portion of those proceeds to the repayment of such debt which may prevent us from restoring such properties to their prior state if the remainder of the proceeds after any such required repayment were insufficient to make the repairs necessary to restore the damaged properties to a condition substantially equivalent to its state immediately prior to the casualty we may not have sufficient liquidity to otherwise fund these repairs and may be required to obtain additional financing which could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition liquidity results of operations and prospects 

climate change may adversely affect our business 

climate change including rising sea levels extreme weather and changes in precipitation and temperature may result in physical damage to a decrease in demand for andor a decrease in rent from and value of our properties located in the areas affected by these conditions for example we own a number of assets in lowlying areas close to sea level making those assets susceptible to damage or other negative effects resulting from a rise in sea level if sea levels were to rise we may incur material costs to protect such lowlying assets to the extent not covered by our tenants under the terms of our leases or may sustain damage a decrease in value or total loss of such assets 

in addition climate change may result in reduced economic activity in these areas which could harm the operations of our tenants and reduce the demand at our properties which could reduce the rent payable to us under our triplenet leases and make it difficult for us to renew or release our properties on favorable lease terms or at all  furthermore our insurance premiums may increase as a result of the threat of climate change or the effects of climate change may not be covered by our insurance policies in addition changes in federal and state legislation and regulations on climate change could result in increased capital expenditures to improve the energy efficiency of our existing properties or other related aspects of our properties in order to comply with such regulations or otherwise adapt to climate change any of the above could have a material and adverse effect on us 

if our separation from ceoc together with certain related transactions does not qualify as a transaction that is generally taxfree for us federal income tax purposes ceoc could be subject to significant tax liabilities and in certain circumstances we could be required to indemnify ceoc for material taxes pursuant to indemnification obligations under the tax matters agreement 

the irs issued a private letter ruling with respect to certain issues relevant to our separation from ceoc including relating to the separation and certain related transactions as taxfree for us federal income tax purposes under certain provisions of the code the irs ruling does not address certain requirements for taxfree treatment of the separation ceoc received from its tax advisors a tax opinion substantially to the effect that with respect to such requirements on which the irs did not rule such requirements should be satisfied the irs ruling and the tax opinion that ceoc received relied on among other things certain representations assumptions and undertakings including those relating to the past and future conduct of our business and the irs ruling and the opinion would not be valid if such representations assumptions and undertakings were incorrect in any material respect 

notwithstanding the irs ruling and the tax opinion the irs could determine the separation should be treated as a taxable transaction for us federal income tax purposes if it determines any of the representations assumptions or undertakings that were included in the request for the irs ruling are false or have been violated or if it disagrees with the conclusions in the opinion that are not covered by the irs ruling 

if the reorganization fails to qualify for taxfree treatment in general ceoc would be subject to tax as if it had sold our assets to us in a taxable sale for their fair market value and ceoc’s creditors who received shares of our common stock pursuant to the plan of reorganization would be subject to tax as if they had received a taxable distribution in respect of their claims equal to the fair market value of such shares 

under the tax matters agreement that we entered into with caesars we generally are required to indemnify caesars against any tax resulting from the separation to the extent that such tax resulted from certain of our representations or undertakings being incorrect or violated our indemnification obligations to caesars are not limited by any maximum amount as a result if we are required to indemnify caesars or such other persons under the circumstances set forth in the tax matters agreement we may be subject to substantial liabilities 

risks related to our status as a reit 

we may not qualify or maintain our qualification as a reit 

we elected to be taxed as a reit for us federal income tax purposes commencing with our taxable year ended december 31 2017 and expect to operate in a manner that will allow us to continue to be classified as such the code generally requires that a reit distribute annually to its stockholders at least 90 of its reit taxable income with certain adjustments determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gains and that it pay tax at regular corporate rates to the extent that it distributes annually less than 100 of its reit taxable income including capital gains in addition a reit is required to pay a 4 nondeductible excise tax on the amount if any by which the distributions it makes in a calendar year are less than the sum of 85 of its ordinary income 95 of its capital gain net income and 100 of its undistributed income from prior years as a result in order to avoid or otherwise minimize current entity level us federal income taxes a substantial portion of our cash flow after operating expenses and debt service will be required to be distributed to our stockholders 

if we were to fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year we would be subject to us federal income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates and dividends paid to our stockholders would not be deductible by us in computing our reit taxable income any resulting corporate tax liability could be substantial and would reduce the amount of cash available for distribution to our stockholders which in turn could have an adverse impact on the market price of our common stock unless we were entitled to relief under certain code provisions we also would be disqualified from reelecting to be taxed as a reit for the four taxable years following the year in which we failed to qualify as a reit as a result the amount available for distribution to holders of equity securities that would otherwise receive dividends would be reduced for the year or years involved furthermore the us federal income tax consequences of distributions and sales of our shares to certain of our stockholders could be adversely impacted if we were to fail to qualify as a reit 

finally our qualification to be taxed as a reit will depend on our satisfaction of certain asset income organizational distribution stockholder ownership and other requirements on a continuing basis our ability to satisfy the asset tests depends upon our analysis of the characterization and fair market values of our assets some of which are not susceptible to a precise determination and for which we may not obtain independent appraisals any failure to qualify to be taxed as a reit or failure to remain to be qualified to be taxed as a reit would have a material and adverse effect on us 

qualification to be taxed as a reit involves highly technical and complex provisions of the code and violations of these provisions could jeopardize our reit qualification 

qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex code provisions for which only limited judicial and administrative authorities exist even a technical or inadvertent violation could jeopardize our reit qualification our qualification as a reit depends on our satisfaction of certain asset income organizational distribution stockholder ownership and other requirements on a continuing basis in addition our ability to satisfy the requirements to qualify as a reit may depend in part on the actions of third parties over which we have no control or only limited influence including in cases where we own an equity interest in an entity that is classified as a partnership for us federal income tax purposes 

we may in the future choose to pay dividends in the form of our own common stock in which case stockholders may be required to pay income taxes in excess of the cash dividends they receive 

we may seek in the future to distribute taxable dividends that are payable in cash or our common stock taxable stockholders receiving such dividends will be required to include the full amount of the dividend as ordinary income to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits for us federal income tax purposes as to which noncorporate stockholders will generally be eligible for a deduction equal to 20 of such distributions as a result stockholders receiving dividends in the form of common stock may be required to pay income taxes with respect to such dividends in excess of the cash dividends received if any if a us stockholder sells the common stock that it receives as a dividend in order to pay this tax the sales proceeds may be less than the amount included in income with respect to the dividend depending on the market price of our common stock at the time of the sale in addition in such case a us stockholder could have a capital loss with respect to the common stock sold that could not be used to offset such dividend income moreover with respect to certain nonus stockholders we may be required to withhold us federal income tax with respect to such dividends including in respect of all or a portion of such dividend that is payable in common stock furthermore such a taxable share dividend could be viewed as equivalent to a reduction in our cash distributions and that factor as well as the possibility that a significant number of our stockholders determine to sell our common stock in order to pay taxes owed on dividends may put downward pressure on the market price of our common stock 

changes to the us federal income tax laws including the enactment of certain tax reform measures could have a material and adverse effect on us 

us federal income tax laws governing reits and other corporations and the administrative interpretations of those laws may be amended at any time potentially with retroactive effect we cannot predict whether when or to what extent new us federal tax laws regulations interpretations or rulings will be issued prospective investors are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding the effect of potential changes to the us federal tax laws on an investment in our common stock 

changes to the us federal income tax laws could have a material and adverse effect on us for example certain changes in law pursuant to the law known as the tax cuts and jobs act could reduce the relative competitive advantage of operating as a reit as compared with operating as a c corporation including by 

• reducing the rate of tax applicable to individuals and c corporations which could reduce the relative attractiveness of the generally single level of taxation on reit distributions 

• permitting immediate expensing of capital expenditures which could likewise reduce the relative attractiveness of the reit taxation regime and 

• limiting the deductibility of interest expense which could increase the distribution requirement of reits though reits can generally elect out of the limitation 

we could fail to qualify to be taxed as a reit if income we receive from our tenants is not treated as qualifying income 

under applicable provisions of the code we will not be treated as a reit unless we satisfy various requirements including requirements relating to the sources of our gross income rents received or accrued by us from our tenants will not be treated as qualifying rent for purposes of these requirements if the leases are not respected as true leases for us federal income tax purposes and instead are treated as service contracts joint ventures financings or some other type of arrangement if some or all of our leases are not respected as true leases for us federal income tax purposes we may fail to qualify to be taxed as a reit furthermore our qualification as a reit will depend on our satisfaction of certain asset income organizational distribution stockholder ownership and other requirements on a continuing basis our ability to satisfy the asset tests depends upon our analysis of the characterization and fair market values of our assets some of which are not susceptible to a precise determination and for which we may not obtain independent appraisals 

in addition subject to certain exceptions rents received or accrued by us from any tenant or affiliated tenants will not be treated as qualifying rent for purposes of these requirements if we or an actual or constructive owner of 10 or more of our stock actually or constructively owns 10 or more of the total combined voting power of all classes of such tenant’s stock entitled to vote or 10 or more of the total value of all classes of such tenant’s stock our charter provides restrictions on ownership and transfer of our shares of stock including restrictions on such ownership or transfer that would cause the rents received or accrued by us from tenants to be treated as nonqualifying rent for purposes of the reit gross income requirements nevertheless there can be no assurance that such restrictions will be effective in ensuring that rents received or accrued by us from tenants will not be treated as qualifying rent for purposes of reit qualification requirements 

reit distribution requirements could adversely affect our ability to execute our business plan 

we generally must distribute annually to our stockholders at least 90 of our reit taxable income with certain adjustments determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding any net capital gains in order for us to qualify as a reit so that us federal corporate income tax does not apply to our earnings that we distribute to the extent that we satisfy this distribution requirement and qualify for taxation as a reit but distribute less than 100 of our reit taxable income determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and including any net capital gains we will be subject to us federal corporate income tax on any undistributed portion of such taxable income in addition we will be subject to a 4 nondeductible excise tax if the actual amount that we distribute to our stockholders in a calendar year is less than a minimum amount specified under us federal tax laws we intend to make distributions to our stockholders to comply with the reit requirements of the code and to avoid or otherwise minimize paying entity level federal or excise tax other than at any taxable reit subsidiary of ours we may generate taxable income greater than our income for financial reporting purposes prepared in accordance with gaap further we may generate taxable income greater than our cash flow from operations after operating expenses and debt service as a result of differences in timing between the recognition of taxable income and the actual receipt of cash or the effect of nondeductible capital expenditures the creation of reserves or required debt or amortization payments in order to avoid or otherwise minimize current entity level us federal income taxes we will generally be required to distribute sufficient cash flow after operating expenses and debt service payments to satisfy the reit distribution requirements while we intend to make distributions to our stockholders to comply with the reit requirements of the code we may not have sufficient liquidity to meet the reit distribution requirements if our cash flow is insufficient to satisfy the reit distribution requirements we could be required to raise capital on unfavorable terms sell assets at disadvantageous prices distribute amounts that would otherwise be invested in future acquisitions or issue dividends in the form of shares of our common stock to make distributions sufficient to enable us to pay out enough of our reit taxable income to satisfy the reit distribution requirement and to avoid or otherwise minimize corporate income tax and the 4 excise tax in a particular year these alternatives could increase our costs or change the value of our equity thus compliance with the reit requirements may hinder our ability to grow which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

even if we qualify as a reit we may face other tax liabilities that reduce our cash flow 

even if we qualify for taxation as a reit we may be subject to certain us federal state and local taxes on our income and assets including taxes on any undistributed income and state or local income property and transfer taxes for example in order to meet the reit qualification requirements we currently hold and expect in the future to hold some of our assets and conduct certain of our activities through one or more taxable reit subsidiaries or other subsidiary corporations that will be subject to federal state and local corporatelevel income taxes as regular c corporations ie corporations generally subject to corporatelevel income tax under subchapter c of chapter 1 the code in addition we may incur a 100 excise tax on transactions with a taxable reit subsidiary if they are not conducted on an arm’s length basis any of these taxes would decrease cash available for distribution to our stockholders 

complying with reit requirements may cause us to liquidate or forgo otherwise attractive opportunities and limit our expansion opportunities 

to qualify as a reit for us federal income tax purposes we must continually satisfy tests concerning among other things our sources of income the nature of our investments in real estate and related assets the amounts we distribute to our stockholders and the ownership of our stock we may also be required to make distributions to stockholders at disadvantageous times or when we do not have funds readily available for distribution 

as a reit we must ensure that at the end of each calendar quarter at least 75 of the value of our assets consists of cash cash items government securities and “real estate assets” as defined in the code including certain mortgage loans and securities the remainder of our investments other than government securities qualified real estate assets and securities issued by a taxable reit subsidiary generally cannot include more than 10 of the outstanding voting securities of any one issuer or more than 10 of the total value of the outstanding securities of any one issuer in addition in general no more than 5 of the value of our total assets other than government securities qualified real estate assets and securities issued by a taxable reit 

subsidiary can consist of the securities of any one issuer and no more than 20 of the value of our total assets can be represented by securities of one or more taxable reit subsidiaries in addition not more than 25 of our total assets may be represented by debt instruments issued by publicly offered reits that are “nonqualified” debt instruments if we fail to comply with these requirements at the end of any calendar quarter we must correct the failure within 30 days after the end of the calendar quarter or qualify for certain statutory relief provisions to avoid losing our reit qualification and suffering adverse tax consequences as a result we may be required to liquidate from our portfolio or contribute to a taxable reit subsidiary or forgo otherwise attractive investments in order to maintain our qualification as a reit these actions could have the effect of reducing our income and amounts available for distribution to our stockholders in addition to the asset tests set forth above to qualify as a reit we must continually satisfy tests concerning among other things the sources of our income the amounts we distribute to our stockholders and the ownership of our stock we may be unable to pursue investments that would be otherwise advantageous to us in order to satisfy the sourceofincome or assetdiversification requirements for qualifying as a reit thus compliance with the reit requirements may hinder our ability to make certain attractive investments 

we may be subject to builtin gains tax on the disposition of certain of our properties 

if we acquire certain properties in taxdeferred transactions which properties were held by one or more c corporations before they were held by us we may be subject to a builtin gain tax on future disposition of such properties this is the case with respect to all or substantially all of the properties acquired from ceoc pursuant to the formation transactions as well as certain other properties we have acquired and may acquire in the future if we dispose of any such properties during the fiveyear period following acquisition of the properties from the respective c corporation ie during the fiveyear period following ownership of such properties by a reit we will be subject to us federal income tax and applicable state and local taxes at the highest corporate tax rates on any gain recognized from the disposition of such properties to the extent of the excess of the fair market value of the properties on the date that they were contributed to or acquired by us in a taxdeferred transaction over the adjusted tax basis of such properties on such date which are referred to as builtin gains similarly if we recognize certain other income considered to be builtin income during the fiveyear period following the property acquisitions described above we could be subject to us federal tax under the builtingains tax rules we would be subject to this corporatelevel tax liability without the benefit of the deduction for dividends paid even if we qualify and maintain our status as a reit any recognized builtin gain will retain its character as ordinary income or capital gain and will be taken into account in determining reit taxable income and the reit distribution requirements any tax on the recognized builtin gain will reduce reit taxable income we may choose to forego otherwise attractive opportunities to sell assets in a taxable transaction during the fiveyear builtingain recognition period in order to avoid this builtingain tax however there can be no assurance that such a taxable transaction will not occur the amount of any such builtingain tax could be material and the resulting tax liability could have a negative effect on our cash flow and limit our ability to pay distributions required to qualify and maintain our status as a reit 

complying with reit requirements may limit our ability to hedge effectively and may cause us to incur tax liabilities 

the reit provisions of the code substantially limit our ability to hedge our assets and liabilities income from certain hedging transactions that we may enter into to manage risk of interest rate changes with respect to borrowings made or to be made to acquire or carry real estate assets or from transactions to manage risk of currency fluctuations with respect to any item of income or gain that satisfy the reit gross income tests including gain from the termination of such a transaction does not constitute “gross income” for purposes of the 75 or 95 gross income tests that apply to reits provided that certain identification requirements are met to the extent that we enter into other types of hedging transactions or fail to properly identify such transaction as a hedge the income is likely to be treated as nonqualifying income for purposes of both of the gross income tests as a result of these rules we may be required to limit our use of advantageous hedging techniques or implement those hedges through a taxable reit subsidiary this could increase the cost of our hedging activities because the taxable reit subsidiary may be subject to tax on gains or expose us to greater risks associated with changes in interest rates that we would otherwise want to bear in addition losses in the taxable reit subsidiary will generally not provide any tax benefit except that such losses could theoretically be carried back or forward against past or future taxable income of the taxable reit subsidiary 

if we are required to make a purging distribution we may pay such purging distribution in a combination of common stock and cash 

in order to qualify as a reit we must distribute any “earnings and profits” as defined in the code accumulated by us during any period for which we did not qualify as a reit or by any entity whose accumulated earnings and profits we acquire during any period for which such entity did not qualify as a reit such distribution requirement applied to any earnings and profits that were allocated from ceoc to us in connection with the formation transactions by the end of the first taxable year in which we elected reit status based on our analysis we do not believe that any earnings and profits were allocated to us in connection with the formation transactions or any other transaction to which we are party and therefore did not make a purging distribution and do not currently intend to make any purging distribution with respect to transactions to which we are a party if 

we are required to make a purging distribution in the future we may pay the purging distribution to our stockholders in a combination of cash and shares of our common stock each of our stockholders will be permitted to elect to receive the stockholder’s entire entitlement under the purging distribution in either cash or shares of our common stock subject to a cash limitation if our stockholders elect to receive a portion of cash in excess of the cash limitation each such electing stockholder will receive a pro rata portion of cash corresponding to the stockholder’s respective entitlement under the purging distribution declaration the irs has issued a revenue procedure that provides that so long as a reit complied with certain provisions therein certain distributions that are paid partly in cash and partly in stock will be treated as taxable dividends that would satisfy the reit distribution requirements and qualify for the dividends paid deduction for us federal income tax purposes in a purging distribution if any a stockholder of our common stock will be required to report dividend income equal to the amount of cash and common stock received as a result of the purging distribution even though we may distribute no cash or only nominal amounts of cash to such stockholder 

the cash available for distribution to stockholders may not be sufficient to pay dividends at expected levels nor can we assure you of our ability to make distributions in the future we may use borrowed funds to make distributions 

if cash available for distribution is less than the amount necessary to make cash distributions our inability to make the expected distributions could result in a decrease in the market price of our common stock all distributions will be made at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon various factors including but not limited to our historical and projected financial condition cash flows results of operations and reit taxable income limitations contained in financing instruments debt service requirements operating cash inflows and outflows including capital expenditures and acquisitions limitations on our ability to use cash generated in one or more taxable reit subsidiaries if any to fund distributions and applicable law we may not be able to make distributions in the future in addition some of our distributions may include a return of capital to the extent that we decide to make distributions in excess of our current and accumulated earnings and profits in the future such distributions would generally be considered a return of capital for federal income tax purposes to the extent of the holder’s adjusted tax basis in their shares a return of capital is not taxable but it has the effect of reducing the holder’s adjusted tax basis in our common stock to the extent that such distributions exceed the adjusted tax basis of a holder’s shares they will be treated as gain from the sale or exchange of such stock if we borrow to fund distributions our future interest costs would increase thereby reducing our earnings and cash available for distribution from what they otherwise would have been 

for purposes of satisfying the minimum distribution requirement to qualify for and maintain reit status our reit taxable income will be calculated without reference to our cash flow consequently under certain circumstances we may not have available cash to make our required distributions and we may need to raise additional equity or debt in order to fund our intended distributions or we may distribute a portion of our distributions in the form of our common stock or debt instruments which could result in dilution or higher leverage while the irs has issued a revenue procedure indicating that certain distributions that are made partly in cash and partly in stock will be treated as taxable dividends that would satisfy that reit annual distribution requirement and qualify for the dividends paid deduction for us federal income tax purposes no assurance can be provided that we will be able to satisfy the requirements of the revenue procedure therefore it is unclear whether and to what extent we will be able to make taxable dividends payable inkind in addition to the extent we were to make distributions that include our common stock or debt instruments a stockholder of ours will be required to report dividend income as a result of such distributions even though we distributed no cash or only nominal amounts of cash to such stockholder 

the us federal income tax treatment of the cash that we might receive from cash settlement of the june 2020 forward sale agreement is unclear and could jeopardize our ability to meet the reit qualification requirements 

in the event that we elect to settle the june 2020 forward sale agreement for cash and the settlement price is below the applicable forward sale price we would be entitled to receive a cash payment from the forward purchasers under section 1032 of the code generally no gains and losses are recognized by a corporation in dealing in its own shares including pursuant to a “securities futures contract” as defined in the code by reference to the exchange act although we believe that any amount received by us in exchange for our shares of common stock would qualify for the exemption under section 1032 of the code because it is not entirely clear whether the june 2020 forward sale agreement qualifies as a “securities futures contract” the us federal income tax treatment of any cash settlement payment we receive is uncertain in the event that we recognize a significant gain from the cash settlement of the june 2020 forward sale agreement we might not be able to satisfy the gross income requirements applicable to reits under the code if we were to fail to satisfy one or both of the gross income tests for any taxable year we may nevertheless qualify as a reit for such year if we were entitled to relief under certain provisions of the code if these relief provisions were inapplicable we would not qualify as a reit even if these relief provisions were to apply a tax based on the amount of the relevant reit’s nonqualifying income would be imposed 

risks related to our organizational structure 

vici is a holding company with no direct operations and relies on distributions received from the operating partnership to make distributions to its stockholders 

vici is a holding company and conducts its operations through subsidiaries including the operating partnership and vici golf vici does not have apart from the units that it owns in the operating partnership and vici golf any independent operations as a result vici relies on distributions from its operating partnership to make any distributions to its stockholders it might declare on its common stock and to meet any of its obligations including any tax liability on taxable income allocated to it from the operating partnership which might not be able to make distributions to vici equal to the tax on such allocated taxable income in turn the ability of subsidiaries of the operating partnership to make distributions to the operating partnership and therefore the ability of the operating partnership to make distributions to vici depends on the operating results of these subsidiaries and the operating partnership and on the terms of any financing arrangements they have entered into in addition because vici is a holding company claims of common stockholders of vici are structurally subordinated to all existing and future liabilities and other obligations whether or not for borrowed money and any preferred equity of the operating partnership and its subsidiaries therefore in the event of our bankruptcy liquidation or reorganization vici’s assets and those of the operating partnership and its subsidiaries will be available to satisfy the claims of vici common stockholders only after all of vici’s the operating partnership’s and its subsidiaries’ liabilities and other obligations and any preferred equity of any of them have been paid in full 

the operating partnership may in connection with its acquisition of additional properties or otherwise issue additional common units or preferred units to third parties such issuances would reduce vici’s ownership in the operating partnership because stockholders of vici do not directly own common units or preferred units of the operating partnership they do not have any voting rights with respect to any such issuances or other partnership level activities of the operating partnership 

our rights and the rights of our stockholders to take action against our directors and officers are limited 

the maryland general corporation law the “mgcl” provides that a director has no liability in any action based on an act of the director if he or she has acted in good faith in a manner he or she reasonably believes to be in the corporation’s best interests and with the care that an ordinarily prudent person in a like position would use under similar circumstances as permitted by the mgcl our charter limits the liability of our directors and officers to our company and our stockholders for money damages to the maximum extent permitted by maryland law under maryland law our present directors and officers will not have any liability to us or our stockholders for money damages other than liability resulting from 

• actual receipt of an improper benefit or profit in money property or services or 

• a final judgment based upon a finding that his or her action or failure to act was the result of active and deliberate dishonesty by the director or officer and was material to the cause of action adjudicated 

our charter provides that we have the power to obligate ourselves and our amended and restated bylaws obligate us to indemnify our directors and officers for actions taken by them in those capacities and to pay or reimburse their reasonable expenses in advance of final disposition of a proceeding to the maximum extent permitted by maryland law in addition we have entered into indemnification agreements with our directors and executive officers that provide for indemnification and advancement of expenses to the maximum extent permitted by maryland law as a result we and our stockholders may have more limited rights against our directors and officers than might otherwise exist under common law 

our charter and bylaws contain provisions that may delay defer or prevent an acquisition of our common stock or a change in control 

our charter and bylaws contain provisions the exercise or existence of which could delay defer or prevent a transaction or a change in control that might involve a premium price for our stockholders or otherwise be in their best interests including the following 

• our charter contains restrictions on the ownership and transfer of our stock 

in order for us to qualify as a reit no more than 50 of the value of outstanding shares of our stock may be owned beneficially or constructively by five or fewer individuals or certain other persons at any time during the last half of each taxable year “closely held” subject to certain exceptions our charter prohibits any stockholder from owning beneficially or constructively with respect to any class or series of our capital stock more than 98 in value or by number of shares whichever is more restrictive of the aggregate of the outstanding shares of such class or series of our capital stock 

the constructive ownership rules under the code are complex and may cause the outstanding stock owned by a group of related individuals or entities to be deemed to be constructively owned by one individual or entity as a result the acquisition of 98 or less of the outstanding shares of a class or series of our stock by an individual or entity could cause that individual or entity or another individual or entity to own constructively in excess of the relevant ownership limits 

among other restrictions on ownership and transfer of shares our charter also prohibits any person from owning shares of our stock that would result in our being “closely held” under section 856h of the code or otherwise cause us to fail to qualify as a reit any attempt to own or transfer shares of our common stock or of any of our other capital stock in violation of these restrictions may result in the shares being automatically transferred to a charitable trust or may be void 

our charter provides that our board may grant exceptions to the 98 ownership limit subject in each case to certain initial and ongoing conditions designed to protect our status as a reit these ownership limits may prevent a thirdparty from acquiring control of us if our board of directors does not grant an exemption from the ownership limits even if our stockholders believe the change in control is in their best interests an exemption from the 98 ownership limit has previously been granted to certain stockholders and our board may in the future provide exceptions to the ownership limit for other stockholders subject to the aforementioned initial and ongoing conditions designed to protect our status as a reit 

• our board of directors has the power to cause us to issue and authorize additional shares of our capital stock without stockholder approval 

our charter authorizes us to issue authorized but unissued shares of common or preferred stock in addition to the shares of common stock issued and outstanding in addition our board of directors may without stockholder approval amend our charter to increase the aggregate number of our shares of stock or the number of shares of stock of any class or series that we have authority to issue and classify or reclassify any unissued shares of common or preferred stock and set the preferences rights and other terms of the classified or reclassified shares as a result our board of directors may establish a class or series of shares of common or preferred stock that could delay or prevent a transaction or a change in control that might involve a premium price for our shares of common stock or otherwise be in the best interests of our stockholders 

certain provisions of maryland law may limit the ability of a third party to acquire control of us 

certain provisions of the mgcl may have the effect of inhibiting a third party from acquiring us or of impeding a change of control under circumstances that otherwise could provide our common stockholders with the opportunity to realize a premium over the then prevailing market price of such shares including 

• “business combination” provisions that subject to limitations a prohibit certain business combinations between an “interested stockholder” defined generally as any person who beneficially owns 10 or more of the voting power of our outstanding shares of voting stock or an affiliate or associate of ours who at any time within the twoyear period immediately prior to the date in question was the beneficial owner of 10 or more of the voting power of our then outstanding shares of our common stock or an affiliate of any interested stockholder and us for five years after the most recent date on which the stockholder becomes an interested stockholder and b thereafter impose two supermajority stockholder voting requirements on these combinations and 

• “control share” provisions that provide that holders of “control shares” of our company defined as voting shares of stock that if aggregated with all other shares of stock owned or controlled by the acquirer except solely by virtue of a revocable proxy would entitle the acquirer to exercise one of three increasing ranges of voting power in electing directors acquired in a “control share acquisition” defined as the direct or indirect acquisition of ownership or control of “control shares” have no voting rights with respect to “control shares” except to the extent approved by our stockholders by the affirmative vote of at least twothirds of all of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter excluding all votes entitled to be cast by the acquirer of control shares and by any of our officers and employees who are also our directors 

our charter provides that notwithstanding any other provision of our charter or our bylaws the maryland business combination act title 3 subtitle 6 of the mgcl does not apply to any business combination between us and any interested stockholder or any affiliate of any interested stockholder of ours and that we expressly elect not to be governed by the provisions of section 3602 of the mgcl in whole or in part pursuant to the mgcl our bylaws contain a provision exempting from the maryland control share acquisition act any and all acquisitions by any person of shares of our stock there can be no assurance that any of these provisions of our charter or bylaws will not be amended or eliminated at any time in the future 

additionally provisions of title 3 subtitle 8 of the mgcl permit a maryland corporation such as the company by action of its board of directors and without stockholder approval and regardless of what is provided in the charter or bylaws to elect to avail itself of certain takeover defenses such as a classified board unless the charter or a resolution adopted by the board of 

directors prohibits such election our charter provides that we are prohibited from making any such election unless first approved by our stockholders by the affirmative vote of a majority of all votes entitled to be cast on the matter

provisions contained in the june 2020 forward sale agreement could result in substantial dilution to our earnings per share or result in substantial cash payment obligations 

the forward purchaser under the june 2020 forward sale agreement has the right to accelerate the june 2020 forward sale agreement with respect to all or in certain cases any portion of the transaction under the june 2020 forward sale agreement that the forward purchaser determines is affected by an event described below and require us to settle on a date specified by the forward purchaser if 

• we declare any dividend issue or distribution on our common stock payable in x cash in excess of specified amounts y securities of another company that we acquire or own directly or indirectly as a result of a spinoff or similar transaction or z any other type of securities other than our common stock rights warrants or other assets for payment at less than the prevailing market price 

• certain ownership thresholds applicable to the forward purchaser and its affiliate are exceeded 

• an event x is announced that if consummated would result in a specified extraordinary event including certain mergers or tender offers certain events involving our nationalization or insolvency or a delisting of our common shares or y occurs that would constitute a delisting or change in law or 

• certain other events of default or termination events occur including among others any material misrepresentation made in connection with the june 2020 forward sale agreement or our insolvency each as more fully described in the june 2020 forward sale agreement 

the forward purchaser’s decision to exercise its right to accelerate the settlement of the june 2020 forward sale agreement will be made irrespective of our interests including our need for capital in such cases we could be required to issue and deliver shares of our common stock under the physical settlement provisions of the june 2020 forward sale agreement which would result in dilution to our earnings per share 

we expect to physically settle the june 2020 forward sale agreement and receive proceeds from the sale of those shares of our common stock upon one or more forward settlement dates no later than june 17 2021 however the june 2020 forward sale agreement may be settled earlier in whole or in part at our option subject to certain conditions we have the right to elect physical cash or net share settlement under the june 2020 forward sale agreement at any time and from time to time in part or in full the june 2020 forward sale agreement will be physically settled by delivery of shares of our common stock unless we elect to cash settle or net share settle the june 2020 forward sale agreement delivery of shares of our common stock upon physical settlement or if we elect net share settlement upon such settlement to the extent we are obligated to deliver shares of our common stock will result in dilution to our earnings per share 

if we elect cash settlement or net share settlement with respect to all or a portion of the shares of our common stock underlying the june 2020 forward sale agreement we expect the forward purchaser or its affiliate to purchase a number of shares of our common stock in secondary market transactions over an unwind period to i return shares of our common stock to securities lenders in order to unwind its hedge after taking into consideration any shares of our common stock to be delivered by us to the forward purchaser in the case of net share settlement and ii if applicable in the case of net share settlement deliver shares of our common stock to us to the extent required in settlement of the june 2020 forward sale agreement 

the purchase of shares of our common stock in connection with the forward purchaser or its affiliate unwinding its hedge position could cause the price of shares of our common stock to increase over such time or reduce the amount of a decrease over such time thereby increasing the amount of cash we would be required to pay to the forward purchaser or decreasing the amount of cash that the forward purchaser would be required to pay us upon a cash settlement of the june 2020 forward sale agreement or increasing the number of shares of common stock we would be required to deliver to the forward purchaser or decreasing the number of shares of common stock that the forward purchaser would be required to deliver to us upon net share settlement of the june 2020 forward sale agreement 

the forward sale price that we expect to receive upon physical settlement of the june 2020 forward sale agreement will be subject to adjustment on a daily basis based on a floating interest rate factor determined by reference to a specified daily rate less a spread and will be decreased by amounts related to expected dividends on our common stock during the term of the june 2020 forward sale agreement if the specified daily rate is less than the spread on any day the interest rate factor will result in a reduction of the forward sale price for that day as of june 16 2020 the date of the prospectus supplement governing the offering of our common stock pursuant to the june 2020 forward sale agreement the specified daily rate was less than the 

spread reducing the proceeds that we would receive upon settlement of the june 2020 forward sale agreement if the prevailing market price for our common stock during the unwind period under the june 2020 forward sale agreement is above the forward sale price in the case of cash settlement we would pay the forward purchaser an amount per share in cash equal to the difference or in the case of net share settlement we would deliver to the forward purchaser a number of shares of common stock having a value equal to the difference thus we could be responsible for a potentially substantial cash payment in the case of cash settlement 

in case of our bankruptcy or insolvency the june 2020 forward sale agreement would automatically terminate and we would not receive the expected proceeds from the sale of common stock under such agreement 

if we institute or a regulatory authority with jurisdiction over us institutes or we consent to a proceeding seeking a judgment in bankruptcy or insolvency or any other relief under any bankruptcy or insolvency law or other similar law affecting creditors’ rights or we or a regulatory authority with jurisdiction over us presents a petition for our windingup or liquidation or we consent to such a petition the june 2020 forward sale agreement will automatically terminate if the june 2020 forward sale agreement so terminates we would not be obligated to deliver to the forward purchaser any shares of common stock not previously delivered and the forward purchaser would be discharged from its obligation to pay the forward sale price per share in respect of any shares of common stock not previously settled therefore to the extent that there are any shares of common stock with respect to which the june 2020 forward sale agreement has not been settled at the time of the commencement of any such bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings we would not receive the forward sale price per share in respect of those shares of common stock 

general risk factors

we face risks associated with security breaches whether through cyberattacks or cyberintrusions over the internet malware computer viruses attachments to emails persons inside our organization or persons with access to systems inside our organization and other significant disruptions of our it networks and related systems the risk of a security breach or disruption particularly through cyberattack or cyberintrusion including by computer hackers foreign governments and cyber terrorists has generally increased as the number intensity and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions from around the world have increased our it networks and related systems are essential to the operation of our business and our ability to perform daytoday operations including due to increased remote access and operations in 2020 due to the impact of the covid19 pandemic although we make efforts to maintain the security and integrity of these types of it networks and related systems and we have implemented various measures to manage the risk of a security breach or disruption there can be no assurance that our security efforts and measures will be effective or that attempted security breaches or disruptions would not be successful or damaging a security breach or other significant disruption involving our it networks and related systems could disrupt the proper functioning of our networks and systems result in misstated financial reports violations of loan covenants andor missed reporting deadlines result in our inability to monitor our compliance with the rules and regulations regarding our qualification as a reit result in the unauthorized access to and destruction loss theft misappropriation or release of proprietary confidential sensitive or otherwise valuable information of ours or others which others could use to compete against us or for disruptive destructive or otherwise harmful purposes and outcomes require significant management attention and resources to remedy any damages that result subject us to claims for breach of contract damages credits penalties or termination of certain agreements or damage our reputation among our tenants and investors generally any or all of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations cash flow and ability to make distributions with respect to and the market price of our common stock 

our board of directors may change our major corporate policies without stockholder approval and those changes may materially and adversely affect us 

our board of directors will determine and may eliminate or otherwise change our major corporate policies including our acquisition investment financing growth operations and distribution policies while our stockholders have the power to elect or remove directors changes in our major corporate policies may be made by our board of directors without stockholder approval and those changes could adversely affect our business financial condition liquidity results of operations and prospects the market price of our common stock and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders and to satisfy our debt service requirements 

the market price and trading volume of shares of our common stock may be volatile 

the market price of our common stock may be volatile in addition the stock markets generally may experience significant volatility often unrelated to the operating performance of the individual companies whose securities are publicly traded the trading volume in our common stock may fluctuate and cause significant price variations to occur we cannot assure you that the market price of our common stock will not fluctuate or decline significantly in the future if the market price or trading volume of our common stock declines you may be unable to sell your shares at a profit or at all 

some of the factors many of which are beyond our control that could negatively affect the market price of our common stock or result in fluctuations in the price or trading volume of our common stock include 

• actual or anticipated variations in our quarterly results of operations or distributions 

• changes in our earnings funds from operations “ffo” or adjusted funds from operations “affo” estimates 

• publication of research reports about us our tenants or the real estate or gaming industries 

• adverse developments involving our tenants 

• changes in market interest rates that may cause purchasers of our shares to demand a different yield 

• changes in market valuations of similar companies 

• market reaction to any additional capital we raise in the future including availability and attractiveness of longterm debt financing in connection with future acquisitions 

• our failure to achieve the anticipated benefits of our recently completed or future acquisitions within the timeframe or to the extent anticipated by financial or industry analysts 

• additions or departures of key personnel 

• reaction to any other of our public announcements 

• sales or potential sales of our common stock by us or our significant stockholders 

• other actions by institutional stockholders 

• strategic actions taken by us or our competitors such as acquisitions 

• speculation in the press or investment community about us our tenants our industry or the economy in general 

• new laws or regulations or new interpretations of existing laws or regulations applicable to our business and operations or the gaming industry 

• changes in tax or accounting standards policies guidance interpretations or principles 

• the occurrence of any of the other risk factors presented in this annual report on form 10k or our other sec filings and 

• adverse conditions in the financial markets or general us or international economic conditions including those resulting from war acts of terrorism public health crises and responses to such events 

we may be adversely affected by changes in libor reporting practices the method in which libor is determined or the use of alternative reference rates 

our indebtedness under the term loan b facility and revolving credit facility bears interest at variable interest rates that use libor as a benchmark rate on november 30 2020 the ice benchmark administration “iba” announced that it intends to publish oneweek and twomonth usd liborsettings until december 31 2021 and the remaining usd libor settings until the end of june 2023 the iba announcement was supported by similar announcements from the united kingdom’s financial conduct authority “fca” which regulates libor and the board of governors of the federal reserve system federal deposit insurance corporation and office of the comptroller of the currency collectively the “us regulators” both the fca and the us regulators in their announcements also encouraged banks to cease entering into new contracts referencing usd libor after december 2021 these announcements indicate that the continuation of libor on the current basis may not 

be assured after 2021 as such libor may cease to exist or otherwise be unsuitable for use as a benchmark a change or transition away from libor as a common reference rate in the global financial market could have a material adverse effect on our business recent proposals for libor reforms may result in the establishment of new methods of calculating libor or the establishment of one or more alternative benchmark rates the alternative reference rates committee which was convened by the federal reserve board and the new york federal reserve bank has identified the secured oversight financing rate “sofr” as the recommended riskfree alternative rate for usd libor however the composition and characteristics of sofr are not the same as those of libor sofr is a secured rate while libor is an unsecured rate and sofr is an overnight rate while libor is a forwardlooking rate that represents interbank funding over different maturities while market participants including the international swaps and derivatives association “isda” have proposed certain methods to interpolate and transition between libor and sofr there can be no assurance that sofr including a term sofr or compounded sofr will perform in the same way as libor would have at any time including without limitation as a result of changes in interest and yield rates in the market market volatility or global or regional economic financial political regulatory judicial or other events 

if libor ceases to exist we cannot predict whether sofr or another successor rate would be utilized or the impact of such rate on us and we may determine that we need to negotiate an amendment to our term loan b facility and revolving credit facility with our lenders and to our hedging arrangements while isda has proposed sofr as the fallback benchmark rate for dollardenominated derivative instruments currently utilizing the usd libor benchmark rate there is still some uncertainty as to the implementation of a replacement in the loan markets in particular when and how such a replacement will be implemented in the loan market while the loan market may eventually generally adopt sofr as the replacement for libor there can be no assurance as to the timing of such adoption and any differences in the timing of adoption of sofr between the loan and hedge market as well as differences in methodology and valuation can lead to mismatches in hedging which could result in changes to our risk exposure adverse tax or accounting effects increased compliance and legal and operational costs as a result our interest expense may increase and our ability to refinance some or all of our existing indebtedness and our available cash flow may be adversely affected 

future incurrences of debt which would be senior to our shares of common stock upon liquidation andor issuance of preferred equity securities which may be senior to our shares of common stock for purposes of distributions or upon liquidation could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

in the future we may attempt to increase our capital resources by incurring additional debt including mediumterm notes trust preferred securities and senior or subordinated notes or issuing preferred shares if a liquidation event were to occur holders of our debt securities and preferred shares and lenders with respect to other borrowings will receive distributions of our available assets prior to the holders of our shares of common stock in addition our preferred stock if issued would likely limit our ability to make liquidating or other distributions to the holders of shares of our common stock under certain circumstances any future common stock offerings may dilute the holdings of our existing stockholders or reduce the market price of our common stock or both holders of shares of our common stock are not entitled to preemptive rights or other protections against dilution since our decision to issue debt securities incur other forms of indebtedness or to issue additional common stock or preferred stock in the future will depend on future developments market conditions and other factors beyond our control we cannot predict or estimate the amount timing nature or success of our future offerings thus our stockholders bear the risk of our issuing senior securities incurring other senior obligations or issuing additional common stock in the future which may reduce the market price of shares of our common stock reduce cash available for distribution to common stockholders or dilute their stockholdings in us 

the number of shares available for future sale could adversely affect the market price of shares of our common stock 

we cannot predict whether future issuances of our shares or the availability of shares of our common stock for resale in the open market will decrease the market price per share of shares of our common stock sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market or the perception that such sales might occur could adversely affect the market price of shares of our common stock if any of our stockholders cause or there is a perception that they may cause a large number of their shares to be sold in the public market the sales could reduce the market price of shares of our common stock and could impede our ability to raise future capital 

our earnings and cash distributions could affect the market price of shares of our common stock 

our common stock may trade at prices that are higher or lower than the net asset value per share to the extent that we retain operating cash flow for investment purposes working capital reserves or other purposes rather than distributing the cash flows to stockholders these retained funds while increasing the value of our underlying assets may negatively impact the market price of shares of our common stock our failure to meet market expectations with regard to future earnings and cash distributions could adversely affect the market price of shares of our common stock

key trends that may affect our business 

subsidiaries of caesars penn national hard rock century casinos and jack entertainment are the lessees of all of our properties pursuant to the lease agreements and caesars penn national seminole hard rock century casinos or rock ohio ventures llc guarantees the obligations of their respective subsidiary tenants under the lease agreements the lease agreements account for a substantial majority of our revenues additionally we expect to realize organic growth in rental revenue through annual rent escalators in our lease agreements accordingly we are dependent on our tenants the gaming industry and the health of the economies in the areas where our properties are located for the foreseeable future and an event that has a material adverse effect on any of our tenant’s business financial condition liquidity results of operations or prospects such as the ongoing covid19 pandemic would have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition liquidity results of operations and prospects see item 1a “risk factors—risks related to our business and operations”  for a full discussion on the impact of the covid19 pandemic on our business see item 1 “business—impact of the covid19 pandemic on our business” 

we actively seek to grow our portfolio through acquisitions of and investments in experiential real estate in geographically diverse dynamic markets spanning hospitality entertainment leisure and gaming properties additionally we expect to grow our portfolio through acquisitions by pursuing opportunities to execute sale leaseback transactions with caesars including pursuant to i the centaur properties putcall agreement ii the caesars forum putcall agreement and iii the las vegas strip rofr agreement and horseshoe baltimore rofr agreement however caesars will make an independent financial decision regarding whether to sell properties and therefore trigger the rights of first refusal under the las vegas strip rofr agreement and the horseshoe baltimore rofr agreement and we will make an independent financial decision whether to purchase the properties in each instance finally we believe the approximately 34 acres of undeveloped or underdeveloped land on and adjacent to the las vegas strip that we own may provide attractive opportunities for potential future expansion and development in pursuing external growth initiatives we will generally seek to acquire or invest in properties that can generate stable revenue through longterm leases with tenants with established operating histories and we will consider various factors when evaluating acquisitions and other investments including the ability to continue to diversify our tenant base and increasing our geographic diversification 

our operating and financial performance in the future will be significantly influenced by the success of our acquisition strategy and the timing and the availability and terms of financing of any acquisitions that we may complete as well as broader macroeconomic and other conditions that affect our tenants’ operating and financial performance including the impact of the covid19 pandemic we can provide no assurance that we will exercise any of our contractual rights to purchase one or more properties from caesars that caesars will trigger the rights of first offer under the las vegas strip rofr agreement and horseshoe baltimore rofr agreement or that we will otherwise be successful in acquiring any properties whether subject to the las vegas strip rofr agreement the horseshoe baltimore rofr agreement or otherwise additionally our ability to successfully implement our acquisition and investment strategy will depend upon the availability and terms of financing including debt and equity capital further the pricing of any acquisitions or other investments we may consummate and the terms of any leases that we may enter into will significantly impact our future results competition to enter into transactions including sale leaseback transactions with attractive properties and desirable tenants is intense and we can provide no assurance that any future acquisitions investments or leases will be on terms as favorable to us as those relating to recent transactions we anticipate that we would seek to finance these acquisitions with a combination of debt and equity although no assurance can be given that we would be able to issue equity in such amounts on favorable terms or at all or that we would not determine to incur more debt on a relative basis at the relevant time due to market conditions or otherwise in addition to rent our current lease agreements require our tenants to pay the following 1 all facility maintenance 2 all insurance required in connection with the leased properties and the business conducted on the leased properties 3 taxes levied on or with respect to the leased properties other than taxes on our income and 4 all utilities and other services necessary or appropriate for the leased properties and the business conducted on the leased properties accordingly due to the “triplenet” structure of our leases we do not expect to incur significant propertylevel expenses

additionally the weighted average annualized interest rate of our debt decreased to 447 during the year ended december 31 2020 from 495 during the year ended december 31 2019 as a result of i the weighted average interest rate on the february 2020 senior unsecured notes and the november 2019 senior unsecured notes being lower than the weighted average interest rate of the second lien notes and cplv cmbs debt ii a decrease in libor on the 1000 million portion of our variable rate debt that is not hedged and iii a reduction in the interest rate on the term loan b facility from libor plus 200 to libor plus 175 

interest income 

interest income decreased 132 million during the year ended december 31 2020 compared to the year ended december 31 2019 the decrease was primarily driven by an overall decrease in our cash and shortterm investment balances and a substantial decrease in the interest rates earned on these investment balances 

loss on extinguishment of debt 

during the year ended december 31 2020 we recognized a loss on extinguishment of debt of 391 million resulting from the full redemption of our second lien notes in february 2020 during the year ended december 31 2019 we recognized a loss on extinguishment of debt of 581 million resulting from the 1108 million prepayment penalties associated with the full repayment of our cplv cmbs debt in november 2019 net of 554 million of which was reimbursed by eldorado 

s 

gain upon lease modification 

in connection with the eldorado transaction and as required under asc 842 we reassessed the lease classification of the las vegas master lease agreement regional master lease agreement and joliet lease agreement and determined the leases meet the definition of a salestype lease including the land component of caesars palace las vegas as a result of the reclassifications of the caesars lease agreements from direct financing and operating leases to salestype leases we recorded the investments at their estimated fair values as of the modification date and recognized a net gain equal to the difference in fair value of the assets and their carrying values immediately prior to the modification 

results of operations for the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018 

for a comparison of our results of operations for the fiscal years ended december 31 2019 and 2018 see “ part ii item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ” of our annual report on form 10k for the fiscal year ended december 31 2019 filed with the sec on february 20 2020 and incorporated by reference herein 

reconciliation of nongaap measures 

we present funds from operations “ffo” ffo per share adjusted funds from operations “affo” affo per share and adjusted ebitda which are not required by or presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states “gaap” these are nongaap financial measures and should not be construed as alternatives to net income or as an indicator of operating performance as determined in accordance with gaap we believe ffo ffo per share affo affo per share and adjusted ebitda provide a meaningful perspective of the underlying operating performance of our business 

ffo is a nongaap financial measure that is considered a supplemental measure for the real estate industry and a supplement to gaap measures consistent with the definition used by the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit we define ffo as net income or loss attributable to common stockholders computed in accordance with gaap excluding i gains or losses from sales of certain real estate assets ii depreciation and amortization related to real estate iii gains and losses from change in control and iv impairment writedowns of certain real estate assets and investments in entities when the impairment is directly attributable to decreases in the value of depreciable real estate held by the entity 

affo is a nongaap financial measure that we use as a supplemental operating measure to evaluate our performance we calculate affo by adding or subtracting from ffo noncash leasing and financing adjustments noncash change in allowance for credit losses noncash stockbased compensation expense transaction costs incurred in connection with the acquisition of real estate investments amortization of debt issuance costs and original issue discount other noncash interest expense nonreal estate depreciation which is comprised of the depreciation related to our golf course operations capital expenditures which are comprised of additions to property plant and equipment related to our golf course operations impairment charges related to nondepreciable real estate and gains or losses on debt extinguishment other nonrecurring noncash transactions such as noncash gain upon lease modification and noncash adjustments attributable to noncontrolling interest with respect to certain of the foregoing the noncash change in allowance for credit losses consists of estimated credit losses for our investments in leases  salestype and direct financing investments in leases  financing receivables and investments in loans as a result of our adoption of asu no 201613  financial instrumentscredit losses topic 326 no similar adjustments are reflected in prior periods because the accounting standard was adopted effective january 1 2020 and does not require retrospective application please see note 6  allowance for credit losses for further information 

we calculate adjusted ebitda by adding or subtracting from affo contractual interest expense and interest income collectively interest expense net and income tax expense 

these nongaap financial measures i do not represent cash flow from operations as defined by gaap ii should not be considered as an alternative to net income as a measure of operating performance or to cash flows from operating investing and financing activities and iii are not alternatives to cash flow as a measure of liquidity in addition these measures should not be viewed as measures of liquidity nor do they measure our ability to fund all of our cash needs including our ability to make cash distributions to our stockholders to fund capital improvements or to make interest payments on our indebtedness investors are also cautioned that ffo ffo per share affo affo per share and adjusted ebitda as presented may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other real estate companies including reits due to the fact that not all real estate companies use the same definitions our presentation of these measures does not replace the presentation of our financial results in accordance with gaap

2 the term loan b facility is subject to amortization of 10 of principal per annum payable in equal quarterly installments on the last business day of each calendar quarter however as a result of prepaying 1000 million in february 2018 the next principal payment due on the term loan b facility is september 2022 the term loan b facility will mature on december 22 2024 or if the maturity is extended pursuant to the terms of the agreement such extended maturity date as determined pursuant thereto 

3 the revolving credit facility will mature on may 15 2024

5 the allocation of our future funding commitments is based on the commitment funding date or expiration date as applicable however we may be obligated to fund these commitments earlier than such date 

we believe that we have sufficient liquidity to meet our liquidity and capital resource requirements primarily through currently available cash and cash equivalents shortterm investments cash received under our lease agreements borrowings from banks including undrawn capacity under our revolving credit facility and proceeds from the issuance of debt and equity securities including issuances under the june 2020 forward sale agreement and our atthemarket offering program 

all of the lease agreements call for an initial term of fifteen years with four fiveyear tenant renewal options and are designed to provide us with a reliable and predictable longterm revenue stream except for the jack clevelandthistledown lease agreement as amended which now provides for an initial term of twenty years with three fiveyear renewal options however the covid19 pandemic has adversely impacted our tenants and their financial condition and is expected to continue to do so as all of their properties were closed for a period of time and upon reopening are subject to operating restrictions and continuing uncertainty as to whether they will be forced to close again in the future in the event our tenants are unable to make all of their contractual rent payments as provided by the lease agreements we believe we have sufficient 

s 

liquidity from the other sources discussed above to meet all of our contractual obligations for a significant period of time additionally we do not have any debt maturities until 2024 for more information refer to the risk factors in part i item 1a risk factors  

our cash flows from operations and our ability to access capital resources could be adversely affected due to uncertain economic factors and volatility in the financial and credit markets including the current conditions created by the covid19 pandemic which has severely and adversely impacted global national and regional economic activity and has contributed to significant volatility and negative pressure in financial markets in particular in connection with the ongoing covid19 pandemic and its impact on our tenants’ operations and financial performance we have provided certain relief under the applicable lease agreements to some of our tenants as more fully described above in “—summary of significant 2020 activities — amendment to jack clevelandthistledown lease agreement” “—summary of significant 2020 activities — amendment to century portfolio lease agreement” and “—summary of significant 2020 activities — amendment to caesars lease agreements” and as a result we can provide no assurances that our tenants will not default on their leases or fail to make full rental payments if their businesses become challenged due to among other things current or future adverse economic conditions in addition any such tenant default or failure to make full rental payments could impact our operating performance and result in us not satisfying the financial covenants applicable to our outstanding indebtedness which could result in us not being able to incur additional debt including the available capacity under our revolving credit facility or result in a default further current or future economic conditions could impact our tenants’ ability to meet capital improvement requirements or other obligations required in our lease agreements that could result in a decrease in the value of our properties 

our ability to raise funds through the issuance of debt and equity securities and access to other thirdparty sources of capital in the future will be dependent on among other things uncertainties related to covid19 and the impact of our response and our tenants’ responses to covid19 general economic conditions general market conditions for reits market perceptions and the trading price of our stock we will continue to analyze which sources of capital are most advantageous to us at any particular point in time but the capital markets may not be consistently available on terms we deem attractive or at all

s 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap we have identified certain accounting policies that we believe are the most critical to the presentation of our financial information over a period of time these accounting policies may require our management to take decisions on subjective andor complex matters relating to reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue costs expenses and related disclosures including but not limited to determining the classification of our leases the subsequent accounting for our leases and the calculation of our allowance for credit losses the judgment on such estimates and underlying assumptions is based on our historical experience that we believe is reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ from the estimates 

investments in leases  salestype and direct financing net 

we account for our investments in leases under asc 842 “leases” “asc 842” upon lease inception or lease modification we assess lease classification to determine whether the lease should be classified as a salestype direct financing or operating lease as required by asc 842 we separately assess the land and building components of the property to determine the classification of each component if the lease component is determined to be a direct financing or salestype lease we record a net investment in the lease which is equal to the sum of the lease receivable and the unguaranteed residual asset discounted at the rate implicit in the lease any difference between the fair value of the asset and the net investment in the lease is considered selling profit or loss and is either recognized upon execution of the lease or deferred and recognized over the life of the lease depending on the classification of the lease since we purchase properties and simultaneously enter into new leases directly with the tenants the net investment in the lease is generally equal to the purchase price of the asset and due to the long term nature of our leases the land and building components of an investment generally have the same lease classification 

upon adoption of asc 842 on january 1 2019 we made an accounting policy election to use a package of practical expedients that among other things allow us to not reassess prior lease classifications or initial direct costs for leases that existed as of the balance sheet date as such at that time we did not reassess the classification of our caesars lease agreements as these leases existed prior to our adoption of asc 842 

prior to the consummation of the eldorado transaction the caesars lease agreements continued to be accounted for as direct financing leases and were included within investments in leases  salestype and direct financing net on the balance sheet with the exception of the land component of caesars palace las vegas which was determined to be an operating lease and was included in investments in leases  operating on the balance sheet the income recognition for our direct financing leases recognized under asc 840 “leases” “asc 840” was consistent with the income recognition for our salestype lease under asc 842 

upon the consummation of the eldorado transaction on july 20 2020 we modified the cplv lease agreement hlv lease agreement noncplv lease agreement and joliet lease agreement which included amending certain of the lease terms combining the cplv lease agreement and hlv lease agreement into the las vegas master lease agreement and replacing the noncplv lease agreement with the regional master lease agreement upon modification we reassessed the lease classification of the las vegas master lease agreement regional master lease agreement and joliet lease agreement and determined that the leases meet the definition of a salestype lease including the land component of caesars palace las vegas accordingly we reclassified the land component of caesars palace las vegas from investments in leases  operating to investments in leases  salestype and direct financing further as a result of the reclassifications of the caesars lease agreements from direct financing and operating leases to salestype leases we recorded the investments at their estimated fair values as of the modification date and recognized a net gain equal to the difference in fair value of the assets and their carrying values immediately prior to the modification such gain is recognized in our statement of operations as gain upon lease modification subsequent to the consummation of the eldorado transaction we no longer have any leases classified as operating or direct financing and as such there is no longer any income recorded through investments in leases  operating refer to note 4  property transactions for further discussion surrounding the lease modifications refer to note 10  fair value for further discussion surrounding the mark to fair value 

we have determined that the land and building components of the margaritaville lease agreement the greektown lease agreement the hard rock cincinnati lease agreement and the century portfolio lease agreement meet the definition of a salestype lease under asc 842 

investments in leases  financing receivables net 

in accordance with asc 842 for transactions in which we enter into a contract to acquire an asset and lease it back to the seller under a salestype lease ie a sale leaseback transaction control of the asset is not considered to have transferred to us as a result we do not recognize the underlying asset but instead recognize a financial asset in accordance with asc 310 “receivables” “asc 310” the accounting for the financing receivable under asc 310 is materially consistent with the 

s 

accounting for our investments in leases  salestype under asc 842 we determined that the land and building components of the jack clevelandthistledown lease agreement meet the definition of a salestype lease and since we purchased and leased the assets back to the seller under a sale leaseback transaction control is not considered to have transferred to us under gaap accordingly the jack clevelandthistledown lease agreement is accounted for as investments in leases  financing receivables on our balance sheet net of allowance for credit losses in accordance with asc 310 

upon the consummation of the eldor ado transaction on july 20 2020 and reassessment of the classification of the caesars lease agreements as described above we determined that the mta properties acquisitions as defined in note 4  property transactions  meet the definition of a separate contract under asc 842 in accordance with this guidance we are required to separately assess the lease classification apart from the other assets in the regional master lease agreement we determined that the land and building components of the mta properties as defined in note 4  property transactions  meet the definition of a salestype lease and since we purchased and leased the assets back to caesars control is not considered to have transferred to us under gaap accordingly the mta properties are accounted for as investments in leases  financing receivables on our balance sheet net of allowance for credit losses in accordance with asc 310 

lease term 

we assess the noncancelable lease term under asc 842 which includes any reasonably assured renewal periods all of our lease agreements provide for an initial term with multiple tenant renewal options we have individually assessed all of our lease agreements and concluded that the lease term includes all of the periods covered by extension options as it is reasonably certain our tenants will renew the lease agreements we believe our tenants are economically compelled to renew the lease agreements due to the importance of our real estate to the operation of their business the significant capital they have invested in our properties and the lack of suitable replacement assets 

income from leases and lease financing receivables 

we recognize the related income from our salestype leases direct financing leases and lease financing receivables on an effective interest basis at a constant rate of return over the terms of the applicable leases as a result the cash payments accounted for under salestype leases direct financing leases and lease financing receivables will not equal income from our lease agreements rather a portion of the cash rent we receive is recorded as income from salestype and direct financing leases or income from lease financing receivables and loans as applicable in our statement of operations and a portion is recorded as a change to investments in leases  salestype and direct financing net or investments in leases  financing receivables net as applicable 

prior to july 20 2020 under asc 840 we determined that the land component of caesars palace las vegas was greater than 25 of the overall fair value of the combined land and building components at lease inception the land was determined to be an operating lease and we recorded the related income on a straightline basis over the lease term the amount of annual minimum lease payments attributable to the land element after deducting executory costs including any profit thereon was determined by applying the lessee’s incremental borrowing rate to the value of the land revenue from this lease was recorded as income from operating leases in our statement of operations upon the consummation of the eldorado transaction on july 20 2020 the land component of caesars palace las vegas was reassessed for lease classification and determined to be a salestype lease accordingly subsequent to july 20 2020 the income is recognized as income from salestype leases 

initial direct costs incurred in connection with entering into investments classified as salestype or direct financing leases are included in the balance of the net investment in lease such amounts will be recognized as a reduction to income from investments in leases over the life of the lease using the effective interest method costs that would have been incurred regardless of whether the lease was signed such as legal fees and certain other thirdparty fees are expensed as incurred to transaction and acquisition expenses in our statement of operations in connection with the reassessment of the lease classification and mark to fair value of the caesars lease agreements any initial direct costs capitalized prior to the eldorado transaction were written off as part of the gain upon lease modification 

loan origination fees and costs incurred in connection with entering into investments classified as lease financing receivables are included in the balance of the net investment and such amounts will be recognized as a reduction to income from investments in loans and lease financing receivables over the life of the lease using the effective interest method 

allowance for credit losses 

on january 1 2020 we adopted asc 326 “credit losses” “asc 326” which requires that we measure and record current expected credit losses “cecl” for the majority of our investments the scope of which includes our investments in leases  salestype and direct financing investments in leases  financing receivables and investments in loans 

s 

we have elected to use a discounted cash flow model to estimate the allowance for credit losses or cecl allowance this model requires us to develop cash flows which project estimated credit losses over the life of the lease or loan and discount these cash flows at the asset’s effective interest rate we then record a cecl allowance equal to the difference between the amortized cost basis of the asset and the present value of the expected credit loss cash flows 

expected losses within our cash flows are determined by estimating the probability of default “pd” and loss given default “lgd” of our tenants and their parent guarantors over the life of each individual lease or financial asset we have engaged a nationally recognized data analytics firm to assist us with estimating both the pd and lgd of our tenants and their parent guarantors the pd and lgd are estimated during a reasonable and supportable period for which we believe we are able to estimate future economic conditions the “rs period” and a longterm period for which we revert to longterm historical averages the “longterm period” the pd and lgd estimates for the rs period are developed using the current financial condition of the tenant and applied to a projection of economic conditions over a twoyear term the pd and lgd for the longterm period are estimated using the average historical default rates and historical loss rates respectively of public companies over the past 35 years that have similar credit profiles or characteristics to our tenants and their parent guarantors we were unable to use our historical data to estimate losses as we have no loss history to date 

the cecl allowance is recorded as a reduction to our net investments in leases  direct financing and sales type investments in leases  financing receivables and investments in loans on our balance sheet we are required to update our cecl allowance on a quarterly basis with the resulting change being recorded in the statement of operations for the relevant period finally each time we make a new investment in an asset subject to asc 326 we are required to record an initial cecl allowance for such asset which will result in a noncash charge to the statement of operations for the relevant period 

we are required to estimate a cecl allowance related to contractual commitments to extend credit such as future funding commitments under a revolving credit facility the cecl allowance related to these future commitments is recorded as a component of other liabilities on our balance sheet 

chargeoffs are deducted from the allowance in the period in which they are deemed uncollectible recoveries previously written off are recorded when received there were no chargeoffs or recoveries for the year ended december 31 2020

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend

our future income cash flows and fair values relevant to financial instruments are dependent upon prevailing market interest rates in the normal course of business we are exposed to the effect of interest rate changes we have entered into derivative agreements to mitigate exposure to unexpected changes in interest market risk refers to the risk of loss from adverse changes in market interest rates we periodically use derivative financial instruments to seek to manage or hedge interest rate risks related to our borrowings we do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes and only enter into contracts with major financial institutions based on their credit rating and other factors we intend to enter into derivative agreements only with counterparties that we believe have a strong credit rating to mitigate the risk of counterparty default or insolvency 

as of december 31 2020 we had 68500 million of debt outstanding of which 47500 million was fixed rate debt and 20000 million was hedged variable rate debt the remaining 1000 million of our indebtedness was unhedged as of december 31 2020 a one percent increase or decrease in the annual interest rate on our unhedged variable rate borrowings of 1000 million would increase or decrease our annual cash interest expense by approximately 10 million 

subsequent to year end on january 22 2021 two of our interest rate swaps with a notional balance of 5000 million matured and as a result subsequent to january 22 2021 6000 million of our indebtedness was unhedged after january 22 2021 a one percent increase or decrease in the annual interest rate on our unhedged variable rate borrowings of 6000 million would increase or decrease our annual cash interest expense by approximately 60 million 

we may manage or hedge interest rate risks related to our borrowings by means of interest rate swap agreements we also expect to manage our exposure to interest rate risk by maintaining a mix of fixed and variable rates for our indebtedness however the reit provisions of the code substantially limit our ability to hedge our assets and liabilities

financing policies 

we expect to employ leverage in our capital structure in amounts that we determine appropriate from time to time our board of directors has not adopted a policy that limits the total amount of indebtedness that we may incur but will consider a number of factors in evaluating our level of indebtedness from time to time as well as the amount of such indebtedness that will be either

risks related to our business and operations 

we are and will be significantly dependent on caesars and following the completion of the eldorado transaction the combined eldoradocaesars and their respective subsidiaries unless or until we substantially diversify our portfolio and an event that has a material adverse effect on any of its businesses financial condition liquidity results of operations or prospects could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition liquidity results of operations and prospects 

we depend on our tenants to operate the properties that we own in a manner that generates revenues sufficient to allow the tenants to meet their obligations to us substantially all of our revenue is from the caesars lease agreements because these leases are triplenet leases we depend on the tenants to pay substantially all insurance taxes utilities and maintenance and repair expenses in connection with these leased properties and to indemnify defend and hold us harmless from and against various claims litigation and liabilities arising in connection with their businesses see item 1  “business ” there can be no assurance that the tenants will have sufficient assets income or access to financing to enable them to satisfy their payment and other obligations under their leases with us or that the applicable guarantor will be able to satisfy its guarantee of the applicable tenant’s obligations under the caesars lease agreements 

caesars relies on the properties it owns andor operate for income to satisfy its obligations including its debt service requirements and lease payments due to us under the caesars lease agreements or to others under other lease agreements if income from these properties were to decline for any reason or if the debt service requirements of our tenants were to increase for any reason or if their creditworthiness were to become impaired for other reasons caesars and following the completion of the eldorado transaction the combined eldoradocaesars may become unable or unwilling to satisfy its payment and other obligations under the caesars lease agreements the inability or unwillingness of caesars and following the completion of the eldorado transaction the combined eldoradocaesars to meet their respective subsidiaries’ payment and other obligations under the caesars lease agreements in each case could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition liquidity results of operations and prospects including our ability to make distributions to our stockholders 

the gaming and entertainment industry is highly competitive and our tenants’ failure to continue to compete successfully could adversely affect their businesses financial conditions results of operations and cash flows in particular our tenants’ businesses may be adversely impacted by the reinvestment and expansion by competitors in existing jurisdictions and expansion of gaming into new jurisdictions in which gaming was not previously permitted which would result in increased competition in these jurisdictions additionally the casino entertainment industry represents a significant source of tax revenues to the various jurisdictions in which casinos operate from time to time various state and federal legislators and officials have proposed changes in tax laws or in the administration of such laws including increases in tax rates which would affect the industry if adopted such changes could adversely impact the business financial condition and results of operations of our tenants 

in addition following the completion of the eldorado transaction the combined eldoradocaesars will be our largest tenant eldorado has publicly disclosed that it expects to achieve approximately 5000 million of synergies over time following completion of the eldoradocaesars merger the combined eldoradocaesars may be unable to achieve these synergies during the time period that it expects to do so or at all and a failure to achieve these synergies may adversely affect the combined eldoradocaesars including its creditworthiness and impair its ability to meet its obligations to us moreover given the combined eldoradocaesar’s expected significance to our business a failure on the part of the combined eldoradocaesars to realize expected synergies and any related improvement to its creditworthiness or any deterioration of its creditworthiness could materially and adversely affect us even in the absence of a default under our agreements with the combined eldoradocaesars 

due to our dependence on rental payments from subsidiaries of caesars and following the completion of the eldorado transaction the combined eldoradocaesars as our primary source of revenue we may be limited in our ability to enforce our rights under the leases or to terminate the applicable lease with respect to any particular property failure by the tenants to comply with the terms of their respective leases or to comply with the gaming regulations to which the leased properties are subject could require 

us to find another tenant for such property to the extent possible and there could be a decrease or cessation of rental payments by the tenants in such event we may be unable to locate a suitable creditworthy tenant at similar rental rates or at all which would have the effect of reducing our rental revenues and could have a material adverse effect on us 

because a concentrated portion of our revenues are generated from the strip we are subject to greater risks than a company that is more geographically diversified 

our properties on the las vegas strip generated approximately 33 of our lease revenue for the year ended december 31 2019 therefore our business may be significantly affected by risks common to the las vegas tourism industry for example the cost and availability of air services and the impact of any events that disrupt air travel to and from las vegas can adversely affect the business of our tenants we cannot control the number or frequency of flights to or from las vegas but the tenants rely on air traffic for a significant portion of their visitors reductions in flights by major airlines as a result of higher fuel prices or lower demand can impact the number of visitors to our properties additionally there is one principal interstate highway between las vegas and southern california where a large number of the customers that frequent our properties reside capacity constraints of that highway or any other traffic disruptions may also affect the number of customers who visit our facilities moreover due to the importance of our two properties on the strip we may be disproportionately affected by general risks such as acts of terrorism natural disasters including major fires floods and earthquakes and severe or inclement weather should such developments occur in or nearby las vegas 

caesars and its subsidiaries are and after the completion of the eldorado transaction the combined eldoradocaesars and its subsidiaries will be party to certain leasing and financial commitments with us which may have a negative impact on caesars’ business and operating condition 

caesars andor its subsidiaries entered into certain leasing and financial commitments evidenced by agreements with us see item 1 “businessour relationship with caesars” for additional information regarding such agreements 

caesars is obligated to pay us in the aggregate approximately 42 billion in fixed annual rents and golf course membership fees over the next five years of the respective caesars lease agreements subject to certain escalators and adjustments if caesars’ or after the completion of the eldorado transaction eldorado’s businesses and properties fail to generate sufficient earnings the applicable tenants caesars andor crc before the completion of the eldorado transaction and eldorado after the completion of the completion of the eldorado transaction may be unable to satisfy their respective obligations under the lease agreements or the related guarantees respectively additionally these obligations may limit their ability to make investments to maintain and grow their portfolio of businesses and properties which may adversely affect their competitiveness and ability to satisfy their obligations to us 

subsidiaries of caesars are required to pay a significant portion of their cash flow from operations to us pursuant to and subject to the terms and conditions of the caesars lease agreements which could adversely affect caesars’ ability to fund its operations or development projects raise capital make acquisitions and otherwise respond to competitive and economic changes and its ability to satisfy its payment obligations to us under the lease agreements and the related guarantees 

subsidiaries of caesars and after the completion of the completion of the eldorado transaction subsidiaries of eldorado are required to pay a significant portion of their cash flow from operations to us pursuant to and subject to the terms and conditions of the caesars lease agreements see item 1 “businessour lease agreementcaesars lease agreementsoverview” and item 1 “businessour relationship with caesars” as a result of this commitment caesars’ ability to fund its operations or development projects raise capital make acquisitions and otherwise respond to competitive and economic changes may be adversely affected which could adversely affect the ability of the applicable tenants to satisfy their obligations to us under the caesars lease agreements and the ability of caesars andor crc before the completion of the eldorado transaction and eldorado after the completion of the eldorado transaction to satisfy their respective obligations to us under the related guarantees 

in addition during the initial seven years of the caesars lease agreements the annual rent escalations under the caesars lease agreements will continue to apply regardless of the amount of cash flows generated by the properties that are subject to the caesars lease agreements accordingly if the cash flows generated by such properties decrease or do not increase at the same rate as the rent escalations the rents payable under the caesars lease agreements will comprise a higher percentage of the cash flows generated by the subsidiaries of caesars and after the completion of the eldorado transaction eldorado which could make it more difficult for the applicable subsidiaries to make their payment obligations to us under the caesars lease agreements and ultimately could adversely affect the applicable guarantor’s ability to satisfy their respective obligations to us under the related guarantees 

caesars’ indebtedness and after the completion of the eldorado transaction eldorado’s indebtedness and the fact that a significant portion of its cash flow is used to make interest payments could adversely affect its ability to satisfy its obligations under the caesars lease agreements 

as disclosed in its quarterly report on form 10q for the quarter ended september 30 2019 caesars’ consolidated estimated debt service including principal and interest for 2020 will be approximately 5040 million and 102 billion thereafter to maturity as a result a significant portion of caesars’ liquidity needs and after the completion of the eldorado transaction eldorado’s liquidity needs are for debt service including significant interest payments such substantial indebtedness and the restrictive covenants under the agreements governing such indebtedness could limit the ability of the applicable tenants to satisfy their obligations to us under the lease agreements and the ability of caesars andor crc before the completion of the eldorado transaction and eldorado after the completion of the completion of the eldorado transaction to satisfy their respective obligations under the related guarantees 

we are dependent on the gaming industry and may be susceptible to the risks associated with it which could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition liquidity results of operations and prospects 

as the landlord of gaming facilities we are impacted by the risks associated with the gaming industry therefore so long as our investments are concentrated in gamingrelated assets our success is dependent on the gaming industry which could be adversely affected by economic conditions in general changes in consumer trends and preferences and other factors over which we and our tenants have no control as we are subject to risks inherent in substantial investments in a single industry a decrease in the gaming business would likely have a greater adverse effect on us than if we owned a more diversified real estate portfolio particularly because a component of the rent under the lease agreements will be based over time on the performance of the gaming facilities operated by our tenants on our properties and such effect could be material and adverse to our business financial condition liquidity results of operations and prospects 

the gaming industry is characterized by a high degree of competition among a large number of participants including riverboat casinos dockside casinos landbased casinos video lottery sweepstakes and poker machines not located in casinos native american gaming internet lotteries and other internet wagering gaming services and in a broader sense gaming operators face competition from all manner of leisure and entertainment activities gaming competition is intense in most of the markets where our facilities are located recently there has been additional significant competition in the gaming industry as a result of the upgrading or expansion of facilities by existing market participants the entrance of new gaming participants into a market internet gaming or legislative changes as competing properties and new markets are opened we may be negatively impacted additionally decreases in discretionary consumer spending brought about by weakened general economic conditions such as but not limited to lackluster recoveries from recessions high unemployment levels higher income taxes low levels of consumer confidence weakness in the housing market cultural and demographic changes and increased stock market volatility may negatively impact our revenues and operating cash flows 

we and our tenants face extensive regulation from gaming and other regulatory authorities and our charter provides that any of our shares held by investors who are found to be unsuitable by state gaming regulatory authorities are subject to redemption 

the ownership operation and management of gaming and racing facilities are subject to extensive regulation these gaming and racing regulations impact our gaming and racing tenants and persons associated with our gaming and racing facilities which in many jurisdictions include us as the landlord and owner of the real estate certain gaming authorities in the jurisdictions in which we hold properties may require us andor our affiliates to maintain a license as a key business entity or supplier because of our status as landlord gaming authorities also retain great discretion to require us to be found suitable as a landlord and certain of our stockholders officers and directors may be required to be found suitable as well regulatory authorities also have broad powers with respect to the licensing of casino operations and may revoke suspend condition or limit the gaming or other licenses of our tenants impose substantial fines or take other actions any one of which could adversely impact the business financial condition and results of operations of our tenants in addition in many jurisdictions licenses are granted for limited durations and require renewal from time to time 

in many jurisdictions gaming laws can require certain of our stockholders to file an application be investigated and qualify or have his her or its suitability determined by gaming authorities gaming authorities have very broad discretion in determining whether an applicant should be deemed suitable subject to certain administrative proceeding requirements the gaming regulators have the authority to deny any application or limit condition restrict revoke or suspend any license registration finding of suitability or approval or fine any person licensed registered or found suitable or approved for any cause deemed reasonable by the gaming authorities 

gaming authorities may conduct investigations into the conduct or associations of our directors officers key employees or investors to ensure compliance with applicable standards if we are required to be found suitable and are found suitable as a landlord we 

will be registered as a public company with the gaming authorities and will be subject to disciplinary action if after we receive notice that a person is unsuitable to be a stockholder or to have any other relationship with us we 

 many jurisdictions also require any person who acquires beneficial ownership of more than a certain percentage of voting securities of a gaming company and in some jurisdictions nonvoting securities typically 5 of a publiclytraded company to report the acquisition to gaming authorities and gaming authorities may require such holders to apply for qualification licensure or a finding of suitability subject to limited exceptions for “institutional investors” that hold a company’s voting securities for passive investment purposes only our outstanding shares of capital stock are held subject to applicable gaming laws any person owning or controlling at least 5 of the outstanding shares of any class of our capital stock is required to promptly notify us of such person’s identity some jurisdictions may also limit the number of gaming licenses in which a person may hold an ownership or a controlling interest 

further our directors officers key employees and investors in our shares must meet approval standards of certain gaming regulatory authorities if such gaming regulatory authorities were to find such a person or investor unsuitable we may be required to sever our relationship with that person or the investor may be required to dispose of his her or its interest in us our charter provides that all of our shares held by investors who are found to be unsuitable by regulatory authorities are subject to redemption upon our receipt of notice of such finding 

additionally because we and our tenants are subject to regulation in numerous jurisdictions and because regulatory agencies within each jurisdiction review compliance with gaming laws in other jurisdictions it is possible that gaming compliance issues in one jurisdiction may lead to reviews and compliance issues in other jurisdictions the loss of gaming licenses could result in an event of default under our certain of our indebtedness and crossdefault provisions in our debt agreements could cause an event of default under one debt agreement to trigger an event of default under our other debt agreements 

finally substantially all material loans significant acquisitions leases sales of securities and similar financing transactions by us and our subsidiaries must be reported to and in some cases approved by gaming authorities in advance of the transaction neither we nor any of our subsidiaries may make a public offering of securities without the prior approval of certain gaming authorities changes in control through merger consolidation stock or asset acquisitions management or consulting agreements or otherwise may be subject to receipt of prior approval of certain gaming authorities entities seeking to acquire control of us or one of our subsidiaries and certain of our affiliates must satisfy gaming authorities with respect to a variety of stringent standards prior to assuming control failure to satisfy the stringent licensing standards may preclude entities from acquiring control of us or one of our subsidiaries and certain of our affiliates andor require the entities to divest such control 

required regulatory approvals can delay or prohibit transfers of our gaming properties which could result in periods in which we are unable to receive rent for such properties and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition liquidity results of operations and prospects 

our tenants are and any future tenants of our gaming properties will be required to be licensed under applicable law in order to operate any of our properties as gaming facilities if the lease agreements or any future lease agreement we enter into are terminated which could be required by a regulatory agency or expire any new tenant must be licensed and receive other regulatory approvals to operate our properties as gaming facilities any delay in or inability of the new tenant to receive required licenses and other regulatory approvals from the applicable state and county government agencies may prolong the period during which we are unable to collect the applicable rent further in the event that the lease agreements or future lease agreements are terminated or expire and a new tenant is not licensed or fails to receive other regulatory approvals the properties may not be operated as gaming facilities and we will not be able to collect the applicable rent moreover we may be unable to transfer or sell the affected properties as gaming facilities which could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition liquidity results of operations and prospects 

tenants may choose not to renew the lease agreements 

the lease agreements each have an initial lease term of 15 years with the potential to extend the term for up to four additional fiveyear terms thereafter provided that for certain facilities the aggregate lease term including renewals is cutback to the extent it would otherwise exceed 80 of the remaining useful life of the applicable leased property solely at the option of the tenants upon completion of the eldorado transaction the initial lease term under each of the caesars lease agreements shall be extended such that the expiration of such initial lease term shall occur 15 years following the completion of the eldorado transaction at 

the expiration of the initial lease term or of any additional renewal term thereafter a tenant may choose not to renew the lease agreements if the lease agreements expire without renewal and we are not able to find suitable creditworthy tenants to replace a tenant on the same or more attractive terms our business financial condition liquidity results of operations and prospects may be materially and adversely affected including our ability to make distributions to our stockholders at the then current level or at all given the coterminous nature of the formation lease agreements and after completion of the eldorado transaction the caesars lease agreements this risk would be exacerbated if caesars or after completion of the eldorado transaction eldorado determined not to renew or was prohibited from renewing due to the remaining useful life of the leased property all such lease agreements at any one time 

net leases may not result in fair market lease rates over time which could negatively impact our results of operations and cash flows and reduce the amount of funds available to make distributions to stockholders 

all of our rental revenue is generated from the lease agreements which are triplenet leases and provide greater flexibility to the respective tenants related to the use of the applicable leased property than would be the case with ordinary property leases such as the right to freely sublease portions of each leased property to make alterations in the leased premises and to terminate the lease prior to its expiration under specified circumstances furthermore net leases typically have longer lease terms and thus there is an increased risk that contractual rental increases in future years will fail to result in fair market rental rates during those years as a result our results of operations and cash flows and distributions to our stockholders could be lower than they would otherwise be if we did not enter into a net lease 

the lease agreements may restrict our ability to sell the properties 

our ability to sell or dispose of our properties may be hindered by the fact that such properties are subject to the lease agreements as the terms of the lease agreements require that a purchaser assume the lease agreements or in certain cases enter into a severance lease with the tenants for the sold property on substantially the same terms as contained in the applicable lease agreement which may make our properties less attractive to a potential buyer than alternative properties that may be for sale 

we may fail to complete the eldorado transaction or may not complete it on the contemplated terms 

the completion of the eldorado transaction is subject to certain customary regulatory and other closing conditions many of which are beyond our control including the closing of the eldoradocaesars merger to which we are not a party which make the completion and timing thereof uncertain there can be no assurance that such conditions will be satisfied on the anticipated schedule or at all completion of certain of the transactions contemplated by the master transaction agreement such as the putcall agreement relating to the centaur properties the horseshoe baltimore rofr the las vegas rofr and certain lease modifications are subject to the negotiation of definitive documentation and while the principal terms of these transactions are specified in the master transaction agreement there can be no assurance that we will be successful in negotiating definitive documentation 

if one or more of the transactions contemplated by the eldorado transaction is not completed on the anticipated schedule on the contemplated terms or at all we could be subject to a number of risks that may adversely affect our business and the market price of our common stock including 

 we cannot provide any assurance that each of the transactions contemplated by the eldorado transaction will be completed or that there will not be a delay in the completion of any or all of these transactions if the eldorado transaction is not consummated our reputation in our industry and in the investment community could be damaged and the market price of our common stock could decline 

even if the eldorado transaction is completed we may not achieve the intended benefits and the eldorado transaction may disrupt our current plans or operations 

if the eldorado transaction is completed there can be no assurance that we will be able to realize the intended benefits of such transaction if the eldoradocaesars merger is consummated we may be obligated to complete the eldorado transaction even if during the pendency of the eldoradocaesars merger the finances and operations of eldorado are materially and adversely impacted moreover the limited contractual protections under our agreements with eldorado will not include a restrictions on certain asset sales by caesars b a right to automatically obtain liens on certain caesars property under certain circumstances if caesars refinances certain debt c a right to obtain the benefit of certain covenants if made by caesars if caesars refinances certain debt with debt provided by affiliates or insiders of caesars or d provisions designed to ensure that the guaranty and the associated leases will continue to remain in place if any lease is terminated without our express written consent all of which we are currently entitled to under our existing agreements with caesars 

if the eldorado transaction is consummated and we do not receive the amount of net proceeds from the settlement of the forward sale agreements that we expect we may incur a substantially greater amount of debt either through additional longterm debt financing under the bridge facilities or under our revolving credit facility this additional debt could materially and adversely affect us including by increasing our interest expense restricting our ability to engage in additional transactions or incur additional indebtedness or result in a downgrade or other adverse action with respect to our credit rating 

if we do not receive the amount of net proceeds from the settlement of the forward sale agreements that we expect we may be required to fund any shortfall with additional longterm debt borrowings under the bridge facilities or borrowings under our revolving credit facility equal to the difference to fund the purchase price and related fees and expenses our net consolidated borrowing costs will depend on our overall indebtedness our creditworthiness interest rates in effect from time to time including at the time we incur such debt the structure of our debt taxes and other factors no assurance can be given that longterm debt financing will be available to us on attractive terms or at all initially or to refinance any borrowings under the bridge facilities or borrowings under our revolving credit facility 

our credit ratings impact the cost and availability of borrowings and accordingly our cost of capital our credit ratings at any time will reflect each rating organization’s opinion of our financial strength operating performance and ability to meet our debt obligations there can be no assurance that we will achieve a particular rating or maintain a particular rating in the future any reduction in our credit ratings may limit our ability to borrow at interest rates consistent with the interest rates that have been available to us and may subject us to additional covenants under our debt instruments an inability to achieve or maintain expected credit ratings would materially and adversely affect our ability to obtain longterm debt financing or to refinance amounts borrowed under the bridge facilities or borrowings under our revolving credit facility 

the completion of the eldorado transaction is subject to the receipt of consents and approvals which cannot be assured or which may impose conditions that could have a material adverse effect on us 

completion of the eldorado transaction is conditioned upon the receipt of certain consents and approvals including without limitation gaming regulatory approvals although we have agreed to use our reasonable best efforts to obtain such consents and approvals there can be no assurance that these consents or approvals will be obtained and that the other conditions to completing these transactions will be satisfied in addition the governmental authorities from which the regulatory approvals are required may impose conditions on the completion of these transactions or require changes to the terms of the transaction documents such conditions or changes and the process of obtaining regulatory approvals could have the effect of delaying or impeding consummation of one or more of these transactions or of imposing additional costs or limitations on us following completion of the eldorado transaction any of which might have a material adverse effect on us following completion of the eldorado transaction 

we are subject to provisions under the respective transaction documents that in specified circumstances could require us to pay significant termination fees or liquidated damages to the sellers in the mta properties acquisitions 

the transaction documents for the eldorado transaction provide that in specified circumstances we could be required to pay significant termination fees or liquidated damages to the sellers if the eldorado transaction is terminated under certain circumstances we could become liable to eldorado for a termination fee of up to 750 million if we become obligated to pay a termination fee or liquidated damages the payment could have a material adverse effect on us 

if eldorado declares bankruptcy and such action results in a lease being recharacterized as a disguised financing transaction in its bankruptcy proceeding our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 

if eldorado declares bankruptcy our business could be materially and adversely affected if a bankruptcy court recharacterizes the cplv additional rent acquisition or the hlv additional rent acquisition as defined below as a disguised financing transaction in the event of recharacterization our claim under a lease agreement with respect to the additional rent acquired in 

the hlv additional rent acquisition and cplv additional rent acquisition could either be secured or unsecured generally the leases permit us to take steps to create and perfect a security interest in the leased property but such attempts could be subject to challenge by the tenant or its creditors and with respect to the cplv additional rent acquisition and the hlv additional rent acquisition there is no assurance that a court would find that portion of our claim to be secured the bankrupt lessee and other eldorado affiliates and their creditors under this scenario might have the ability to restructure the terms including the amount owed to us under the lease with respect to the additional rent if approved by the bankruptcy court we could be bound by the new terms and prevented from collecting such additional rent that we paid for in the cplv additional rent acquisition and hlv additional rent acquisition and our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 

properties within our portfolio are and properties that we may acquire in the future are likely to be operated and promoted under certain trademarks and brand names that we do not own 

most of the properties within our portfolio are currently operated and promoted under trademarks and brand names not owned by us including caesars horseshoe harrah’s bally’s margaritaville greektown jack hard rock century and mountaineer in addition properties that we may acquire in the future may be operated and promoted under these same trademarks and brand names or under different trademarks and brand names we do not or will not own during the term that our properties are managed by our tenants we will be reliant on our tenants to maintain and protect the trademarks brand names and other licensed intellectual property used in the operation or promotion of the leased properties operation of the leased properties as well as our business and financial condition could be adversely impacted by infringement invalidation unauthorized use or litigation affecting any such intellectual property moreover if any of our properties are rebranded unsuccessfully it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition liquidity results of operations and prospects as we may not enjoy comparable recognition or status under a new brand a transition of management away from a caesars or after the completion of the eldorado transaction eldorado penn national hard rock century casinos or jack entertainment entity could also have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition liquidity results of operations and prospects 

we have a substantial amount of indebtedness and may incur additional indebtedness in the future our substantial indebtedness exposes us to the risk of default under our debt obligations limits our operating flexibility increases the risks associated with a downturn in our business or in the businesses of our tenants and requires us to use a substantial portion of our cash to service our debt obligations 

we have a substantial amount of indebtedness and debt service requirements as of december 31 2019 we had approximately 48 billion in longterm indebtedness consisting of 

 in addition giving effect to the completion of our february 2020 notes offering which consisted of the issuance of 7500 million of 2025 notes 7500 million of 2027 notes and 10 billion of 2030 notes and the redemption and repayment of the second lien notes with a portion of the proceeds thereof as of february 20 2020 we had approximately 69 billion principal amount of indebtedness outstanding 

as of december 31 2019 we also have 10 billion of available capacity to borrow under our revolving credit facility 

our term loan b and revolving credit facility are collateralized by substantially all of our properties payments of principal and interest under this indebtedness or any other instruments governing debt we may incur in the future may leave us with insufficient cash resources to pursue our business and growth strategies or to pay the distributions currently contemplated or necessary to qualify or maintain qualification as a reit our substantial outstanding indebtedness or future indebtedness and the limitations imposed on us by our debt agreements could have other significant adverse consequences including the following 



 if any one of these events were to occur our financial condition results of operations cash flows the market price of our common stock and our ability to satisfy our debt service obligations and to pay distributions to our stockholders could be materially and adversely affected in addition the foreclosure on our properties could create reit taxable income without accompanying cash proceeds which could result in entity level taxes to us or could adversely affect our ability to meet the distribution requirements necessary to qualify or maintain qualification as a reit 

in addition the code generally requires that a reit distribute annually to its stockholders at least 90 of its reit taxable income with certain adjustments determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gains and that it pay tax at regular corporate rates to the extent that it distributes annually less than 100 of its reit taxable income including capital gains vici golf is also subject to us federal income tax at regular corporate rates on any of its taxable income in order to maintain our status as a reit and avoid or otherwise minimize current entitylevel us federal income taxes a substantial portion of our cash flow after operating expenses and debt service will be required to be distributed to our stockholders 

because of the limitations on the amount of cash available to us after satisfying our debt service obligations and our distribution obligations to maintain our status as a reit and avoid or otherwise minimize current entitylevel us federal income taxes our ability to pursue our business and growth strategies may be limited 

any mechanic’s liens or similar liens incurred by the tenants under the lease agreements may attach to and constitute liens on our interests in the properties 

to the extent the tenants under the lease agreements make any improvements these improvements could cause mechanic’s liens or similar liens to attach to and constitute liens on our interests in the properties to the extent that mechanic’s liens or similar liens are recorded against any of the properties or any properties we may acquire in the future the holders of such mechanic’s liens or similar liens may enforce them by court action and courts may cause the applicable properties or future properties to be sold to satisfy such liens which could negatively impact our revenues results of operations cash flows and distributions to our stockholders further holders of such liens could have priority over our stockholders in the event of bankruptcy or liquidation and as a result a trustee in bankruptcy may have difficulty realizing or foreclosing on such properties in any such bankruptcy or liquidation and the amount of distributions our stockholders could receive in such bankruptcy or liquidation could be reduced 

adverse changes in our credit rating may affect our borrowing capacity and borrowing terms 

our outstanding debt is periodically rated by nationally recognized credit rating agencies the credit ratings are based upon our operating performance liquidity and leverage ratios overall financial condition and other factors viewed by the credit rating agencies as relevant to both our industry and the economic outlook our credit rating may affect the amount of capital we can access as well as the terms of any financing we obtain because we rely in part on debt financing to fund growth the absence of an investment grade credit rating or any credit rating downgrade or negative outlook may have a negative effect on our future growth 

we will have future capital needs and may not be able to obtain additional financing on acceptable terms 

we may incur additional indebtedness in the future to refinance our existing indebtedness or to finance newly acquired properties or for general corporate or other purposes any significant additional indebtedness could require a substantial portion of our cash flow to make interest and principal payments due on our indebtedness greater demands on our cash resources may reduce funds available to us to pay distributions make capital expenditures and acquisitions or carry out other aspects of our business and growth strategies increased indebtedness can also limit our ability to adjust rapidly to changing market conditions make us more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions and create competitive disadvantages for us compared to other companies with relatively lower debt levels increased future debt service obligations may limit our operational and financial flexibility further to the extent we were required to incur indebtedness our future interest costs would increase thereby reducing our earnings and cash flows from what they otherwise would have been 

moreover our ability to obtain additional financing and satisfy our financial obligations under indebtedness outstanding from time to time will depend upon our future operating performance which is subject to then prevailing general economic and credit market conditions including interest rate levels and the availability of credit generally and financial business and other factors many of which are beyond our control the prolonged continuation or worsening of current credit market conditions would have a material adverse effect on our ability to obtain financing on favorable terms if at all 

we may be unable to obtain additional financing or financing on favorable terms or our operating cash flow may be insufficient to satisfy our financial obligations under indebtedness outstanding from time to time if any among other things the absence of an investment grade credit rating or any credit rating downgrade or negative outlook could increase our financing costs and could limit our access to financing sources if financing is not available when needed or is available on unfavorable terms we may be unable to pursue our business and growth strategies or otherwise take advantage of new business opportunities or respond to competitive pressures any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition liquidity results of operations and prospects we may raise additional funds in the future through the issuance of equity securities and as a result our stockholders may experience significant dilution which may adversely affect the market price of our common stock and make it more difficult for our stockholders to sell our shares at a time and price that they deem appropriate and could impair our future ability to raise capital through an offering of our equity securities 

our ability to refinance our indebtedness as it becomes due depends on many factors some of which are beyond our control 

our ability to refinance our existing indebtedness and any future indebtedness will depend in part on our current and projected financial condition liquidity and results of operations and economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors many of these factors are beyond our control we cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance any of our indebtedness as it becomes due on commercially reasonable terms or at all if we are not able to refinance our indebtedness as it becomes due we will be obligated to pay such indebtedness with cash from our operations and we may not have sufficient cash to do so which would have a material and adverse effect on us 

covenants in our debt agreements limit our operational flexibility and a covenant breach or default could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition liquidity results of operations and prospects 

the agreements governing our indebtedness contain customary covenants including restrictions on our ability to grant liens on our assets incur indebtedness sell assets make investments engage in acquisitions mergers or consolidations engage in transactions with affiliates and pay certain dividends and other restricted payments in addition we are required to comply with certain financial maintenance covenants these restrictions could seriously harm our business by among other things limiting our operational flexibility a breach of any of these covenants or covenants under any other agreements governing our indebtedness could result in an event of default crossdefault provisions in our debt agreements could cause an event of default under one debt agreement to trigger an event of default under our other debt agreements upon the occurrence of an event of default under any of our debt agreements the lenders could elect to declare all outstanding debt under such agreements to be immediately due and payable if we were unable to repay or refinance the accelerated debt the lenders could proceed against any assets pledged to secure any debt that is secured by such assets including foreclosing on or requiring the sale of our properties and our assets may not be sufficient to repay such debt in full covenants that limit our operational flexibility as well as defaults under our debt instruments could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition liquidity results of operations and prospects 

a rise in interest rates may increase our overall interest rate expense and could adversely affect our stock price 

a rise in interest rates may increase our overall interest rate expense and have an adverse impact on our ability to pay distributions to our stockholders the risk presented by holding variable rate indebtedness can be managed or mitigated by utilizing interest rate protection products however there is no assurance that we will utilize any of these products effectively or all or that such products will be available to us in addition in the event of a rise in interest rates new debt whether fixed or variable is likely to be more expensive which could among other things make the financing of any acquisition more expensive and we may be unable to incur new debt or replace maturing debt with new debt at equal or better interest rates 

further the dividend yield on our common stock as a percentage of the price of such common stock will influence the market price of such common stock thus an increase in market interest rates may lead prospective purchasers of our common stock to expect a higher dividend yield which would adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

we have engaged and may engage in hedging transactions that may limit gains or result in losses 

we use derivatives to hedge certain of our liabilities and we currently have interest rate swap agreements in place as of december 31 2019 we had in place six interest rate swap agreements with third party financial institutions having an aggregate notional amount of 20 billion the interest rate swap transactions are designated as cash flow hedges that effectively fix the libor component of the interest rate on a portion of the outstanding debt under the term loan b facility the counterparties of these arrangements are major financial institutions however we are exposed to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties this has certain risks including losses on a hedge position which may reduce the return on our investments such losses may exceed the amount invested in such instruments in addition counterparties to a hedging arrangement could default on their obligations we may have to pay certain costs such as transaction fees or breakage costs related to hedging transactions 

we may be adversely affected by changes in libor reporting practices the method in which libor is determined or the use of alternative reference rates 

our indebtedness under the term loan b facility and revolving credit facility bears interest at variable interest rates that use libor as a benchmark rate on july 27 2017 the united kingdom’s financial conduct authority which regulates libor announced that it intends to stop persuading or requiring banks to submit libor quotations after 2021 the “fca announcement” the fca announcement indicates that the continuation of libor on the current basis cannot and will not be assured after 2021 and as such libor may cease to exist or otherwise be unsuitable for use as a benchmark a change or transition away from libor as a common reference rate in the global financial market could have a material adverse effect on our business recent proposals for libor reforms may result in the establishment of new methods of calculating libor or the establishment of one or more alternative benchmark rates if libor ceases to exist we cannot predict what such successor rate would be utilized and the impact of such rate on us and we may determine that we need to negotiate an amendment to our term loan b facility and revolving credit facility with our lenders as a result our interest expense may increase our ability to refinance some or all of our existing indebtedness and our available cash flow may be adversely affected

the bankruptcy or insolvency of any tenant or guarantor could result in the termination of the lease agreements and the related guarantees and material losses to us 

we are subject to the credit risk of our tenants we cannot assure you that our tenants will not default on their leases and fail to make rental payments to us in particular disruptions in the financial and credit markets local economic conditions and other factors affecting the gaming industry may affect our tenants’ ability to obtain financing to operate their businesses or continue to profitability execute their business plans this in turn may cause our tenants to be unable to meet their financial obligations including making rental payments to us which may result in their bankruptcy or insolvency in the event of a bankruptcy of caesars crc or after the completion of the eldorado transaction eldorado penn national hard rock century casinos or jack entertainment any claim for damages under the applicable guarantee may not be paid in full furthermore although the tenants’ performance and payments under the caesars lease agreements are guaranteed by caesars or crc or after the completion of the eldorado transaction eldorado as the case may be a default by the applicable tenant under the caesars lease agreements or by the applicable guarantor with regard to its guarantee may cause a default under certain circumstances with regard to the entire portfolio covered by the caesars lease agreements in event of a bankruptcy there can be no assurances that the tenants or the applicable guarantor would assume the caesars lease agreements or the related guarantees and if the caesars lease agreements or guarantees were rejected the tenant or the guarantors as applicable may not have sufficient funds to pay the damages that would be owed to us a result of the rejection and we might not be able to find a replacement tenant on the same or better terms for these and other reasons the bankruptcy of one or more tenants caesars crc or after the completion of the eldorado transaction eldorado penn national hard rock century casinos or jack entertainment would have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition liquidity results of operations and prospects 

our pursuit of investments in and acquisitions of additional properties may be unsuccessful or fail to meet our expectations 

we intend to continue to pursue acquisitions of additional properties and seek acquisitions and other strategic opportunities accordingly we may often be engaged in evaluating potential transactions and other strategic alternatives in addition from time to time we may engage in discussions that may result in one or more transactions although there is uncertainty that any of these discussions will result in definitive agreements or the completion of any transaction we may devote a significant amount of our management resources to such a transaction which could negatively impact our operations we may incur significant costs in connection with seeking acquisitions or other strategic opportunities regardless of whether the transaction is completed and to the extent applicable in combining our operations if such a transaction is completed 

we operate in a highly competitive industry and face competition from other reits investment companies private equity and hedge fund investors sovereign funds lenders gaming companies and other investors some of whom are significantly larger and have greater resources access to capital and lower costs of capital increased competition will make it more challenging to identify and successfully capitalize on acquisition opportunities that meet our investment objectives if we cannot identify and purchase a sufficient quantity of gaming properties and other experiential properties at favorable prices or if we are unable to finance acquisitions on commercially favorable terms our business financial condition liquidity results of operations and prospects could be materially and adversely affected additionally the fact that we must distribute 90 of our reit taxable income in order to maintain our qualification as a reit may limit our ability to rely upon rental payments from our leased properties or subsequently acquired properties in order to finance acquisitions as a result if debt or equity financing is not available on acceptable terms further acquisitions might be limited or curtailed 

investments in and acquisitions of gaming properties and other experiential properties we might seek to acquire entail risks associated with real estate investments generally including that the investment’s performance will fail to meet expectations that the cost estimates for necessary property improvements will prove inaccurate or the operator or manager will underperform real estate development projects present other risks including construction delays or cost overruns that increase expenses the inability to obtain required zoning occupancy and other governmental approvals and permits on a timely basis and the incurrence of significant development costs prior to completion of the project 

further even if we were able to acquire additional properties in the future there is no guarantee that such properties would be able to maintain their historical performance which may prevent the ability of our tenants to pay the partial or total amount of the required lease payments under the respective lease agreements in addition our financing of these acquisitions could negatively impact our cash flows and liquidity require us to incur substantial debt or involve the issuance of substantial new equity which would be dilutive to existing stockholders we have a substantial amount of indebtedness outstanding which may affect our ability to pay distributions may expose us to interest rate fluctuation risk and may expose us to the risk of default under our debt obligations in addition we cannot assure you that we will be successful in implementing our business and growth strategies or that any expansion will improve operating results the failure to identify and acquire new properties effectively or the failure of any acquired properties to perform as expected could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition liquidity results of operations and prospects and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders 

we may sell or divest different properties or assets after an evaluation of our portfolio of businesses such sales or divestitures would affect our costs revenues results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

from time to time we may evaluate our properties and may as a result sell or attempt to sell divest or spinoff different properties or assets subject to the terms of the lease agreements these sales or divestitures would affect our costs revenues results of operations financial condition liquidity and our ability to comply with financial covenants divestitures have inherent risks including possible delays in closing transactions including potential difficulties in obtaining regulatory approvals the risk of lowerthanexpected sales proceeds for the divested businesses and potential postclosing claims for indemnification in addition current economic conditions at the time and relatively illiquid real estate markets may result in fewer potential bidders and unsuccessful sales efforts 

our properties are subject to risks from natural disasters such as earthquakes hurricanes severe weather and terrorism 

our properties are located in areas that may be subject to natural disasters such as earthquakes and extreme weather conditions including but not limited to hurricanes such natural disasters or extreme weather conditions may interrupt operations at the casinos damage our properties and reduce the number of customers who visit our facilities in such areas a severe earthquake could damage or destroy our properties in addition our operations could be adversely impacted by a drought or other cause of water shortage a severe drought of extensive duration experienced in las vegas or in the other regions in which we operate could adversely affect the business and financial results at our properties although the tenants are required to maintain both property and business interruption insurance coverage such coverage is subject to deductibles and limits on maximum benefits including limitation on the coverage period for business interruption and we cannot assure you that we or the tenants will be able to fully insure such losses or fully collect if at all on claims resulting from such natural disasters while the lease agreements require and new lease agreements are expected to require that comprehensive insurance and hazard insurance be maintained by the tenants there are certain types of losses generally of a catastrophic nature such as earthquakes hurricanes and floods that may be uninsurable or not economically insurable insurance coverage may not be sufficient to pay the full current market value or current replacement cost of a loss inflation changes in building codes and ordinances environmental considerations and other factors also might make it infeasible to use insurance proceeds to replace the property after such property has been damaged or destroyed under such circumstances the insurance proceeds received might not be adequate to restore the economic position with respect to such property if we experience a loss that is uninsured or that exceeds our policy coverage limits we could lose the capital invested in the damaged properties as well as the anticipated future cash flows from those properties 

terrorist attacks or other acts of violence may result in declining economic activity which could harm the demand for goods and services offered by our tenants and the value of our properties and might adversely affect the value of an investment in our common stock such a resulting decrease in retail demand could make it difficult for us to renew or release our properties to suitable creditworthy tenants at lease rates equal to or above historical rates terrorist activities or violence also could directly affect the value of our properties through damage destruction or loss and the availability of insurance for such acts or of insurance generally might be lower or cost more which could increase our operating expenses and adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows to the extent that any of our tenants is affected by future terrorist attacks or violence its business similarly could be adversely affected including the ability of our tenants to continue to meet their obligations to us these events might erode business and consumer confidence and spending and might result in increased volatility in national and international financial markets and economies any one of these events might decrease demand for real estate decrease or delay the occupancy of our new or redeveloped properties and limit our access to capital or increase our cost of raising capital 

in addition the noncplv lease agreement allows the tenant to remove a property from the noncplv lease agreement and each of our lease agreements excluding the noncplv lease agreement may be terminated by the applicable tenant if i a casualty event occurs a in the case of the noncplv lease agreement the cplv lease agreement the joliet lease agreement and the hlv lease agreement during the final two years of the term and b in the case of the hard rock cincinnati lease agreement the century portfolio lease agreement and the jack clevelandthistledown lease agreement the final year of the term and ii the cost to rebuild or restore the applicable property in connection with a casualty event exceeds 25 or in the case of the century portfolio lease agreement 50 of such property’s total property fair market value similarly if a condemnation event occurs that renders a facility unsuitable for its primary intended use the applicable tenants may remove the property from the noncplv lease agreement and may terminate the cplv lease agreement the joliet lease agreement the hlv lease agreement the hard rock cincinnati lease agreement the century portfolio lease agreement or the jack clevelandthistledown lease agreement as the case may be the penn national lease agreements allows the tenants to terminate their respective leases during the final year of the lease term if 50 or more of the square feet of the improvements are destroyed by a casualty event such that the improvements are rendered substantially untenantable if a condemnation event occurs that renders margaritaville or greektown reasonably uneconomical for the operation of the improvements thereon on a commercially practicable basis for their permitted use as rentable facilities capable of producing a fair and reasonable net income therefrom the tenant may terminate the margaritaville lease agreement or the greektown lease agreement respectively if a property is removed from the noncplv lease agreement or if the cplv lease agreement the joliet lease agreement the hlv lease agreement the penn national lease agreements the hard rock cincinnati lease agreement the century portfolio lease agreement or the jack thistledowncleveland lease agreement as the case may be is terminated we will lose the rent associated with the related facility which would have a negative impact on our financial results in this event following termination of the lease of a property even if we are able to restore the affected property we could be limited to selling or leasing such property to a new tenant in order to obtain an alternate source of revenue which may not happen on comparable terms or at all 

changes in building andor zoning laws may require us to update a property in the event of recapture or prevent us from fully restoring a property in the event of a substantial casualty loss andor require us to meet additional or more stringent construction requirements 

due to changes among other things in applicable building and zoning laws ordinances and codes that may affect certain of our properties that have come into effect after the initial construction of the properties certain properties may not comply fully with current building andor zoning laws including electrical fire health and safety codes and regulations use lot coverage parking and setback requirements but may qualify as permitted nonconforming uses although the lease agreements require our tenants to pay for and ensure continued compliance with applicable law there is no assurance that future leases will be negotiated on the same basis or that our tenants will make any changes required by the terms of the lease agreements andor any future leases we may enter into in addition such changes may limit a tenant’s ability to restore the premises of a property to its previous condition in the event of a substantial casualty loss with respect to the property or the ability to refurbish expand or renovate such property to remain compliant or increase the cost of construction in order to comply with changes in building or zoning codes and regulations if a tenant is unable to restore a property to its prior use after a substantial casualty loss or is required to comply with more stringent building or zoning codes and regulations we may be unable to release the space at a comparable effective rent or sell the property at an acceptable price which may materially and adversely affect our business financial condition liquidity results of operations and prospects 

certain properties are subject to restrictions pursuant to reciprocal easement agreements operating agreements or similar agreements 

many of the properties that we own are and properties that we may acquire in the future may be subject to use restrictions andor operational requirements imposed pursuant to ground leases restrictive covenants or conditions reciprocal easement agreements or operating agreements or other instruments that could among other things adversely affect our ability to lease space to third parties such property restrictions could include the following limitations on alterations changes expansions or reconfiguration 

of properties limitations on use of properties limitations affecting parking requirements or restrictions on exterior or interior signage or facades in certain cases consent of the other party or parties to such agreements may be required when altering reconfiguring expanding or redeveloping failure to secure such consents when necessary may harm our ability to execute leasing strategies which could adversely affect us 

the loss of the services of key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business 

our success and ability to grow depends in large part upon the leadership and performance of our executive management team particularly our chief executive officer our president and chief operating officer our chief financial officer and our general counsel any unforeseen loss of our executive officers’ services or any negative market or industry perception with respect to them or arising from their loss could have a material adverse effect on our business we do not have key man or similar life insurance policies covering members of our senior management we have employment agreements with our executive officers but these agreements do not guarantee that any given executive will remain with us and there can be no assurance that any such officers will remain with us the appointment or replacement of certain key members of our executive management team is subject to regulatory approvals based upon suitability determinations by gaming regulatory authorities in the jurisdictions where our properties are located if any of our executive officers is found unsuitable by any such gaming regulatory authorities or if we otherwise lose their services we would have to find alternative candidates and may not be able to successfully manage our business or achieve our business objectives 

environmental compliance costs and liabilities associated with real estate properties owned by us may materially impair the value of those investments 

as an owner of real property we are subject to various federal state and local environmental and health and safety laws and regulations although we do not operate or manage most of our properties we may be held primarily or jointly and severally liable for costs relating to the investigation and cleanup of any property from which there has been a release or threatened release of a regulated material as well as other affected properties regardless of whether we knew of or caused the release and to preserve claims for damages further some environmental laws create a lien on a contaminated site in favor of the government for damages and the costs the government incurs in connection with such contamination 

although under the lease agreements the tenants are required to indemnify us for certain environmental liabilities including environmental liabilities it causes the amount of such liabilities could exceed the financial ability of the applicable tenants to indemnify us in addition the presence of contamination or the failure to remediate contamination may adversely affect our ability to sell or lease our properties or to borrow using our properties as collateral 

we may be required to contribute insurance proceeds with respect to casualty events at our properties to the lenders under our debt financing agreements 

in the event that we were to receive insurance proceeds with respect to a casualty event at any of our properties we may be required under the terms of our debt financing agreements to contribute all or a portion of those proceeds to the repayment of such debt which may prevent us from restoring such properties to their prior state if the remainder of the proceeds after any such required repayment were insufficient to make the repairs necessary to restore the damaged properties to a condition substantially equivalent to its state immediately prior to the casualty we may not have sufficient liquidity to otherwise fund these repairs and may be required to obtain additional financing which could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition liquidity results of operations and prospects 

if we fail to establish and maintain an effective system of integrated internal controls we may not be able to report our financial results accurately which could have a material adverse effect on us 

as a reporting company we are required to develop and implement substantial control systems policies and procedures in order to satisfy our periodic sec reporting requirements we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully develop and implement these systems policies and procedures and to operate our company or that any such development and implementation will be effective failure to do so could jeopardize our status as a reit or as a reporting company and the loss of such statuses would materially and adversely affect us if we fail to develop implement or maintain proper overall business controls including as required to support our growth our operating and financial results could be harmed or we could fail to meet our reporting obligations in addition the existence of a material weakness or significant deficiency could result in errors in our financial statements that could require a restatement cause us to fail to meet our sec reporting obligations and cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information which could have a material adverse effect on us and on the market price of our common stock

climate change may adversely affect our business 

climate change including rising sea levels extreme weather and changes in precipitation and temperature may result in physical damage to a decrease in demand for andor a decrease in rent from and value of our properties located in the areas affected by these conditions we own a number of assets in lowlying areas close to sea level making those assets susceptible to a rise in sea level if sea levels were to rise we may incur material costs to protect our lowlying assets to the extent not covered by our tenants under the terms of our leases or may sustain damage a decrease in value or total loss of such assets in addition climate change may result in reduced economic activity in these areas which could harm the operations of our tenants and reduce the demand at our properties which could reduce the rent payable to us under our triplenet leases and make it difficult for us to renew or release our properties on favorable lease terms  furthermore our insurance premiums may increase as a result of the threat of climate change or the effects of climate change may not be covered by our insurance policies in addition changes in federal and state legislation and regulations on climate change could result in increased capital expenditures to improve the energy efficiency of our existing properties or other related aspects of our properties in order to comply with such regulations or otherwise adapt to climate change any of the above could have a material and adverse effect on us 

if our separation from ceoc together with certain related transactions does not qualify as a transaction that is generally taxfree for us federal income tax purposes ceoc could be subject to significant tax liabilities and in certain circumstances we could be required to indemnify ceoc for material taxes pursuant to indemnification obligations under the tax matters agreement 

the irs issued a private letter ruling with respect to certain issues relevant to our separation from ceoc including relating to the separation and certain related transactions as taxfree for us federal income tax purposes under certain provisions of the code the irs ruling does not address certain requirements for taxfree treatment of the separation ceoc received from its tax advisors a tax opinion substantially to the effect that with respect to such requirements on which the irs did not rule such requirements should be satisfied the irs ruling and the tax opinion that ceoc received relied on among other things certain representations assumptions and undertakings including those relating to the past and future conduct of our business and the irs ruling and the opinion would not be valid if such representations assumptions and undertakings were incorrect in any material respect 

notwithstanding the irs ruling and the tax opinion the irs could determine the separation should be treated as a taxable transaction for us federal income tax purposes if it determines any of the representations assumptions or undertakings that were included in the request for the irs ruling are false or have been violated or if it disagrees with the conclusions in the opinion that are not covered by the irs ruling 

if the reorganization fails to qualify for taxfree treatment in general ceoc would be subject to tax as if it had sold our assets to us in a taxable sale for their fair market value and ceoc’s creditors who received shares of our common stock pursuant to the 

plan of reorganization would be subject to tax as if they had received a taxable distribution in respect of their claims equal to the fair market value of such shares 

under the tax matters agreement that we entered into with caesars we generally are required to indemnify caesars against any tax resulting from the separation to the extent that such tax resulted from certain of our representations or undertakings being incorrect or violated our indemnification obligations to caesars are not limited by any maximum amount as a result if we are required to indemnify caesars or such other persons under the circumstances set forth in the tax matters agreement we may be subject to substantial liabilities 

risks related to our status as a reit 

we may not qualify or maintain our qualification as a reit 

we elected to be taxed as a reit for us federal income tax purposes commencing with our taxable year ended december 31 2017 and expect to operate in a manner that will allow us to continue to be classified as such the code generally requires that a reit distribute annually to its stockholders at least 90 of its reit taxable income with certain adjustments determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gains and that it pay tax at regular corporate rates to the extent that it distributes annually less than 100 of its reit taxable income including capital gains in addition a reit is required to pay a 4 nondeductible excise tax on the amount if any by which the distributions it makes in a calendar year are less than the sum of 85 of its ordinary income 95 of its capital gain net income and 100 of its undistributed income from prior years as a result in order to avoid or otherwise minimize current entity level us federal income taxes a substantial portion of our cash flow after operating expenses and debt service will be required to be distributed to our stockholders 

if we were to fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year we would be subject to us federal income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates and dividends paid to our stockholders would not be deductible by us in computing our reit taxable income any resulting corporate tax liability could be substantial and would reduce the amount of cash available for distribution to our stockholders which in turn could have an adverse impact on the market price of our common stock unless we were entitled to relief under certain code provisions we also would be disqualified from reelecting to be taxed as a reit for the four taxable years following the year in which we failed to qualify as a reit as a result the amount available for distribution to holders of equity securities that would otherwise receive dividends would be reduced for the year or years involved furthermore the us federal income tax consequences of distributions and sales of our shares to certain of our stockholders could be adversely impacted if we were to fail to qualify as a reit 

finally our qualification to be taxed as a reit will depend on our satisfaction of certain asset income organizational distribution stockholder ownership and other requirements on a continuing basis our ability to satisfy the asset tests depends upon our analysis of the characterization and fair market values of our assets some of which are not susceptible to a precise determination and for which we may not obtain independent appraisals any failure to qualify to be taxed as a reit or failure to remain to be qualified to be taxed as a reit would have a material and adverse effect on us 

qualification to be taxed as a reit involves highly technical and complex provisions of the code and violations of these provisions could jeopardize our reit qualification 

qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex code provisions for which only limited judicial and administrative authorities exist even a technical or inadvertent violation could jeopardize our reit qualification our qualification as a reit depends on our satisfaction of certain asset income organizational distribution stockholder ownership and other requirements on a continuing basis in addition our ability to satisfy the requirements to qualify as a reit may depend in part on the actions of third parties over which we have no control or only limited influence including in cases where we own an equity interest in an entity that is classified as a partnership for us federal income tax purposes 

we may in the future choose to pay dividends in the form of our own common stock in which case stockholders may be required to pay income taxes in excess of the cash dividends they receive 

we may seek in the future to distribute taxable dividends that are payable in cash or our common stock taxable stockholders receiving such dividends will be required to include the full amount of the dividend as ordinary income to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits for us federal income tax purposes as to which noncorporate stockholders will generally be eligible for a deduction equal to 20 of such distributions as a result stockholders receiving dividends in the form of common stock may be required to pay income taxes with respect to such dividends in excess of the cash dividends received if any if a us stockholder sells the common stock that it receives as a dividend in order to pay this tax the sales proceeds may be less than the amount included in income with respect to the dividend depending on the market price of our common stock at the time of the sale in addition in such case a us stockholder could have a capital loss with respect to the common stock sold that could not be used to offset such dividend income moreover with respect to certain nonus stockholders we may be required to withhold 

us federal income tax with respect to such dividends including in respect of all or a portion of such dividend that is payable in common stock furthermore such a taxable share dividend could be viewed as equivalent to a reduction in our cash distributions and that factor as well as the possibility that a significant number of our stockholders determine to sell our common stock in order to pay taxes owed on dividends may put downward pressure on the market price of our common stock 

changes to the us federal income tax laws including the recent enactment of certain tax reform measures could have a material and adverse effect on us 

us federal income tax laws governing reits and other corporations and the administrative interpretations of those laws may be amended at any time potentially with retroactive effect we cannot predict whether when or to what extent new us federal tax laws regulations interpretations or rulings will be issued prospective investors are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding the effect of potential changes to the us federal tax laws on an investment in our common stock 

changes to the us federal income tax laws could have a material and adverse effect on us for example certain changes in law pursuant to the law known as the tax cuts and jobs act could reduce the relative competitive advantage of operating as a reit as compared with operating as a c corporation including by 

 we could fail to qualify to be taxed as a reit if income we receive from our tenants is not treated as qualifying income 

under applicable provisions of the code we will not be treated as a reit unless we satisfy various requirements including requirements relating to the sources of our gross income rents received or accrued by us from our tenants will not be treated as qualifying rent for purposes of these requirements if the leases are not respected as true leases for us federal income tax purposes and instead are treated as service contracts joint ventures financings or some other type of arrangement if some or all of our leases are not respected as true leases for us federal income tax purposes we may fail to qualify to be taxed as a reit furthermore our qualification as a reit will depend on our satisfaction of certain asset income organizational distribution stockholder ownership and other requirements on a continuing basis our ability to satisfy the asset tests depends upon our analysis of the characterization and fair market values of our assets some of which are not susceptible to a precise determination and for which we may not obtain independent appraisals 

in addition subject to certain exceptions rents received or accrued by us from any tenant or affiliated tenants will not be treated as qualifying rent for purposes of these requirements if we or an actual or constructive owner of 10 or more of our stock actually or constructively owns 10 or more of the total combined voting power of all classes of such tenant’s stock entitled to vote or 10 or more of the total value of all classes of such tenant’s stock our charter provides restrictions on ownership and transfer of our shares of stock including restrictions on such ownership or transfer that would cause the rents received or accrued by us from tenants to be treated as nonqualifying rent for purposes of the reit gross income requirements nevertheless there can be no assurance that such restrictions will be effective in ensuring that rents received or accrued by us from tenants will not be treated as qualifying rent for purposes of reit qualification requirements 

reit distribution requirements could adversely affect our ability to execute our business plan 

we generally must distribute annually to our stockholders at least 90 of our reit taxable income with certain adjustments determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding any net capital gains in order for us to qualify as a reit so that us federal corporate income tax does not apply to our earnings that we distribute to the extent that we satisfy this distribution requirement and qualify for taxation as a reit but distribute less than 100 of our reit taxable income determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and including any net capital gains we will be subject to us federal corporate income tax on any undistributed portion of such taxable income in addition we will be subject to a 4 nondeductible excise tax if the actual amount that we distribute to our stockholders in a calendar year is less than a minimum amount specified under us federal tax laws we intend to make distributions to our stockholders to comply with the reit requirements of the code and to avoid or otherwise minimize paying entity level federal or excise tax other than at any taxable reit subsidiary of ours we may generate taxable income greater than our income for financial reporting purposes prepared in accordance with gaap further we may generate taxable income greater than our cash flow from operations after operating expenses and debt service as a result of differences in timing between the recognition of taxable income and the actual receipt of cash or the effect of nondeductible capital expenditures the creation of reserves or required debt or amortization payments in order to avoid or otherwise minimize current 

entity level us federal income taxes we will generally be required to distribute sufficient cash flow after operating expenses and debt service payments to satisfy the reit distribution requirements while we intend to make distributions to our stockholders to comply with the reit requirements of the code we may not have sufficient liquidity to meet the reit distribution requirements if our cash flow is insufficient to satisfy the reit distribution requirements we could be required to raise capital on unfavorable terms sell assets at disadvantageous prices distribute amounts that would otherwise be invested in future acquisitions or issue dividends in the form of shares of our common stock to make distributions sufficient to enable us to pay out enough of our reit taxable income to satisfy the reit distribution requirement and to avoid or otherwise minimize corporate income tax and the 4 excise tax in a particular year these alternatives could increase our costs or change the value of our equity thus compliance with the reit requirements may hinder our ability to grow which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

even if we qualify as a reit we may face other tax liabilities that reduce our cash flow 

even if we qualify for taxation as a reit we may be subject to certain us federal state and local taxes on our income and assets including taxes on any undistributed income and state or local income property and transfer taxes for example in order to meet the reit qualification requirements we currently hold and expect in the future to hold some of our assets and conduct certain of our activities through one or more taxable reit subsidiaries or other subsidiary corporations that will be subject to federal state and local corporatelevel income taxes as regular c corporations ie corporations generally subject to corporatelevel income tax under subchapter c of chapter 1 the code in addition we may incur a 100 excise tax on transactions with a taxable reit subsidiary if they are not conducted on an arm’s length basis any of these taxes would decrease cash available for distribution to our stockholders 

complying with reit requirements may cause us to liquidate or forgo otherwise attractive opportunities and limit our expansion opportunities 

to qualify as a reit for us federal income tax purposes we must continually satisfy tests concerning among other things our sources of income the nature of our investments in real estate and related assets the amounts we distribute to our stockholders and the ownership of our stock we may also be required to make distributions to stockholders at disadvantageous times or when we do not have funds readily available for distribution 

as a reit we must ensure that at the end of each calendar quarter at least 75 of the value of our assets consists of cash cash items government securities and “real estate assets” as defined in the code including certain mortgage loans and securities the remainder of our investments other than government securities qualified real estate assets and securities issued by a taxable reit subsidiary generally cannot include more than 10 of the outstanding voting securities of any one issuer or more than 10 of the total value of the outstanding securities of any one issuer in addition in general no more than 5 of the value of our total assets other than government securities qualified real estate assets and securities issued by a taxable reit subsidiary can consist of the securities of any one issuer and no more than 20 of the value of our total assets can be represented by securities of one or more taxable reit subsidiaries in addition not more than 25 of our total assets may be represented by debt instruments issued by publicly offered reits that are “nonqualified” debt instruments if we fail to comply with these requirements at the end of any calendar quarter we must correct the failure within 30 days after the end of the calendar quarter or qualify for certain statutory relief provisions to avoid losing our reit qualification and suffering adverse tax consequences as a result we may be required to liquidate from our portfolio or contribute to a taxable reit subsidiary or forgo otherwise attractive investments in order to maintain our qualification as a reit these actions could have the effect of reducing our income and amounts available for distribution to our stockholders in addition to the asset tests set forth above to qualify as a reit we must continually satisfy tests concerning among other things the sources of our income the amounts we distribute to our stockholders and the ownership of our stock we may be unable to pursue investments that would be otherwise advantageous to us in order to satisfy the sourceofincome or assetdiversification requirements for qualifying as a reit thus compliance with the reit requirements may hinder our ability to make certain attractive investments 

we may be subject to builtin gains tax on the disposition of certain of our properties 

if we acquire certain properties in taxdeferred transactions which properties were held by one or more c corporations before they were held by us we may be subject to a builtin gain tax on future disposition of such properties this is the case with respect to all or substantially all of the properties acquired from ceoc pursuant to the formation transactions as well as certain other properties we have acquired and may acquire in the future if we dispose of any such properties during the fiveyear period following acquisition of the properties from the respective c corporation ie during the fiveyear period following ownership of such properties by a reit we will be subject to us federal income tax and applicable state and local taxes at the highest corporate tax rates on any gain recognized from the disposition of such properties to the extent of the excess of the fair market value of the properties on the date that they were contributed to or acquired by us in a taxdeferred transaction over the adjusted tax basis of such properties on such date which are referred to as builtin gains similarly if we recognize certain other income considered to be builtin income during the fiveyear period following the property acquisitions described above we could be subject to us 

federal tax under the builtingains tax rules we would be subject to this corporatelevel tax liability without the benefit of the deduction for dividends paid even if we qualify and maintain our status as a reit any recognized builtin gain will retain its character as ordinary income or capital gain and will be taken into account in determining reit taxable income and the reit distribution requirements any tax on the recognized builtin gain will reduce reit taxable income we may choose to forego otherwise attractive opportunities to sell assets in a taxable transaction during the fiveyear builtingain recognition period in order to avoid this builtingain tax however there can be no assurance that such a taxable transaction will not occur the amount of any such builtingain tax could be material and the resulting tax liability could have a negative effect on our cash flow and limit our ability to pay distributions required to qualify and maintain our status as a reit 

complying with reit requirements may limit our ability to hedge effectively and may cause us to incur tax liabilities 

the reit provisions of the code substantially limit our ability to hedge our assets and liabilities income from certain hedging transactions that we may enter into to manage risk of interest rate changes with respect to borrowings made or to be made to acquire or carry real estate assets or from transactions to manage risk of currency fluctuations with respect to any item of income or gain that satisfy the reit gross income tests including gain from the termination of such a transaction does not constitute “gross income” for purposes of the 75 or 95 gross income tests that apply to reits provided that certain identification requirements are met to the extent that we enter into other types of hedging transactions or fail to properly identify such transaction as a hedge the income is likely to be treated as nonqualifying income for purposes of both of the gross income tests as a result of these rules we may be required to limit our use of advantageous hedging techniques or implement those hedges through a taxable reit subsidiary this could increase the cost of our hedging activities because the taxable reit subsidiary may be subject to tax on gains or expose us to greater risks associated with changes in interest rates that we would otherwise want to bear in addition losses in the taxable reit subsidiary will generally not provide any tax benefit except that such losses could theoretically be carried back or forward against past or future taxable income of the taxable reit subsidiary 

we may pay a purging distribution if any in common stock and cash 

in order to qualify as a reit we must distribute any “earnings and profits” as defined in the code accumulated by us during any period for which we did not qualify as a reit or by any entity whose accumulated earnings and profits we acquire during any period for which such entity did not qualify as a reit such distribution requirement applied to any earnings and profits that were allocated from ceoc to us in connection with the formation transactions by the end of the first taxable year in which we elected reit status based on our analysis we do not believe that any earnings and profits were allocated to us in connection with the formation transactions or any other transaction to which we are party and therefore did not make a purging distribution and do not currently intend to make any purging distribution with respect to transactions to which we are a party if we are required to make a purging distribution in the future we may pay the purging distribution to our stockholders in a combination of cash and shares of our common stock each of our stockholders will be permitted to elect to receive the stockholder’s entire entitlement under the purging distribution in either cash or shares of our common stock subject to a cash limitation if our stockholders elect to receive a portion of cash in excess of the cash limitation each such electing stockholder will receive a pro rata portion of cash corresponding to the stockholder’s respective entitlement under the purging distribution declaration the irs has issued a revenue procedure that provides that so long as a reit complied with certain provisions therein certain distributions that are paid partly in cash and partly in stock will be treated as taxable dividends that would satisfy the reit distribution requirements and qualify for the dividends paid deduction for us federal income tax purposes in a purging distribution if any a stockholder of our common stock will be required to report dividend income equal to the amount of cash and common stock received as a result of the purging distribution even though we may distribute no cash or only nominal amounts of cash to such stockholder 

the cash available for distribution to stockholders may not be sufficient to pay dividends at expected levels nor can we assure you of our ability to make distributions in the future we may use borrowed funds to make distributions 

if cash available for distribution is less than the amount necessary to make cash distributions our inability to make the expected distributions could result in a decrease in the market price of our common stock all distributions will be made at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon various factors including but not limited to our historical and projected financial condition cash flows results of operations and reit taxable income limitations contained in financing instruments debt service requirements operating cash inflows and outflows including capital expenditures and acquisitions limitations on our ability to use cash generated in one or more taxable reit subsidiaries if any to fund distributions and applicable law we may not be able to make distributions in the future in addition some of our distributions may include a return of capital to the extent that we decide to make distributions in excess of our current and accumulated earnings and profits in the future such distributions would generally be considered a return of capital for federal income tax purposes to the extent of the holder’s adjusted tax basis in their shares a return of capital is not taxable but it has the effect of reducing the holder’s adjusted tax basis in our common stock to the extent that such distributions exceed the adjusted tax basis of a holder’s shares they will be treated as gain from the sale or exchange of such stock if we borrow to fund distributions our future interest costs would increase thereby reducing our earnings and cash available for distribution from what they otherwise would have been 

for purposes of satisfying the minimum distribution requirement to qualify for and maintain reit status our reit taxable income will be calculated without reference to our cash flow consequently under certain circumstances we may not have available cash to make our required distributions and we may need to raise additional equity or debt in order to fund our intended distributions or we may distribute a portion of our distributions in the form of our common stock or debt instruments which could result in dilution or higher leverage while the irs has issued a revenue procedure indicating that certain distributions that are made partly in cash and partly in stock will be treated as taxable dividends that would satisfy that reit annual distribution requirement and qualify for the dividends paid deduction for us federal income tax purposes no assurance can be provided that we will be able to satisfy the requirements of the revenue procedure therefore it is unclear whether and to what extent we will be able to make taxable dividends payable inkind in addition to the extent we were to make distributions that include our common stock or debt instruments a stockholder of ours will be required to report dividend income as a result of such distributions even though we distributed no cash or only nominal amounts of cash to such stockholder 

the us federal income tax treatment of the cash that we might receive from cash settlement of forward sale agreements is unclear and could jeopardize our ability to meet the reit qualification requirements 

in the event that we elect to settle the forward sale agreements for cash and the settlement price is below the applicable forward sale price we would be entitled to receive a cash payment from the forward purchasers under section 1032 of the code generally no gains and losses are recognized by a corporation in dealing in its own shares including pursuant to a “securities futures contract” as defined in the code by reference to the exchange act although we believe that any amount received by us in exchange for our shares of common stock would qualify for the exemption under section 1032 of the code because it is not entirely clear whether a forward sale agreement qualifies as a “securities futures contract” the us federal income tax treatment of any cash settlement payment we receive is uncertain in the event that we recognize a significant gain from the cash settlement the forward sale agreements we might not be able to satisfy the gross income requirements applicable to reits under the code if we were to fail to satisfy one or both of the gross income tests for any taxable year we may nevertheless qualify as a reit for such year if we were entitled to relief under certain provisions of the code if these relief provisions were inapplicable we would not qualify as a reit even if these relief provisions were to apply a tax based on the amount of the relevant reit’s nonqualifying income would be imposed 

risks related to our organizational structure 

vici is a holding company with no direct operations and relies on distributions received from the operating partnership to make distributions to its stockholders 

vici is a holding company and conducts its operations through subsidiaries including the operating partnership and vici golf vici does not have apart from the units that it owns in the operating partnership and vici golf any independent operations as a result vici relies on distributions from its operating partnership to make any distributions to its stockholders it might declare on its common stock and to meet any of its obligations including any tax liability on taxable income allocated to it from the operating partnership which might not be able to make distributions to vici equal to the tax on such allocated taxable income in turn the ability of subsidiaries of the operating partnership to make distributions to the operating partnership and therefore the ability of the operating partnership to make distributions to vici depends on the operating results of these subsidiaries and the operating partnership and on the terms of any financing arrangements they have entered into in addition because vici is a holding company claims of common stockholders of vici are structurally subordinated to all existing and future liabilities and other obligations whether or not for borrowed money and any preferred equity of the operating partnership and its subsidiaries therefore in the event of our bankruptcy liquidation or reorganization vici’s assets and those of the operating partnership and its subsidiaries will be available to satisfy the claims of vici common stockholders only after all of vici’s the operating partnership’s and its subsidiaries’ liabilities and other obligations and any preferred equity of any of them have been paid in full 

the operating partnership may in connection with its acquisition of additional properties or otherwise issue additional common units or preferred units to third parties such issuances would reduce vici’s ownership in the operating partnership because stockholders of vici do not directly own common units or preferred units of the operating partnership they do not have any voting rights with respect to any such issuances or other partnership level activities of the operating partnership 

our rights and the rights of our stockholders to take action against our directors and officers are limited 

the maryland general corporation law the “mgcl” provides that a director has no liability in any action based on an act of the director if he or she has acted in good faith in a manner he or she reasonably believes to be in the corporation’s best interests and with the care that an ordinarily prudent person in a like position would use under similar circumstances as permitted by the mgcl our charter limits the liability of our directors and officers to our company and our stockholders for money damages to the maximum extent permitted by maryland law under maryland law our present directors and officers will not have any liability to us or our stockholders for money damages other than liability resulting from 

 our charter provides that we have the power to obligate ourselves and our amended and restated bylaws obligate us to indemnify our directors and officers for actions taken by them in those capacities and to pay or reimburse their reasonable expenses in advance of final disposition of a proceeding to the maximum extent permitted by maryland law in addition we have entered into indemnification agreements with our directors and executive officers that provide for indemnification and advancement of expenses to the maximum extent permitted by maryland law as a result we and our stockholders may have more limited rights against our directors and officers than might otherwise exist under common law 

our board of directors may change our major corporate policies without stockholder approval and those changes may materially and adversely affect us 

our board of directors will determine and may eliminate or otherwise change our major corporate policies including our acquisition investment financing growth operations and distribution policies while our stockholders have the power to elect or remove directors changes in our major corporate policies may be made by our board of directors without stockholder approval and those changes could adversely affect our business financial condition liquidity results of operations and prospects the market price of our common stock and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders and to satisfy our debt service requirements 

the ability of our board of directors to revoke or otherwise terminate our reit qualification with stockholder approval may cause adverse consequences to our stockholders 

our charter provides that our board of directors may revoke or otherwise terminate our reit election only with the affirmative vote of stockholders entitled to cast a majority of all votes entitled to be cast on the matter if the board determines that it is no longer in our best interests to continue to qualify as a reit if we cease to be a reit we would become subject to federal income tax on our taxable income and would no longer be required to distribute most of our taxable income to our stockholders which may have adverse consequences on the total return to our stockholders 

our charter and bylaws contain provisions that may delay defer or prevent an acquisition of our common stock or a change in control 

our charter and bylaws contain provisions the exercise or existence of which could delay defer or prevent a transaction or a change in control that might involve a premium price for our stockholders or otherwise be in their best interests including the following 

• our charter contains restrictions on the ownership and transfer of our stock 

in order for us to qualify as a reit no more than 50 of the value of outstanding shares of our stock may be owned beneficially or constructively by five or fewer individuals or certain other persons at any time during the last half of each taxable year “closely held” subject to certain exceptions our charter prohibits any stockholder from owning beneficially or constructively with respect to any class or series of our capital stock more than 98 in value or by number of shares whichever is more restrictive of the aggregate of the outstanding shares of such class or series of our capital stock 

the constructive ownership rules under the code are complex and may cause the outstanding stock owned by a group of related individuals or entities to be deemed to be constructively owned by one individual or entity as a result the acquisition of 98 or less of the outstanding shares of a class or series of our stock by an individual or entity could cause that individual or entity or another individual or entity to own constructively in excess of the relevant ownership limits 

among other restrictions on ownership and transfer of shares our charter also prohibits any person from owning shares of our stock that would result in our being “closely held” under section 856h of the code or otherwise cause us to fail to qualify as a reit any attempt to own or transfer shares of our common stock or of any of our other capital stock in violation of these restrictions may result in the shares being automatically transferred to a charitable trust or may be void 

our charter provides that our board may grant exceptions to the 98 ownership limit subject in each case to certain initial and ongoing conditions designed to protect our status as a reit these ownership limits may prevent a thirdparty from acquiring control of us if our board of directors does not grant an exemption from the ownership limits even if our stockholders believe the change in control is in their best interests an exemption from the 98 ownership limit was granted to certain stockholders and our board may in the future provide exceptions to the ownership limit for other stockholders subject to certain initial and ongoing conditions designed to protect our status as a reit 

• our board of directors has the power to cause us to issue and authorize additional shares of our capital stock without stockholder approval 

our charter authorizes us to issue authorized but unissued shares of common or preferred stock in addition to the shares of common stock issued and outstanding in addition our board of directors may without stockholder approval amend our charter to increase the aggregate number of our shares of stock or the number of shares of stock of any class or series that we have authority to issue and classify or reclassify any unissued shares of common or preferred stock and set the preferences rights and other terms of the classified or reclassified shares as a result our board of directors may establish a class or series of shares of common or preferred stock that could delay or prevent a transaction or a change in control that might involve a premium price for our shares of common stock or otherwise be in the best interests of our stockholders 

certain provisions of maryland law may limit the ability of a third party to acquire control of us 

certain provisions of the mgcl may have the effect of inhibiting a third party from acquiring us or of impeding a change of control under circumstances that otherwise could provide our common stockholders with the opportunity to realize a premium over the then prevailing market price of such shares including 

 our charter provides that notwithstanding any other provision of our charter or our bylaws the maryland business combination act title 3 subtitle 6 of the mgcl does not apply to any business combination between us and any interested stockholder or any affiliate of any interested stockholder of ours and that we expressly elect not to be governed by the provisions of section 3602 of the mgcl in whole or in part pursuant to the mgcl our bylaws contain a provision exempting from the maryland control share acquisition act any and all acquisitions by any person of shares of our stock there can be no assurance that any of these provisions of our charter or bylaws will not be amended or eliminated at any time in the future 

additionally provisions of title 3 subtitle 8 of the mgcl permit a maryland corporation such as the company by action of its board of directors and without stockholder approval and regardless of what is provided in the charter or bylaws to elect to avail itself of certain takeover defenses such as a classified board unless the charter or a resolution adopted by the board of directors prohibits such election our charter provides that we are prohibited from making any such election unless first approved by our stockholders by the affirmative vote of a majority of all votes entitled to be cast on the matter 

risks related to our common stock 

the market price and trading volume of shares of our common stock may be volatile 

the market price of our common stock may be volatile in addition the stock markets generally may experience significant volatility often unrelated to the operating performance of the individual companies whose securities are publicly traded the trading volume in our common stock may fluctuate and cause significant price variations to occur we cannot assure you that the market price of our common stock will not fluctuate or decline significantly in the future if the market price of our common stock declines you may be unable to sell your shares 

some of the factors many of which are beyond our control that could negatively affect the market price of our common stock or result in fluctuations in the price or trading volume of our common stock include 



 an increase in market interest rates could cause potential investors to seek higher returns and therefore reduce demand for our common stock and result in a decline in our share price 

one of the factors that may influence the market price of shares of our common stock is the yield of our shares ie the annualized distributions per share of our common stock as a percentage of the market price per share of our common stock relative to market interest rates an increase in market interest rates which are currently at low levels relative to historical rates may lead prospective purchasers of our common stock to expect a higher yield which may result in a decline in the market price of our common stock higher interest rates would likely increase our borrowing costs and potentially decrease our cash available for distribution thus higher market interest rates could also cause the market price of shares of our common stock to decline 

future incurrences of debt which would be senior to our shares of common stock upon liquidation andor issuance of preferred equity securities which may be senior to our shares of common stock for purposes of distributions or upon liquidation could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

in the future we may attempt to increase our capital resources by incurring additional debt including mediumterm notes trust preferred securities and senior or subordinated notes or issuing preferred shares if a liquidation event were to occur holders of our debt securities and preferred shares and lenders with respect to other borrowings will receive distributions of our available assets prior to the holders of our shares of common stock in addition our preferred stock if issued would likely limit our ability to make liquidating or other distributions to the holders of shares of our common stock under certain circumstances any future common stock offerings may dilute the holdings of our existing stockholders or reduce the market price of our common stock or both holders of shares of our common stock are not entitled to preemptive rights or other protections against dilution since our decision to issue debt securities incur other forms of indebtedness or to issue additional common stock or preferred stock in the future will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control we cannot predict or estimate the amount timing nature or success of our future offerings thus our stockholders bear the risk of our issuing senior securities incurring other senior obligations or issuing additional common stock in the future which may reduce the market price of shares of our common stock reduce cash available for distribution to common stockholders or dilute their stockholdings in us 

the number of shares available for future sale could adversely affect the market price of shares of our common stock 

we cannot predict whether future issuances of our shares or the availability of shares of our common stock for resale in the open market will decrease the market price per share of shares of our common stock sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market or the perception that such sales might occur could adversely affect the market price of shares of our common stock if any of our stockholders cause or there is a perception that they may cause a large number of their shares 

to be sold in the public market the sales could reduce the market price of shares of our common stock and could impede our ability to raise future capital 

our earnings and cash distributions could affect the market price of shares of our common stock 

our common stock may trade at prices that are higher or lower than the net asset value per share to the extent that we retain operating cash flow for investment purposes working capital reserves or other purposes rather than distributing the cash flows to stockholders these retained funds while increasing the value of our underlying assets may negatively impact the market price of shares of our common stock our failure to meet market expectations with regard to future earnings and cash distributions could adversely affect the market price of shares of our common stock 

provisions contained in the forward sale agreements could result in substantial dilution to our earnings per share or result in substantial cash payment obligations 

the forward purchasers under the forward sale agreements will have the right to accelerate the forward sale agreements with respect to all or any portion of the transaction under the forward sale agreements that the forward purchasers determine is affected by an event described below and require us to settle on a date specified by the forward purchasers if 

 a forward purchaser’s decision to exercise its right to accelerate the settlement of its forward sale agreement will be made irrespective of our interests including our need for capital in such cases we could be required to issue and deliver shares of common stock under the physical settlement provisions of the applicable forward sale agreement which would result in dilution to our earnings per share 

we expect to physically settle the forward sale agreements and receive proceeds from the sale of those shares of our common stock upon one or more forward settlement dates no later than september 26 2020 however the forward sale agreements may be settled earlier in whole or in part at our option subject to certain conditions we have the right to elect physical cash or net share settlement under the forward sale agreements at any time and from time to time in part or in full the forward sale agreements will be physically settled by delivery of shares of our common stock unless we elect to cash settle or net share settle the forward sale agreements delivery of shares of our common stock upon physical settlement or if we elect net share settlement upon such settlement to the extent we are obligated to deliver shares of our common stock will result in dilution to our earnings per share 

if we elect cash settlement or net share settlement with respect to all or a portion of the shares of common stock underlying a forward sale agreement we expect the applicable forward purchaser or its affiliate to purchase a number of shares of our common stock in secondary market transactions over an unwind period to 

 the purchase of shares of our common stock in connection with the forward purchasers or their respective affiliates unwinding their hedge positions could cause the price of shares of our common stock to increase over such time or reduce the amount of a decrease over such time thereby increasing the amount of cash we would be required to pay to the forward purchasers or 

decreasing the amount of cash that the forward purchasers would be required to pay us upon a cash settlement of the forward sale agreements or increasing the number of shares of common stock we would be required to deliver to the forward purchasers or decreasing the number of shares of common stock that the forward purchasers would be required to deliver to us upon net share settlement of the forward sale agreements 

the forward sale price that we expect to receive upon physical settlement of the forward sale agreements will be subject to adjustment on a daily basis based on a floating interest rate factor determined by reference to a specified daily rate less a spread and will be decreased by amounts related to expected dividends on our common stock during the term of the forward sale agreements if the specified daily rate is less than the spread on any day the interest rate factor will result in a reduction of the applicable forward sale price for that day as of december 31 2019 the specified daily rate was greater than the spread but we can give no assurance that this rate will not decrease to a rate below the spread during the term of the forward sale agreements which would reduce the proceeds that we would receive upon settlement of the forward sale agreements if the prevailing market price for our common stock during the unwind period under a forward sale agreement is above the applicable forward sale price in the case of cash settlement we would pay the applicable forward purchaser under the applicable forward sale agreement an amount per share in cash equal to the difference or in the case of net share settlement we would deliver to the applicable forward purchaser a number of shares of common stock having a value equal to the difference thus we could be responsible for a potentially substantial cash payment in the case of cash settlement 

in case of our bankruptcy or insolvency the forward sale agreements would automatically terminate and we would not receive the expected proceeds from the sale of common stock under such agreements 

if we institute or a regulatory authority with jurisdiction over us institutes or we consent to a proceeding seeking a judgment in bankruptcy or insolvency or any other relief under any bankruptcy or insolvency law or other similar law affecting creditors’ rights or we or a regulatory authority with jurisdiction over us presents a petition for our windingup or liquidation or we consent to such a petition the forward sale agreements will automatically terminate if the forward sale agreements so terminate we would not be obligated to deliver to the forward purchasers any shares of common stock not previously delivered and the forward purchasers would be discharged from their obligation to pay the forward sale price per share in respect of any shares of common stock not previously settled therefore to the extent that there are any shares of common stock with respect to which the forward sale agreements have not been settled at the time of the commencement of any such bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings we would not receive the forward sale price per share in respect of those shares of common stock

market information 

on february 1 2018 in connection with our initial registered public offering our common stock began trading on the new york stock exchange “nyse” under the symbol “vici” 

holders 

as of february 19 2020 there were 468491573 shares of common stock issued and outstanding that were held by approximately 26 stockholders of record not including beneficial owners of shares registered in nominee or street name 

distribution policy

we actively seek to grow our portfolio through acquisitions of experiential real estate in geographically diverse dynamic markets spanning hospitality entertainment leisure and gaming properties additionally we expect to grow our portfolio through acquisitions by pursuing opportunities to execute sale leaseback transactions with the combined eldoradocaesars following the closing of the eldorado transaction including pursuant to i the centaur properties putcall agreement ii the caesars forum putcall agreement and iii the las vegas strip rofr and horseshoe baltimore rofr however the combined eldoradocaesars entity will make an independent financial decision regarding whether to trigger the rights of first refusal under the las vegas rofr and horseshoe baltimore rofr and we will make an independent financial decision whether to purchase the properties finally we believe the approximately 34 acres of undeveloped or underdeveloped land on and adjacent to the las vegas strip that we own will provide attractive opportunities for potential future expansion and development in pursuing external growth initiatives we will generally seek to acquire properties that can generate stable rental revenue through longterm leases with tenants with established operating histories and we will consider various factors when evaluating acquisitions including the ability to continue to diversify our tenant base and increasing our geographic diversification

those relating to recent transactions we anticipate that we would seek to finance these acquisitions with a combination of debt and equity although no assurance can be given that we would be able to issue equity in such amounts on favorable terms or at all or that we would not determine to incur more debt on a relative basis at the relevant time due market conditions or otherwise in addition to rent our current lease agreements require our tenants to pay the following 1 all facility maintenance 2 all insurance required in connection with the leased properties and the business conducted on the leased properties 3 taxes levied on or with respect to the leased properties other than taxes on our income and 4 all utilities and other services necessary or appropriate for the leased properties and the business conducted on the leased properties accordingly due to the “triplenet” structure of our leases we do not expect to incur significant propertylevel expenses

golf course business revenue 

revenues from golf operations increased 17 million during the year ended december 31 2019 compared to the year ended december 31 2018  the increase was primarily driven by an increase in the number of rounds played at our golf courses as well as by an increase in the contractual fees paid to us by caesars for the use of our golf courses pursuant to a golf course use agreement 

operating expenses 

general and administrative expenses 

general and administrative expenses increased 01 million during the year ended december 31 2019 compared to the year ended december 31 2018  the increase was primarily driven by an increase in stock based compensation which was partially offset by certain nonrecurring costs incurred during the first six months of the year ended december 31 2018 as a result of being a newly publiclytraded company primarily following our initial public offering and the transition and relocation of our corporate headquarters from las vegas nv to new york ny

transaction and acquisition expenses 

transaction and acquisition costs increased 46 million during the year ended december 31 2019 compared to the year ended december 31 2018  the increase was primarily due to the adoption of asc 842 which requires us to expense certain legal and thirdparty costs associated with our leases that were previously capitalized 

interest expense 

interest expense increased 357 million during the year ended december 31 2019 compared to the year ended december 31 2018  the increase is primarily attributable to our november 2019 senior unsecured notes our interest rate swap agreements which we entered into in april 2018 and january 2019 and an increase in the amortization of our deferred financing fees as a result of the costs associated with our revolving credit facility and bridge facilities with respect to the interest rate swap agreements prior to entering into such agreements in the comparative period we were paying a lower variable rate as compared to the fixed rate under the interest rate swap agreements these amounts were partially offset by a reduction in interest rates due to the repayment of amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility and the partial paydown of the term loan b facility and second lien notes in february of 2018 

interest income 

interest income increased 87 million during the year ended december 31 2019 compared to the year ended december 31 2018  the increase is primarily driven by increased cash on hand from our primary followon equity offerings in november 2018 and june 2019 and debt offering in november 2019

ffo is a nongaap financial measure that is considered a supplemental measure for the real estate industry and a supplement to gaap measures consistent with the definition used by the national association of real estate investment trusts we define ffo as net income or loss computed in accordance with gaap excluding i gains or losses from sales of certain real estate assets ii depreciation and amortization related to real estate iii gains and losses from change in control and iv impairment writedowns of certain real estate assets and investments in entities when the impairment is directly attributable to decreases in the value of depreciable real estate held by the entity 

affo is a nongaap financial measure that we use as a supplemental operating measure to evaluate our performance we calculate affo by adding or subtracting from ffo direct financing and salestype lease adjustments transaction costs incurred in connection with the acquisition of real estate investments noncash stockbased compensation expense amortization of debt issuance costs and original issue discount other noncash interest expense nonreal estate depreciation which is comprised of the depreciation related to our golf course operations capital expenditures which are comprised of additions to property plant and equipment related to our golf course operations impairment charges related to nondepreciable real estate and gains or losses on debt extinguishment 

we calculate adjusted ebitda by adding or subtracting from affo interest expense and interest income collectively interest expense net and income tax expense 

these nongaap financial measures i do not represent cash flow from operations as defined by gaap ii should not be considered as an alternative to net income as a measure of operating performance or to cash flows from operating investing and financing activities and iii are not alternatives to cash flow as a measure of liquidity in addition these measures should not be viewed as measures of liquidity nor do they measure our ability to fund all of our cash needs including our ability to make cash distributions to our stockholders to fund capital improvements or to make interest payments on our indebtedness investors are also cautioned that ffo ffo per share affo affo per share and adjusted ebitda as presented may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other real estate companies including reits due to the fact that not all real estate companies use the same definitions our presentation of these measures does not replace the presentation of our financial results in accordance with gaap

liquidity and capital resources 

overview 

as of december 31 2019  our available cash balances shortterm investments and capacity under our revolving credit facility were as follows 



 

 our shortterm obligations consist primarily of regular interest payments on our debt obligations dividends to our common stockholders normal recurring operating expenses recurring expenditures for corporate and administrative needs certain lease and other contractual commitments related to our golf operations and certain nonrecurring expenditures for a list of our material contractual commitments refer to note 10  commitments and contingent liabilities  in the notes to our financial statements 

our longterm obligations consist primarily of principal payments on our outstanding debt obligations taking into account our february 2020 senior unsecured notes offering and the redemption of our second lien secured notes we currently have 69 billion of debt obligations outstanding none of which are maturing in the next twelve months for a summary of principal debt balances and their maturity dates and principal terms refer to note 7  debt  in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 

we closed the jack clevelandthistledown acquisition on january 24 2020 using a mix of cash on hand and a portion of the proceeds that we raised from our november 2019 senior unsecured notes offering we anticipate closing the eldorado transaction in the first half of 2020 and expect to fund the purchase with a mix of cash on hand the settlement of our forward sales agreements and a portion of the proceeds that we raised from our february 2020 senior unsecured notes offering to the extent we are unable to settle the forward sales agreements we intend to use the capacity under the bridge facility in lieu of such financing we anticipate funding future transactions with a mix of debt equity and available cash 

we believe that we have sufficient liquidity to meet our liquidity and capital resource requirements primarily through currently available cash and cash equivalents restricted cash short term investments cash received under our lease agreements borrowings from banks including undrawn capacity under our revolving credit facility and bridge facilities and proceeds from the issuance of debt and equity securities including issuances under our forward sale agreements and our atm agreement all of the lease agreements call for an initial term of fifteen years with four fiveyear tenant renewal options and are designed to provide us with a reliable and predictable longterm revenue stream however our cash flows from operations and our ability to access capital resources could be adversely affected due to uncertain economic factors and volatility in the financial and credit markets in particular we can provide no assurances that our tenants will not default on their leases or fail to make full rental payments if their businesses become challenged due to among other things adverse economic conditions 

our ability to raise funds through the issuance of debt and equity securities and access to other thirdparty sources of capital in the future will be dependent on among other things general economic conditions general market conditions for reits market perceptions and the trading price of our stock we will continue to analyze which sources of capital are most advantageous to us at any particular point in time but the capital markets may not be consistently available on terms we deem attractive or at all

capital expenditures 

as described in our leases capital expenditures for properties under the lease agreements are the responsibility of the tenants minimum capital expenditure spending requirements of the tenants are described in item 1 “businessoverview of our lease agreements”  

inflation 

our leases provide for certain increases in rent as a result of a fixed annual rent escalator or changes in the consumer price index as further described in item 1 “businessoverview of our lease agreements”  inflation may cause the rent provisions to result in rent increases over time however we could be negatively affected if increases in rent are not sufficient to cover increases in our operating expenses due to inflation in addition inflation and increased cost may have an adverse impact on our tenants if increases in their operating expenses exceed increases in revenue due to inflation 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

as of december 31 2019  and as of the date this report was filed we do not have any offbalance sheet arrangements 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap we have identified certain accounting policies that we believe are the most critical to the presentation of our financial information over a period of time these accounting policies may require our management to take decisions on subjective andor complex matters relating to reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue costs expenses and related disclosures including but not limited to the application of fresh start reporting determining the useful lives of real estate properties and evaluating the impairment of longlived assets and allocation of costs and deferred income taxes the judgment on such estimates and underlying assumptions is based on our historical experience that we believe is reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ from the estimates 

investments in direct financing and salestype leases net 

we account for our investments in leases under asc 842 “leases” “asc 842” which we adopted on january 1 2019 upon lease inception or lease modification we assess lease classification to determine whether the lease should be classified as a direct financing salestype or operating lease as required by asc 842 we separately assess the land and building components of the property to determine the classification of each component unless the impact of doing so is immaterial if the lease component is determined to be a direct financing or salestype lease we record a net investment in the lease which is equal to the sum of the lease receivable and the unguaranteed residual asset discounted at the rate implicit in the lease any difference between the fair value of the asset and the net investment in the lease is considered selling profit or loss and is either recognized upon execution of the lease or deferred and recognized over the life of the lease depending on the classification of the lease due to the nature of our assets the net investment in the lease is generally equal to the purchase price of the asset and the land and building components of an investment generally have the same lease classification 

for leases determined to be salestype leases we further assess to determine whether the transaction is considered a sale leaseback transaction if we determine that the lease meets the definition for a sale leaseback transaction the lease is considered a financing receivable and is recognized in accordance with asc 310 “receivables” “asc 310” we currently do not have any lease investments that are accounted for as financing receivables under asc 310 

upon adoption of asc 842 we made an accounting policy election to use a package of practical expedients that among other things allow us to not reassess prior lease classifications or initial direct costs for leases that existed as of the balance sheet date 

lease term 

we assess the noncancelable lease term under asc 842 which includes any reasonably assured renewal periods all of our lease agreements provide for an initial term with multiple tenant renewal options we have individually assessed all of our lease agreements and concluded that the lease term includes all of the periods covered by extension options as it is reasonably certain our tenants will renew the lease agreements we believe our tenants are economically compelled to renew the lease agreements due to the importance of our real estate to the operation of their business the significant capital they have invested in our properties and the lack of suitable replacement assets 

income from leases 

we recognize the related income from our direct financing and salestype leases on an effective interest basis at a constant rate of return over the terms of the applicable leases as a result the cash payments accounted for under direct financing and salestype leases will not equal income from our lease agreements rather a portion of the cash rent we receive is recorded as income from direct financing and salestype leases in our statement of operations and a portion is recorded as a change to investments in direct financing and salestype leases net 

under asc 840 we determined that the land component of caesars palace las vegas was greater than 25 of the overall fair value of the combined land and building components at lease inception the land was determined to be an operating lease and we record the related income on a straightline basis over the lease term the amount of annual minimum lease payments attributable to the land element after deducting executory costs including any profit thereon is determined by applying the lessee’s incremental borrowing rate to the value of the land revenue from this lease is recorded as income from operating leases in our statement of operations 

initial direct costs incurred in connection with entering into lease agreements are included in the balance of the net investment in lease in relation to direct financing and salestype leases such amounts will be recognized as a reduction to income from investments in leases over the life of the lease using the effective interest method costs that would have been incurred regardless of whether the lease was signed such as legal fees and certain other thirdparty fees are expensed as incurred to transaction and acquisition expenses in our statement of operations 

contractual obligations and commitments 

information concerning our obligations and commitments to make future payments under contracts such as our indebtedness and future minimum lease commitments under operating leases is included in the following table as of december 31 2019  



 

1 subsequent to december 31 2019 on february 5 2020 the operating partnership issued i 7500 million in aggregate principal amount of 3500 senior unsecured notes due 2025 ii 7500 million in aggregate principal amount of 3750 senior unsecured notes due 2027 and iii 10 billion of 4125 senior unsecured notes due 2030 the 2025 notes will mature on february 15 2025 the 2027 notes will mature on february 15 2027 and the 2030 notes will mature on august 15 2030 

2 the 2026 notes will mature on december 1 2026 

3 the 2029 notes will mature on december 1 2029 

4 the term loan b facility is subject to amortization of 10 of principal per annum payable in equal quarterly installments on the last business day of each calendar quarter however as a result of prepaying 1000 million in february 2018 the next principal payment due on the term loan b facility is september 2022 the term loan b facility will mature on december 22 2024 or the date that is three months prior to the maturity of the second lien notes whichever is earlier or if the maturity is extended pursuant to the terms of the agreement such extended maturity date as determined pursuant thereto subsequent to december 31 2019 on january 24 2020 the term loan b facility was amended to reduce the interest rate from libor plus 200 to libor plus 175 

5 subsequent to the year end on february 20 2020 we used the proceeds from the issuance of the 2025 notes to redeem in full the second lien notes at a redemption price of 100 of the principal amount of the second lien notes then outstanding plus the second lien notes applicable premium which resulted in a total redemption amount of approximately 5375 million 

6 the revolving credit facility will mature on may 15 2024 

7 estimated interest payments on variable interest loans are based on a libor rate as of december 31 2019

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend

our future income cash flows and fair values relevant to financial instruments are dependent upon prevailing market interest rates in the normal course of business we are exposed to the effect of interest rate changes we have entered into derivative agreements to mitigate exposure to unexpected changes in interest market risk refers to the risk of loss from adverse changes in market interest rates we periodically use derivative financial instruments to seek to manage or hedge interest rate risks related to our borrowings we do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes and only enter into contracts with major financial institutions based on their credit rating and other factors we intend to enter into derivative agreements only with counterparties that we believe have a strong credit rating to mitigate the risk of counterparty default or insolvency 

as of december 31 2019  we had 48485 million of debt outstanding of which 27485 million was fixed rate debt and 20000 million was hedged variable rate debt the remaining 1000 million of our indebtedness was unhedged as of december 31 2019  a one percent increase or decrease in the annual interest rate on our unhedged variable rate borrowings of 1000 million would increase or decrease our annual cash interest expense by approximately 10 million 

we may manage or hedge interest rate risks related to our borrowings by means of interest rate swap agreements we also expect to manage our exposure to interest rate risk by maintaining a mix of fixed and variable rates for our indebtedness however the reit provisions of the code substantially limit our ability to hedge our assets and liabilities

business 

tableend

we are an owner and acquirer of experiential real estate assets across leading gaming hospitality entertainment and leisure destinations our national geographically diverse portfolio currently consists of 22 market leading properties including caesars palace las vegas and harrah’s las vegas two of the most iconic entertainment facilities on the las vegas strip our entertainment facilities are leased to leading brands that seek to drive consumer loyalty and value with guests through superior services experiences products and continuous innovation across approximately 39 million square feet our wellmaintained properties are currently located across urban destination and driveto markets in ten states contain approximately 14800 hotel rooms and feature over 150 restaurants bars and nightclubs 

our portfolio also includes approximately 34 acres of undeveloped or underdeveloped land on and adjacent to the las vegas strip that is leased to caesars which we may look to monetize as appropriate we also own and operate four championship golf courses located near certain of our properties two of which are in close proximity to the las vegas strip 

we believe we have a mutually beneficial relationship with caesars and penn national both of which are leading owners and operators of gaming entertainment and leisure properties our longterm triplenet lease agreements with subsidiaries of caesars and penn national provide us with a highly predictable revenue stream with embedded growth potential we believe our geographic diversification limits the effect of changes in any one market on our overall performance we are focused on driving longterm total returns through managing experiential asset growth and allocating capital diligently maintaining a highly productive tenant base and optimizing our capital structure to support external growth as a growth focused public real estate company we expect our relationship with our partners will position us for the acquisition of additional properties across leisure and hospitality 

our portfolio is competitively positioned and wellmaintained pursuant to the terms of the lease agreements which require our tenants to invest in our properties and in line with our tenants’ commitment to build guest loyalty we anticipate our tenants will continue to make strategic valueenhancing investments in our properties over time helping to maintain their competitive position in addition given our scale and deep industry knowledge we believe we are wellpositioned to execute highly complementary singleasset and portfolio acquisitions to augment growth 

we have elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust “reit” for us federal income tax purposes commencing with our taxable year ended december 31 2017 we believe our election of reit status combined with the income generation from the lease agreements will enhance our ability to make distributions to our stockholders providing investors with current income as well as longterm growth 

our competitive strengths 

we believe the following strengths effectively position us to execute our business and growth strategies 

leading portfolio of highquality experiential gaming hospitality entertainment and leisure assets 

our portfolio features caesars palace las vegas and harrah’s las vegas and marketleading urban destination and regional properties with significant scale our properties are wellmaintained and leased to leading brands such as caesars horseshoe harrah’s bally’s and margaritaville these brands seek to drive loyalty and value with guests through superior service and products and continuous innovation our portfolio benefits from its strong mix of demand generators including casinos guest rooms restaurants entertainment facilities bars and nightclubs and convention space we believe our properties are wellinsulated from incremental competition as a result of high replacement costs as well as regulatory restrictions and longlead times for new development the high quality of our properties appeals to a broad base of customers stimulating traffic and visitation 

our portfolio is anchored by our las vegas properties caesars palace las vegas and harrah’s las vegas which are located at the center of the strip w e believe las vegas is a market characterized by steady economic growth and high consumer and business demand with limited new supply our las vegas properties which are two of the most iconic entertainment facilities in las vegas feature gaming entertainment largescale hotels extensive food and beverage options stateoftheart convention facilities retail outlets and entertainment showrooms 

our portfolio also includes marketleading regional resorts and destinations that we believe are benefiting from significant invested capital over recent years the regional properties we own include awardwinning landbased and dockside casinos hotels and entertainment facilities that are market leaders within their respective regions the properties operate primarily under the caesars harrah’s horseshoe bally’s and margaritaville trademark and brand names which in many instances have marketleading brand recognition 

under the terms of the lease agreements the tenants are required to continue to invest in the properties which we believe will enhance the value of our properties 

our properties feature diversified sources of revenue on both a business and geographic basis 

our portfolio includes 22 geographically diverse casino resorts that serve numerous metropolitan statistical areas “msas” nationally this diversity reduces our exposure to adverse events that may affect any single market this also allows our tenants to derive multiple revenue streams from an economically diverse set of customers and services to such customers these include gaming food and beverage entertainment hospitality and other sources of revenue we believe that this geographic diversity and the diversity of revenue sources that our tenants derive from our leased properties improves the stability of rental revenue 

our longterm lease agreements provide a highly predictable base level of rent with embedded growth potential 

our properties are 100 occupied pursuant to our longterm triplenet lease agreements with subsidiaries of caesars and penn national providing us with a predictable level of rental revenue to support future cash distributions to our stockholders 

all of our casino resort properties are established assets with extensive operating histories based on historical performance of the properties we expect that the properties will generate sufficient revenues for caesars’ and penn national’s subsidiaries to pay to us all rent due under the lease agreements

subject to the asset tests and gross income tests necessary for reit qualification we may invest in securities of other reits other entities engaged in real estate activities or securities of other issuers including for the purpose of exercising control over such entities we do not currently have any policy limiting the types of entities in which we may invest or the proportion of assets to be so invested whether through acquisition of an entity’s common stock limited liability or partnership interests interests in another reit or entry into a joint venture we have no current plans to make additional investments in entities that are not engaged in real estate activities our investment objectives are to maximize the cash flow of our investments acquire investments with growth potential and provide cash distributions and longterm capital appreciation to our stockholders through increases in the value of our company we have not established a specific policy regarding the relative priority of these investment objectives 

investments in shortterm commercial paper and discount notes 

we generally invest our excess cash on hand in shortterm income producing investments such as commercial paper government securities including those issued by governmentsponsored enterprises such as the federal home loan mortgage corporation and certain of the federal home loan banks or money market funds that invest in government securities andor commercial paper that are consistent with our intention to continue to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes these investments generally have original maturities between 91 and 120 days 

investment in other securities 

other than as described above we do not intend to invest in any additional securities of third parties such as bonds preferred stocks or common stock 

financing policies 

we expect to employ leverage in our capital structure in amounts that we determine appropriate from time to time our board of directors has not adopted a policy which limits the total amount of indebtedness that we may incur but will consider a number of factors in evaluating our level of indebtedness from time to time as well as the amount of such indebtedness that will be either fixed or variable rate we are however and expect to continue to be subject to certain indebtedness limitations pursuant to the restrictive covenants of our outstanding indebtedness we may from time to time modify our debt policy in light of thencurrent economic conditions relative availability and costs of debt and equity capital market values of our properties general market conditions for debt and equity securities fluctuations in the market price of our shares of common stock growth and acquisition opportunities and other factors if these limits are relaxed we could become more highly leveraged resulting in an increased risk of default on our obligations and a related increase in debt service requirements that could adversely affect our financial condition liquidity and results of operations and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders to the extent that our board of directors or management determines that it is necessary to raise additional capital we may without stockholder approval borrow money under our revolving credit facility issue debt or equity securities including securities senior to our shares retain earnings subject to the reit distribution requirements for us federal income tax purposes assume indebtedness obtain mortgage financing on a portion of our owned properties engage in a joint venture or employ a combination of these methods

risks related to our business and operations 

we are and will be significantly dependent on caesars and penn national and their respective subsidiaries unless or until we substantially diversify our portfolio and an event that has a material adverse effect on either of their respective businesses financial condition liquidity results of operations or prospects could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition liquidity results of operations and prospects 

we depend on our tenants to operate the properties that we own in a manner that generates revenues sufficient to allow the tenants to meet their obligations to us substantially all of our revenue is from our leases with subsidiaries of caesars and penn national because these master leases are triplenet leases we depend on the tenants to pay substantially all insurance taxes utilities and maintenance and repair expenses in connection with these leased properties and to indemnify defend and hold us harmless from and against various claims litigation and liabilities arising in connection with their businesses see “item 1  business” there can be no assurance that the tenants will have sufficient assets income or access to financing to enable them to satisfy their payment and other obligations under their leases with us or that the applicable guarantor will be able to satisfy its guarantee of the applicable tenant’s obligations under the lease agreements 

the tenants and applicable guarantors rely on the properties they or their respective subsidiaries own andor operate for income to satisfy their obligations including their debt service requirements and lease payments due to us under the lease agreements or to others under other lease agreements if income from these properties were to decline for any reason or if caesars’ or penn national’s debt service requirements were to increase for any reason or if their creditworthiness were to become impaired for other reasons a tenant or the applicable guarantor may become unable or unwilling to satisfy its payment and other obligations under their leases with us the inability or unwillingness of either caesars or penn national to meet their respective subsidiaries’ payment and other obligations under the leases in each case could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition liquidity results of operations and prospects including our ability to make distributions to our stockholders 

due to our dependence on rental payments from subsidiaries of caesars and penn national as our primary source of revenue we may be limited in our ability to enforce our rights under the leases or to terminate the applicable lease with respect to any particular property failure by the tenants to comply with the terms of their respective leases or to comply with the gaming regulations to which the leased properties are subject could require us to find another tenant for such property to the extent possible and there could be a decrease or cessation of rental payments by the tenants in such event we may be unable to locate a suitable creditworthy tenant at similar rental rates or at all which would have the effect of reducing our rental revenues and could have a material adverse effect on us 

because a concentrated portion of our revenues are generated from the strip we are subject to greater risks than a company that is more geographically diversified 

our properties on the las vegas strip generated approximately 36 of our lease revenue for the year ended december 31 2018 therefore our business may be significantly affected by risks common to the las vegas tourism industry for example the cost and availability of air services and the impact of any events that disrupt air travel to and from las vegas can adversely affect the business of our tenants we cannot control the number or frequency of flights to or from las vegas but the tenants rely on air traffic for a significant portion of their visitors reductions in flights by major airlines as a result of higher fuel prices or lower demand can impact the number of visitors to our properties additionally there is one principal interstate highway between las vegas and southern california where a large number of the customers that frequent our properties reside capacity constraints of that highway or any other traffic disruptions may also affect the number of customers who visit our facilities moreover due to the importance of our two properties on the strip we may be disproportionately affected by general risks such as acts of terrorism natural disasters including major fires floods and earthquakes and severe or inclement weather should such developments occur in or nearby las vegas 

caesars and its subsidiaries are party to certain leasing and financial commitments with us which may have a negative impact on caesars’ business and operating condition 

caesars andor its subsidiaries entered into certain leasing and financial commitments evidenced by agreements with us see item 1  “business  our relationship with caesars” for additional information regarding such agreements 

caesars is obligated to pay us in the aggregate approximately 42 billion in fixed annual rents and golf course membership fees over the next five years of the respective caesars lease agreements subject to certain escalators and adjustments if caesars’ businesses and properties fail to generate sufficient earnings the applicable tenants caesars andor crc may be unable to satisfy their respective obligations under the lease agreements or the related guarantees respectively additionally these obligations may limit their ability to make investments to maintain and grow their portfolio of businesses and properties which may adversely affect their competitiveness and ability to satisfy their obligations to us 

subsidiaries of caesars are required to pay a significant portion of their cash flow from operations to us pursuant to and subject to the terms and conditions of the caesars lease agreements which could adversely affect caesars’ ability to fund their operations or development projects raise capital make acquisitions and otherwise respond to competitive and economic changes and its ability to satisfy its payment obligations to us under the lease agreements and the related guarantees 

subsidiaries of caesars are required to pay a significant portion of their cash flow from operations to us pursuant to and subject to the terms and conditions of the caesars lease agreements see item 1 “business  caesars lease agreements  overview” and item 1 “business  our relationship with caesars” as a result of this commitment caesars’ ability to fund its operations or development projects raise capital make acquisitions and otherwise respond to competitive and economic changes may be adversely affected which could adversely affect the ability of the applicable tenants to satisfy their obligations to us under the caesars lease agreements and the ability of caesars andor crc to satisfy their respective obligations to us under the related guarantees 

in addition during the initial seven years of the caesars lease agreements the annual rent escalations under the caesars lease agreements will continue to apply regardless of the amount of cash flows generated by the properties that are subject to the caesars lease agreements accordingly if the cash flows generated by such properties decrease or do not increase at the same rate as the rent escalations the rents payable under the caesars lease agreements will comprise a higher percentage of the cash flows generated by the subsidiaries of caesars which could make it more difficult for the applicable subsidiaries to make their payment obligations to us under the caesars lease agreements and ultimately could adversely affect caesars’ andor crc’s ability to satisfy their respective obligations to us under the related guarantees 

caesars’ indebtedness and the fact that a significant portion of its cash flow is used to make interest payments could adversely affect its ability to satisfy its obligations under the caesars lease agreements 

as disclosed in its quarterly report on form 10q for the quarter ended september 30 2018 caesars’ consolidated estimated debt service including principal and interest for 2019 will be approximately 6540 million and 236 billion thereafter to maturity as a result a significant portion of caesars’ liquidity needs are for debt service including significant interest payments such substantial indebtedness and the restrictive covenants under the agreements governing such indebtedness could limit the ability of the applicable tenants to satisfy their obligations to us under the lease agreements and the ability of caesars’ andor crc to satisfy their respective obligations under the related guarantees 

we are dependent on the gaming industry and may be susceptible to the risks associated with it which could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition liquidity results of operations and prospects 

as the landlord of gaming facilities we are impacted by the risks associated with the gaming industry therefore so long as our investments are concentrated in gamingrelated assets our success is dependent on the gaming industry which could be adversely affected by economic conditions in general changes in consumer trends and preferences and other factors over which we and our tenants have no control as we are subject to risks inherent in substantial investments in a single industry a decrease in the gaming business would likely have a greater adverse effect on us than if we owned a more diversified real estate portfolio particularly because a component of the rent under the lease agreements will be based over time on the performance of the gaming facilities operated by our tenants on our properties and such effect could be material and adverse to our business financial condition liquidity results of operations and prospects 

the gaming industry is characterized by a high degree of competition among a large number of participants including riverboat casinos dockside casinos landbased casinos video lottery sweepstakes and poker machines not located in casinos native american gaming internet lotteries and other internet wagering gaming services and in a broader sense gaming operators face competition from all manner of leisure and entertainment activities gaming competition is intense in most of the markets where our facilities are located recently there has been additional significant competition in the gaming industry as a result of the 

upgrading or expansion of facilities by existing market participants the entrance of new gaming participants into a market internet gaming or legislative changes as competing properties and new markets are opened we may be negatively impacted additionally decreases in discretionary consumer spending brought about by weakened general economic conditions such as but not limited to lackluster recoveries from recessions high unemployment levels higher income taxes low levels of consumer confidence weakness in the housing market cultural and demographic changes and increased stock market volatility may negatively impact our revenues and operating cash flows 

we face extensive regulation from gaming and other regulatory authorities and our charter provides that any of our shares held by investors who are found to be unsuitable by state gaming regulatory authorities are subject to redemption 

the ownership operation and management of gaming and racing facilities are subject to pervasive regulation these gaming and racing regulations impact our gaming and racing tenants and persons associated with our gaming and racing facilities which in many jurisdictions include us as the landlord and owner of the real estate certain gaming authorities in the jurisdictions in which we hold properties may require us andor our affiliates to maintain a license as a key business entity or supplier because of our status as landlord gaming authorities also retain great discretion to require us to be found suitable as a landlord and certain of our stockholders officers and directors may be required to be found suitable as well 

in many jurisdictions gaming laws can require certain of our stockholders to file an application be investigated and qualify or have his her or its suitability determined by gaming authorities gaming authorities have very broad discretion in determining whether an applicant should be deemed suitable subject to certain administrative proceeding requirements the gaming regulators have the authority to deny any application or limit condition restrict revoke or suspend any license registration finding of suitability or approval or fine any person licensed registered or found suitable or approved for any cause deemed reasonable by the gaming authorities 

gaming authorities may conduct investigations into the conduct or associations of our directors officers key employees or investors to ensure compliance with applicable standards if we are required to be found suitable and are found suitable as a landlord we will be registered as a public company with the gaming authorities and will be subject to disciplinary action if after we receive notice that a person is unsuitable to be a stockholder or to have any other relationship with us we 

 many jurisdictions also require any person who acquires beneficial ownership of more than a certain percentage of voting securities of a gaming company and in some jurisdictions nonvoting securities typically 5 of a publiclytraded company to report the acquisition to gaming authorities and gaming authorities may require such holders to apply for qualification licensure or a finding of suitability subject to limited exceptions for “institutional investors” that hold a company’s voting securities for passive investment purposes only our outstanding shares of capital stock are held subject to applicable gaming laws any person owning or controlling at least 5 of the outstanding shares of any class of our capital stock is required to promptly notify us of such person’s identity some jurisdictions may also limit the number of gaming licenses in which a person may hold an ownership or a controlling interest 

further our directors officers key employees and investors in our shares must meet approval standards of certain gaming regulatory authorities if such gaming regulatory authorities were to find such a person or investor unsuitable we may be required to sever our relationship with that person or the investor may be required to dispose of his her or its interest in us our charter provides that all of our shares held by investors who are found to be unsuitable by regulatory authorities are subject to redemption upon our receipt of notice of such finding 

additionally the loss of our gaming licenses could result in an event of default under our certain of our indebtedness and crossdefault provisions in our debt agreements could cause an event of default under one debt agreement to trigger an event of default under our other debt agreements 

finally substantially all material loans significant acquisitions leases sales of securities and similar financing transactions by us and our subsidiaries must be reported to and in some cases approved by gaming authorities in advance of the transaction neither we nor any of our subsidiaries may make a public offering of securities without the prior approval of certain gaming authorities changes in control through merger consolidation stock or asset acquisitions management or consulting agreements or otherwise may be subject to receipt of prior approval of certain gaming authorities entities seeking to acquire control of us or one of our subsidiaries and certain of our affiliates must satisfy gaming authorities with respect to a variety of stringent standards prior to 

assuming control failure to satisfy the stringent licensing standards may preclude entities from acquiring control of us or one of our subsidiaries and certain of our affiliates andor require the entities to divest such control 

required regulatory approvals can delay or prohibit transfers of our gaming properties which could result in periods in which we are unable to receive rent for such properties and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition liquidity results of operations and prospects 

our tenants are and any future tenants of our gaming properties will be required to be licensed under applicable law in order to operate any of our properties as gaming facilities if the lease agreements or any future lease agreement we enter into are terminated which could be required by a regulatory agency or expire any new tenant must be licensed and receive other regulatory approvals to operate our properties as gaming facilities any delay in or inability of the new tenant to receive required licenses and other regulatory approvals from the applicable state and county government agencies may prolong the period during which we are unable to collect the applicable rent further in the event that the lease agreements or future lease agreements are terminated or expire and a new tenant is not licensed or fails to receive other regulatory approvals the properties may not be operated as gaming facilities and we will not be able to collect the applicable rent moreover we may be unable to transfer or sell the affected properties as gaming facilities which could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition liquidity results of operations and prospects 

tenants may choose not to renew the lease agreements 

the lease agreements each have an initial lease term of 15   years with the potential to extend the term for up to four additional fiveyear terms thereafter provided that for certain facilities the aggregate lease term including renewals is cutback to the extent it would otherwise exceed 80 of the remaining useful life of the applicable leased property solely at the option of the tenants at the expiration of the initial lease term or of any additional renewal term thereafter a tenant may choose not to renew the lease agreements if the lease agreements expire without renewal and we are not able to find suitable creditworthy tenants to replace a tenant on the same or more attractive terms our business financial condition liquidity results of operations and prospects may be materially and adversely affected including our ability to make distributions to our stockholders at the then current level or at all this risk would be exacerbated if caesars or penn national as the case may be determined not to renew or was prohibited from renewing due to the remaining useful life of the leased property all lease agreements at any one time 

net leases may not result in fair market lease rates over time which could negatively impact our results of operations and cash flows and reduce the amount of funds available to make distributions to stockholders 

all of our rental revenue is generated from the lease agreements which are triplenet leases and provide greater flexibility to the respective tenants related to the use of the applicable leased property than would be the case with ordinary property leases such as the right to freely sublease portions of each leased property to make alterations in the leased premises and to terminate the lease prior to its expiration under specified circumstances furthermore net leases typically have longer lease terms and thus there is an increased risk that contractual rental increases in future years will fail to result in fair market rental rates during those years as a result our results of operations and cash flows and distributions to our stockholders could be lower than they would otherwise be if we did not enter into a net lease 

the lease agreements may restrict our ability to sell the properties 

our ability to sell or dispose of our properties may be hindered by the fact that such properties are subject to the lease agreements as the terms of the lease agreements require that a purchaser assume the lease agreements or in certain cases enter into a severance lease with the tenants for the sold property on substantially the same terms as contained in the applicable lease agreement which may make our properties less attractive to a potential buyer than alternative properties that may be for sale 

properties within our portfolio are and properties that we may acquire in the future are likely to be operated and promoted under certain trademarks and brand names that we do not own 

most of the properties within our portfolio are currently operated and promoted under trademarks and brand names not owned by us including caesars palace horseshoe harrah’s bally’s and margaritaville in addition properties that we may acquire in the future may be operated and promoted under these same trademarks and brand names or under different trademarks and brand names we do not or will not own during the term that our properties are managed by our tenants we will be reliant on our tenants to maintain and protect the trademarks brand names and other licensed intellectual property used in the operation or promotion of the leased properties operation of the leased properties as well as our business and financial condition could be adversely impacted by infringement invalidation unauthorized use or litigation affecting any such intellectual property moreover if any of our properties are rebranded unsuccessfully it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition liquidity results of operations and prospects as we may not enjoy comparable recognition or status under a new brand a transition of 

management away from a caesars or penn national entity could also have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition liquidity results of operations and prospects 

we have a substantial amount of indebtedness and expect to incur additional indebtedness in connection with the closing of the pending greektown acquisition and may incur additional indebtedness in the future our substantial indebtedness exposes us to the risk of default under our debt obligations limits our operating flexibility increases the risks associated with a downturn in our business or in the businesses of our tenants and requires us to use a substantial portion of our cash to service our debt obligations 

we have a substantial amount of indebtedness and debt service requirements as of december 31 2018 we had approximate ly 41 bi llion in longterm indebtedness consisting of 

 in addition we expect to incur additional indebtedness in connection with the closing of the pending greektown acquisition and to pay related fees and expenses and we may incur additional indebtedness in the future to finance additional acquisitions or otherwise as of december 31 2018 we also have 4000 million of available capacity to borrow under our revolving credit facility 

our indebtedness is collateralized by substantially all of our properties payments of principal and interest under this indebtedness or any other instruments governing debt we may incur in the future may leave us with insufficient cash resources to pursue our business and growth strategies or to pay the distributions currently contemplated or necessary to qualify or maintain qualification as a reit our substantial outstanding indebtedness or future indebtedness and the limitations imposed on us by our debt agreements could have other significant adverse consequences including the following 

 if any one of these events were to occur our financial condition results of operations cash flows the market price of our common stock and our ability to satisfy our debt service obligations and to pay distributions to our stockholders could be materially and adversely affected in addition the foreclosure on our properties could create taxable income without accompanying cash proceeds which could result in entity level taxes to us or could adversely affect our ability to meet the distribution requirements necessary to qualify or maintain qualification as a reit 

in addition the code generally requires that a reit distribute annually to its stockholders at least 90 of its reit taxable income with certain adjustments determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gains and that it pay tax at regular corporate rates to the extent that it distributes annually less than 100 of its reit taxable income including capital gains vici golf is also subject to us federal income tax at regular corporate rates on any of its taxable income in order to maintain our status as a reit and avoid or otherwise minimize current entitylevel us federal income taxes a substantial portion of our cash flow after operating expenses and debt service will be required to be distributed to our stockholders 

because of the limitations on the amount of cash available to us after satisfying our debt service obligations and our distribution obligations to maintain our status as a reit and avoid or otherwise minimize current entitylevel us federal income taxes our ability to pursue our business and growth strategies will be limited 

any mechanic’s liens or similar liens incurred by the tenants under the lease agreements may attach to and constitute liens on our interests in the properties 

to the extent the tenants under the lease agreements make any improvements these improvements could cause mechanic’s liens or similar liens to attach to and constitute liens on our interests in the properties to the extent that mechanic’s liens or similar liens are recorded against any of the properties or any properties we may acquire in the future the holders of such mechanic’s liens or similar liens may enforce them by court action and courts may cause the applicable properties or future properties to be sold to satisfy such liens which could negatively impact our revenues results of operations cash flows and distributions to our stockholders further holders of such liens could have priority over our stockholders in the event of bankruptcy or liquidation and as a result a trustee in bankruptcy may have difficulty realizing or foreclosing on such properties in any such bankruptcy or liquidation and the amount of distributions our stockholders could receive in such bankruptcy or liquidation could be reduced 

adverse changes in our credit rating may affect our borrowing capacity and borrowing terms 

our outstanding debt is periodically rated by nationally recognized credit rating agencies the credit ratings are based upon our operating performance liquidity and leverage ratios overall financial condition and other factors viewed by the credit rating agencies as relevant to both our industry and the economic outlook our credit rating may affect the amount of capital we can access as well as the terms of any financing we obtain because we rely in part on debt financing to fund growth the absence of an investment grade credit rating or any credit rating downgrade or negative outlook may have a negative effect on our future growth 

we will have future capital needs and may not be able to obtain additional financing on acceptable terms 

we may incur additional indebtedness in the future to refinance our existing indebtedness or to finance newly acquired properties or for general corporate or other purposes any significant additional indebtedness could require a substantial portion of our cash flow to make interest and principal payments due on our indebtedness greater demands on our cash resources may reduce funds available to us to pay distributions make capital expenditures and acquisitions or carry out other aspects of our business and growth strategies increased indebtedness can also limit our ability to adjust rapidly to changing market conditions make us more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions and create competitive disadvantages for us compared to other companies with relatively lower debt levels increased future debt service obligations may limit our operational and financial flexibility further to the extent we were required to incur indebtedness our future interest costs would increase thereby reducing our earnings and cash flows from what they otherwise would have been 

moreover our ability to obtain additional financing and satisfy our financial obligations under indebtedness outstanding from time to time will depend upon our future operating performance which is subject to then prevailing general economic and credit market conditions including interest rate levels and the availability of credit generally and financial business and other factors many of which are beyond our control the prolonged continuation or worsening of current credit market conditions would have a material adverse effect on our ability to obtain financing on favorable terms if at all 

we may be unable to obtain additional financing or financing on favorable terms or our operating cash flow may be insufficient to satisfy our financial obligations under indebtedness outstanding from time to time if any among other things the absence of an investment grade credit rating or any credit rating downgrade or negative outlook could increase our financing costs and could limit our access to financing sources if financing is not available when needed or is available on unfavorable terms we may be unable to pursue our business and growth strategies or otherwise take advantage of new business opportunities or respond to competitive pressures any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition liquidity results of operations and prospects we may raise additional funds in the future through the issuance of equity securities and as a result our stockholders may experience significant dilution which may adversely affect the market price of our common stock and make it more difficult for our stockholders to sell our shares at a time and price that they deem appropriate and could impair our future ability to raise capital through an offering of our equity securities 

our ability to refinance our indebtedness as it becomes due depends on many factors some of which are beyond our control 

our ability to refinance our existing indebtedness and any future indebtedness will depend in part on our current and projected financial condition liquidity and results of operations and economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors many of these factors are beyond our control we cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance any of our indebtedness as it becomes due on commercially reasonable terms or at all if we are not able to refinance our indebtedness as it becomes due we will be obligated to pay such indebtedness with cash from our operations and we may not have sufficient cash to do so which would have a material and adverse effect on us 

covenants in our debt agreements limit our operational flexibility and a covenant breach or default could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition liquidity results of operations and prospects 

the agreements governing our indebtedness contain customary covenants including restrictions on our ability to grant liens on our assets incur indebtedness sell assets make investments engage in acquisitions mergers or consolidations and pay certain dividends and other restricted payments these covenants could impair our ability to pursue our business and growth strategies take advantage of new business opportunities or successfully compete a breach of any of these covenants or covenants under any other agreements governing our indebtedness could result in an event of default crossdefault provisions in our debt agreements could cause an event of default under one debt agreement to trigger an event of default under our other debt agreements upon the occurrence of an event of default under any of our debt agreements the lenders could elect to declare all outstanding debt under such agreements to be immediately due and payable if we were unable to repay or refinance the accelerated debt the lenders could proceed against any assets pledged to secure that debt including foreclosing on or requiring the sale of our properties and our assets may not be sufficient to repay such debt in full covenants that limit our operational flexibility as well as defaults under our debt instruments could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition liquidity results of operations and prospects 

a rise in interest rates may increase our overall interest rate expense and could adversely affect our stock price 

a rise in interest rates may increase our overall interest rate expense and have an adverse impact on our ability to pay distributions to our stockholders the risk presented by holding variable rate indebtedness can be managed or mitigated by utilizing interest rate protection products however there is no assurance that we will utilize any of these products effectively or all or that such products will be available to us in addition in the event of a rise in interest rates new debt whether fixed or variable is likely to be more expensive which could among other things make the financing of any acquisition more expensive and we may be unable to incur new debt or replace maturing debt with new debt at equal or better interest rates 

further the dividend yield on our common stock as a percentage of the price of such common stock will influence the market price of such common stock thus an increase in market interest rates may lead prospective purchasers of our common stock to expect a higher dividend yield which would adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

we have engaged and may engage in hedging transactions that may limit gains or result in losses 

we use derivatives to hedge certain of our liabilities and we currently have interest rate swap agreements in place as of december 31 2018 we had in place four interest rate swap agreements with third party financial institutions having an aggregate notional amount of 15 billion subsequent to year end on january 3 2019 we entered into two additional interest rate swap transactions having an aggregate notional amount of 5000 million bringing the aggregate notional amount of debt subject to an interest rate swap to 20 billion the interest rate swap transactions are designated as cash flow hedges that effectively fix the libor component of the interest rate on a portion of the outstanding debt under the term loan b facility the counterparties of these arrangements are major financial institutions however we are exposed to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties this has certain risks including losses on a hedge position which may reduce the return on our investments such losses may exceed the amount invested in such instruments in addition counterparties to a hedging arrangement could default on their obligations we may have to pay certain costs such as transaction fees or breakage costs related to hedging transactions 

we may not be able to purchase the properties subject to the call right agreements the second amended and restated right of first refusal agreement or the putcall agreement if we are unable to obtain additional financing in addition we may be forced to dispose of harrah’s las vegas to caesars possibly on disadvantageous terms 

the call right agreements provide for our right for up to five years after the formation date to enter into binding agreements to purchase the real property interest and all improvements associated with the option properties from caesars the putcall agreement that we entered into with caesars among other things provides us with the opportunity or the obligation to acquire the caesars forum convention center and lease it back to caesars the second amended and restated right of first refusal agreement provides us the right subject to certain exclusions to i acquire and lease to caesars any domestic gaming facilities located outside of the gaming enterprise district of clark county nevada proposed to be acquired or developed by caesars and ii acquire and lease to caesars any of the properties that caesars has recently agreed to acquire from centaur holdings llc in each case should caesars determine to sell any such properties in order to exercise these rights we would likely be required to secure additional financing and our substantial level of indebtedness following the formation date or other factors could limit our ability to do so on attractive terms or at all if we are unable to obtain financing on terms acceptable to us we may not be able to exercise these rights and acquire these properties even if financing with acceptable terms is available to us there can be no assurance that we will exercise any of these rights 

the putcall agreement among other things grants caesars the right to sell to and simultaneously lease back from us the caesars forum convention center if caesars exercises the right to sell to and lease from us the caesars forum convention center and 

the transactions do not close for reasons other than a default by caesars or a failure to obtain any required regulatory approvals caesars will have the right to acquire harrah’s las vegas from us all on and subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the putcall agreement in addition the hlv lease agreement grants caesars the right to purchase harrah’s las vegas from us if we engage in certain transactions with entities deemed to be competitors of caesars or if the landlord under the lease otherwise becomes a competitor of caesars the disposition of harrah’s las vegas to caesars pursuant to the putcall agreement or the hlv lease agreement may be at disadvantageous terms and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition liquidity results of operations and prospects 

the bankruptcy or insolvency of any tenant or guarantor could result in the termination of the lease agreements and the related guarantees and material losses to us 

we are subject to the credit risk of our tenants we cannot assure you that our tenants will not default on their leases and fail to make rental payments to us in particular disruptions in the financial and credit markets local economic conditions and other factors affecting the gaming industry may affect our tenants’ ability to obtain financing to operate their businesses or continue to profitability execute their business plans this in turn may cause our tenants to be unable to meet their financial obligations including making rental payments to us which may result in their bankruptcy or insolvency in the event of a bankruptcy of caesars crc or penn national any claim for damages under the guarantee may not be paid in full furthermore although the tenants’ performance and payments under the caesars lease agreements are guaranteed by caesars or crc as the case may be a default by the applicable tenant under the caesars lease agreement or by caesars or crc with regard to its guarantee may cause a default under certain circumstances with regard to the entire portfolio covered by the caesars lease agreements in event of a bankruptcy there can be no assurances that the tenants caesars or crc would assume the caesars lease agreements or the related guarantees and if the caesars lease agreements or guarantees were rejected the tenant caesars or crc as applicable may not have sufficient funds to pay the damages that would be owed to us a result of the rejection and we might not be able to find a replacement tenant on the same or better terms for these and other reasons the bankruptcy of one or more tenants caesars crc or penn national would have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition liquidity results of operations and prospects 

our pursuit of investments in and acquisitions of additional properties may be unsuccessful or fail to meet our expectations 

we intend to continue to pursue acquisitions of additional properties and seek acquisitions and other strategic opportunities accordingly we may often be engaged in evaluating potential transactions and other strategic alternatives in addition from time to time we may engage in discussions that may result in one or more transactions although there is uncertainty that any of these discussions will result in definitive agreements or the completion of any transaction we may devote a significant amount of our management resources to such a transaction which could negatively impact our operations we may incur significant costs in connection with seeking acquisitions or other strategic opportunities regardless of whether the transaction is completed and to the extent applicable in combining our operations if such a transaction is completed 

we operate in a highly competitive industry and face competition from other reits investment companies private equity and hedge fund investors sovereign funds lenders gaming companies and other investors some of whom are significantly larger and have greater resources access to capital and lower costs of capital increased competition will make it more challenging to identify and successfully capitalize on acquisition opportunities that meet our investment objectives if we cannot identify and purchase a sufficient quantity of gaming properties and other properties at favorable prices or if we are unable to finance acquisitions on commercially favorable terms our business financial condition liquidity results of operations and prospects could be materially and adversely affected additionally the fact that we must distribute 90 of our reit taxable income in order to maintain our qualification as a reit may limit our ability to rely upon rental payments from our leased properties or subsequently acquired properties in order to finance acquisitions as a result if debt or equity financing is not available on acceptable terms further acquisitions might be limited or curtailed 

investments in and acquisitions of gaming properties and other properties we might seek to acquire entail risks associated with real estate investments generally including that the investment’s performance will fail to meet expectations that the cost estimates for necessary property improvements will prove inaccurate or the operator or manager will underperform real estate development projects present other risks including construction delays or cost overruns that increase expenses the inability to obtain required zoning occupancy and other governmental approvals and permits on a timely basis and the incurrence of significant development costs prior to completion of the project 

further even if we were able to acquire additional properties in the future there is no guarantee that such properties would be able to maintain their historical performance which may prevent the ability of our tenants to pay the partial or total amount of the required lease payments under the respective lease agreements in addition our financing of these acquisitions could negatively impact our cash flows and liquidity require us to incur substantial debt or involve the issuance of substantial new equity which would be dilutive to existing stockholders we have a substantial amount of indebtedness outstanding which may affect our ability 

to pay distributions may expose us to interest rate fluctuation risk and may expose us to the risk of default under our debt obligations in addition we cannot assure you that we will be successful in implementing our business and growth strategies or that any expansion will improve operating results the failure to identify and acquire new properties effectively or the failure of any acquired properties to perform as expected could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition liquidity results of operations and prospects and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders 

we may fail to consummate the pending acquisition of greektown or may not consummate such acquisition on the terms agreed to we could be required under certain circumstances to pay significant termination fees or liquidated damages to the seller in the pending acquisition 

the consummation of our pending acquisition of greektown is subject to certain customary regulatory and other closing conditions which make the completion and timing of the closing uncertain and accordingly there can be no assurance that such conditions will be satisfied on the anticipated schedule or at all if we fail to consummate the pending acquisition we will not have acquired the revenue generating asset that will be required to produce the earnings and cash flow we anticipated as a result failure to consummate the acquisition would reduce our anticipated rental revenue and adversely affect our earnings per share and our ability to make distributions to stockholders and the market price of our common stock could decline to the extent that the current market price reflects a market assumption that the pending acquisition will be completed furthermore our ability to raise the amount of longterm debt financing necessary to fund the pending acquisition is subject to market and economic conditions 

the transaction documents for the pending acquisition provide that in specified circumstances we could be required to pay significant termination fees or liquidated damages to the seller if such a termination fee or liquidated damages is payable under any such circumstance described above the payment could have a material adverse effect on us 

we may sell or divest different properties or assets after an evaluation of our portfolio of businesses such sales or divestitures would affect our costs revenues results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

from time to time we may evaluate our properties and may as a result sell or attempt to sell divest or spinoff different properties or assets subject to the terms of the lease agreements these sales or divestitures would affect our costs revenues results of operations financial condition liquidity and our ability to comply with financial covenants divestitures have inherent risks including possible delays in closing transactions including potential difficulties in obtaining regulatory approvals the risk of lowerthanexpected sales proceeds for the divested businesses and potential postclosing claims for indemnification in addition current economic conditions and relatively illiquid real estate markets may result in fewer potential bidders and unsuccessful sales efforts 

our properties are subject to risks from natural disasters such as earthquakes hurricanes severe weather and terrorism 

our properties are located in areas that may be subject to natural disasters such as earthquakes and extreme weather conditions including but not limited to hurricanes such natural disasters or extreme weather conditions may interrupt operations at the casinos damage our properties and reduce the number of customers who visit our facilities in such areas a severe earthquake could damage or destroy our properties in addition our operations could be adversely impacted by a drought or other cause of water shortage a severe drought of extensive duration experienced in las vegas or in the other regions in which we operate could adversely affect the business and financial results at our properties although the tenants are required to maintain both property and business interruption insurance coverage such coverage is subject to deductibles and limits on maximum benefits including limitation on the coverage period for business interruption and we cannot assure you that we or the tenants will be able to fully insure such losses or fully collect if at all on claims resulting from such natural disasters while the lease agreements require and new lease agreements are expected to require that comprehensive insurance and hazard insurance be maintained by the tenants there are certain types of losses generally of a catastrophic nature such as earthquakes hurricanes and floods that may be uninsurable or not economically insurable insurance coverage may not be sufficient to pay the full current market value or current replacement cost of a loss inflation changes in building codes and ordinances environmental considerations and other factors also might make it infeasible to use insurance proceeds to replace the property after such property has been damaged or destroyed under such circumstances the insurance proceeds received might not be adequate to restore the economic position with respect to such property if we experience a loss that is uninsured or that exceeds our policy coverage limits we could lose the capital invested in the damaged properties as well as the anticipated future cash flows from those properties 

terrorist attacks or other acts of violence may result in declining economic activity which could harm the demand for goods and services offered by our tenants and the value of our properties and might adversely affect the value of an investment in our common stock such a resulting decrease in retail demand could make it difficult for us to renew or release our properties to suitable creditworthy tenants at lease rates equal to or above historical rates terrorist activities or violence also could directly affect the value of our properties through damage destruction or loss and the availability of insurance for such acts or of insurance generally might be lower or cost more which could increase our operating expenses and adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows to the extent that any of our tenants is affected by future terrorist attacks or violence its business similarly could be adversely 

affected including the ability of our tenants to continue to meet their obligations to us these events might erode business and consumer confidence and spending and might result in increased volatility in national and international financial markets and economies any one of these events might decrease demand for real estate decrease or delay the occupancy of our new or redeveloped properties and limit our access to capital or increase our cost of raising capital 

in addition the caesars lease agreements as applicable allow the tenants to remove a property from the noncplv lease agreement and to terminate the cplv lease agreement the joliet lease agreement or the hlv lease agreement as the case may be during the final two years of the lease terms if the cost to rebuild or restore a property in connection with a casualty event exceeds 25 of total property fair market value similarly if a condemnation event occurs that renders a facility unsuitable for its primary intended use the applicable tenants may remove the property from the noncplv lease agreement and may terminate the cplv lease agreement the joliet lease agreement or the hlv lease agreement as the case may be the margaritaville lease agreement allows the tenant to terminate the margaritaville lease agreement during the final year of the lease term if 50 or more of the square feet of the improvements are destroyed by a casualty event such that the improvements are rendered substantially untenantable if a condemnation event occurs that renders the margaritaville resort casino reasonably uneconomical for the operation of the improvements thereon on a commercially practicable basis for their permitted use as rentable facilities capable of producing a fair and reasonable net income therefrom the tenant may terminate the margaritaville lease agreement if a property is removed from the noncplv lease agreement or if the cplv lease agreement the joliet lease agreement the hlv lease agreement or the margaritaville lease agreement as the case may be is terminated we will lose the rent associated with the related facility which would have a negative impact on our financial results in this event following termination of the lease of a property even if we are able to restore the affected property we could be limited to selling or leasing such property to a new tenant in order to obtain an alternate source of revenue which may not happen on comparable terms or at all 

changes in building andor zoning laws may require us to update a property in the event of recapture or prevent us from fully restoring a property in the event of a substantial casualty loss andor require us to meet additional or more stringent construction requirements 

due to changes among other things in applicable building and zoning laws ordinances and codes that may affect certain of our properties that have come into effect after the initial construction of the properties certain properties may not comply fully with current building andor zoning laws including electrical fire health and safety codes and regulations use lot coverage parking and setback requirements but may qualify as permitted nonconforming uses although the lease agreements require our tenants to pay for and ensure continued compliance with applicable law there is no assurance that future leases will be negotiated on the same basis or that our tenants will make any changes required by the terms of the lease agreements andor any future leases we may enter into in addition such changes may limit a tenant’s ability to restore the premises of a property to its previous condition in the event of a substantial casualty loss with respect to the property or the ability to refurbish expand or renovate such property to remain compliant or increase the cost of construction in order to comply with changes in building or zoning codes and regulations if a tenant is unable to restore a property to its prior use after a substantial casualty loss or is required to comply with more stringent building or zoning codes and regulations we may be unable to release the space at a comparable effective rent or sell the property at an acceptable price which may materially and adversely affect our business financial condition liquidity results of operations and prospects 

certain properties are subject to restrictions pursuant to reciprocal easement agreements operating agreements or similar agreements 

many of the properties that we own are and properties that we may acquire in the future may be subject to use restrictions andor operational requirements imposed pursuant to ground leases restrictive covenants or conditions reciprocal easement agreements or operating agreements or other instruments that could among other things adversely affect our ability to lease space to third parties such property restrictions could include limitations on alterations changes expansions or reconfiguration of properties limitations on use of properties limitations affecting parking requirements or restrictions on exterior or interior signage or facades in certain cases consent of the other party or parties to such agreements may be required when altering reconfiguring expanding or redeveloping failure to secure such consents when necessary may harm our ability to execute leasing strategies which could adversely affect us 

the loss of the services of key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business 

our success and ability to grow depends in large part upon the leadership and performance of our executive management team particularly our chief executive officer our president and chief operating officer and our chief financial officer any unforeseen loss of our executive officers’ services or any negative market or industry perception with respect to them or arising from their loss could have a material adverse effect on our business we do not have key man or similar life insurance policies covering members of our senior management we have employment agreements with our executive officers but these agreements do not guarantee that any given executive will remain with us and there can be no assurance that any such officers will remain with us 

the appointment or replacement of certain key members of our executive management team is subject to regulatory approvals based upon suitability determinations by gaming regulatory authorities in the jurisdictions where our properties are located if any of our executive officers is found unsuitable by any such gaming regulatory authorities or if we otherwise lose their services we would have to find alternative candidates and may not be able to successfully manage our business or achieve our business objectives 

environmental compliance costs and liabilities associated with real estate properties owned by us may materially impair the value of those investments 

as an owner of real property we are subject to various federal state and local environmental and health and safety laws and regulations although we do not operate or manage most of our properties we may be held primarily or jointly and severally liable for costs relating to the investigation and cleanup of any property from which there has been a release or threatened release of a regulated material as well as other affected properties regardless of whether we knew of or caused the release and to preserve claims for damages further some environmental laws create a lien on a contaminated site in favor of the government for damages and the costs the government incurs in connection with such contamination 

although under the lease agreements the tenants are required to indemnify us for certain environmental liabilities including environmental liabilities it causes the amount of such liabilities could exceed the financial ability of the applicable tenants to indemnify us in addition the presence of contamination or the failure to remediate contamination may adversely affect our ability to sell or lease our properties or to borrow using our properties as collateral 

we may be required to contribute insurance proceeds with respect to casualty events at our properties to the lenders under our debt financing agreements 

in the event that we were to receive insurance proceeds with respect to a casualty event at any of our properties we may be required under the terms of our debt financing agreements to contribute all or a portion of those proceeds to the repayment of such debt which may prevent us from restoring such properties to their prior state if the remainder of the proceeds after any such required repayment were insufficient to make the repairs necessary to restore the damaged properties to a condition substantially equivalent to its state immediately prior to the casualty we may not have sufficient liquidity to otherwise fund these repairs and may be required to obtain additional financing which could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition liquidity results of operations and prospects 

if we fail to establish and maintain an effective system of integrated internal controls we may not be able to report our financial results accurately which could have a material adverse effect on us 

as a reporting company we are required to develop and implement substantial control systems policies and procedures in order to qualify and maintain our qualification as a reit and satisfy our periodic sec reporting requirements we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully develop and implement these systems policies and procedures and to operate our company or that any such development and implementation will be effective failure to do so could jeopardize our status as a reit or as a reporting company and the loss of such statuses would materially and adversely affect us if we fail to develop implement or maintain proper overall business controls including as required to support our growth our operating and financial results could be harmed or we could fail to meet our reporting obligations in addition the existence of a material weakness or significant deficiency could result in errors in our financial statements that could require a restatement cause us to fail to meet our sec reporting obligations and cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information which could have a material adverse effect on us and on the market price of our common stock 

we face risks associated with security breaches through cyberattacks cyberintrusions or otherwise as well as other significant disruptions of our information technology it networks and related systems 

we face risks associated with security breaches whether through cyberattacks or cyberintrusions over the internet malware computer viruses attachments to emails persons inside our organization or persons with access to systems inside our organization and other significant disruptions of our it networks and related systems the risk of a security breach or disruption particularly through cyberattack or cyberintrusion including by computer hackers foreign governments and cyber terrorists has generally increased as the number intensity and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions from around the world have increased our it networks and related systems are essential to the operation of our business and our ability to perform daytoday operations although we make efforts to maintain the security and integrity of these types of it networks and related systems and we have implemented various measures to manage the risk of a security breach or disruption there can be no assurance that our security efforts and measures will be effective or that attempted security breaches or disruptions would not be successful or damaging a security breach or other significant disruption involving our it networks and related systems could disrupt the proper functioning of our networks and systems result in misstated financial reports violations of loan covenants andor missed reporting deadlines result in our inability to monitor our compliance with the rules and regulations regarding our qualification as a reit result in the

climate change may adversely affect our business 

climate change including rising sea levels extreme weather and changes in precipitation and temperature may result in physical damage to a decrease in demand for andor a decrease in rent from and value of our properties located in the areas affected by these conditions we own a number of assets in lowlying areas close to sea level making those assets susceptible to a rise in sea level if sea levels were to rise we may incur material costs to protect our lowlying assets to the extent not covered by our tenants under the terms of our leases or may sustain damage a decrease in value or total loss of such assets in addition climate change may result in reduced economic activity in these areas which could harm the operations of our tenants and reduce the demand at our properties which could reduce the rent payable to us under our triplenet leases and make it difficult for us to renew or release our properties on favorable lease terms  furthermore our insurance premiums may increase as a result of the threat of climate change or the effects of climate change may not be covered by our insurance policies in addition changes in federal and state legislation and regulations on climate change could result in increased capital expenditures to improve the energy efficiency of our existing properties or other related aspects of our properties in order to comply with such regulations or otherwise adapt to climate change any of the above could have a material and adverse effect on us 

if our separation from ceoc together with certain related transactions does not qualify as a transaction that is generally taxfree for us federal income tax purposes ceoc could be subject to significant tax liabilities and in certain circumstances we could be required to indemnify ceoc for material taxes pursuant to indemnification obligations under the tax matters agreement 

the irs issued a private letter ruling with respect to certain issues relevant to our separation from ceoc including relating to the separation and certain related transactions as taxfree for us federal income tax purposes under certain provisions of the code the irs ruling does not address certain requirements for taxfree treatment of the separation ceoc received from its tax advisors a tax opinion substantially to the effect that with respect to such requirements on which the irs did not rule such requirements should be satisfied the irs ruling and the tax opinion that ceoc received relied on among other things certain representations assumptions and undertakings including those relating to the past and future conduct of our business and the irs ruling and the opinion would not be valid if such representations assumptions and undertakings were incorrect in any material respect 

notwithstanding the irs ruling and the tax opinion the irs could determine the separation should be treated as a taxable transaction for us federal income tax purposes if it determines any of the representations assumptions or undertakings that were included in the request for the irs ruling are false or have been violated or if it disagrees with the conclusions in the opinion that are not covered by the irs ruling 

if the reorganization fails to qualify for taxfree treatment in general ceoc would be subject to tax as if it had sold our assets to us in a taxable sale for their fair market value and ceoc’s creditors who received shares of our common stock pursuant to the plan of reorganization would be subject to tax as if they had received a taxable distribution in respect of their claims equal to the fair market value of such shares 

under the tax matters agreement that we entered into with caesars we generally are required to indemnify caesars against any tax resulting from the separation to the extent that such tax resulted from certain of our representations or undertakings being incorrect or violated our indemnification obligations to caesars are not limited by any maximum amount as a result if we are required to indemnify caesars or such other persons under the circumstances set forth in the tax matters agreement we may be subject to substantial liabilities 

we may not be able to engage in desirable strategic or capitalraising transactions following the spinoff in addition we could be liable for adverse tax consequences resulting from engaging in significant strategic or capitalraising transactions 

to preserve the taxfree treatment to ceoc of the spinoff for the twoyear period following the spinoff we may be prohibited except in specific circumstances from 1 entering into any transaction pursuant to which all or a portion of our stock would be acquired whether by merger or otherwise 2 issuing equity securities beyond certain thresholds 3 repurchasing our common stock 4 ceasing to actively conduct the business of operating vici golf or 5 taking or failing to take any other action that 

prevents the spinoff and related transactions from being taxfree these restrictions may limit our ability to pursue strategic transactions or engage in new business or other transactions that may maximize the value of our business 

risks related to our status as a reit 

we may not qualify or maintain our qualification as a reit 

we elected to be taxed as a reit for us federal income tax purposes commencing with our taxable year ended december 31 2017 and expect to operate in a manner that will allow us to continue to be classified as such the code generally requires that a reit distribute annually to its stockholders at least 90 of its reit taxable income with certain adjustments determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gains and that it pay tax at regular corporate rates to the extent that it distributes annually less than 100 of its reit taxable income including capital gains in addition a reit is required to pay a 4 nondeductible excise tax on the amount if any by which the distributions it makes in a calendar year are less than the sum of 85 of its ordinary income 95 of its capital gain net income and 100 of its undistributed income from prior years as a result in order to avoid current entity level us federal income taxes a substantial portion of our cash flow after operating expenses and debt service will be required to be distributed to our stockholders 

if we were to fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year we would be subject to us federal income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates and dividends paid to our stockholders would not be deductible by us in computing our reit taxable income any resulting corporate tax liability could be substantial and would reduce the amount of cash available for distribution to our stockholders which in turn could have an adverse impact on the market price of our common stock unless we were entitled to relief under certain code provisions we also would be disqualified from reelecting to be taxed as a reit for the four taxable years following the year in which we failed to qualify as a reit as a result the amount available for distribution to holders of equity securities that would otherwise receive dividends would be reduced for the year or years involved furthermore the us federal income tax consequences of distributions and sales of our shares to certain of our stockholders could be adversely impacted if we were to fail to qualify as a reit 

finally our qualification to be taxed as a reit will depend on our satisfaction of certain asset income organizational distribution stockholder ownership and other requirements on a continuing basis our ability to satisfy the asset tests depends upon our analysis of the characterization and fair market values of our assets some of which are not susceptible to a precise determination and for which we may not obtain independent appraisals any failure to qualify to be taxed as a reit or failure to remain to be qualified to be taxed as a reit would have a material and adverse effect on us 

qualification to be taxed as a reit involves highly technical and complex provision of the code and violations of these provisions could jeopardize our reit qualification 

qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex code provisions for which only limited judicial and administrative authorities exist even a technical or inadvertent violation could jeopardize our reit qualification our qualification as a reit depends on our satisfaction of certain asset income organizational distribution stockholder ownership and other requirements on a continuing basis in addition our ability to satisfy the requirements to qualify as a reit may depend in part on the actions of third parties over which we have no control or only limited influence including in cases where we own an equity interest in an entity that is classified as a partnership for us federal income tax purposes 

we may in the future choose to pay dividends in the form of our own common stock in which case stockholders may be required to pay income taxes in excess of the cash dividends they receive 

we   may seek in the future to distribute taxable dividends that are payable in cash or our common stock taxable stockholders receiving such dividends will be required to include the full amount of the dividend as ordinary income to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits for us federal income tax purposes as to which noncorporate stockholders will generally be eligible for a deduction equal to 20 of such distributions as a result stockholders receiving dividends in the form of common stock may be required to pay income taxes with respect to such dividends in excess of the cash dividends received if any if a us stockholder sells the common stock that it receives as   a dividend in order to pay this tax the sales proceeds may be less than the amount included in income with respect to the dividend depending on the market price of our common stock at the time of the sale in addition in such case a   us stockholder could have a capital loss with respect to the common stock sold that could not be used to offset such dividend income moreover with respect to certain nonus stockholders we may be required to withhold us federal income tax with respect to such dividends including in respect of all or a portion of such dividend that is payable in common stock furthermore such a taxable share dividend could be viewed as equivalent to a reduction in our cash distributions and that factor as well as the possibility that a significant number of our stockholders determine to sell our common stock in order to pay taxes owed on dividends may put downward pressure on the market price of our common stock 

changes to the us federal income tax laws including the recent enactment of certain tax reform measures could have a material and adverse effect on us 

us federal income tax laws governing reits and other corporations and the administrative interpretations of those laws may be amended at any time potentially with retroactive effect we cannot predict whether when or to what extent new us federal tax laws regulations interpretations or rulings will be issued prospective investors are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding the effect of potential changes to the us federal tax laws on an investment in our common stock 

recently enacted changes to the us federal income tax laws could have a material and adverse effect on us for example certain changes in law pursuant to the law known as the tax cuts and jobs act could reduce the relative competitive advantage of operating as a reit as compared with operating as a c corporation including by 

 we could fail to qualify to be taxed as a reit if income we receive from our tenants is not treated as qualifying income 

under applicable provisions of the code we will not be treated as a reit unless we satisfy various requirements including requirements relating to the sources of our gross income rents received or accrued by us from our tenants will not be treated as qualifying rent for purposes of these requirements if the leases are not respected as true leases for us federal income tax purposes and instead are treated as service contracts joint ventures or some other type of arrangement if some or all of our leases are not respected as true leases for us federal income tax purposes we may fail to qualify to be taxed as a reit furthermore our qualification as a reit will depend on our satisfaction of certain asset income organizational distribution stockholder ownership and other requirements on a continuing basis our ability to satisfy the asset tests depends upon our analysis of the characterization and fair market values of our assets some of which are not susceptible to a precise determination and for which we may not obtain independent appraisals 

in addition subject to certain exceptions rents received or accrued by us from any tenant or affiliated tenants will not be treated as qualifying rent for purposes of these requirements if we or an actual or constructive owner of 10 or more of our stock actually or constructively owns 10 or more of the total combined voting power of all classes of such tenant’s stock entitled to vote or 10 or more of the total value of all classes of such tenant’s stock our charter provides restrictions on ownership and transfer of our shares of stock including restrictions on such ownership or transfer that would cause the rents received or accrued by us from tenants to be treated as nonqualifying rent for purposes of the reit gross income requirements nevertheless there can be no assurance that such restrictions will be effective in ensuring that rents received or accrued by us from tenants will not be treated as qualifying rent for purposes of reit qualification requirements 

reit distribution requirements could adversely affect our ability to execute our business plan 

we generally must distribute annually to our stockholders at least 90 of our reit taxable income with certain adjustments determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding any net capital gains in order for us to qualify as a reit so that us federal corporate income tax does not apply to earnings that we distribute to the extent that we satisfy this distribution requirement and qualify for taxation as a reit but distribute less than 100 of our reit taxable income determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and including any net capital gains we will be subject to us federal corporate income tax on any undistributed portion of such taxable income in addition we will be subject to a 4 nondeductible excise tax if the actual amount that we distribute to our stockholders in a calendar year is less than a minimum amount specified under us federal tax laws we intend to make distributions to our stockholders to comply with the reit requirements of the code and to avoid or otherwise minimize paying entity level federal or excise tax other than at any trs of ours we may generate taxable income greater than our income for financial reporting purposes prepared in accordance with gaap further we may generate taxable income greater than our cash flow from operations after operating expenses and debt service as a result of differences in timing between the recognition of taxable income and the actual receipt of cash or the effect of nondeductible capital expenditures the creation of reserves or required debt or amortization payments in order to avoid or otherwise minimize current entity level us federal income taxes we will generally be required to distribute sufficient cash flow after operating expenses and debt service payments to satisfy the reit distribution requirements while we intend to make distributions to our stockholders to comply with the reit requirements of the code we may not have sufficient liquidity to meet the reit distribution requirements if our cash flow is insufficient to satisfy the reit distribution requirements we could be required to raise capital on unfavorable terms sell assets at disadvantageous prices distribute amounts that would otherwise be invested in future acquisitions or issue dividends in 

the form of shares of our common stock to make distributions sufficient to enable us to pay out enough of our reit taxable income to satisfy the reit distribution requirement and to avoid corporate income tax and the 4 excise tax in a particular year these alternatives could increase our costs or change the value of our equity thus compliance with the reit requirements may hinder our ability to grow which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

even if we qualify as a reit we may face other tax liabilities that reduce our cash flow 

even if we qualify for taxation as a reit we may be subject to certain us federal state and local taxes on our income and assets including taxes on any undistributed income and state or local income property and transfer taxes for example in order to meet the reit qualification requirements we currently hold and expect in the future to hold some of our assets and conduct certain of our activities through one or more taxable reit subsidiaries or other subsidiary corporations that will be subject to federal state and local corporatelevel income taxes as regular c corporations ie corporations generally subject to corporatelevel income tax under subchapter c of chapter 1 the code in addition we may incur a 100 excise tax on transactions with a taxable reit subsidiary if they are not conducted on an arm’s length basis any of these taxes would decrease cash available for distribution to our stockholders 

complying with reit requirements may cause us to liquidate or forgo otherwise attractive opportunities and limit our expansion opportunities 

to qualify as a reit for us federal income tax purposes we must continually satisfy tests concerning among other things our sources of income the nature of our investments in real estate and related assets the amounts we distribute to our stockholders and the ownership of our stock we may also be required to make distributions to stockholders at disadvantageous times or when we do not have funds readily available for distribution 

as a reit we must ensure that at the end of each calendar quarter at least 75 of the value of our assets consists of cash cash items government securities and “real estate assets” as defined in the code including certain mortgage loans and securities the remainder of our investments other than government securities qualified real estate assets and securities issued by a taxable reit subsidiary generally cannot include more than 10 of the outstanding voting securities of any one issuer or more than 10 of the total value of the outstanding securities of any one issuer in addition in general no more than 5 of the value of our total assets other than government securities qualified real estate assets and securities issued by a taxable reit subsidiary can consist of the securities of any one issuer and no more than 20 of the value of our total assets can be represented by securities of one or more taxable reit subsidiaries in addition not more than 25 of our total assets may be represented by debt instruments issued by publicly offered reits that are “nonqualified” debt instruments if we fail to comply with these requirements at the end of any calendar quarter we must correct the failure within 30 days after the end of the calendar quarter or qualify for certain statutory relief provisions to avoid losing our reit qualification and suffering adverse tax consequences as a result we may be required to liquidate from our portfolio or contribute to a trs or forgo otherwise attractive investments in order to maintain our qualification as a reit these actions could have the effect of reducing our income and amounts available for distribution to our stockholders in addition to the asset tests set forth above to qualify as a reit we must continually satisfy tests concerning among other things the sources of our income the amounts we distribute to our stockholders and the ownership of our stock we may be unable to pursue investments that would be otherwise advantageous to us in order to satisfy the sourceofincome or assetdiversification requirements for qualifying as a reit thus compliance with the reit requirements may hinder our ability to make certain attractive investments 

we may be subject to builtin gains tax on the disposition of certain of our properties 

if we   acquire certain properties in taxdeferred transactions which properties were held by one or more c corporations before they were held by us we may be subject to a builtin gain tax on future disposition of such properties this is the case with respect to all or substantially all of the properties acquired from ceoc pursuant to the formation transactions as well as certain other properties we have acquired and may acquire in the future if we dispose of any such properties during the fiveyear period following acquisition of the properties from the respective c corporation ie during the fiveyear period following ownership of such properties by a reit we will be subject to us federal income tax and applicable state and local taxes at the highest corporate tax rates on any gain recognized from the disposition of such properties to the extent of the excess of the fair market value of the properties on the date that they were contributed to or acquired by us in a taxdeferred transaction over the adjusted tax basis of such properties on such date which are referred to as builtin gains similarly if we recognize certain other income considered to be builtin income during the fiveyear period following the property acquisitions described above we could be subject to us federal tax under the builtin gains tax rules we would be subject to this corporatelevel tax liability without the benefit of the deduction for dividends paid even if we qualify and maintain our status as a reit any recognized builtin gain will retain its character as ordinary income or capital gain and will be taken into account in determining reit taxable income and the reit distribution requirements any tax on the recognized builtin gain will reduce reit taxable income we may choose to forego otherwise attractive opportunities to sell assets in a taxable transaction during the fiveyear builtin gain recognition period in order 

to avoid this builtin gain tax however there can be no assurance that such a taxable transaction will not occur the amount of any such builtin gain tax could be material and the resulting tax liability could have a negative effect on our cash flow and limit our ability to pay distributions required to qualify and maintain our status as a reit 

complying with reit requirements may limit our ability to hedge effectively and may cause us to incur tax liabilities 

the reit provisions of the code substantially limit our ability to hedge our assets and liabilities income from certain hedging transactions that we may enter into to manage risk of interest rate changes with respect to borrowings made or to be made to acquire or carry real estate assets or from transactions to manage risk of currency fluctuations with respect to any item of income or gain that satisfy the reit gross income tests including gain from the termination of such a transaction does not constitute “gross income” for purposes of the 75 or 95 gross income tests that apply to reits provided that certain identification requirements are met to the extent that we enter into other types of hedging transactions or fail to properly identify such transaction as a hedge the income is likely to be treated as nonqualifying income for purposes of both of the gross income tests as a result of these rules we may be required to limit our use of advantageous hedging techniques or implement those hedges through a taxable reit subsidiary this could increase the cost of our hedging activities because the taxable reit subsidiary may be subject to tax on gains or expose us to greater risks associated with changes in interest rates that we would otherwise want to bear in addition losses in the taxable reit subsidiary will generally not provide any tax benefit except that such losses could theoretically be carried back or forward against past or future taxable income of the taxable reit subsidiary 

we may pay a purging distribution if any in common stock and cash 

in order to qualify as a reit we must distribute any “earnings and profits” as defined in the code accumulated by us during any period for which we did not qualify as a reit or by any entity whose accumulated earnings and profits we acquire during any period for which such entity did not qualify as a reit such distribution requirement applied to any earnings and profits that were allocated from ceoc to us in connection with the formation transactions by the end of the first taxable year in which we elected reit status based on our analysis we do not believe that any earnings and profits were allocated to us in connection with the formation transactions or any other transaction to which we are party and therefore did not make a purging distribution and do not currently intend to make any purging distribution with respect to transactions to which we are a party if we are required to make a purging distribution in the future we may pay the purging distribution to our stockholders in a combination of cash and shares of our common stock each of our stockholders will be permitted to elect to receive the stockholder’s entire entitlement under the purging distribution in either cash or shares of our common stock subject to a cash limitation if our stockholders elect to receive a portion of cash in excess of the cash limitation each such electing stockholder will receive a pro rata portion of cash corresponding to the stockholder’s respective entitlement under the purging distribution declaration the irs has issued a revenue procedure that provides that so long as a reit complied with certain provisions therein certain distributions that are paid partly in cash and partly in stock will be treated as taxable dividends that would satisfy the reit distribution requirements and qualify for the dividends paid deduction for us federal income tax purposes in a purging distribution if any a stockholder of our common stock will be required to report dividend income equal to the amount of cash and common stock received as a result of the purging distribution even though we may distribute no cash or only nominal amounts of cash to such stockholder 

the cash available for distribution to stockholders may not be sufficient to pay dividends at expected levels nor can we assure you of our ability to make distributions in the future we may use borrowed funds to make distributions 

if cash available for distribution is less than the amount necessary to make cash distributions our inability to make the expected distributions could result in a decrease in the market price of our common stock all distributions will be made at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon various factors including but not limited to our historical and projected financial condition cash flows results of operations and reit taxable income limitations contained in financing instruments debt service requirements operating cash inflows and outflows including capital expenditures and acquisitions limitations on our ability to use cash generated in one or more taxable reit subsidiaries if any to fund distributions and applicable law we may not be able to make distributions in the future in addition some of our distributions may include a return of capital to the extent that we decide to make distributions in excess of our current and accumulated earnings and profits in the future such distributions would generally be considered a return of capital for federal income tax purposes to the extent of the holder’s adjusted tax basis in their shares a return of capital is not taxable but it has the effect of reducing the holder’s adjusted tax basis in our common stock to the extent that such distributions exceed the adjusted tax basis of a holder’s shares they will be treated as gain from the sale or exchange of such stock if we borrow to fund distributions our future interest costs would increase thereby reducing our earnings and cash available for distribution from what they otherwise would have been 

for purposes of satisfying the minimum distribution requirement to qualify for and maintain reit status our reit taxable income will be calculated without reference to our cash flow consequently under certain circumstances we may not have available cash to make our required distributions and we may need to raise additional equity or debt in order to fund our intended distributions or we may distribute a portion of our distributions in the form of our common stock or debt instruments which could result in 

significant stockholder dilution or higher leverage while the irs has issued a revenue procedure indicating that certain distributions that are made partly in cash and partly in stock will be treated as taxable dividends that would satisfy that reit annual distribution requirement and qualify for the dividends paid deduction for us federal income tax purposes no assurance can be provided that we will be able to satisfy the requirements of the revenue procedure therefore it is unclear whether and to what extent we will be able to make taxable dividends payable inkind in addition to the extent we were to make distributions that include our common stock or debt instruments a stockholder of ours will be required to report dividend income as a result of such distributions even though we distributed no cash or only nominal amounts of cash to such stockholder 

risks related to our organizational structure 

vici is a holding company with no direct operations and relies on distributions received from the operating partnership to make distributions to its stockholders 

vici is a holding company and conducts its operations through subsidiaries including the operating partnership and vici golf vici does not have apart from the units that it owns in the operating partnership and vici golf any independent operations as a result vici relies on distributions from its operating partnership to make any distributions to its stockholders it might declare on its common stock and to meet any of its obligations including any tax liability on taxable income allocated to it from the operating partnership which might not be able to make distributions to vici equal to the tax on such allocated taxable income in turn the ability of subsidiaries of the operating partnership to make distributions to the operating partnership and therefore the ability of the operating partnership to make distributions to vici depends on the operating results of these subsidiaries and the operating partnership and on the terms of any financing arrangements they have entered into in addition because vici is a holding company claims of common stockholders of vici are structurally subordinated to all existing and future liabilities and other obligations whether or not for borrowed money and any preferred equity of the operating partnership and its subsidiaries therefore in the event of our bankruptcy liquidation or reorganization vici’s assets and those of the operating partnership and its subsidiaries will be available to satisfy the claims of vici common stockholders only after all of vici’s the operating partnership’s and its subsidiaries’ liabilities and other obligations and any preferred equity of any of them have been paid in full 

the operating partnership may in connection with its acquisition of additional properties or otherwise issue additional common units or preferred units to third parties such issuances would reduce vici’s ownership in the operating partnership because stockholders of vici do not directly own common units or preferred units of the operating partnership they do not have any voting rights with respect to any such issuances or other partnership level activities of the operating partnership 

our rights and the rights of our stockholders to take action against our directors and officers are limited 

the maryland general corporation law the “mgcl” provides that a director has no liability in any action based on an act of the director if he or she has acted in good faith in a manner he or she reasonably believes to be in the corporation’s best interests and with the care that an ordinarily prudent person in a like position would use under similar circumstances as permitted by the mgcl our charter limits the liability of our directors and officers to our company and our stockholders for money damages to the maximum extent permitted by maryland law under maryland law our present directors and officers will not have any liability to us or our stockholders for money damages other than liability resulting from 

 our charter provides that we have the power to obligate ourselves and our amended and restated bylaws obligate us to indemnify our directors and officers for actions taken by them in those capacities and to pay or reimburse their reasonable expenses in advance of final disposition of a proceeding to the maximum extent permitted by maryland law in addition we have entered into indemnification agreements with our directors and executive   officers that provide for indemnification and advance expenses to the maximum extent permitted by maryland law as a result we and our stockholders may have more limited rights against our directors and officers than might otherwise exist under common law 

our board of directors may change our major corporate policies without stockholder approval and those changes may materially and adversely affect us 

our board of directors will determine and may eliminate or otherwise change our major corporate policies including our acquisition investment financing growth operations and distribution policies while our stockholders have the power to elect or remove directors changes in our major corporate policies may be made by our board of directors without stockholder approval and those changes could adversely affect our business financial condition liquidity results of operations and prospects the market price of our common stock and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders and to satisfy our debt service requirements 

the ability of our board of directors to revoke or otherwise terminate our reit qualification with stockholder approval may cause adverse consequences to our stockholders 

our charter provides that our board of directors may revoke or otherwise terminate our reit election only with the affirmative vote of stockholders entitled to cast a majority of all votes entitled to be cast on the matter if the board determines that it is no longer in our best interests to continue to qualify as a reit if we cease to be a reit we would become subject to federal income tax on our taxable income and would no longer be required to distribute most of our taxable income to our stockholders which may have adverse consequences on the total return to our stockholders 

our charter and bylaws contain provisions that may delay defer or prevent an acquisition of our common stock or a change in control 

our charter and bylaws contain provisions the exercise or existence of which could delay defer or prevent a transaction or a change in control that might involve a premium price for our stockholders or otherwise be in their best interests including the following 

 in order for us to qualify as a reit no more than 50 of the value of outstanding shares of our stock may be owned beneficially or constructively by five or fewer individuals or certain other persons at any time during the last half of each taxable year “closely held” subject to certain exceptions our charter prohibits any stockholder from owning beneficially or constructively with respect to any class or series of our capital stock more than 98 in value or by number of shares whichever is more restrictive of the aggregate of the outstanding shares of such class or series of our capital stock 

the constructive ownership rules under the code are complex and may cause the outstanding stock owned by a group of related individuals or entities to be deemed to be constructively owned by one individual or entity as a result the acquisition of 98 or less of the outstanding shares of a class or series of our stock by an individual or entity could cause that individual or entity or another individual or entity to own constructively in excess of the relevant ownership limits 

among other restrictions on ownership and transfer of shares our charter also prohibits any person from owning shares of our stock that would result in our being “closely held” under section 856h of the code or otherwise cause us to fail to qualify as a reit any attempt to own or transfer shares of our common stock or of any of our other capital stock in violation of these restrictions may result in the shares being automatically transferred to a charitable trust or may be void 

our charter provides that our board may grant exceptions to the 98 ownership limit subject in each case to certain initial and ongoing conditions designed to protect our status as a reit these ownership limits may prevent a thirdparty from acquiring control of us if our board of directors does not grant an exemption from the ownership limits even if our stockholders believe the change in control is in their best interests an exemption from the 98 ownership limit was granted to certain stockholders and our board may in the future provide exceptions to the ownership limit for other stockholders subject to certain initial and ongoing conditions designed to protect our status as a reit 

 our charter authorizes us to issue authorized but unissued shares of common or preferred stock in addition to the shares of common stock issued and outstanding in addition our board of directors may without stockholder approval amend our charter to increase the aggregate number of our shares of stock or the number of shares of stock of any class or series that we have authority to issue and classify or reclassify any unissued shares of common or preferred stock and set the preferences rights and other terms of the classified or reclassified shares as a result our board of directors may establish a class or series of shares of common or preferred stock that could delay or prevent a transaction or a change in control that might involve a premium price for our shares of common stock or otherwise be in the best interests of our stockholders 

certain provisions of maryland law may limit the ability of a third party to acquire control of us 

certain provisions of the mgcl may have the effect of inhibiting a third party from acquiring us or of impeding a change of control under circumstances that otherwise could provide our common stockholders with the opportunity to realize a premium over the then prevailing market price of such shares including 



outstanding shares of our common stock or an affiliate of any interested stockholder and us for five years after the most recent date on which the stockholder becomes an interested stockholder and b thereafter impose two supermajority stockholder voting requirements on these combinations and 

 our charter provides that notwithstanding any other provision of our charter or our bylaws the maryland business combination act title 3 subtitle 6 of the mgcl does not apply to any business combination between us and any interested stockholder or any affiliate of any interested stockholder of ours and that we expressly elect not to be governed by the provisions of section 3602 of the mgcl in whole or in part any amendment to such provision of our charter must be approved by the affirmative vote of stockholders entitled to cast a majority of all votes entitled to be cast on the matter pursuant to the mgcl our bylaws contain a provision exempting from the maryland control share acquisition act any and all acquisitions by any person of shares of our stock this provision of our bylaws may not be altered amended or repealed except by our stockholders by the affirmative vote of at least twothirds of all the votes entitled to be cast on the matter there can be no assurance that this exemption contained in our bylaws will not be amended or eliminated at any time in the future 

additionally provisions of title 3 subtitle 8 of the mgcl permit a maryland corporation such as the company by action of its board of directors and without stockholder approval and regardless of what is provided in the charter or bylaws to elect to avail itself of certain takeover defenses such as a classified board unless the charter or a resolution adopted by the board of directors prohibits such election our charter provides that we are prohibited from making any such election unless first approved by our stockholders by the affirmative vote of a majority of all votes entitled to be cast on the matter 

conflicts of interest could arise between the interests of our stockholders and the interests of holders of operating partnership units which may impede business decisions that could benefit our stockholders 

conflicts of interest could arise as a result of the relationships between us on the one hand and our operating partnership or any limited partner thereof if any on the other our directors and officers have duties to us under applicable maryland law at the same time we as general partner of our operating partnership have fiduciary duties and obligations to our operating partnership and its limited partners under delaware law and the partnership agreement of our operating partnership in connection with the management of our operating partnership our duties as general partner to our operating partnership and its limited partners may come into conflict with the duties of our directors and officers to vici these conflicts may be resolved in a manner that is not in the best interests of our stockholders 

risks related to our common stock 

the market price and trading volume of shares of our common stock may be volatile 

the market price of our common stock may be volatile in addition the stock markets generally may experience significant volatility often unrelated to the operating performance of the individual companies whose securities are publicly traded the trading volume in our common stock may fluctuate and cause significant price variations to occur we cannot assure you that the market price of our common stock will not fluctuate or decline significantly in the future if the market price of our common stock declines you may be unable to sell your shares 

some of the factors many of which are beyond our control that could negatively affect the market price of our common stock or result in fluctuations in the price or trading volume of our common stock include 



 an increase in market interest rates could cause potential investors to seek higher returns and therefore reduce demand for our common stock and result in a decline in our share price 

one of the factors that may influence the market price of shares of our common stock is the yield of our shares ie the annualized distributions per share of our common stock as a percentage of the market price per share of our common stock relative to market interest rates an increase in market interest rates which are currently at low levels relative to historical rates may lead prospective purchasers of our common stock to expect a higher yield which may result in a decline in the market price of our common stock higher interest rates would likely increase our borrowing costs and potentially decrease our cash available for distribution thus higher market interest rates could also cause the market price of shares of our common stock to decline 

future incurrences of debt which would be senior to our shares of common stock upon liquidation andor issuance of preferred equity securities which may be senior to our shares of common stock for purposes of distributions or upon liquidation could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

in the future we may attempt to increase our capital resources by incurring additional debt including mediumterm notes trust preferred securities and senior or subordinated notes or issuing preferred shares if a liquidation event were to occur holders of our debt securities and preferred shares and lenders with respect to other borrowings will receive distributions of our available assets prior to the holders of our shares of common stock in addition our preferred stock if issued would likely limit our ability to make liquidating or other distributions to the holders of shares of our common stock under certain circumstances any future common stock offerings may dilute the holdings of our existing stockholders or reduce the market price of our common stock or both holders of shares of our common stock are not entitled to preemptive rights or other protections against dilution since our decision to issue debt securities incur other forms of indebtedness or to issue additional common stock or preferred stock in the future will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control we cannot predict or estimate the amount timing nature or success of our future offerings thus our stockholders bear the risk of our issuing senior securities incurring other senior obligations or issuing additional common stock in the future which may reduce the market price of shares of our common stock reduce cash available for distribution to common stockholders or dilute their stockholdings in us 

the number of shares available for future sale could adversely affect the market price of shares of our common stock 

we cannot predict whether future issuances of our shares or the availability of shares of our common stock for resale in the open market will decrease the market price per share of shares of our common stock sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market or the perception that such sales might occur could adversely affect the market price of shares of our common stock if any of our stockholders cause or there is a perception that they may cause a large number of their shares to be sold in the public market the sales could reduce the market price of shares of our common stock and could impede our ability to raise future capital 

our earnings and cash distributions could affect the market price of shares of our common stock 

our common stock may trade at prices that are higher or lower than the net asset value per share to the extent that we retain operating cash flow for investment purposes working capital reserves or other purposes rather than distributing the cash flows to stockholders these retained funds while increasing the value of our underlying assets may negatively impact the market price of shares of our common stock our failure to meet market expectations with regard to future earnings and cash distributions could adversely affect the market price of shares of our common stock

distribution policy 

we intend to make regular quarterly distributions to holders of shares of our common stock we cannot assure you that our estimated distributions will be made or sustained or that our board of directors will not change our distribution policy in the future any distributions will be at the sole discretion of our board of directors and their form timing and amount if any will depend upon a number of factors including our actual and projected results of operations ffo liquidity cash flows and financial condition the revenue we actually receive from our properties our operating expenses our debt service requirements our capital expenditures prohibitions and other limitations under our financing arrangements our reit taxable income the annual reit distribution requirements applicable law and such other factors as our board of directors deems relevant for more information regarding risk factors that could materially and adversely affect us and our ability to make cash distributions see item 1a “risk factors” if our operations do not generate sufficient cash flow to enable us to pay our intended or required distributions we may be required either to fund distributions from working capital borrow or raise equity or to reduce such distributions in addition our charter allows us to issue preferred stock that could have a preference on distributions and could limit our ability to make distributions to our common stockholders additionally under certain circumstances agreements relating to our indebtedness could limit our ability to make distributions to our common stockholders 

federal income tax law requires that a reit distribute annually at least 90 of its reit taxable income with certain adjustments determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding any net capital gains and that it pay tax at regular corporate rates to the extent that it annually distributes less than 100 of its reit taxable income determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and including any net capital gains in addition a reit will be required to pay a 4 nondeductible excise tax on the amount if any by which the distributions it makes in a calendar year are less than the sum of 85 of its ordinary income 95 of its capital gain net income and 100 of its undistributed income from prior years 

we intend to make distributions to our stockholders to comply with the reit requirements of the code and to avoid or otherwise minimize paying entity level federal or excise tax other than at any trs of ours we may generate taxable income greater than our income for financial reporting purposes prepared in accordance with gaap in particular during the first several years of the leases under the terms of the formation lease agreements rental income will be allocated for tax purposes generally in an amount greater than cash rents further we may generate reit taxable income greater than our cash flow from operations after operating expenses and debt service as a result of differences in timing between the recognition of reit taxable income and the actual receipt of cash or the effect of nondeductible capital expenditures the creation of reserves or required debt or amortization payments

summary of significant 2018 activities 



 key trends that may affect our business 

subsidiaries of caesars and penn national are the lessees of all of our properties pursuant to the lease agreements and caesars crc or penn national guarantees the obligations of the tenants under the lease agreements the lease agreements account for substantially all of our revenues additionally we expect to realize organic growth in rental revenue through annual rent escalators in our lease agreements accordingly we are dependent on caesars penn national the gaming industry and the health of the economies in the areas where our properties are located for the foreseeable future and an event that has a material adverse effect on caesars’ or penn nationals’ business financial condition liquidity results of operations or prospects would have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition liquidity results of operations and prospects see item 1a “risk factors—risks related to our business and operations” 

we actively seek to grow our portfolio through acquisitions of experiential real estate in geographically diverse dynamic markets spanning hospitality entertainment leisure and gaming properties additionally we expect to grow our portfolio through acquisitions by pursuing opportunities to execute sale leaseback transactions with caesars pursuant to i the call right agreements relating to three properties ii rights of first refusal relating to certain domestic gaming facilities proposed to be acquired or developed by caesars located outside the gaming enterprise district of clark county nevada and the properties that caesars acquired from centaur holdings llc in indiana and iii the putcall agreement which includes rights relating to the caesars forum convention center in las vegas finally we believe the approximately 34 acres after giving effect to the sale of approximately 184 acres to caesars in december 2017 of undeveloped or underdeveloped land on and adjacent to the las vegas strip that we own will provide attractive opportunities for potential future expansion and development in pursuing external growth initiatives we will generally seek to acquire properties that can generate stable rental revenue through longterm leases with tenants with established operating histories and we will consider various factors when evaluating acquisitions including the ability to continue to diversify our tenant base and increasing our geographic diversification 

our operating and financial performance in the future will be significantly influenced by the success of our acquisition strategy and the timing and the availability and terms of financing of any acquisitions that we may complete we can provide no assurance 

that we will exercise any of our contractual rights to purchase one or more properties from caesars or otherwise be successful in acquiring any properties additionally our ability to successfully implement our acquisition strategy will depend upon the availability and terms of financing including debt and equity capital further the pricing of any acquisitions we may consummate and the terms of any leases that we may enter into will significantly impact our future results competition to execute sale leaseback transactions with attractive properties and desirable tenants is intense and we can provide no assurance that any future acquisitions or leases will be on terms as favorable to us as those relating to recent transactions should we exercise an option to purchase a property under a call right agreement the purchase price will be equal to ten times the property’s annual rent which in turn will equal approximately 60 of the trailing property ebitdar at the time of exercise accordingly the purchase price and rent for any property we may acquire under a call right agreement and lease to caesars will depend upon the property’s trailing 12month ebitdar at the time of exercise we anticipate that we would seek to finance these acquisitions with a combination of debt and equity although no assurance can be given that we would be able to issue equity in such amounts on favorable terms or at all or that we would not determine to incur more debt on a relative basis at the relevant time due market conditions or otherwise in addition to rent our tenants are required to pay the following 1 all facility maintenance 2 all insurance required in connection with the leased properties and the business conducted on the leased properties 3 taxes levied on or with respect to the leased properties other than taxes on our income and 4 all utilities and other services necessary or appropriate for the leased properties and the business conducted on the leased properties accordingly due to the “triplenet” structure of our leases we do not expect to incur significant propertylevel expenses

reconciliation of nongaap measures 

we present funds from operations “ffo” ffo per share adjusted funds from operations “affo” affo per share and adjusted ebitda which are not required by or presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states “gaap” these are nongaap financial measures and should not be construed as alternatives to net income or as an indicator of operating performance as determined in accordance with gaap we believe ffo ffo per share affo affo per share and adjusted ebitda provide a meaningful perspective of the underlying operating performance of our business 

ffo is a nongaap financial measure that is considered a supplemental measure for the real estate industry and a supplement to gaap measures consistent with the definition used by the national association of real estate investment trusts “nareit” we define ffo as net income or loss computed in accordance with gaap excluding gains or losses from sales of property plus real estate depreciation 

affo is a nongaap financial measure that we use as a supplemental operating measure to evaluate our performance we calculate affo by adding or subtracting from ffo direct financing lease adjustments transaction costs incurred in connection with the acquisition of real estate investments noncash stockbased compensation expense amortization of debt issuance costs and original issue discount other noncash interest expense nonreal estate depreciation which is comprised of the depreciation related to our golf course operations capital expenditures which are comprised of additions to property plant and equipment related to our golf course operations impairment charges and gains or losses on debt extinguishment 

we calculate adjusted ebitda by adding or subtracting from affo interest expense net and income tax expense 

these nongaap financial measures i do not represent cash flow from operations as defined by gaap ii should not be considered as an alternative to net income as a measure of operating performance or to cash flows from operating investing and financing activities and iii are not alternatives to cash flow as a measure of liquidity in addition these measures should not be viewed as measures of liquidity nor do they measure our ability to fund all of our cash needs including our ability to make cash distributions to our stockholders to fund capital improvements or to make interest payments on our indebtedness investors are also cautioned that ffo ffo per share affo affo per share and adjusted ebitda as presented may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other real estate companies including reits due to the fact that not all real estate companies use the same definitions our presentation of these measures does not replace the presentation of our financial results in accordance with gaap

liquidity and capital resources 

overview 

as of december 31 2018  our available cash balance was 5779 million  our restricted cash balance was 206 million  our shortterm investment balance was 5209 million  and 4000 million was available for future borrowings under our revolving credit facility 

our shortterm obligations consist primarily of regular interest payments on our debt obligations dividends to our common stockholders normal recurring operating expenses recurring expenditures for corporate and administrative needs certain lease and other contractual commitments related to our golf operations and certain nonrecurring expenditures for a list of our contractual commitments refer to note 12  commitments and contingent liabilities in the notes to our financial statements 

our longterm obligations consist primarily of principal payments on our outstanding debt obligations we currently have 41 billion of debt obligations outstanding none of which are maturing in the next twelve months for a summary of principal debt balances and their maturity dates and principal terms refer to note 9  debt in the notes to our consolidated financial statements we anticipate closing the acquisition of greektown in mid2019 and we expect to fund the purchase with approximately 3500 million of cash on hand which represents a portion of the proceeds that we raised in our november 2018 equity offering and 3500 million of debt either through additional longterm debt financing or under our revolving credit facility we anticipate funding future transactions with a mix of debt equity and available cash 

we believe that we have sufficient liquidity to meet our liquidity and capital resource requirements primarily through currently available cash and cash equivalents restricted cash short term investments cash received under our lease agreements borrowings from banks including undrawn capacity under our revolving credit facility and proceeds from the issuance of debt and equity securities all of the lease agreements call for an initial term of fifteen years with four fiveyear renewal options except for harrah’s philadelphia and are designed to provide us with a reliable and predictable revenue stream however our cash flows from operations and our ability to access capital resources could be adversely affected due to uncertain economic factors and volatility in the financial and credit markets in particular we can provide no assurances that our tenants will not default on their leases or fail to make full rental payments if their businesses become challenged due to among other things adverse economic conditions 

our ability to raise funds through the issuance of debt and equity securities and access to other thirdparty sources of capital in the future will be dependent on among other things general economic conditions general market conditions for reits market perceptions and the trading price of our stock we will continue to analyze which sources of capital are most advantageous to us at any particular point in time but the capital markets may not be consistently available on terms we deem attractive or at all

capital expenditures 

as described in our leases capital expenditures for properties under the lease agreements are the responsibility of the tenants minimum capital expenditure spending requirements of the tenants are described in “overview of our lease agreements” of item 1  business 

inflation 

our leases provide for certain increases in rent as a result of a fixed annual rent escalator or changes in the consumer price index as further described in “overview of our lease agreements” of item 1  business inflation may cause the rent provisions to result in rent increases over time however we could be negatively affected if increases in rent are not sufficient to cover increases in our operating expenses due to inflation in addition inflation and increased cost may have an adverse impact on our tenants if increases in their operating expenses exceed increases in revenue due to inflation 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

as of december 31 2018 and as of the date this report was filed we do not have any offbalance sheet arrangements 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap we have identified certain accounting policies that we believe are the most critical to the presentation of our financial information over a period of time these accounting policies may require our management to take decisions on subjective andor complex matters relating to reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue costs expenses and related disclosures including but not limited to the application of fresh start reporting determining the useful lives of real estate properties and evaluating the impairment of longlived assets and allocation of costs and deferred income taxes the judgment on such estimates and underlying assumptions is based on our historical experience that we believe is reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ from the estimates 

investments in direct financing and operating leases 

upon lease inception we assess lease classification under asc 840 “leases” “asc 840” to determine if the lease should be classified as capital or operating if a lease is determined to be a capital lease we further assess if it is a direct financing or salestype lease as defined in asc 840 for leases determined to be direct financing capital leases upon execution of the lease transaction the asset is classified to investments in direct financing leases net for direct financing leases where the land represents greater than 25 of the fair value of the underlying asset the land and building components of the lease are bifurcated and separately assessed for classification 

we have determined that all of our leases meet the definition of direct financing leases under asc 840 with the exception of the land component of our investment in caesars palace las vegas and certain parcels of land contained in the noncplv lease agreement we recognize the related income from our direct financing leases on an effective interest basis at a constant rate of return over the terms of the applicable leases as a result the cash payments accounted for under direct financing leases will not equal income from direct financing leases rather a portion of the cash rent we receive is recorded as income from direct financing leases in our statement of operations and a portion is recorded as a change to the investments in direct financing leases net 

initial direct costs incurred in connection with direct financing lease transactions are included in the balance of investments in direct financing leases net such amounts will be recognized as a reduction to income from direct financing leases over the life of the lease using the effective interest method 

under the operating lease model as the lessor at lease inception the land is recorded as investments in operating leases in our balance sheet and we record income from operating leases on a straightline basis over the lease term the amount of annual minimum lease payments attributable to the land element after deducting executory costs including any profit thereon is determined by applying the lessee’s incremental borrowing rate to the value of the land we record this lease income as income from operating leases in our statement of operations 

contractual obligations and commitments 

information concerning our obligations and commitments to make future payments under contracts such as our indebtedness and future minimum lease commitments under operating leases is included in the following table as of december 31 2018  



 

1 the term loan b facility is subject to amortization of 10 of principal per annum payable in equal quarterly installments on the last business day of each calendar quarter however as a result of prepaying 1000 million in february 2018 the next principal payment due on the term loan b facility is september 2022 the term loan b facility will mature on december 22 2024 or the date that is three months prior to the maturity of the second lien notes whichever is earlier or if the maturity is extended pursuant to the terms of the agreement such extended maturity date as determined pursuant thereto

3 the second lien notes will mature on october 15 2023

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend

our future income cash flows and fair values relevant to financial instruments are dependent upon prevailing market interest rates in the normal course of business we are exposed to the effect of interest rate changes we have entered into derivative agreements to mitigate exposure to unexpected changes in interest market risk refers to the risk of loss from adverse changes in market interest rates we periodically use derivative financial instruments to seek to manage or hedge interest rate risks related to our borrowings we do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes and only enter into contracts with major financial institutions based on their credit rating and other factors we intend to enter into derivative agreements only with counterparties that we believe have a strong credit rating to mitigate the risk of counterparty default or insolvency 

as of december 31 2018 we had 41485 million of debt outstanding of which 20485 million was fixed rate debt and 15000 million was hedged variable rate debt the remaining 6000 million of our indebtedness was unhedged subsequent to december 31 2018 we entered into two interest swap transactions which are effective january 22 2019 for a notional amount of 500 million effectively bringing our unhedged variable rate debt to 1000 million as of december 31 2018 a one percent increase or decrease in the annual interest rate on our unhedged variable rate borrowings of 6000 million would increase or decrease our annual cash interest expense by approximately 60 million subsequent to january 22 2019 a one percent increase or decrease 

in the annual interest rate on our unhedged variable rate borrowings of 1000 million would increase or decrease our annual cash interest expense by approximately 10 million 

we may manage or hedge interest rate risks related to our borrowings by means of interest rate swap agreements we also expect to manage our exposure to interest rate risk by maintaining a mix of fixed and variable rates for our indebtedness however the reit provisions of the code substantially limit our ability to hedge our assets and liabilities

business 

tableend overview of the company 

we are an owner and acquirer of experiential real estate assets across leading gaming hospitality entertainment and leisure destinations our national geographically diverse portfolio consists of 20 marketleading properties including caesars palace las vegas and harrah’s las vegas two of the most iconic entertainment facilities on the las vegas strip our entertainment facilities are leased to leading brands that seek to drive consumer loyalty and value with guests through superior services experiences products and continuous innovation across more than 36 million square feet our wellmaintained properties are located in nine states contain nearly 14500 hotel rooms and feature over 150 restaurants bars and nightclubs our portfolio also includes approximately 34 acres of undeveloped land adjacent to the las vegas strip that is leased to caesars which we may look to monetize as appropriate we also own and operate four championship golf courses located near certain of our properties two of which are in close proximity to the las vegas strip as a growth focused public real estate company we expect our relationship with our partners will position us for the acquisition of additional properties across leisure and hospitality 

in december 2017 we acquired from an affiliate of caesars and then leased back the real estate assets of harrah’s las vegas for approximately 114 billion and we simultaneously sold to caesars approximately 184 acres of undeveloped land located behind the linq hotel  casino and harrah’s las vegas for 736 million the “eastside property” simultaneous with this transaction vici propco entered into a new credit facility the “vici propco credit facility” comprised of a 22 billion senior secured term loan b facility the “term loan b facility” and a 4000 million senior secured revolving credit facility the “revolving credit facility” and we used the proceeds from the term loan b facility and drawings under the revolving credit facility to refinance a portion of our outstanding longterm debt 

our portfolio is competitively positioned and wellmaintained pursuant to the terms of the lease agreements which require caesars to invest in our properties and in line with its commitment to build guest loyalty we anticipate caesars will continue to make strategic valueenhancing investments in our properties over time helping to maintain their competitive position in addition 

given our scale and deep industry knowledge we believe we are wellpositioned to execute highly complementary singleasset and portfolio acquisitions to augment growth 

we intend to elect and qualify to be taxed as a reit for us federal income tax purposes commencing with our taxable year ended december 31 2017 we believe our election of reit status combined with the income generation from the lease agreements will enhance our ability to make distributions to our stockholders providing investors with current income as well as longterm growth

our portfolio features caesars palace las vegas and harrah’s las vegas and marketleading regional properties with significant scale our properties are wellmaintained and leased to leading brands such as caesars horseshoe harrah’s and bally’s these brands seek to drive loyalty and value with guests through superior service and products and continuous innovation our portfolio benefits from its strong mix of demand generators including casinos guest rooms restaurants entertainment facilities bars and nightclubs and convention space we believe our properties are wellinsulated from incremental competition as a result of high replacement costs as well as regulatory restrictions and longlead times for new development the high quality of our properties appeals to a broad base of customers stimulating traffic and visitation 

our portfolio is anchored by our las vegas properties caesars palace las vegas and harrah’s las vegas which are located at the center of the strip we believe las vegas is one of the most attractive travel destinations in the united states with a record 429 million visitors in 2016 according to the las vegas convention and visitors authority we believe las vegas is a market characterized by steady economic growth and high consumer and business demand with limited new supply our las vegas properties which are two of the most iconic entertainment facilities in las vegas feature gaming entertainment largescale hotels extensive food and beverage options stateoftheart convention facilities retail outlets and entertainment showrooms our las vegas properties continue to benefit from positive macroeconomic trends including according to caesars’ publicly available information record visitation levels in 2016 and strong convention attendance hotel occupancy and average daily rates among other key indicators 

our portfolio also includes marketleading regional resorts that we believe are benefiting from significant invested capital over recent years the regional properties we own include awardwinning landbased and dockside casinos hotels and entertainment facilities that are market leaders within their respective regions the properties operate primarily under the caesars harrah’s horseshoe and bally’s trademark and brand names which in many instances have marketleading brand recognition 

under the terms of the lease agreements the tenants are required to continue to invest in the properties which we believe will enhance the value of our properties 

our properties feature diversified sources of revenue on both a business and geographic basis 

our portfolio includes 20 geographically diverse casino resorts that serve numerous metropolitan statistical areas “msas” nationally this diversity reduces our exposure to adverse events that may affect any single market this also allows our tenants to derive revenue from an economically diverse set of customers who work in a variety of industries additionally although the lease agreements are with subsidiaries of caesars caesars generates revenue from a diverse set of services that it offers its customers these include gaming food and beverage entertainment hospitality and other sources of revenue we believe that this 

geographic diversity and the diversity of revenue sources that our tenants derive from our leased properties improves the stability of rental revenue 

our longterm lease agreements provide a highly predictable base level of rent with embedded growth potential 

our properties are 100 occupied pursuant to our longterm triplenet lease agreements with subsidiaries of caesars providing us with a predictable level of rental revenue to support future cash distributions to our stockholders in october 2017 we entered into the formation lease agreements and in december 2017 we entered into the hlv lease agreement 

caesars is generally not permitted to remove individual properties from the noncplv lease agreement and has the right following certain casualty events or condemnations to terminate the respective lease agreement with respect to affected properties all of our casino resort properties are established assets with extensive operating histories based on historical performance of the properties we expect that the properties will generate sufficient revenues for caesars’ subsidiaries to pay to us all rent due under the lease agreements 

we believe our relationship with caesars including our contractual agreements with it and its applicable subsidiaries will continue to drive significant benefits and mutual alignment of strategic interests in the future

competition 

we compete for real property investments with other reits gaming companies investment companies private equity and hedge fund investors sovereign funds lenders and other investors in addition revenues from our properties are dependent on the ability of our tenants currently subsidiaries of caesars and operators to compete with other gaming operators the operators of our properties compete on a local and regional basis for customers the gaming industry is characterized by a high degree of competition among a large number of participants including riverboat casinos dockside casinos landbased casinos video lottery sweepstakes and poker machines not located in casinos native american gaming emerging varieties of internet gaming and other forms of gaming in the united states 

as a landlord we compete in the real estate market with numerous developers and owners of properties some of our competitors are significantly larger have greater financial resources and lower costs of capital than we have have greater economies of scale and have greater name recognition than we do increased competition will make it more challenging to identify and successfully capitalize on acquisition opportunities that meet our investment objectives our ability to compete is also impacted by national and local economic trends availability of investment alternatives availability and cost of capital construction and renovation costs existing laws and regulations new legislation and population trends

risks related to our business and operations 

we are dependent on caesars for the foreseeable future and an event that has a material adverse effect on caesars’ business financial condition liquidity results of operations or prospects would have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition liquidity results of operations and prospects 

subsidiaries of caesars are the lessees of all of our properties pursuant to the lease agreements and caesars or crc guarantees the obligations of the applicable tenants under the lease agreements the lease agreements account for a significant majority of all of our revenues additionally because the lease agreements are triplenet leases we depend on the tenants to pay all insurance taxes utilities and maintenance and repair expenses in connection with these leased properties and to indemnify defend and hold us harmless from and against various claims litigation and liabilities arising in connection with our businesses see “business” there can be no assurance that the tenants will have sufficient assets income and access to financing to enable them to satisfy their payment obligations on account of the lease agreements or that caesars or its crc will be able to satisfy its guarantee of the applicable tenant’s obligations under the lease agreements the tenants and the applicable guarantor rely on the properties they or their subsidiaries own andor operate for income to satisfy their obligations including their debt service requirements and lease payments due to us under the lease agreements and the guarantees if income from these properties were to decline for any reason if any tenant’s or the applicable guarantor or their subsidiaries’ debt service requirements were to increase whether due to an increase in interest rates or otherwise or if caesars’ subsidiaries were prevented from making distributions to caesars or crc whether due to restrictions in their financing arrangements or otherwise a tenant may become unable or unwilling to satisfy its payment obligations under the lease agreements and the applicable guarantor may become unable or unwilling to make payments under its guarantee of the lease agreements 

the inability or unwillingness of a tenant or the applicable guarantor to meet their rent and other obligations to us under the lease agreements and the related guarantee would materially and adversely affect our business financial condition liquidity results of operations and prospects including our ability to make distributions to our stockholders as required to maintain our status as a reit for these reasons if any tenant andor the applicable guarantor were to experience a material adverse effect on its business financial condition liquidity results of operations or prospects we would also be materially and adversely affected 

in addition due to our dependence on rental payments from caesars as a primary source of revenues we may be limited in our ability to enforce our rights under the lease agreements or to terminate the applicable lease with respect to a particular property failure by the tenants to comply with the terms of the lease agreements or to comply with the gaming regulations to which the leased properties are subject could require us to find another lessee for such leased property to the extent possible and there could be a decrease or cessation of rental payments by the tenants in such event we may be unable to locate a suitable creditworthy lessee at similar rental rates or at all which could have a material and adverse effect on us 

because a concentrated portion of our revenues are generated from the strip we are subject to greater risks than a company that is more geographically diversified 

our properties on the las vegas strip generated approximately 278 of our lease revenue for the period from october 6 2017 to december 31 2017 therefore our business may be significantly affected by risks common to the las vegas tourism industry for example the cost and availability of air services and the impact of any events that disrupt air travel to and from las vegas can adversely affect the business of our tenants we cannot control the number or frequency of flights to or from las vegas but the tenants rely on air traffic for a significant portion of their visitors reductions in flights by major airlines as a result of higher fuel prices or lower demand can impact the number of visitors to our properties additionally there is one principal interstate highway between las vegas and southern california where a large number of the customers that frequent our properties reside capacity constraints of that highway or any other traffic disruptions may also affect the number of customers who visit our facilities moreover due to the importance of our two properties on the strip we may be disproportionately affected by general risks such 

as acts of terrorism natural disasters including major fires floods and earthquakes and severe or inclement weather should such developments occur in or nearby las vegas 

caesars and its subsidiaries are party to certain leasing and financial commitments with us which may have a negative impact on caesars’ business and operating condition 

caesars andor its subsidiaries entered into certain leasing and financial commitments evidenced by agreements with us see “business—our relationship with caesars” for additional information regarding such agreements 

caesars is obligated to pay us in the aggregate approximately 7353 million in fixed annual rents and golf course membership fees for each of the first seven years subject to certain escalators and adjustments if caesars’ businesses and properties fail to generate sufficient earnings the applicable tenants caesars andor crc may be unable to satisfy their respective obligations under the lease agreements or the related guarantees respectively additionally these obligations may limit their ability to make investments to maintain and grow their portfolio of businesses and properties which may adversely affect their competitiveness and ability to satisfy their obligations to us see “—we are dependent on caesars for the foreseeable future and an event that has a material adverse effect on caesars’ business financial condition liquidity results of operations or prospects would have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition liquidity results of operations and prospects” above 

subsidiaries of caesars are required to pay a significant portion of their cash flow from operations to us pursuant to and subject to the terms and conditions of the lease agreements which could adversely affect caesars’ ability to fund their operations or development projects raise capital make acquisitions and otherwise respond to competitive and economic changes and its ability to satisfy its payment obligations to us under the lease agreements and the related guarantees 

subsidiaries of caesars are required to pay a significant portion of their cash flow from operations to us pursuant to and subject to the terms and conditions of the lease agreements see “business—our relationship with caesars” as a result of this commitment caesars’ ability to fund its operations or development projects raise capital make acquisitions and otherwise respond to competitive and economic changes may be adversely affected which could adversely affect the ability of the applicable tenants to satisfy their obligations to us under the lease agreements and the ability of caesars andor crc to satisfy their respective obligations to us under the related guarantees 

in addition the annual rent escalations under the lease agreements will continue to apply regardless of the amount of cash flows generated by the properties that are subject to the lease agreements accordingly if the cash flows generated by such properties decrease or do not increase at the same rate as the rent escalations the rents payable under the lease agreements will comprise a higher percentage of the cash flows generated by the subsidiaries of caesars which could make it more difficult for the applicable subsidiaries to make their payment obligations to us under the lease agreements and ultimately could adversely affect caesars’ andor crc’s ability to satisfy their respective obligations to us under the related guarantees 

caesars’ substantial indebtedness and the fact that a significant portion of its cash flow is used to make interest payments could adversely affect its ability to satisfy its obligations under the lease agreements 

as disclosed in its annual report on form 10k for the year ended december 31 2017 caesars’ consolidated estimated debt service including principal and interest for 2018 will be 504 million and 118 billion thereafter to maturity on october 16 2017 two whollyowned subsidiaries of caesars issued 17 billion aggregate principal amount of 525 senior notes due 2025 on or about december 22 2017 the proceeds of the senior notes were released from escrow and crc assumed the obligations of one of the original issuer entities pursuant to a supplement to the original indenture governing the senior notes on december 22 2017 crc entered into new 57 billion senior secured credit facilities comprised of a 1 billion revolving credit facility maturing in 2022 and a 47 billion first lien term loan facility maturing in 2024 which amortizes at 025 per quarter as a result a significant portion of caesars’ liquidity needs are for debt service including significant interest payments such substantial indebtedness and the restrictive covenants under the agreements governing such indebtedness could limit the ability of the applicable tenants to satisfy their obligations to us under the lease agreements and the ability of caesars’ andor crc to satisfy their respective obligations under the related guarantees 

we are dependent on the gaming industry and may be susceptible to the risks associated with it which could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition liquidity results of operations and prospects 

as the landlord of gaming facilities we are impacted by the risks associated with the gaming industry therefore so long as our investments are concentrated in gamingrelated assets our success is dependent on the gaming industry which could be adversely affected by economic conditions in general changes in consumer trends and preferences and other factors over which we and our tenants have no control as we are subject to risks inherent in substantial investments in a single industry a decrease in the gaming business would likely have a greater adverse effect on us than if we owned a more diversified real estate portfolio particularly 

because a component of the rent under the lease agreements will be based over time on the performance of the gaming facilities operated by caesars on our properties and such effect could be material and adverse to our business financial condition liquidity results of operations and prospects 

the gaming industry is characterized by a high degree of competition among a large number of participants including riverboat casinos dockside casinos landbased casinos video lottery sweepstakes and poker machines not located in casinos native american gaming internet lotteries and other internet wagering gaming services and in a broader sense gaming operators face competition from all manner of leisure and entertainment activities gaming competition is intense in most of the markets where our facilities are located recently there has been additional significant competition in the gaming industry as a result of the upgrading or expansion of facilities by existing market participants the entrance of new gaming participants into a market or legislative changes as competing properties and new markets are opened we may be negatively impacted additionally decreases in discretionary consumer spending brought about by weakened general economic conditions such as but not limited to lackluster recoveries from recessions high unemployment levels higher income taxes low levels of consumer confidence weakness in the housing market cultural and demographic changes and increased stock market volatility may negatively impact our revenues and operating cash flows 

we face extensive regulation from gaming and other regulatory authorities and our charter provides that any of our shares held by investors who are found to be unsuitable by state gaming regulatory authorities are subject to redemption 

the ownership operation and management of gaming and racing facilities are subject to pervasive regulation these gaming and racing regulations impact our gaming and racing tenants and persons associated with our gaming and racing facilities which in many jurisdictions include us as the landlord and owner of the real estate certain gaming authorities in the jurisdictions in which we hold properties may require us andor our affiliates to maintain a license as a key business entity or supplier because of our status as landlord gaming authorities also retain great discretion to require us to be found suitable as a landlord and certain of our stockholders officers and directors may be required to be found suitable as well 

in many jurisdictions gaming laws can require certain of our stockholders to file an application be investigated and qualify or have his her or its suitability determined by gaming authorities gaming authorities have very broad discretion in determining whether an applicant should be deemed suitable subject to certain administrative proceeding requirements the gaming regulators have the authority to deny any application or limit condition restrict revoke or suspend any license registration finding of suitability or approval or fine any person licensed registered or found suitable or approved for any cause deemed reasonable by the gaming authorities 

gaming authorities may conduct investigations into the conduct or associations of our directors officers key employees or investors to ensure compliance with applicable standards if we are required to be found suitable and are found suitable as a landlord we will be registered as a public company with the gaming authorities and will be subject to disciplinary action if after we receive notice that a person is unsuitable to be a stockholder or to have any other relationship with us we 

 many jurisdictions also require any person who acquires beneficial ownership of more than a certain percentage of voting securities of a gaming company and in some jurisdictions nonvoting securities typically 5 of a publiclytraded company to report the acquisition to gaming authorities and gaming authorities may require such holders to apply for qualification licensure or a finding of suitability subject to limited exceptions for “institutional investors” that hold a company’s voting securities for passive investment purposes only our outstanding shares of capital stock are held subject to applicable gaming laws any person owning or controlling at least 5 of the outstanding shares of any class of our capital stock is required to promptly notify us of such person’s identity some jurisdictions may also limit the number of gaming licenses in which a person may hold an ownership or a controlling interest 

further our directors officers key employees and investors in our shares must meet approval standards of certain gaming regulatory authorities if such gaming regulatory authorities were to find such a person or investor unsuitable we may be required to sever our relationship with that person or the investor may be required to dispose of his her or its interest in us our charter provides that all of our shares held by investors who are found to be unsuitable by regulatory authorities are subject to redemption upon our receipt of notice of such finding 

additionally the loss of our gaming licenses could result in an event of default under our certain of our indebtedness and crossdefault provisions in our debt agreements could cause an event of default under one debt agreement to trigger an event of default under our other debt agreements 

 finally substantially all material loans significant acquisitions leases sales of securities and similar financing transactions by us and our subsidiaries must be reported to and in some cases approved by gaming authorities in advance of the transaction neither we nor any of our subsidiaries may make a public offering of securities without the prior approval of certain gaming authorities changes in control through merger consolidation stock or asset acquisitions management or consulting agreements or otherwise may be subject to receipt of prior approval of certain gaming authorities entities seeking to acquire control of us or one of our subsidiaries and certain of our affiliates must satisfy gaming authorities with respect to a variety of stringent standards prior to assuming control failure to satisfy the stringent licensing standards may preclude entities from acquiring control of us or one of our subsidiaries and certain of our affiliates andor require the entities to divest such control 

required regulatory approvals can delay or prohibit transfers of our gaming properties which could result in periods in which we are unable to receive rent for such properties and have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition liquidity results of operations and prospects 

our tenants are and any future tenants of our gaming properties will be required to be licensed under applicable law in order to operate any of our properties as gaming facilities if the lease agreements or any future lease agreements we will enter into are terminated which could be required by a regulatory agency or expire any new tenant must be licensed and receive other regulatory approvals to operate our properties as gaming facilities any delay in or inability of the new tenant to receive required licenses and other regulatory approvals from the applicable state and county government agencies may prolong the period during which we are unable to collect the applicable rent further in the event that the lease agreements or future lease agreements are terminated or expire and a new tenant is not licensed or fails to receive other regulatory approvals the properties may not be operated as gaming facilities and we will not be able to collect the applicable rent moreover we may be unable to transfer or sell the affected properties as gaming facilities which could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition liquidity results of operations and prospects 

tenants may choose not to renew the lease agreements 

the lease agreements each have an initial lease term of 15   years with the potential to extend the term for up to four additional fiveyear terms thereafter provided that for certain facilities the aggregate lease term including renewals is cutback to the extent it would otherwise exceed 80 of the remaining useful life of the applicable leased property solely at the option of the tenants at the expiration of the initial lease term or of any additional renewal term thereafter a tenant may choose not to renew the lease agreements if the lease agreements expire without renewal and we are not able to find suitable creditworthy tenants to replace a tenant on the same or more attractive terms our business financial condition liquidity results of operations and prospects may be materially and adversely affected including our ability to make distributions to our stockholders at the then current level or at all this risk would be exacerbated if caesars determined not to renew or was prohibited from renewing due to the remaining useful life of the leased property all lease agreements at any one time 

net leases may not result in fair market lease rates over time which could negatively impact our results of operations and cash flows and reduce the amount of funds available to make distributions to stockholders 

all of our rental revenue is generated from the lease agreements which are triplenet leases and provide greater flexibility to the respective tenants related to the use of the applicable leased property than would be the case with ordinary property leases such as the right to freely sublease portions of each leased property to make alterations in the leased premises and to terminate the lease prior to its expiration under specified circumstances furthermore net leases typically have longer lease terms and thus there is an increased risk that contractual rental increases in future years will fail to result in fair market rental rates during those years as a result our results of operations and cash flows and distributions to our stockholders could be lower than they would otherwise be if we did not enter into a net lease 

the lease agreements may restrict our ability to sell the properties 

our ability to sell or dispose of our properties may be hindered by the fact that such properties are subject to the lease agreements as the terms of the lease agreements require that a purchaser assume the lease agreements or enter into a severance lease with the tenants for the sold property on substantially the same terms as contained in the applicable lease agreement which may make our properties less attractive to a potential buyer than alternative properties that may be for sale 

properties within our portfolio are and properties that we may acquire in the future are likely to be operated and promoted under certain trademarks and brand names that we do not own 

most of the properties within our portfolio are currently operated and promoted under trademarks and brand names not owned by us including caesars palace horseshoe harrah’s and bally’s in addition properties that we may acquire in the future may be operated and promoted under these same trademarks and brand names or under different trademarks and brand names we do not or will not own during the term that our properties are managed by caesars we will be reliant on caesars to maintain and protect the trademarks brand names and other licensed intellectual property used in the operation or promotion of the leased properties operation of the leased properties as well as our business and financial condition could be adversely impacted by infringement invalidation unauthorized use or litigation affecting any such intellectual property moreover if any of our properties are rebranded unsuccessfully it could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition liquidity results of operations and prospects as we may not enjoy comparable recognition or status under a new brand a transition of management away from a caesars entity could also have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition liquidity results of operations and prospects 

a substantial portion of our cash is used to satisfy our debt service obligations and our distribution obligations to maintain our status as a reit and avoid or otherwise minimize current entity level us federal income taxes which may expose us to interest rate fluctuation risk expose us to the risk of default under our debt obligations and limit our ability to pursue our business and growth strategies 

we have substantial debt service obligations as of december 31 2017 we had approximately 4817 billion of outstanding indebtedness under our term b loan facility revolving credit facility cplv cmbs debt and second lien notes requiring us to make annual debt service payments of approximately 2493 million in 2018 

our indebtedness is collateralized by substantially all of our properties payments of principal and interest under this indebtedness or any other instruments governing debt we may incur in the future may leave us with insufficient cash resources to pursue our business and growth strategies or to pay the distributions currently contemplated or necessary to qualify or maintain qualification as a reit our substantial outstanding indebtedness or future indebtedness and the limitations imposed on us by our debt agreements could have other significant adverse consequences including the following 

 if any one of these events were to occur our financial condition results of operations cash flows the market price of our common stock and our ability to satisfy our debt service obligations and to pay distributions to our stockholders could be materially and adversely affected in addition the foreclosure on our properties could create taxable income without accompanying cash proceeds which could result in entity level taxes to us or could adversely affect our ability to meet the distribution requirements necessary to qualify or maintain qualification as a reit 

in addition the code generally requires that a reit distribute annually to its stockholders at least 90 of its reit taxable income with certain adjustments determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gains and that it pay tax at regular corporate rates to the extent that it distributes annually less than 100 of its reit taxable income including capital gains vici golf is also subject to us federal income tax at regular corporate rates on any of its taxable income in order to maintain our status as a reit and avoid or otherwise minimize current entitylevel us federal income taxes a substantial portion of our cash flow after operating expenses and debt service will be required to be distributed to our stockholders 

because of the limitations on the amount of cash available to us after satisfying our debt service obligations and our distribution obligations to maintain our status as a reit and avoid or otherwise minimize current entity level us federal income taxes our ability to pursue our business and growth strategies will be limited 

any mechanic’s liens or similar liens incurred by the tenants under the lease agreements may attach to and constitute liens on our interests in the properties 

to the extent the tenants under the lease agreements make any improvements these improvements could cause mechanic’s liens or similar liens to attach to and constitute liens on our interests in the properties to the extent that mechanic’s liens or similar liens are recorded against any of the properties or any properties we may acquire in the future the holders of such mechanic’s liens or similar liens may enforce them by court action and courts may cause the applicable properties or future properties to be sold to satisfy such liens which could negatively impact our revenues results of operations cash flows and distributions to our stockholders further holders of such liens could have priority over our stockholders in the event of bankruptcy or liquidation and as a result a trustee in bankruptcy may have difficulty realizing or foreclosing on such properties in any such bankruptcy or liquidation and the amount of distributions our stockholders could receive in such bankruptcy or liquidation could be reduced 

adverse changes in our credit rating may affect our borrowing capacity and borrowing terms 

our outstanding debt is periodically rated by nationally recognized credit rating agencies the credit ratings are based upon our operating performance liquidity and leverage ratios overall financial condition and other factors viewed by the credit rating agencies as relevant to both our industry and the economic outlook our credit rating may affect the amount of capital we can access as well as the terms of any financing we obtain because we rely in part on debt financing to fund growth the absence of an investment grade credit rating or any credit rating downgrade or negative outlook may have a negative effect on our future growth 

we will have future capital needs and may not be able to obtain additional financing on acceptable terms 

we may incur additional indebtedness in the future to refinance our existing indebtedness or to finance newly acquired properties or for general corporate or other purposes any significant additional indebtedness could require a substantial portion of our cash flow to make interest and principal payments due on our indebtedness greater demands on our cash resources may reduce funds available to us to pay distributions make capital expenditures and acquisitions or carry out other aspects of our business and growth strategies increased indebtedness can also limit our ability to adjust rapidly to changing market conditions make us more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions and create competitive disadvantages for us compared to other companies with relatively lower debt levels increased future debt service obligations may limit our operational and financial flexibility further to the extent we were required to incur indebtedness our future interest costs would increase thereby reducing our earnings and cash flows from what they otherwise would have been 

moreover our ability to obtain additional financing and satisfy our financial obligations under indebtedness outstanding from time to time will depend upon our future operating performance which is subject to then prevailing general economic and credit market conditions including interest rate levels and the availability of credit generally and financial business and other factors many of which are beyond our control the prolonged continuation or worsening of current credit market conditions would have a material adverse effect on our ability to obtain financing on favorable terms if at all 

we may be unable to obtain additional financing or financing on favorable terms or our operating cash flow may be insufficient to satisfy our financial obligations under indebtedness outstanding from time to time if any among other things the absence of an investment grade credit rating or any credit rating downgrade or negative outlook could increase our financing costs and could limit our access to financing sources if financing is not available when needed or is available on unfavorable terms we may be unable to pursue our business and growth strategies or otherwise take advantage of new business opportunities or respond to competitive pressures any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition liquidity results of operations and prospects we may raise additional funds in the future through the issuance of equity securities and as a result our stockholders may experience significant dilution which may adversely affect the market price of our common stock and make it more difficult for our stockholders to sell our shares at a time and price that they deem appropriate and could impair our future ability to raise capital through an offering of our equity securities 

our ability to refinance our indebtedness as it becomes due depends on many factors some of which are beyond our control 

our ability to refinance our existing indebtedness and any future indebtedness will depend in part on our current and projected financial condition liquidity and results of operations and economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors many of these factors are beyond our control we cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance any of our indebtedness as it becomes due on commercially reasonable terms or at all if we are not able to refinance our indebtedness as it becomes due 

we will be obligated to pay such indebtedness with cash from our operations and we may not have sufficient cash to do so which would have a material and adverse effect on us 

covenants in our debt agreements limit our operational flexibility and a covenant breach or default could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition liquidity results of operations and prospects 

the agreements governing our indebtedness contain customary covenants including restrictions on our ability to grant liens on our assets incur indebtedness sell assets make investments engage in acquisitions mergers or consolidations and pay certain dividends and other restricted payments these covenants could impair our ability to pursue our business and growth strategies take advantage of new business opportunities or successfully compete a breach of any of these covenants or covenants under any other agreements governing our indebtedness could result in an event of default crossdefault provisions in our debt agreements could cause an event of default under one debt agreement to trigger an event of default under our other debt agreements upon the occurrence of an event of default under any of our debt agreements the lenders could elect to declare all outstanding debt under such agreements to be immediately due and payable if we were unable to repay or refinance the accelerated debt the lenders could proceed against any assets pledged to secure that debt including foreclosing on or requiring the sale of our properties and our assets may not be sufficient to repay such debt in full covenants that limit our operational flexibility as well as defaults under our debt instruments could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition liquidity results of operations and prospects 

a rise in interest rates may increase our overall interest rate expense and could adversely affect our stock price 

our revolving credit facility and term loan b facility are subject to variable interest rates a rise in interest rates may increase our overall interest rate expense and have an adverse impact on our ability to pay distributions to our stockholders the risk presented by holding variable rate indebtedness can be managed or mitigated by utilizing interest rate protection products however there is no assurance that we will utilize any of these products or that such products will be available to us in addition in the event of a rise in interest rates new debt whether fixed or variable is likely to be more expensive and we may be unable to replace maturing debt with new debt at equal or better interest rates 

further the dividend yield on our common stock as a percentage of the price of such common stock will influence the market price of such common stock thus an increase in market interest rates may lead prospective purchasers of our common stock to expect a higher dividend yield which would adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

we may not be able to purchase the properties subject to the call right agreements the amended and restated right of first refusal agreement or the putcall agreement if we are unable to obtain additional financing in addition we may be forced to dispose of harrah’s las vegas to caesars possibly on disadvantageous terms 

the call right agreements provide for our right for up to five years after the formation date to enter into binding agreements to purchase the real property interest and all improvements associated with the option properties from caesars the put call agreement that we entered into with caesars among other things provides us with the opportunity or the obligation to acquire the eastside convention center property and lease it back to caesars the amended and restated right of first refusal agreement provides us the right subject to certain exclusions to i acquire and lease to caesars any domestic gaming facilities located outside of the gaming enterprise district of clark county nevada proposed to be acquired or developed by caesars and ii acquire and lease to caesars any of the properties that caesars has recently agreed to acquire from centaur holdings llc in each case should caesars determine to sell any such properties in order to exercise these rights we would likely be required to secure additional financing and our substantial level of indebtedness following the formation date or other factors could limit our ability to do so on attractive terms or at all if we are unable to obtain financing on terms acceptable to us we may not be able to exercise these rights and acquire these properties even if financing with acceptable terms is available to us there can be no assurance that we will exercise any of these rights 

the putcall agreement among other things grants caesars the right to sell to and simultaneously lease back from us the eastside convention center property if caesars exercises the right to sell to and lease from us the eastside convention center property and the transactions do not close for reasons other than a default by caesars or a failure to obtain any required regulatory approvals caesars will have the right to acquire harrah’s las vegas from us all on and subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the putcall agreement in addition the hlv lease agreement grants caesars the right to purchase harrah’s las vegas from us if we engage in certain transactions with entities deemed to be competitors of caesars or if the landlord under the lease otherwise becomes a competitor of caesars the disposition of harrah’s las vegas to caesars pursuant to the putcall agreement or the hlv lease agreement may be at disadvantageous terms and could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition liquidity results of operations and prospects 

the bankruptcy or insolvency of any tenant or guarantor could result in the termination of the lease agreements and the related guarantees and material losses to us 

although the tenants’ performance and payments under the lease agreements are guaranteed by caesars or crc as the case may be a default by the applicable tenant under the lease agreement or by caesars or crc with regard to its guarantee may cause a default under certain circumstances with regard to the entire portfolio covered by the lease agreements in event of a bankruptcy there can be no assurances that the tenants caesars or crc would assume the lease agreements or the related guarantees and if the lease agreements or guarantees were rejected the tenant caesars or crc as applicable may not have sufficient funds to pay the damages that would be owed to us a result of the rejection and we might not be able to find a replacement tenant on the same or better terms similarly in the event of a bankruptcy of caesars or crc any claim for damages under the guarantee may not be paid in full for these and other reasons the bankruptcy of one or more tenants caesars or crc would have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition liquidity results of operations and prospects 

our pursuit of investments in and acquisitions of additional properties may be unsuccessful or fail to meet our expectations 

we intend to pursue acquisitions of additional properties and seek acquisitions and other strategic opportunities accordingly we may often be engaged in evaluating potential transactions and other strategic alternatives in addition from time to time we may engage in discussions that may result in one or more transactions although there is uncertainty that any of these discussions will result in definitive agreements or the completion of any transaction we may devote a significant amount of our management resources to such a transaction which could negatively impact our operations we may incur significant costs in connection with seeking acquisitions or other strategic opportunities regardless of whether the transaction is completed and in combining our operations if such a transaction is completed 

we operate in a highly competitive industry and face competition from other reits investment companies private equity and hedge fund investors sovereign funds lenders gaming companies and other investors some of whom are significantly larger and have greater resources access to capital and lower costs of capital increased competition will make it more challenging to identify and successfully capitalize on acquisition opportunities that meet our investment objectives if we cannot identify and purchase a sufficient quantity of gaming properties and other properties at favorable prices or if we are unable to finance acquisitions on commercially favorable terms our business financial condition liquidity results of operations and prospects could be materially and adversely affected additionally the fact that we must distribute 90 of our reit taxable income in order to maintain our qualification as a reit may limit our ability to rely upon rental payments from our leased properties or subsequently acquired properties in order to finance acquisitions as a result if debt or equity financing is not available on acceptable terms further acquisitions might be limited or curtailed 

investments in and acquisitions of gaming properties and other properties we might seek to acquire entail risks associated with real estate investments generally including that the investment’s performance will fail to meet expectations that the cost estimates for necessary property improvements will prove inaccurate or the operator or manager will underperform real estate development projects present other risks including construction delays or cost overruns that increase expenses the inability to obtain required zoning occupancy and other governmental approvals and permits on a timely basis and the incurrence of significant development costs prior to completion of the project 

further even if we were able to acquire additional properties in the future there is no guarantee that such properties would be able to maintain their historical performance in addition our financing of these acquisitions could negatively impact our cash flows and liquidity require us to incur substantial debt or involve the issuance of substantial new equity which would be dilutive to existing stockholders we have a substantial amount of indebtedness outstanding which may affect our ability to pay distributions may expose us to interest rate fluctuation risk and may expose us to the risk of default under our debt obligations in addition we cannot assure you that we will be successful in implementing our business and growth strategies or that any expansion will improve operating results the failure to identify and acquire new properties effectively or the failure of any acquired properties to perform as expected could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition liquidity results of operations and prospects and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders 

we may sell or divest different properties or assets after an evaluation of our portfolio of businesses such sales or divestitures would affect our costs revenues results of operations financial condition and liquidity 

from time to time we may evaluate our properties and may as a result sell or attempt to sell divest or spinoff different properties or assets subject to the terms of the lease agreements these sales or divestitures would affect our costs revenues results of operations financial condition liquidity and our ability to comply with financial covenants divestitures have inherent risks including possible delays in closing transactions including potential difficulties in obtaining regulatory approvals the risk of lowerthanexpected sales proceeds for the divested businesses and potential postclosing claims for indemnification in addition 

current economic conditions and relatively illiquid real estate markets may result in fewer potential bidders and unsuccessful sales efforts 

our properties are subject to risks from natural disasters such as earthquakes hurricanes severe weather and terrorism 

our properties are located in areas that may be subject to natural disasters such as earthquakes and extreme weather conditions including but not limited to hurricanes such natural disasters or extreme weather conditions may interrupt operations at the casinos damage our properties and reduce the number of customers who visit our facilities in such areas a severe earthquake could damage or destroy our properties in addition our operations could be adversely impacted by a drought or other cause of water shortage a severe drought of extensive duration experienced in las vegas or in the other regions in which we operate could adversely affect the business and financial results at our properties although the tenants are required to maintain both property and business interruption insurance coverage such coverage is subject to deductibles and limits on maximum benefits including limitation on the coverage period for business interruption and we cannot assure you that we or the tenants will be able to fully insure such losses or fully collect if at all on claims resulting from such natural disasters while the lease agreements require and new lease agreements are expected to require that comprehensive insurance and hazard insurance be maintained by the tenants there are certain types of losses generally of a catastrophic nature such as earthquakes hurricanes and floods that may be uninsurable or not economically insurable insurance coverage may not be sufficient to pay the full current market value or current replacement cost of a loss inflation changes in building codes and ordinances environmental considerations and other factors also might make it infeasible to use insurance proceeds to replace the property after such property has been damaged or destroyed under such circumstances the insurance proceeds received might not be adequate to restore the economic position with respect to such property if we experience a loss that is uninsured or that exceeds our policy coverage limits we could lose the capital invested in the damaged properties as well as the anticipated future cash flows from those properties 

terrorist attacks or other acts of violence may result in declining economic activity which could harm the demand for goods and services offered by our tenants and the value of our properties and might adversely affect the value of an investment in our common stock such a resulting decrease in retail demand could make it difficult for us to renew or release our properties to suitable creditworthy tenants at lease rates equal to or above historical rates terrorist activities or violence also could directly affect the value of our properties through damage destruction or loss and the availability of insurance for such acts or of insurance generally might be lower or cost more which could increase our operating expenses and adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows to the extent that any of our tenants is affected by future terrorist attacks or violence its business similarly could be adversely affected including the ability of our tenants to continue to meet their obligations to us these events might erode business and consumer confidence and spending and might result in increased volatility in national and international financial markets and economies any one of these events might decrease demand for real estate decrease or delay the occupancy of our new or redeveloped properties and limit our access to capital or increase our cost of raising capital 

in addition the lease agreements as applicable allow the tenants to remove a property from the noncplv lease agreement and to terminate the cplv lease agreement the joliet lease agreement or the hlv lease agreement as the case may be during the final two years of the lease terms if the cost to rebuild or restore a property in connection with a casualty event exceeds 25 of total property fair market value similarly if a condemnation event occurs that renders a facility unsuitable for its primary intended use the applicable tenants may remove the property from the noncplv lease agreement and may terminate the cplv lease agreement the joliet lease agreement or the hlv lease agreement as the case may be if a property is removed from the noncplv lease agreement or if the cplv lease agreement the joliet lease agreement or the hlv lease agreement as the case may be is terminated we will lose the rent associated with the related facility which would have a negative impact on our financial results in this event following termination of the lease of a property even if we are able to restore the affected property we could be limited to selling or leasing such property to a new tenant in order to obtain an alternate source of revenue which may not happen on comparable terms or at all 

changes in building andor zoning laws may require us to update a property in the event of recapture or prevent us from fully restoring a property in the event of a substantial casualty loss andor require us to meet additional or more stringent construction requirements 

due to changes among other things in applicable building and zoning laws ordinances and codes that may affect certain of our properties that have come into effect after the initial construction of the properties certain properties may not comply fully with current building andor zoning laws including electrical fire health and safety codes and regulations use lot coverage parking and setback requirements but may qualify as permitted nonconforming uses although the lease agreements require our tenants to pay for and ensure continued compliance with applicable law there is no assurance that future leases will be negotiated on the same basis or that our tenants will make any changes required by the terms of the lease agreements andor any future leases we may enter into in addition such changes may limit a tenant’s ability to restore the premises of a property to its previous condition in the event of a substantial casualty loss with respect to the property or the ability to refurbish expand or renovate such property to remain compliant or increase the cost of construction in order to comply with changes in building or zoning codes and regulations 

if a tenant is unable to restore a property to its prior use after a substantial casualty loss or is required to comply with more stringent building or zoning codes and regulations we may be unable to release the space at a comparable effective rent or sell the property at an acceptable price which may materially and adversely affect our business financial condition liquidity results of operations and prospects 

certain properties are subject to restrictions pursuant to reciprocal easement agreements operating agreements or similar agreements 

many of the properties that we own are and properties that we may acquire in the future may be subject to use restrictions andor operational requirements imposed pursuant to ground leases restrictive covenants or conditions reciprocal easement agreements or operating agreements or other instruments collectively “property restrictions” that could among other things adversely affect our ability to lease space to third parties such property restrictions could include limitations on alterations changes expansions or reconfiguration of properties limitations on use of properties limitations affecting parking requirements or restrictions on exterior or interior signage or facades in certain cases consent of the other party or parties to such agreements may be required when altering reconfiguring expanding or redeveloping failure to secure such consents when necessary may harm our ability to execute leasing strategies which could adversely affect us 

the loss of the services of key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business 

our success and ability to grow depends in large part upon the leadership and performance of our executive management team particularly our chief executive officer our president and chief operating officer and our chief financial officer any unforeseen loss of our executive officers’ services or any negative market or industry perception with respect to them or arising from their loss could have a material adverse effect on our business we do not have key man or similar life insurance policies covering members of our senior management we have employment agreements with our executive officers but these agreements do not guarantee that any given executive will remain with us and there can be no assurance that any such officers will remain with us the appointment of certain key members of our executive management team will be subject to regulatory approvals based upon suitability determinations by gaming regulatory authorities in the jurisdictions where our properties are located if any of our executive officers is found unsuitable by any such gaming regulatory authorities or if we otherwise lose their services we would have to find alternative candidates and may not be able to successfully manage our business or achieve our business objectives 

if we cannot attract retain and motivate employees we may be unable to compete effectively and lose the ability to improve and expand our businesses 

our success and ability to grow depend in part on our ability to hire retain and motivate sufficient numbers of talented people with the increasingly diverse skills needed to serve clients and expand our business we face intense competition for highly qualified specialized technical managerial and consulting personnel recruiting training retention and benefit costs place significant demands on our resources additionally ceoc’s bankruptcy proceedings and our recent formation may make recruiting executives to our business more difficult the inability to attract qualified employees in sufficient numbers to meet particular demands or the loss of a significant number of our employees could have an adverse effect on us 

we may become involved in legal proceedings that if adversely adjudicated or settled could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition liquidity results of operations and prospects 

the nature of our business subjects us to the risk of lawsuits related to matters incidental to our business filed by our tenants customers employees competitors business partners and others as with all legal proceedings no assurance can be provided as to the outcome of these matters and in general legal proceedings can be expensive and time consuming we may not be successful in the defense or prosecution of these lawsuits which could result in settlements or damages that could have a material adverse effect on us 

environmental compliance costs and liabilities associated with real estate properties owned by us may materially impair the value of those investments 

as an owner of real property we are subject to various federal state and local environmental and health and safety laws and regulations although we do not operate or manage most of our properties we may be held primarily or jointly and severally liable for costs relating to the investigation and cleanup of any property from which there has been a release or threatened release of a regulated material as well as other affected properties regardless of whether we knew of or caused the release and to preserve claims for damages further some environmental laws create a lien on a contaminated site in favor of the government for damages and the costs the government incurs in connection with such contamination 

although under the lease agreements the tenants are required to indemnify us for certain environmental liabilities including environmental liabilities it causes the amount of such liabilities could exceed the financial ability of the applicable tenants to 

indemnify us in addition the presence of contamination or the failure to remediate contamination may adversely affect our ability to sell or lease our properties or to borrow using our properties as collateral 

we may be required to contribute insurance proceeds with respect to casualty events at our properties to the lenders under our debt financing agreements 

in the event that we were to receive insurance proceeds with respect to a casualty event at any of our properties we may be required under the terms of our debt financing agreements to contribute all or a portion of those proceeds to the repayment of such debt which may prevent us from restoring such properties to their prior state if the remainder of the proceeds after any such required repayment were insufficient to make the repairs necessary to restore the damaged properties to a condition substantially equivalent to its state immediately prior to the casualty we may not have sufficient liquidity to otherwise fund these repairs and may be required to obtain additional financing which could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition liquidity results of operations and prospects 

if we fail to establish and maintain an effective system of integrated internal controls we may not be able to report our financial results accurately which could have a material adverse effect on us 

as a reporting company we are required to develop and implement substantial control systems policies and procedures in order to qualify and maintain our qualification as a reit and satisfy our periodic sec reporting requirements we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully develop and implement these systems policies and procedures and to operate our company or that any such development and implementation will be effective failure to do so could jeopardize our status as a reit or as a reporting company and the loss of such statuses would materially and adversely affect us if we fail to develop implement or maintain proper overall business controls including as required to support our growth our operating and financial results could be harmed or we could fail to meet our reporting obligations in addition the existence of a material weakness or significant deficiency could result in errors in our financial statements that could require a restatement cause us to fail to meet our sec reporting obligations and cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information which could have a material adverse effect on us and on the market price of our common stock 

risk factors relating to the formation transactions 

we may be unable to make on a timely or costeffective basis the changes necessary to operate as a standalone company primarily focused on owning a portfolio of gaming properties 

we have limited historical operations as an independent company as a standalone entity we are subject to and responsible for regulatory compliance including periodic public filings with the sec compliance with the listing requirements of the new york stock exchange the “nyse” and with applicable state gaming rules and regulations as well as compliance with generally applicable tax and accounting rules because our business did not operate as a standalone company until the formation date we cannot ensure that we will be able to successfully implement the infrastructure or retain the personnel necessary to operate as a standalone company or that we will not incur costs in excess of anticipated costs to establish such infrastructure and retain such personnel 

the historical financial information included in this annual report on form 10k may not be a reliable indicator of future results 

we are a newly organized company with limited operating history and did not operate as a reit or otherwise as a standalone business prior to the formation date therefore our growth prospects must be considered in light of the risks expenses and difficulties frequently encountered when any new business is formed we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully operate our business profitably or implement our operating policies and business and growth strategies as described in this annual report on form 10k 

the financial statements and other financial information included herein may not reflect what our business financial condition cash flows or results of operations will be in the future now that we are a separate public company the properties acquired by our operating partnership from subsidiaries of caesars were historically operated by subsidiaries of caesars as part of its larger corporate organization and not as a standalone business or independent company significant changes have occurred in our cost structure financing and business operations as a result of our operation as a standalone company and the entry into transactions with caesars that have not existed historically including the lease agreements and the related guarantees 

for additional information about the basis of presentation of the financial information included in this annual report on form 10k see “selected financial data” “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation” and the historical combined financial statements of caesars entertainment outdoor our trs prior to the formation date included elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

our actual financial results may vary significantly from the financial projections filed with the bankruptcy court 

in connection with the plan of reorganization the debtors were required to file projected financial information with the bankruptcy court to demonstrate the feasibility of the plan of reorganization and the ability of the debtors to continue operations upon emergence from bankruptcy these projections were prepared for the specific purpose of satisfying statutory requirements in connection with confirmation of the plan of reorganization and are neither included nor incorporated by reference in this annual report on form 10k at the time they were filed the projections reflected numerous assumptions concerning anticipated future performance and market and economic conditions that were and remain beyond our and the debtors’ control and that may not materialize projections are inherently subject to uncertainties and to a wide variety of significant business economic and competitive risks our actual results will vary from those contemplated by the projections and   the variations may be material 

we may be unable to achieve the expected benefits from operating as a company independent of caesars 

we believe that as a company independent from caesars we will have the ability subject to the amended and restated right of first refusal agreement and the lease agreements to pursue transactions with other gaming operators to fund acquisitions with equity on significantly more favorable terms than those that would be available to caesars to diversify into different businesses in which caesars as a practical matter could not diversify and to pursue certain transactions that caesars otherwise would be disadvantaged by or precluded from pursuing due to regulatory constraints however we may not be able to achieve some or all of the benefits from operating as a company independent from caesars in a timely manner if at all  

some members of our management team may have limited experience operating as part of a reit structure 

the requirements for qualifying as a reit are highly technical and complex we did not operate as a reit prior to the formation date and some members of our management team may have limited experience in complying with the income asset and other limitations imposed by the real estate investment provisions of the code any failure to comply with those provisions in a timely manner could prevent us from qualifying as a reit or could force us to pay unexpected taxes and penalties which could materially harm our business financial condition liquidity results of operations and prospects in addition there is no assurance that any past experience   with the acquisition and disposition of gaming facilities will be sufficient to enable us to successfully manage our portfolio of properties as required by our business plan or the reit provisions of the code 

we cannot be certain that the bankruptcy proceedings will not adversely affect our operations going forward 

our properties operated in bankruptcy for over two years and we cannot assure you that having been subject to bankruptcy will not adversely affect our operations going forward for example we may be subject to claims that were not discharged in the bankruptcy proceedings substantially all if not all of the material claims against the debtors that arose prior to the date of the bankruptcy filing were addressed during the bankruptcy proceedings in addition the bankruptcy code provides that the confirmation of a plan of reorganization discharges a debtor from substantially all debts arising prior to confirmation and certain debts arising afterwards circumstances in which claims and other obligations that arose prior to the bankruptcy filing were not discharged primarily relate to certain actions by governmental units under police power authority where ceoc agreed to preserve a claimant’s claims as well as potentially instances where a claimant had inadequate notice of the bankruptcy filing if any such claims remain and can be asserted against us the ultimate resolution of such claims and other obligations may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and profitability 

our separation from subsidiaries of caesars could give rise to disputes or other unfavorable effects which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition liquidity results of operations and prospects 

disputes with third parties could arise out of our separation from subsidiaries of caesars and we could experience unfavorable reactions to the separation from employees ratings agencies regulators or other interested parties for example the city of hammond indiana the city of hammond department of redevelopment department of waterworks of the city of hammond and hammond port collectively the “hammond entities” filed an objection with the bankruptcy court in november 2017 to the assignment of the respective leases licenses and contracts to which they are counterparties relating to horseshoe hammond property the objection alleges that given the prohibition terms of the various leases licenses contracts and the hammond agreements the debtors had no authority or power to make the assignments to vici and at the present the hammond entities do not consent and do object to the property assignments these disputes and reactions of third parties could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition liquidity results of operations and prospects in addition disputes between us and caesars could arise in connection with any of the lease agreements the management and lease support agreements the amended and restated right of first refusal agreement the call right agreements the putcall agreement the tax matters agreement or other agreements 

if our separation from ceoc together with certain related transactions does not qualify as a transaction that is generally taxfree for us federal income tax purposes ceoc could be subject to significant tax liabilities and in certain circumstances we could be required to indemnify ceoc for material taxes pursuant to indemnification obligations under the tax matters agreement 

the irs issued a private letter ruling with respect to certain issues relevant to our separation from ceoc including relating to the separation and certain related transactions as taxfree for us federal income tax purposes under certain provisions of the code the irs ruling does not address certain requirements for taxfree treatment of the separation ceoc received from its tax advisors a tax opinion substantially to the effect that with respect to such requirements on which the irs did not rule such requirements should be satisfied the irs ruling and the tax opinion that ceoc received relied on among other things certain representations assumptions and undertakings including those relating to the past and future conduct of our business and the irs ruling and the opinion would not be valid if such representations assumptions and undertakings were incorrect in any material respect 

notwithstanding the irs ruling and the tax opinion the irs could determine the separation should be treated as a taxable transaction for us federal income tax purposes if it determines any of the representations assumptions or undertakings that were included in the request for the irs ruling are false or have been violated or if it disagrees with the conclusions in the opinion that are not covered by the irs ruling 

if the reorganization fails to qualify for taxfree treatment in general ceoc would be subject to tax as if it had sold our assets to us in a taxable sale for their fair market value and ceoc’s creditors who received shares of our common stock pursuant to the plan of reorganization would be subject to tax as if they had received a taxable distribution in respect of their claims equal to the fair market value of such shares 

under the tax matters agreement that we entered into with caesars we generally are required to indemnify caesars against any tax resulting from the separation to the extent that such tax resulted from certain of our representations or undertakings being incorrect or violated our indemnification obligations to caesars are not limited by any maximum amount as a result if we are required to indemnify caesars or such other persons under the circumstances set forth in the tax matters agreement we may be subject to substantial liabilities 

we may not be able to engage in desirable strategic or capitalraising transactions following the spinoff in addition we could be liable for adverse tax consequences resulting from engaging in significant strategic or capitalraising transactions 

to preserve the taxfree treatment to ceoc of the spinoff for the twoyear period following the spinoff we may be prohibited except in specific circumstances from 1 entering into any transaction pursuant to which all or a portion of our stock would be acquired whether by merger or otherwise 2 issuing equity securities beyond certain thresholds 3 repurchasing our common stock 4 ceasing to actively conduct the business of operating vici golf or 5 taking or failing to take any other action that prevents the spinoff and related transactions from being taxfree these restrictions may limit our ability to pursue strategic transactions or engage in new business or other transactions that may maximize the value of our business 

risks related to our status as a reit 

we may not qualify or maintain our qualification as a reit 

we intend to elect and qualify to be taxed as a reit for us federal income tax purposes commencing with our taxable year ended december 31 2017 and expect to operate in a manner that will allow us to continue to be classified as such once an entity is qualified as a reit the code generally requires that such entity distribute annually to its stockholders at least 90 of its reit taxable income with certain adjustments determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gains and that it pay tax at regular corporate rates to the extent that it distributes annually less than 100 of its reit taxable income including capital gains in addition a reit is required to pay a 4 nondeductible excise tax on the amount if any by which the distributions it makes in a calendar year are less than the sum of 85 of its ordinary income 95 of its capital gain net income and 100 of its undistributed income from prior years as a result in order to avoid current entity level us federal income taxes a substantial portion of our cash flow after operating expenses and debt service will be required to be distributed to our stockholders 

if we were to fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year we would be subject to us federal income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates and dividends paid to our stockholders would not be deductible by us in computing our reit taxable income any resulting corporate tax liability could be substantial and would reduce the amount of cash available for distribution to our stockholders which in turn could have an adverse impact on the market price of our common stock unless we were entitled to relief under certain code provisions we also would be disqualified from reelecting to be taxed as a reit for the four taxable 

years following the year in which we failed to qualify as a reit as a result the amount available for distribution to holders of equity securities that would otherwise receive dividends would be reduced for the year or years involved furthermore the us federal income tax consequences of distributions and sales of our shares to certain of our stockholders could be adversely impacted if we were to fail to qualify as a reit 

qualification to be taxed as a reit involves highly technical and complex provision of the code and violations of these provisions could jeopardize our reit qualification 

qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex code provisions for which only limited judicial and administrative authorities exist even a technical or inadvertent violation could jeopardize our reit qualification our qualification as a reit depends on our satisfaction of certain asset income organizational distribution stockholder ownership and other requirements on a continuing basis in addition our ability to satisfy the requirements to qualify as a reit may depend in part on the actions of third parties over which we have no control or only limited influence including in cases where we own an equity interest in an entity that is classified as a partnership for us federal income tax purposes 

the opinion we expect to receive regarding our status as a reit does not guarantee our ability to qualify as a reit 

we intend to operate in a manner that will allow us to qualify to be taxed as a reit for us federal income tax purposes we expect that we will receive an opinion of kramer levin naftalis  frankel llp “reit tax counsel” that commencing with our taxable year ending december 31 2017 we are organized in conformity with the requirements for qualification and taxation as a reit under the us federal income tax laws and our proposed method of operations will enable us to satisfy the requirements for qualification and taxation as a reit under the us federal income tax laws for our taxable year ending december 31 2017 and subsequent taxable years investors should be aware however that opinions of counsel are not binding on the irs or any court the opinion of reit tax counsel represents only the view of reit tax counsel based on its review and analysis of existing law and on certain representations as to factual matters and covenants made by us including representations relating to the values of our assets and the sources of our income the opinion is expressed as of the date of this offering reit tax counsel will have no obligation to advise us or the holders of shares of our common stock of any subsequent change in the matters stated represented or assumed or of any subsequent change in applicable law furthermore both the validity of the opinion of reit tax counsel and our qualification to be taxed as a reit will depend on our satisfaction of certain asset income organizational distribution stockholder ownership and other requirements on a continuing basis the results of which will not be monitored by reit tax counsel our ability to satisfy the asset tests depends upon our analysis of the characterization and fair market values of our assets some of which are not susceptible to a precise determination and for which we will not obtain independent appraisals any failure to qualify to be taxed as a reit or failure to remain to be qualified to be taxed as a reit would have a material and adverse effect on us 

we may in the future choose to pay dividends in the form of our own common stock in which case stockholders may be required to pay income taxes in excess of the cash dividends they receive 

we   may seek in the future to distribute taxable dividends that are payable in cash or our common stock taxable stockholders receiving such dividends will be required to include the full amount of the dividend as ordinary income to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits for us federal income tax purposes as to which noncorporate stockholders will generally be eligible for a deduction equal to 20 of such distributions as a result stockholders receiving dividends in the form of common stock may be required to pay income taxes with respect to such dividends in excess of the cash dividends received if any if a us stockholder sells the common stock that it receives as   a dividend in order to pay this tax the sales proceeds may be less than the amount included in income with respect to the dividend depending on the market price of our common stock at the time of the sale in addition in such case a   us stockholder could have a capital loss with respect to the common stock sold that could not be used to offset such dividend income moreover with respect to certain nonus stockholders we may be required to withhold us federal income tax with respect to such dividends including in respect of all or a portion of such dividend that is payable in common stock furthermore such a taxable share dividend could be viewed as equivalent to a reduction in our cash distributions and that factor as well as the possibility that a significant number of our stockholders determine to sell our common stock in order to pay taxes owed on dividends may put downward pressure on the market price of our common stock 

changes to the us federal income tax laws including the recent enactment of certain tax reform measures could have a material and adverse effect on us 

us federal income tax laws governing reits and other corporations and the administrative interpretations of those laws may be amended at any time potentially with retroactive effect we cannot predict whether when or to what extent new us federal tax laws regulations interpretations or rulings will be issued prospective investors are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding the effect of potential changes to the us federal tax laws on an investment in our common stock 

recently enacted changes to the us federal income tax laws could have a material and adverse effect on us for example certain changes in law pursuant to the tax cuts and jobs act could reduce the relative competitive advantage of operating as a reit as compared with operating as a c corporation including by 

 we could fail to qualify to be taxed as a reit if income we receive from caesars or its subsidiaries is not treated as qualifying income 

under applicable provisions of the code we will not be treated as a reit unless we satisfy various requirements including requirements relating to the sources of our gross income rents received or accrued by us from caesars or its subsidiaries will not be treated as qualifying rent for purposes of these requirements if the leases are not respected as true leases for us federal income tax purposes and instead are treated as service contracts joint ventures or some other type of arrangement if some or all of our leases are not respected as true leases for us federal income tax purposes we may fail to qualify to be taxed as a reit furthermore our qualification as a reit will depend on our satisfaction of certain asset income organizational distribution stockholder ownership and other requirements on a continuing basis our ability to satisfy the asset tests depends upon our analysis of the characterization and fair market values of our assets some of which are not susceptible to a precise determination and for which we may not obtain independent appraisals 

in addition subject to certain exceptions rents received or accrued by us from caesars or its subsidiaries will not be treated as qualifying rent for purposes of these requirements if we or an actual or constructive owner of 10 or more of our stock actually or constructively owns 10 or more of the total combined voting power of all classes of caesars stock entitled to vote or 10 or more of the total value of all classes of caesars stock our charter provides for restrictions on ownership and transfer of our shares of stock including restrictions on such ownership or transfer that would cause the rents received or accrued by us from caesars or its subsidiaries to be treated as nonqualifying rent for purposes of the reit gross income requirements nevertheless there can be no assurance that such restrictions will be effective in ensuring that rents received or accrued by us from caesars or its subsidiaries will not be treated as qualifying rent for purposes of reit qualification requirements 

reit distribution requirements could adversely affect our ability to execute our business plan 

we generally must distribute annually to our stockholders at least 90 of our reit taxable income with certain adjustments determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding any net capital gains in order for us to qualify as a reit so that us federal corporate income tax does not apply to earnings that we distribute to the extent that we satisfy this distribution requirement and qualify for taxation as a reit but distribute less than 100 of our reit taxable income determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and including any net capital gains we will be subject to us federal corporate income tax on any undistributed portion of such taxable income in addition we will be subject to a 4 nondeductible excise tax if the actual amount that we distribute to our stockholders in a calendar year is less than a minimum amount specified under us federal tax laws we intend to make distributions to our stockholders to comply with the reit requirements of the code and to avoid or otherwise minimize paying entity level federal or excise tax other than at any trs of ours we may generate taxable income greater than our income for financial reporting purposes prepared in accordance with gaap in particular during the first several years of the leases under the terms of the lease agreements rental income will be allocated for tax purposes generally in an amount greater than cash rents further we may generate taxable income greater than our cash flow from operations after operating expenses and debt service as a result of differences in timing between the recognition of taxable income and the actual receipt of cash or the effect of nondeductible capital expenditures the creation of reserves or required debt or amortization payments in order to avoid or otherwise minimize current entity level us federal income taxes we will generally be required to distribute sufficient cash flow after operating expenses and debt service payments to satisfy the reit distribution requirements while we intend to make distributions to our stockholders to comply with the reit requirements of the code we may not have sufficient liquidity to meet the reit distribution requirements if our cash flow is insufficient to satisfy the reit distribution requirements we could be required to raise capital on unfavorable terms sell assets at disadvantageous prices distribute amounts that would otherwise be invested in future acquisitions or issue dividends in the form of shares of our common stock to make distributions sufficient to enable us to pay out enough of our reit taxable income to satisfy the reit distribution requirement and to avoid corporate income tax and the 4 excise tax in a particular year these alternatives could increase our costs or change the value of our equity thus compliance with the reit requirements may hinder our ability to grow which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

even if we qualify as a reit we may face other tax liabilities that reduce our cash flow 

even if we qualify for taxation as a reit we may be subject to certain us federal state and local taxes on our income and assets including taxes on any undistributed income and state or local income property and transfer taxes for example in order to meet the reit qualification requirements we currently hold and expect in the future to hold some of our assets and conduct certain of our activities through one or more taxable reit subsidiaries or other subsidiary corporations that will be subject to federal state and local corporatelevel income taxes as regular c corporations ie corporations generally subject to corporatelevel income tax under subchapter c of chapter 1 the code in addition we may incur a 100 excise tax on transactions with a taxable reit subsidiary if they are not conducted on an arm’s length basis any of these taxes would decrease cash available for distribution to our stockholders 

complying with reit requirements may cause us to liquidate or forgo otherwise attractive opportunities 

to qualify as a reit we must ensure that at the end of each calendar quarter at least 75 of the value of our assets consists of cash cash items government securities and “real estate assets” as defined in the code including certain mortgage loans and securities the remainder of our investments other than government securities qualified real estate assets and securities issued by a taxable reit subsidiary generally cannot include more than 10 of the outstanding voting securities of any one issuer or more than 10 of the total value of the outstanding securities of any one issuer in addition in general no more than 5 of the value of our total assets other than government securities qualified real estate assets and securities issued by a taxable reit subsidiary can consist of the securities of any one issuer and no more than 25 of the value of our total assets can be represented by securities of one or more taxable reit subsidiaries 20 for taxable years beginning after december 31 2017 if we fail to comply with these requirements at the end of any calendar quarter we must correct the failure within 30 days after the end of the calendar quarter or qualify for certain statutory relief provisions to avoid losing our reit qualification and suffering adverse tax consequences as a result we may be required to liquidate or forgo otherwise attractive investments these actions could have the effect of reducing our income and amounts available for distribution to our stockholders in addition to the asset tests set forth above to qualify as a reit we must continually satisfy tests concerning among other things the sources of our income the amounts we distribute to our stockholders and the ownership of our stock we may be unable to pursue investments that would be otherwise advantageous to us in order to satisfy the sourceofincome or assetdiversification requirements for qualifying as a reit thus compliance with the reit requirements may hinder our ability to make certain attractive investments 

we may be subject to builtin gains tax on the disposition of certain of our properties 

if we   acquire certain properties in taxdeferred transactions which properties were held by one or more c corporations before they were held by us we may be subject to a builtin gain tax on future disposition of such properties this is the case with respect to all or substantially all of the properties acquired from ceoc pursuant to the formation transactions if we dispose of any such properties during the fiveyear period following acquisition of the properties from the respective c corporation ie during the fiveyear period following ownership of such properties by a reit we will be subject to us federal income tax and applicable state and local taxes at the highest corporate tax rates on any gain recognized from the disposition of such properties to the extent of the excess of the fair market value of the properties on the date that they were contributed to or acquired by us in a taxdeferred transaction over the adjusted tax basis of such properties on such date which are referred to as builtin gains similarly if we recognize certain other income considered to be builtin income during the fiveyear period following the property acquisitions described above we could be subject to us federal tax under the builtin gains tax rules we would be subject to this corporatelevel tax liability without the benefit of the deduction for dividends paid even if we qualify and maintain our status as a reit any recognized builtin gain will retain its character as ordinary income or capital gain and will be taken into account in determining reit taxable income and the reit distribution requirements any tax on the recognized builtin gain will reduce reit taxable income we may choose to forego otherwise attractive opportunities to sell assets in a taxable transaction during the fiveyear builtin gain recognition period in order to avoid this builtin gain tax however there can be no assurance that such a taxable transaction will not occur the amount of any such builtin gain tax could be material and the resulting tax liability could have a negative effect on our cash flow and limit our ability to pay distributions required to qualify and maintain our status as a reit 

complying with reit requirements may limit our ability to hedge effectively and may cause us to incur tax liabilities 

the reit provisions of the code substantially limit our ability to hedge our assets and liabilities income from certain hedging transactions that we may enter into to manage risk of interest rate changes with respect to borrowings made or to be made to acquire or carry real estate assets or from transactions to manage risk of currency fluctuations with respect to any item of income or gain that satisfy the reit gross income tests including gain from the termination of such a transaction does not constitute “gross income” for purposes of the 75 or 95 gross income tests that apply to reits provided that certain identification requirements are met to the extent that we enter into other types of hedging transactions or fail to properly identify such transaction as a hedge the income is likely to be treated as nonqualifying income for purposes of both of the gross income tests as a result of these rules we may be required to limit our use of advantageous hedging techniques or implement those hedges through a taxable reit 

subsidiary this could increase the cost of our hedging activities because the taxable reit subsidiary may be subject to tax on gains or expose us to greater risks associated with changes in interest rates that we would otherwise want to bear in addition losses in the taxable reit subsidiary will generally not provide any tax benefit except that such losses could theoretically be carried back or forward against past or future taxable income of the taxable reit subsidiary 

we may pay a purging distribution if any in common stock and cash 

in order to qualify as a reit we must distribute any “earnings and profits” as defined in the code that are allocated from ceoc to us in connection with the formation transactions by the end of the first taxable year in which we elect reit status based on analysis of ceoc’s earnings and profits we currently do not believe that any earnings and profits were allocated to us in connection with the formation transactions and therefore do not currently expect to be required to make a purging distribution if notwithstanding this expectation we are required to make a purging distribution we may pay the purging distribution to our stockholders in a combination of cash and shares of our common stock each of our stockholders will be permitted to elect to receive the stockholder’s entire entitlement under the purging distribution in either cash or shares of our common stock subject to a cash limitation if our stockholders elect to receive a portion of cash in excess of the cash limitation each such electing stockholder will receive a pro rata portion of cash corresponding to the stockholder’s respective entitlement under the purging distribution declaration the irs issued a private letter ruling with respect to certain issues relevant to the separation from caesars providing generally that subject to the terms and conditions contained therein the amount of any shares of our common stock received by any of our stockholders as part of a purging distribution if any will be considered to equal the amount of cash that could have been received instead although we may generally rely upon the ruling no assurance can be given that the irs will not challenge our qualification as a reit on the basis of other issues or facts outside the scope of the ruling furthermore the irs has issued a revenue procedure that provides that so long as a reit complied with certain provisions therein certain distributions that are paid partly in cash and partly in stock will be treated as taxable dividends that would satisfy the reit distribution requirements and qualify for the dividends paid deduction for us federal income tax purposes in a purging distribution if any a stockholder of our common stock will be required to report dividend income equal to the amount of cash and common stock received as a result of the purging distribution even though we may distribute no cash or only nominal amounts of cash to such stockholder 

risks related to our organizational structure 

our rights and the rights of our stockholders to take action against our directors and officers are limited 

the maryland general corporation law the “mgcl” provides that a director has no liability in any action based on an act of the director if he or she has acted in good faith in a manner he or she reasonably believes to be in the corporation’s best interests and with the care that an ordinarily prudent person in a like position would use under similar circumstances as permitted by the mgcl our charter limits the liability of our directors and officers to our company and our stockholders for money damages to the maximum extent permitted by maryland law under maryland law our present directors and officers will not have any liability to us or our stockholders for money damages other than liability resulting from 

 our charter provides that we have the power to obligate ourselves and our amended and restated bylaws obligate us to indemnify our directors and officers for actions taken by them in those capacities and to pay or reimburse their reasonable expenses in advance of final disposition of a proceeding to the maximum extent permitted by maryland law in addition we have entered into indemnification agreements with our directors and executive   officers that provide for indemnification and advance expenses to the maximum extent permitted by maryland law as a result we and our stockholders may have more limited rights against our directors and officers than might otherwise exist under common law 

our board of directors may change our major corporate policies without stockholder approval and those changes may materially and adversely affect us 

our board of directors will determine and may eliminate or otherwise change our major corporate policies including our acquisition investment financing growth operations and distribution policies while our stockholders have the power to elect or remove directors changes in our major corporate policies may be made by our board of directors without stockholder approval and those changes could adversely affect our business financial condition liquidity results of operations and prospects the market price of our common stock and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders and to satisfy our debt service requirements 

the ability of our board of directors to revoke or otherwise terminate our reit qualification with stockholder approval may cause adverse consequences to our stockholders 

our charter provides that our board of directors may revoke or otherwise terminate our reit election only with the affirmative vote of stockholders entitled to cast a majority of all votes entitled to be cast on the matter if the board determines that it is no longer in our best interests to continue to qualify as a reit if we cease to be a reit we would become subject to federal income tax on our taxable income and would no longer be required to distribute most of our taxable income to our stockholders which may have adverse consequences on the total return to our stockholders 

our charter and bylaws contain provisions that may delay defer or prevent an acquisition of our common stock or a change in control 

our charter and bylaws contain provisions the exercise or existence of which could delay defer or prevent a transaction or a change in control that might involve a premium price for our stockholders or otherwise be in their best interests including the following 

our charter contains restrictions on the ownership and transfer of our stock 

in order for us to qualify as a reit no more than 50 of the value of outstanding shares of our stock may be owned beneficially or constructively by five or fewer individuals or certain other persons at any time during the last half of each taxable year “closely held” subject to certain exceptions our charter prohibits any stockholder from owning beneficially or constructively with respect to any class or series of our capital stock more than 98 in value or by number of shares whichever is more restrictive of the aggregate of the outstanding shares of such class or series of our capital stock 

the constructive ownership rules under the code are complex and may cause the outstanding stock owned by a group of related individuals or entities to be deemed to be constructively owned by one individual or entity as a result the acquisition of 98 or less of the outstanding shares of a class or series of our stock by an individual or entity could cause that individual or entity or another individual or entity to own constructively in excess of the relevant ownership limits 

among other restrictions on ownership and transfer of shares our charter also prohibits any person from owning shares of our stock that would result in our being “closely held” under section 856h of the code or otherwise cause us to fail to qualify as a reit any attempt to own or transfer shares of our common stock or of any of our other capital stock in violation of these restrictions may result in the shares being automatically transferred to a charitable trust or may be void 

our charter provides that our board may grant exceptions to the 98 ownership limit subject in each case to certain initial and ongoing conditions designed to protect our status as a reit these ownership limits may prevent a thirdparty from acquiring control of us if our board of directors does not grant an exemption from the ownership limits even if our stockholders believe the change in control is in their best interests an exemption from the 98 ownership limit was granted to certain stockholders and our board may in the future provide exceptions to the ownership limit for other stockholders subject to certain initial and ongoing conditions designed to protect our status as a reit 

our board of directors has the power to cause us to issue and authorize additional shares of our capital stock without stockholder approval 

our charter authorizes us to issue authorized but unissued shares of common or preferred stock in addition to the shares of common stock issued and outstanding in addition our board of directors may without stockholder approval amend our charter to increase the aggregate number of our shares of stock or the number of shares of stock of any class or series that we have authority to issue and classify or reclassify any unissued shares of common or preferred stock and set the preferences rights and other terms of the classified or reclassified shares as a result our board of directors may establish a class or series of shares of common or preferred stock that could delay or prevent a transaction or a change in control that might involve a premium price for our shares of common stock or otherwise be in the best interests of our stockholders 

certain provisions of maryland law may limit the ability of a third party to acquire control of us 

certain provisions of the mgcl may have the effect of inhibiting a third party from acquiring us or of impeding a change of control under circumstances that otherwise could provide our common stockholders with the opportunity to realize a premium over the then prevailing market price of such shares including

 our charter provides that notwithstanding any other provision of our charter or our bylaws the maryland business combination act title 3 subtitle 6 of the mgcl does not apply to any business combination between us and any interested stockholder or any affiliate of any interested stockholder of ours and that we expressly elect not to be governed by the provisions of section 3602 of the mgcl in whole or in part any amendment to such provision of our charter must be approved by the affirmative vote of stockholders entitled to cast a majority of all votes entitled to be cast on the matter pursuant to the mgcl our bylaws contain a provision exempting from the maryland control share acquisition act any and all acquisitions by any person of shares of our stock this provision of our bylaws may not be altered amended or repealed except by our stockholders by the affirmative vote of at least twothirds of all the votes entitled to be cast on the matter there can be no assurance that this exemption contained in our bylaws will not be amended or eliminated at any time in the future 

additionally provisions of title 3 subtitle 8 of the mgcl permit a maryland corporation such as the company by action of its board of directors and without stockholder approval and regardless of what is provided in the charter or bylaws to elect to avail itself of certain takeover defenses such as a classified board unless the charter or a resolution adopted by the board of directors prohibits such election our charter provides that we are prohibited from making any such election unless first approved by our stockholders by the affirmative vote of a majority of all votes entitled to be cast on the matter

risks related to our common stock 

the cash available for distribution to stockholders may not be sufficient to pay dividends at expected levels nor can we assure you of our ability to make distributions in the future we may use borrowed funds to make distributions 

if cash available for distribution is less than the amount necessary to make cash distributions our inability to make the expected distributions could result in a decrease in the market price of our common stock all distributions will be made at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon various factors including but not limited to our historical and projected financial condition cash flows results of operations and reit taxable income limitations contained in financing instruments debt service requirements operating cash inflows and outflows including capital expenditures and acquisitions limitations on our ability to use cash generated in one or more taxable reit subsidiaries if any to fund distributions and applicable law we may not be able to make distributions in the future in addition some of our distributions may include a return of capital to the extent that we decide to make distributions in excess of our current and accumulated earnings and profits in the future such distributions would generally be considered a return of capital for federal income tax purposes to the extent of the holder’s adjusted tax basis in their shares a return of capital is not taxable but it has the effect of reducing the holder’s adjusted tax basis in our common stock to the extent that such distributions exceed the adjusted tax basis of a holder’s shares they will be treated as gain from the sale or exchange of such stock if we borrow to fund distributions our future interest costs would increase thereby reducing our earnings and cash available for distribution from what they otherwise would have been 

for purposes of satisfying the minimum distribution requirement to qualify for and maintain reit status our reit taxable income will be calculated without reference to our cash flow consequently under certain circumstances we may not have available cash to make our required distributions and we may need to raise additional equity or debt in order to fund our intended distributions or we may distribute a portion of our distributions in the form of our common stock or debt instruments which could result in significant stockholder dilution or higher leverage while the irs has issued a revenue procedure indicating that certain distributions that are made partly in cash and partly in stock will be treated as taxable dividends that would satisfy that reit annual distribution 

requirement and qualify for the dividends paid deduction for us federal income tax purposes no assurance can be provided that we will be able to satisfy the requirements of the revenue procedure therefore it is unclear whether and to what extent we will be able to make taxable dividends payable inkind in addition to the extent we were to make distributions that include our common stock or debt instruments a stockholder of ours will be required to report dividend income as a result of such distributions even though we distributed no cash or only nominal amounts of cash to such stockholder 

vici reit is a holding company with no direct operations and will rely on distributions received from the operating partnership to make distributions to its stockholders 

vici reit is a holding company and conducts its operations through subsidiaries including the operating partnership and vici golf vici reit does not have apart from the units that it owns in the operating partnership and vici golf any independent operations as a result vici reit relies on distributions from its operating partnership to make any distributions to its stockholders it might declare on its common stock and to meet any of its obligations including any tax liability on taxable income allocated to it from the operating partnership which might not be able to make distributions to vici reit equal to the tax on such allocated taxable income in turn the ability of subsidiaries of the operating partnership to make distributions to the operating partnership and therefore the ability of the operating partnership to make distributions to vici reit depends on the operating results of these subsidiaries and the operating partnership and on the terms of any financing arrangements they have entered into in addition because vici reit is a holding company claims of common stockholders of vici reit are structurally subordinated to all existing and future liabilities and other obligations whether or not for borrowed money and any preferred equity of the operating partnership and its subsidiaries therefore in the event of our bankruptcy liquidation or reorganization vici reit’s assets and those of the operating partnership and its subsidiaries will be available to satisfy the claims of vici reit common stockholders only after all of vici reit’s the operating partnership’s and its subsidiaries’ liabilities and other obligations and any preferred equity of any of them have been paid in full 

the operating partnership may in connection with its acquisition of additional properties or otherwise issue additional common units or preferred units to third parties such issuances would reduce vici reit’s ownership in the operating partnership because stockholders of vici reit do not directly own common units or preferred units of the operating partnership they do not have any voting rights with respect to any such issuances or other partnership level activities of the operating partnership 

conflicts of interest could arise between the interests of our stockholders and the interests of holders of operating partnership units which may impede business decisions that could benefit our stockholders 

conflicts of interest could arise as a result of the relationships between us on the one hand and our operating partnership or any limited partner thereof if any on the other our directors and officers have duties to us under applicable maryland law at the same time we as general partner of our operating partnership have fiduciary duties and obligations to our operating partnership and its limited partners under delaware law and the partnership agreement of our operating partnership in connection with the management of our operating partnership our duties as general partner to our operating partnership and its limited partners may come into conflict with the duties of our directors and officers to vici reit these conflicts may be resolved in a manner that is not in the best interests of our stockholders 

the market price and trading volume of shares of our common stock may be volatile 

the market price of our common stock may be volatile in addition the trading volume in our common stock may fluctuate and cause significant price variations to occur we cannot assure you that the market price of our common stock will not fluctuate or decline significantly in the future 

some of the factors many of which are beyond our control that could negatively affect the market price of our common stock or result in fluctuations in the price or trading volume of our common stock include 



 future offerings of debt andor preferred equity securities which may be senior to our shares for purposes of distributions or upon liquidation could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

in the future we may attempt to increase our capital resources by making additional offerings of debt or preferred equity securities including mediumterm notes trust preferred securities senior or subordinated notes and preferred shares if a liquidation event were to occur holders of our debt securities and preferred shares and lenders with respect to other borrowings will receive distributions of our available assets prior to the holders of our shares additional equity offerings may dilute the holdings of our existing stockholders or reduce the market price of our common stock or both holders of shares of our common stock are not entitled to preemptive rights or other protections against dilution our preferred shares if issued could have a preference on liquidating distributions or a preference on distribution payments that could limit our ability to make a distribution to the holders of shares of our common stock since our decision to issue securities in any future offering will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control we cannot predict or estimate the amount timing or nature of our future offerings thus our stockholders bear the risk of our future offerings reducing the market price of shares of our common stock and diluting their shareholdings in us 

our earnings and cash distributions could affect the market price of shares of our common stock 

our common stock may trade at prices that are higher or lower than the net asset value per share to the extent that we retain operating cash flow for investment purposes working capital reserves or other purposes rather than distributing the cash flows to stockholders these retained funds while increasing the value of our underlying assets may negatively impact the market price of shares of our common stock our failure to meet market expectations with regard to future earnings and cash distributions could adversely affect the market price of shares of our common stock

distribution policy 

we intend to make regular quarterly distributions to holders of shares of our common stock we cannot assure you that our estimated distributions will be made or sustained or that our board of directors will not change our distribution policy in the future any distributions will be at the sole discretion of our board of directors and their form timing and amount if any will depend upon a number of factors including our actual and projected results of operations ffo liquidity cash flows and financial condition the revenue we actually receive from our properties our operating expenses our debt service requirements our capital expenditures prohibitions and other limitations under our financing arrangements our reit taxable income the annual reit distribution requirements applicable law and such other factors as our board of directors deems relevant for more information regarding risk factors that could materially and adversely affect us and our ability to make cash distributions see “risk factors” if our operations do not generate sufficient cash flow to enable us to pay our intended or required distributions we may be required either to fund distributions from working capital borrow or raise equity or to reduce such distributions in addition our charter allows us to issue preferred stock that could have a preference on distributions and could limit our ability to make distributions to our stockholders additionally under certain circumstances agreements relating to our indebtedness could limit our ability to make distributions to our stockholders 

federal income tax law requires that a reit distribute annually at least 90 of its reit taxable income with certain adjustments determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding any net capital gains and that it pay tax at regular corporate rates to the extent that it annually distributes less than 100 of its reit taxable income determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and including any net capital gains in addition a reit will be required to pay a 4 nondeductible excise tax on the amount if any by which the distributions it makes in a calendar year are less than the sum of 85 of its ordinary income 95 of its capital gain net income and 100 of its undistributed income from prior years 

we intend to make distributions to our stockholders to comply with the reit requirements of the code and to avoid or otherwise minimize paying entity level federal or excise tax other than at any trs of ours we may generate taxable income greater than our income for financial reporting purposes prepared in accordance with gaap in particular during the first several years of the leases under the terms of the lease agreements rental income will be allocated for tax purposes generally in an amount greater than cash rents further we may generate reit taxable income greater than our cash flow from operations after operating expenses and debt service as a result of differences in timing between the recognition of reit taxable income and the actual 

receipt of cash or the effect of nondeductible capital expenditures the creation of reserves or required debt or amortization payments

acquisition of harrah’s las vegas and sale of eastside property 

purchase of harrah’s las vegas real estate 

on december 22 2017  we acquired all of the land and real property improvements associated with harrah’s las vegas hotel  casino “hlv” from a subsidiary of caesars for a purchase price of approximately 11362 million  on the closing date we entered into the hlv lease agreement with a subsidiary of caesars as tenant pursuant to which we lease back hlv to caesars and caesars resorts collection “crc” guarantees the tenant’s payment obligations under the lease 

sale of eastside property 

on december 22 2017  we sold approximately 184  acres of certain parcels located in las vegas nevada east of hlv to a subsidiary of caesars for a sales price of approximately 736 million  

at the closing we entered into a putcall agreement with certain subsidiaries of caesars which provides caesars and us with certain rights and obligations in connection with i the sale by subsidiaries of caesars to us and simultaneous leaseback by us to subsidiaries of caesars of the eastside convention center property and ii in the event the transactions described in item i are triggered by caesars and such transactions do not close for reasons other than a default by caesars or failure to obtain any required regulatory approvals among other things and caesars so elects the sale by us to caesars of hlv all on and subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the putcall agreement after the closing subsidiaries of caesars are the owners of certain parcels of real property located adjacent to hlv including the eastside property collectively the “designated property” all or a portion of which designated property may in the future be improved by a convention center in such case the “eastside convention center” 

due to the putcall agreement on the land parcels it was determined that the transaction does not meet the requirements of a completed sale for accounting purposes as a result we reclassified  736 million  from real estate investments accounted for using the operating method to land additionally the company recorded a 736 million  deferred financing liability in its balance sheet 

amended and restated right of first refusal agreement 

on december 22 2017  vici and caesars entered into an amended and restated right of first refusal agreement pursuant to which we also have a right of first refusal on any saleleaseback by caesars of the gaming facilities of centaur holdings llc which are proposed to be acquired by caesars and certain incomeproducing improvements if built by caesars in lieu of a largescale convention center on the eastside property subject to certain exclusions

key trends that may affect our business 

subsidiaries of caesars are the lessees of all of our properties pursuant to the lease agreements and caesars or crc guarantees the obligations of the tenants under the lease agreements the lease agreements account for substantially all of our revenues additionally we expect to experience organic growth in rental revenue through annual rent escalators in our lease agreements accordingly we are dependent on caesars the gaming industry and the health of the economies in the areas where our properties are located for the foreseeable future and an event that has a material adverse effect on caesars’ business financial condition liquidity results of operations or prospects would have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition liquidity results of operations and prospects see “risk factors—risks related to our business and operations” 

additionally we expect to grow our portfolio through acquisitions by pursuing opportunities to execute sale leaseback transactions with caesars pursuant to i the call right agreements relating to three properties ii rights of first refusal relating to certain domestic gaming facilities proposed to be acquired or developed by caesars located outside the gaming enterprise district of clark county nevada and the properties that caesars recently agreed to acquire from centaur holdings llc and iii the putcall agreement which includes rights relating to the eastside convention center property in las vegas additionally we will actively seek to grow our portfolio through acquisitions of experiential real estate in dynamic markets spanning hospitality entertainment leisure and gaming properties finally we believe the approximately 34 acres after giving effect to the sale of approximately 184 acres to caesars in december 2017 of undeveloped land adjacent to the las vegas strip that we own will provide attractive opportunities for potential future expansion and development in pursuing external growth initiatives we will generally seek to acquire properties that can generate stable rental revenue through longterm triplenet leases with tenants with 

established operating histories and we will consider various factors when evaluating acquisitions including the ability to diversify our tenant base by potentially leasing properties to parties unaffiliated with caesars and increasing our geographic diversification 

our operating and financial performance in the future will be significantly influenced by the success of our acquisition strategy and the timing and the availability and terms of financing of any acquisitions that we may complete we can provide no assurance that we will exercise any of our contractual rights to purchase one or more properties from caesars or otherwise be successful in acquiring any properties additionally our ability to successfully implement our acquisition strategy will depend upon the availability and terms of financing including debt and equity capital further the pricing of any acquisitions we may consummate and the terms of any leases that we may enter into will significantly impact our future results competition to execute sale leaseback transactions with attractive properties and desirable tenants is intense and we can provide no assurance that any future acquisitions or leases will be on terms as favorable to us as those relating to recent transactions should we exercise an option to purchase a property under a call right agreement the purchase price will be equal to ten times the property’s annual rent which in turn will equal approximately 60 of the trailing property ebitdar at the time of exercise accordingly the purchase price and rent for any property we may acquire under a call right agreement and lease to caesars will depend upon the property’s ebitdar at the time of exercise we anticipate that we would seek to finance these acquisitions with a majority of equity although no assurance can be given that we would be able to issue equity in such amounts on favorable terms or at all or that we would not determine to incur more debt on a relative basis at the relevant time due market conditions or otherwise in addition to rent our tenants are required to pay the following 1 all facility maintenance 2 all insurance required in connection with the leased properties and the business conducted on the leased properties 3 taxes levied on or with respect to the leased properties other than taxes on our income and 4 all utilities and other services necessary or appropriate for the leased properties and the business conducted on the leased properties accordingly due to the “triplenet” structure of our leases we do not expect to incur significant propertylevel expenses

we present funds from operations “ffo” adjusted funds from operations “affo” and adjusted ebitda which are not required by or presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states “gaap” these are nongaap financial measures and should not be construed as alternatives to net income or as an indicator of operating performance as determined in accordance with gaap we believe ffo affo and adjusted ebitda provide a meaningful perspective of the underlying operating performance of our business 

ffo is a nongaap financial measure that is considered a supplemental measure for the real estate industry and a supplement to gaap measures consistent with the definition used by the national association of real estate investment trusts “nareit” we define ffo as net income or loss computed in accordance with gaap excluding gains or losses from sales of property plus real estate depreciation affo is a nongaap measure that is used as a supplemental operating measure specifically for comparing year over year ability to fund dividend distribution from operating activities affo is used by us as a basis to address our ability to fund our dividend payments we calculate affo by adding or subtracting from ffo direct financing lease adjustments transaction costs incurred in connection with the acquisition of real estate investments noncash stockbased compensation expense amortization of debt issuance costs and original issue discount noncash interest expense nonreal estate depreciation which is comprised of the depreciation related to our golf course operations impairment charges on nonreal estate assets amortization of capitalized leasing costs and debt extinguishment gains and losses we define adjusted ebitda as net income as adjusted for gains or losses from sales of property real estate depreciation direct financing lease adjustments transaction costs incurred in connection with the acquisition of real estate investments noncash stockbased compensation expense amortization of debt issuance costs and original issue discount other noncash interest expense nonreal estate depreciation which is comprised of the depreciation related to our golf course operations impairment charges on nonreal estate assets amortization of capitalized leasing costs debt extinguishment gains and losses provision for income taxes and interest expense net 

because not all companies calculate ffo affo and adjusted ebitda in the same way we do and other companies may not perform such calculations those measures as used by other companies may not be consistent with the way we calculate such measures and should not be considered as alternative measures of operating income or net income our presentation of these measures does not replace the presentation of our financial results in accordance with gaap

capital expenditures 

as described in our leases capital expenditures for properties under the formation lease agreements and the hlv lease are the responsibility of the tenants minimum capital expenditure spending requirements of the tenants are described in “overview of our lease agreements ” of item 1  business 

inflation 

our leases provide for certain increases in rent as a result of a fixed annual rent escalator or changes in the consumer price index as further described in “overview of our lease agreements ” of item 1  business inflation may cause the rent provisions to result in rent increases over time however we could be negatively affected if increases in rent are not sufficient to cover increases in our operating expenses due to inflation in addition inflation and increased cost may have an adverse impact on our tenants if increases in their operating expenses exceed increases in revenue due to inflation 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

as of december 31 2017 and as of the date this report was filed we do not have any offbalance sheet arrangements 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap we have identified certain accounting policies that we believe are the most critical to the presentation of our financial information over a period of time these accounting policies may require our management to take decisions on subjective andor complex matters relating to reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue costs expenses and related disclosures these would further lead us to estimate the effect of matters that may inherently be uncertain 

estimates are required in order to prepare the financial statements in conformity with us gaap 

significant estimates judgments and assumptions are required in a number of areas including but not limited to the application of fresh start reporting determining the useful lives of real estate properties and evaluating the impairment of longlived assets and allocation of costs and deferred income taxes the judgment on such estimates and underlying assumptions is based on our historical experience that we believe is reasonable under the circumstances these form the basis of our judgment on matters that may not be apparent from other available sources of information in many instances changes in the accounting estimates are likely to occur from period to period actual results may differ from the estimates we believe the current assumptions and other considerations used to estimate amounts reflected in our financial statements are appropriate however if actual experience differs 

from the assumptions and other considerations used in estimating amounts reflected in our financial statements the resulting changes could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and in certain situations could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 

revenue recognition 

leases 

as a reit the majority of our revenues are derived from rent received from our tenants under longterm triplenet leases the accounting guidance under financial accounting standards board “fasb” accounting standards codification “asc” 840 “leases” “asc 840” is complex and requires the use of judgments and assumptions by management to determine the proper accounting treatment of a lease we perform a lease classification upon lease inception to determine if we will account for the lease as a capital or operating lease under asc 840 for leases of both building and land if the fair value of the land is 25 percent or more of the total fair value of the leased property at lease inception we consider the land and building separately for lease classification in these cases if the building element of the lease meets the criteria to be classified as a capital lease then we account for the building element as a capital lease and the land separately as an operating lease if the building element does not meet the criteria to be classified as a capital lease then we account for the building and land elements as a single operating lease to determine 

if the building portion of a lease triggers capital lease treatment we conduct the four lease tests in asc 840 outlined below if a lease meets any of the four criteria below it is accounted for as a capital lease 

1 transfer of ownership  the lease transfers ownership of the property to the lessee by the end of the lease term this criterion is met in situations in which the lease agreement provides for the transfer of title at or shortly after the end of the lease term in exchange for the payment of a nominal fee for example the minimum required by statutory regulation to transfer title 

2 bargain purchase option  the lease contains a bargain purchase option which is a provision allowing the lessee at its option to purchase the leased property for a price which is sufficiently lower than the expected fair value of the property at the date the option becomes exercisable in addition the exercise of the option must be reasonably assured at lease inception 

3  lease term  the lease term is equal to 75 or more of the estimated economic life of the leased property however if the beginning of the lease term falls within the last 25 percent of the total estimated economic life of the leased property including earlier years of use this criterion shall not be used for purposes of classifying the lease this test is conducted on a property by property basis 

4 minimum lease payments  the present value of the minimum lease payments at the beginning of the lease term excluding that portion of the payments representing executory costs such as insurance maintenance and taxes to be paid by the lessor including any profit thereon equals or exceeds 90 of the fair value of the leased property to the lessor at lease inception less any related investment tax credit retained by the lessor and expected to be realized by the lessor if the beginning of the lease term falls within the last 25 of the total estimated economic life of the leased property including earlier years of use this criterion shall not be used for purposes of classifying the lease 

the tests outlined above as well as the resulting calculations require subjective judgments such as determining at lease inception the fair value of the assets the residual value of the assets at the end of the lease term the likelihood a tenant will exercise all renewal options in order to determine the lease term the estimated remaining economic life of the leased assets the incremental borrowing rate of the lessee and the interest rate implicit in the lease a change in estimate or judgment can result in a materially different financial statement presentation 

the revenue recognition model is different under capital leases and operating leases 

under the operating lease model as the lessor at lease inception the land is recorded as real estate investments accounted for using the operating method in our balance sheet and we record rental income from operating leases on a straightline basis over the lease term the amount of annual minimum lease payments attributable to the land element after deducting executory costs including any profit thereon is determined by applying our incremental borrowing rate to the value of the land we record this lease income as rental income from operating leases in our statement of operations 

under the direct financing lease model as lessor at lease inception we record the lease receivable as investment in direct financing leases net in our balance sheet under the direct financing lease method we recognize fixed amounts due on an effective interest basis at a constant rate of return over the lease term as a result the cash payments accounted for under direct financing leases 

will not equal the earned income from direct financing leases as a portion of the cash rent we receive is recorded as earned income from direct financing leases in our statement of operations and a portion is recorded as a reduction to investment in direct financing leases net 

investment in direct financing leases net and real estate investments 

for real estate investments accounted for using the operating method we continually monitor events and circumstances that could indicate that the carrying amount of our real estate investments may not be recoverable or realized when events or changes in circumstances indicate that a potential impairment has occurred or that the carrying value of a real estate investment may not be recoverable we use an estimate of the undiscounted value of expected future operating cash flows to determine whether the real estate investment is impaired if the undiscounted cash flows plus net proceeds expected from the disposition of the asset is less than the carrying value of the assets we recognize an impairment charge equivalent to the amount required to reduce the carrying 

value of the asset to its estimated fair value we group our real estate investments together by property the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are available in evaluating impairment in assessing the recoverability of the carrying value we must make assumptions regarding future cash flows and other factors factors considered in performing this assessment include current operating results market and other applicable trends and residual values as well as the effect of obsolescence demand competition and other factors if these estimates or the related assumptions change in the future we may be required to record an impairment loss 

our investment in direct financing leases net is evaluated for impairment as necessary if indicators of impairment are present to determine if there has been anotherthantemporary decline in the residual value of the property or a change in the lessee’s credit worthiness 

income taxes—reit qualification 

we intend to elect to be taxed and qualify as a reit for us federal income tax purposes commencing with our taxable year ended december 31 2017 and we intend to continue to be organized and to operate in a manner that will permit us to qualify as a reit beyond that taxable year end to qualify as a reit we must meet certain organizational and operational requirements including a requirement to distribute at least 90 of our annual reit taxable income to stockholders with certain adjustments determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding any net capital gains as a reit we generally will not be subject to federal income tax on income that we pay as distributions to our stockholders if we fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year we will be subject to us federal income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate income tax rates and distributions paid to our stockholders would not be deductible by us in computing taxable income additionally any resulting corporate liability created if we fail to qualify as a reit could be substantial and could materially and adversely affect our net income and net cash available for distribution to stockholders unless we were entitled to relief under certain code provisions we also would be disqualified from reelecting to be taxed as a reit for the four taxable years following the year in which we failed to qualify to be taxed as a reit 

contractual obligations and commitments 

information concerning our obligations and commitments to make future payments under contracts such as our indebtedness and future minimum lease commitments under operating leases is included in the following table as of december 31 2017

5  estimated interest on variable interest loans are based on a libor rate of 150 

as discussed in note 17 — subsequent events the company utilized a portion of the proceeds from its initial public offering in february 2018 to a pay down 3000 million  of indebtedness outstanding under the revolving credit facility b redeem 2684 million  in aggregate principal amount of the second lien notes at a redemption price of 108  plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of the redemption and c repay 1000 million  of the term loan b facility 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we face market risk exposure in the form of interest rate risk this market risk arises from our debt obligations our primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk with respect to our indebtedness 

at december 31 2017 we had 48169 million aggregate principal amount of outstanding indebtedness approximately 25000 million of our indebtedness has variable interest rates a one percent increase or decrease in the annual interest rate on our variable rate borrowings of 25000 million would increase or decrease our annual cash interest expense by approximately 250 million 

we may manage or hedge interest rate risks related to our borrowings by means of interest rate swap agreements we also expect to manage our exposure to interest rate risk by maintaining a mix of fixed and variable rates for our indebtedness however the reit provisions of the code substantially limit our ability to hedge our assets and liabilities
