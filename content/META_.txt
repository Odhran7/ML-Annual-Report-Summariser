our product development philosophy centers on continuous innovation in creating and improving products that are social by design which means that our products are designed to place people and their social interactions at the core of the product experience as our user base grows as engagement with products like video and vr increases and as we deepen our investment in new technologies like artificial intelligence our computing needs continue to expand we make significant investments in technology both to improve our existing products and services and to develop new ones as well as for our marketers and developers we are also investing in protecting the security privacy and integrity of our platform by investing in both people and technology to strengthen our systems against abuse 

sales and operations 

the majority of our marketers use our selfservice ad platform to launch and manage their advertising campaigns we also have a global sales force that is focused on attracting and retaining advertisers and providing support to them throughout the stages of the marketing cycle from prepurchase decisionmaking to realtime optimizations to postcampaign analytics we work directly with these advertisers as well as through advertising agencies and resellers we operate in more than 80 cities around the globe the majority of which have a sales presence we also invest in and rely on selfservice tools to provide direct customer support to our users and partners 

marketing 

historically our communities have generally grown organically with people inviting their friends to connect with them supported by internal efforts to stimulate awareness and interest in addition we have invested and will continue to invest in marketing our products and services to grow our brand and help build community around the world 

intellectual property 

to establish and protect our proprietary rights we rely on a combination of patents trademarks copyrights trade secrets including knowhow license agreements confidentiality procedures nondisclosure agreements with third parties employee disclosure and invention assignment agreements and other contractual rights in addition to further protect our proprietary rights from time to time we have purchased patents and patent applications from third parties we do not believe that our proprietary technology is dependent on any single patent or copyright or groups of related patents or copyrights we believe the duration of our patents is adequate relative to the expected lives of our products 

government regulation 

we are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the united states and abroad that involve matters central to our business many of which are still evolving and being tested in courts and could be interpreted in ways that could harm our business these laws and regulations involve matters including privacy data use data protection and personal information biometrics encryption rights of publicity content intellectual property advertising marketing distribution data security data retention and deletion data localization and storage data disclosure artificial intelligence electronic contracts and other communications competition protection of minors consumer protection civil rights telecommunications product liability ecommerce taxation economic or other trade controls including sanctions anticorruption and political law compliance securities law compliance and online payment services in particular we are subject to federal state and foreign laws regarding privacy and protection of peoples data foreign data protection privacy content competition consumer protection and other laws and regulations can impose different obligations or penalties or fines for noncompliance or be more restrictive than those in the united states 

these us federal and state and foreign laws and regulations which in some cases can be enforced by private parties in addition to government entities are constantly evolving and can be subject to significant change as a result the application interpretation and enforcement of these laws and regulations are often uncertain particularly in the new and rapidly evolving industry in which we operate and may be interpreted and applied inconsistently from country to country and inconsistently with our current policies and practices for example regulatory or legislative actions affecting the manner in which we display content to our users or obtain consent to various practices or otherwise relating to content that is made available on our products could adversely affect our financial results in the united states there have been and continue to be various efforts to remove or restrict the scope of the protections available to online platforms under section 230 of the communications decency act and any such changes may increase our costs or require significant changes to our products business practices or operations which could adversely affect our business and financial results 

we are also subject to evolving laws and regulations that dictate whether how and under what circumstances we can transfer process andor receive certain data that is critical to our operations including data shared between countries or regions in which we operate and data shared among our products and services if we are unable to transfer data between and among countries and regions in which we operate or if we are restricted from sharing data among our products and services it could affect our ability to provide our services the manner in which we provide our services or our ability to target ads which could adversely affect our financial results for example the privacy shield a transfer framework we relied upon for data transferred from the european union to the united states was invalidated in july 2020 by the court of justice of the european union cjeu in addition the other bases upon which meta relies to transfer such data such as standard contractual clauses sccs have been subjected to regulatory and judicial scrutiny in august 2020 we received a preliminary draft decision from the irish data protection commission idpc that preliminarily concluded that meta platforms irelands reliance on sccs in respect of european user data does not achieve compliance with the general data protection regulation gdpr and preliminarily proposed that such transfers of user data from the european union to the united states should therefore be suspended we believe a final decision in this inquiry may issue as early as the first half of 2022 if a new transatlantic data transfer framework is not adopted and we are unable to continue to rely on sccs or rely upon other alternative means of data transfers from europe to the united states we will likely be unable to offer a number of our most significant products and services including facebook and instagram in europe which would materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

we have been subject to other significant legislative and regulatory developments in the past and proposed or new legislation and regulations could significantly affect our business for example the gdpr includes operational requirements for companies that receive or process personal data of residents of the european union that are different from those previously in place in the european union requires submission of personal data breach notifications to our lead european union privacy regulator the idpc and includes significant penalties for noncompliance with the notification obligation as well as other requirements of the regulation the gdpr is still a relatively new law its interpretation is still evolving and draft decisions in investigations by the idpc are subject to review by other european privacy regulators as part of the gdprs consistency mechanism which may lead to significant changes in the final outcome of such investigations as a result the interpretation and enforcement of the gdpr as well as the imposition and amount of penalties for noncompliance are subject to significant uncertainty in addition brazil the united kingdom and other countries have enacted similar data protection regulations imposing data privacyrelated requirements on products and services offered to users in their respective jurisdictions the california consumer privacy act which took effect in january 2020 and its successor the california privacy rights act which will take effect in january 2023 also establish certain transparency rules and create new data privacy rights for users in addition effective december 2020 the european unions eprivacy directive includes additional limitations on the use of data across messaging products and includes significant penalties for noncompliance changes to our products or business practices as a result of these or similar developments may adversely affect our advertising business similarly there are a number of legislative proposals in the european union the united states at both the federal and state level as well as other jurisdictions that could impose new obligations or limitations in areas affecting our business for example the proposed digital markets act in the european union and pending proposals to modify competition laws in the united states and other jurisdictions could cause us to incur significant compliance costs and could potentially impose new restrictions and requirements on companies like ours including in areas such as the combination of data across services mergers and acquisitions and product design in addition some countries such as india are considering or have passed legislation implementing data protection requirements or requiring local storage and processing of data or similar requirements that could increase the cost and complexity of delivering our services new legislation or regulatory decisions that restrict our ability to collect and use information about minors may also result in limitations on our advertising services or our ability to offer products and services to minors in certain jurisdictions 

we are and expect to continue to be the subject of investigations inquiries data requests requests for information actions and audits by government authorities and regulators in the united states europe and around the world particularly in the areas of privacy data protection law enforcement consumer protection civil rights content moderation and competition as we continue to grow and expand our operations we are also currently and may in the future be subject to regulatory orders or consent decrees including the modified consent order we entered into with the us federal trade commission ftc which took effect in april 2020 and among other matters requires us to maintain a comprehensive privacy program orders issued by or inquiries or enforcement actions initiated by government or regulatory authorities could cause us to incur substantial costs expose us to unanticipated civil and criminal liability or penalties including substantial monetary remedies interrupt or require us to change our business practices in a manner materially adverse to our business result in negative publicity and reputational harm divert resources and the time and attention of management from our business or subject us to other structural or behavioral remedies that adversely affect our business

risks related to our product offerings 

if we fail to retain existing users or add new users or if our users decrease their level of engagement with our products our revenue financial results and business may be significantly harmed 

the size of our user base and our users level of engagement across our products are critical to our success our financial performance has been and will continue to be significantly determined by our success in adding retaining and engaging active users of our products that deliver ad impressions particularly for facebook and instagram we anticipate that our active user growth rate will continue to generally decline over time as the size of our active user base increases in addition we have experienced and expect to continue to experience fluctuations and declines in the size of our active user base in one or more markets from time to time particularly in markets where we have achieved higher penetration rates user growth and engagement are also impacted by a number of other factors including competitive products and services such as tiktok that have reduced some users engagement with our products and services as well as global and regional business and macroeconomic conditions for example beginning in the first quarter of 2020 we experienced significant increases in the size and engagement of our active user base across a number of regions as a result of the covid19 pandemic more recently we have seen these pandemicrelated trends subside we are unable to predict the impact of the pandemic on user growth and engagement with any certainty and these trends may continue to be subject to volatility in the fourth quarter of 2021 we experienced a slight decline on a quarteroverquarter basis in the total number of daus on facebook as well as a slight decline on a quarteroverquarter basis in the number of daus on facebook in the united states  canada region any future declines in the size of our active user base may adversely impact our ability to deliver ad impressions and in turn our financial performance 

if people do not perceive our products to be useful reliable and trustworthy we may not be able to attract or retain users or otherwise maintain or increase the frequency and duration of their engagement a number of other social networking companies that achieved early popularity have since seen their active user bases or levels of engagement decline in some cases precipitously there is no guarantee that we will not experience a similar erosion of our active user base or engagement levels our user engagement patterns have changed over time and user engagement can be difficult to measure particularly as we introduce new and different products and services any number of factors can negatively affect user retention growth and engagement including if 

• users increasingly engage with other competitive products or services 

• we fail to introduce new features products or services that users find engaging or if we introduce new products or services or make changes to existing products and services that are not favorably received 

• users feel that their experience is diminished as a result of the decisions we make with respect to the frequency 

prominence format size and quality of ads that we display 

• users have difficulty installing updating or otherwise accessing our products on mobile devices as a result of actions by us or third parties that we rely on to distribute our products and deliver our services 

• user behavior on any of our products changes including decreases in the quality and frequency of content shared on our products and services 

• we are unable to continue to develop products for mobile devices that users find engaging that work with a variety of mobile operating systems and networks and that achieve a high level of market acceptance 

• there are decreases in user sentiment due to questions about the quality or usefulness of our products or our user data practices concerns about the nature of content made available on our products or concerns related to privacy safety security wellbeing or other factors 

• we are unable to manage and prioritize information to ensure users are presented with content that is appropriate interesting useful and relevant to them 

• we are unable to obtain or attract engaging thirdparty content 

• we are unable to successfully maintain or grow usage of and engagement with mobile and web applications that integrate with our products 

• users adopt new technologies where our products may be displaced in favor of other products or services or may not be featured or otherwise available 

• there are changes mandated by legislation government and regulatory authorities or litigation that adversely affect our products or users 

• we are unable to offer a number of our most significant products and services including facebook and instagram in europe or are otherwise limited in our business operations as a result of european regulators courts or legislative bodies determining that our reliance on standard contractual clauses sccs or other legal bases we rely upon to transfer user data from the european union to the united states is invalid 

• there is decreased engagement with our products or failure to accept our terms of service as part of privacyfocused changes that we have implemented or may implement in the future whether voluntarily in connection with the general data protection regulation gdpr the european unions eprivacy directive the california consumer privacy act ccpa or other laws regulations or regulatory actions or otherwise 

• technical or other problems prevent us from delivering our products in a rapid and reliable manner or otherwise affect the user experience such as security breaches or failure to prevent or limit spam or similar content 

• we adopt terms policies or procedures related to areas such as sharing content user data or advertising or we take or fail to take actions to enforce our policies that are perceived negatively by our users or the general public including as a result of decisions or recommendations from the independent oversight board regarding content on our platform 

• we elect to focus our product decisions on longerterm initiatives that do not prioritize nearterm user growth and engagement for example we have announced plans to focus product decisions on optimizing the young adult experience in the long term 

• we make changes in how we promote different products and services across our family of products 

• initiatives designed to attract and retain users and engagement are unsuccessful or discontinued whether as a result of actions by us third parties or otherwise 

• thirdparty initiatives that may enable greater use of our products including lowcost or discounted data plans are scaled back or discontinued or the pricing of data plans otherwise increases 

• there is decreased engagement with our products as a result of taxes imposed on the use of social media or other mobile applications in certain countries internet shutdowns or other actions by governments that affect the accessibility of our products in their countries 

• we fail to provide adequate customer service to users marketers developers or other partners 

• we developers whose products are integrated with our products or other partners and companies in our industry are the subject of adverse media reports or other negative publicity including as a result of our or their user data practices or 

• our current or future products such as our development tools and application programming interfaces that enable developers to build grow and monetize mobile and web applications reduce user activity on our products by making it easier for our users to interact and share on thirdparty mobile and web applications 

from time to time certain of these factors have negatively affected user retention growth and engagement to varying degrees if we are unable to maintain or increase our user base and user engagement particularly for our significant revenuegenerating products like facebook and instagram our revenue and financial results may be adversely affected any significant decrease in user retention growth or engagement could render our products less attractive to users marketers and developers which is likely to have a material and adverse impact on our ability to deliver ad impressions and accordingly our revenue business financial condition and results of operations as our active user growth rate continues to slow we will become increasingly dependent on our ability to maintain or increase levels of user engagement and monetization in order to drive revenue growth 

we generate substantially all of our revenue from advertising the loss of marketers or reduction in spending by marketers could seriously harm our business 

substantially all of our revenue is currently generated from third parties advertising on facebook and instagram as is common in the industry our marketers do not have longterm advertising commitments with us many of our marketers spend only a relatively small portion of their overall advertising budget with us marketers will not continue to do business with us or they will reduce the budgets they are willing to commit to us if we do not deliver ads in an effective manner if they do not believe that their investment in advertising with us will generate a competitive return relative to other alternatives or if they are not satisfied for any other reason we have implemented and we will continue to implement changes to our user data practices some of these changes reduce our ability to effectively target ads which has to some extent adversely affected and will continue to adversely affect our advertising business if we are unable to provide marketers with a suitable return on investment the pricing of our ads may not increase or may decline in which case our revenue and financial results may be harmed 

our advertising revenue can also be adversely affected by a number of other factors including 

• decreases in user engagement including time spent on our products 

• our inability to continue to increase user access to and engagement with our products 

• product changes or inventory management decisions we may make that change the size format frequency or relative prominence of ads displayed on our products or of other unpaid content shared by marketers on our products 

• our inability to maintain or increase marketer demand the pricing of our ads or both 

• our inability to maintain or increase the quantity or quality of ads shown to users 

• changes to thirdparty policies that limit our ability to deliver target or measure the effectiveness of advertising including changes by mobile operating system and browser providers such as apple and google 

• adverse government actions or legislative regulatory or other legal developments relating to advertising including developments that may impact our ability to deliver target or measure the effectiveness of advertising 

• user behavior or product changes that may reduce traffic to features or products that we successfully monetize such as our feed and stories products including as a result of increased usage of our reels or other video or messaging products 

• reductions of advertising by marketers due to our efforts to implement or enforce advertising policies that protect the security and integrity of our platform 

• the availability accuracy utility and security of analytics and measurement solutions offered by us or third parties that demonstrate the value of our ads to marketers or our ability to further improve such tools 

• loss of advertising market share to our competitors including if prices to purchase our ads increase or if competitors offer lower priced more integrated or otherwise more effective products 

• limitations on our ability to offer a number of our most significant products and services including facebook and instagram in europe as a result of european regulators courts or legislative bodies determining that our reliance on sccs or other legal bases we rely upon to transfer user data from the european union to the united states is invalid 

• changes in our marketing and sales or other operations that we are required to or elect to make as a result of risks related to complying with foreign laws or regulatory requirements or other government actions 

• decisions by marketers to reduce their advertising as a result of announcements by us or adverse media reports or other negative publicity involving us our user data practices our advertising metrics or tools content on our products our interpretation implementation or enforcement of policies relating to content on our products including as a result of decisions or recommendations from the independent oversight board developers with mobile and web applications that are integrated with our products or other companies in our industry 

• reductions of advertising by marketers due to objectionable content made available on our products by third parties questions about our user data practices or the security of our platform concerns about brand safety or potential legal liability or uncertainty regarding their own legal and compliance obligations for example a number of marketers announced that they paused advertising with us in july 2020 due to concerns about content on our products 

• the effectiveness of our ad targeting or degree to which users opt in or out of the use of data for ads including as a result of product changes and controls that we have implemented or may implement in the future in connection with the gdpr eprivacy directive california consumer privacy act ccpa other laws regulations regulatory actions or litigation or otherwise that impact our ability to use data for advertising purposes 

• the degree to which users cease or reduce the number of times they engage with our ads 

• changes in the way advertising on mobile devices or on personal computers is measured or priced 

• the success of technologies designed to block the display of ads or ad measurement tools 

• changes in the composition of our marketer base or our inability to maintain or grow our marketer base and 

• the impact of macroeconomic and geopolitical conditions whether in the advertising industry in general or among specific types of marketers or within particular geographies 

from time to time certain of these factors have adversely affected our advertising revenue to varying degrees the occurrence of any of these or other factors in the future could result in a reduction in demand for our ads which may reduce the prices we receive for our ads or cause marketers to stop advertising with us altogether either of which would negatively affect our revenue and financial results for example macroeconomic conditions have affected and may in the future affect marketers ability or willingness to spend with us as we experienced in 2020 with the regional and worldwide economic 

disruption related to the covid19 pandemic and associated declines in advertising activity on our products the effects of the pandemic previously resulted in reduced demand for our ads a related decline in pricing of our ads and additional demands on our technical infrastructure as a result of increased usage of our services and any similar occurrences in the future may impair our ability to maintain or increase the quantity or quality of ads shown to users and adversely affect our revenue and financial results 

our advertising revenue is dependent on targeting and measurement tools that incorporate data signals from user activity on websites and services that we do not control and changes to the regulatory environment thirdparty mobile operating systems and browsers and our own products have impacted and we expect will continue to impact the availability of such signals which will adversely affect our advertising revenue 

we rely on data signals from user activity on websites and services that we do not control in order to deliver relevant and effective ads to our users our advertising revenue is dependent on targeting and measurement tools that incorporate these signals and any changes in our ability to use such signals will adversely affect our business for example legislative and regulatory developments such as the gdpr eprivacy directive and ccpa have impacted and we expect will continue to impact our ability to use such signals in our ad products in particular we have seen an increasing number of users opt to control certain types of ad targeting in europe following adoption of the gdpr which will increase further with expanded control over certain thirdparty data as part of our eprivacy directive compliance and we have introduced product changes that limit data signal use for certain users in california following adoption of the ccpa regulatory guidance or decisions or new legislation in these or other jurisdictions may require us to make additional changes to our products in the future that further reduce our ability to use these signals in addition mobile operating system and browser providers such as apple and google have implemented product changes andor announced future plans to limit the ability of websites and application developers to collect and use these signals to target and measure advertising for example in 2021 apple made certain changes to its products and data use policies in connection with changes to its ios operating system that reduce our and other ios developers ability to target and measure advertising which has negatively impacted and we expect will continue to negatively impact the size of the budgets marketers are willing to commit to us and other advertising platforms in addition we have implemented and may continue to implement product changes that give users the ability to limit our use of such data signals to improve ads and other experiences on our products and services including our offfacebook activity tool and our worldwide offering of certain product changes we implemented in connection with the gdpr these developments have limited our ability to target and measure the effectiveness of ads on our platform and negatively impacted our advertising revenue for example our advertising revenue in the second half of 2021 was negatively impacted by marketer reaction to targeting and measurement challenges associated with ios changes if we are unable to mitigate these developments as they take further effect in the future our targeting and measurement capabilities will be materially and adversely affected which would in turn significantly impact our future advertising revenue growth 

our user growth engagement and monetization on mobile devices depend upon effective operation with mobile operating systems networks technologies products and standards that we do not control 

the substantial majority of our revenue is generated from advertising on mobile devices there is no guarantee that popular mobile devices will continue to feature our products or that mobile device users will continue to use our products rather than competing products we are dependent on the interoperability of our products with popular mobile operating systems networks technologies products and standards that we do not control such as the android and ios operating systems and mobile browsers any changes bugs or technical issues in such systems or changes in our relationships with mobile operating system partners handset manufacturers browser developers or mobile carriers or in their terms of service or policies that degrade our products functionality reduce or eliminate our ability to update or distribute our products give preferential treatment to competitive products limit our ability to deliver target or measure the effectiveness of ads or charge fees related to the distribution of our products or our delivery of ads could adversely affect the usage of our products and monetization on mobile devices for example apple previously released an update to its safari browser that limits the use of thirdparty cookies which reduces our ability to provide the most relevant ads to our users and impacts monetization and also released changes to ios that limit our ability to target and measure ads effectively we expect that any similar changes to its googles or other browser or mobile platforms will further limit our ability to target and measure the effectiveness of ads and impact monetization additionally in order to deliver high quality mobile products it is important that our products work well with a range of mobile technologies products systems networks and standards that we do not control and that we have good relationships with handset manufacturers mobile carriers and browser developers we may not be successful in maintaining or developing relationships with key participants in the mobile ecosystem or in developing products that operate effectively with these technologies products systems networks or standards in the event that it is 

more difficult for our users to access and use our products on their mobile devices or if our users choose not to access or use our products on their mobile devices or use mobile products that do not offer access to our products our user growth and user engagement could be harmed from time to time we may also take actions regarding the distribution of our products or the operation of our business based on what we believe to be in our longterm best interests such actions may adversely affect our users and our relationships with the operators of mobile operating systems handset manufacturers mobile carriers browser developers other business partners or advertisers and there is no assurance that these actions will result in the anticipated longterm benefits in the event that our users are adversely affected by these actions or if our relationships with such third parties deteriorate our user growth engagement and monetization could be adversely affected and our business could be harmed we have in the past experienced challenges in operating with mobile operating systems networks technologies products and standards that we do not control and any such occurrences in the future may negatively impact our user growth engagement and monetization on mobile devices which may in turn materially and adversely affect our business and financial results 

our new products and changes to existing products could fail to attract or retain users or generate revenue and profits 

our ability to retain increase and engage our user base and to increase our revenue depends heavily on our ability to continue to evolve our existing products and to create successful new products both independently and in conjunction with developers or other third parties we may introduce significant changes to our existing products or acquire or introduce new and unproven products including using technologies with which we have little or no prior development or operating experience for example we do not have significant experience with consumer hardware products or virtual or augmented reality technology which may adversely affect our ability to successfully develop and market these products and technologies we continue to incur substantial costs and we may not be successful in generating profits in connection with these efforts in addition the introduction of new products or changes to existing products may result in new or enhanced governmental or regulatory scrutiny litigation or other complications that could adversely affect our business and financial results we have also invested and expect to continue to invest significant resources in growing our whatsapp and messenger products to support increasing usage of such products we have historically monetized messaging in only a limited fashion and we may not be successful in our efforts to generate meaningful revenue or profits from messaging over the long term in addition we are moving forward with plans to implement endtoend encryption across our messaging services as well as facilitate crossapp communication between these platforms which plans have drawn governmental and regulatory scrutiny in multiple jurisdictions if our new or enhanced products fail to engage users marketers or developers or if our business plans are unsuccessful we may fail to attract or retain users or to generate sufficient revenue operating margin or other value to justify our investments and our business may be adversely affected 

we make product and investment decisions that may not prioritize shortterm financial results and may not produce the longterm benefits that we expect 

we frequently make product and investment decisions that may not prioritize shortterm financial results if we believe that the decisions are consistent with our mission and benefit the aggregate user experience and will thereby improve our financial performance over the long term for example we have implemented and we will continue to implement changes to our user data practices some of these changes reduce our ability to effectively target ads which has to some extent adversely affected and will continue to adversely affect our advertising business for example our offfacebook activity tool enables users to place limits on our storage and use of information about their interactions with advertisers apps and websites which reduces our ability to deliver the most relevant and effective ads to our users similarly from time to time we update our news feed ranking algorithm to optimize the user experience and these changes have had and may in the future have the effect of reducing time spent and some measures of user engagement with facebook which could adversely affect our financial results from time to time we also change the size frequency or relative prominence of ads as part of our product and monetization strategies in addition we have made and we expect to continue to make other changes to our products which may adversely affect the distribution of content of publishers marketers and developers and could reduce their incentive to invest in their efforts on our products we also may introduce new features or other changes to existing products or introduce new standalone products that attract users away from properties formats or use cases where we have more proven means of monetization such as our feed products in addition as we focus on growing users and engagement across our family of products from time to time these efforts have reduced and may in the future reduce engagement with one or more products and services in favor of other products or services that we monetize less successfully or that are not growing as quickly for example we plan to continue to promote reels which we do not currently monetize at the same rate as our feed or stories products these decisions may adversely affect our business and results of operations and may not produce the longterm benefits that we expect 

we may not be successful in our metaverse strategy and investments which could adversely affect our business reputation or financial results 

we believe the metaverse an embodied internet where people have immersive experiences beyond twodimensional screens is the next evolution in social technology in 2021 we announced a shift in our business and product strategy to focus on helping to bring the metaverse to life we expect this will be a complex evolving and longterm initiative that will involve the development of new and emerging technologies continued investment in privacy safety and security efforts and collaboration with other companies developers partners and other participants however the metaverse may not develop in accordance with our expectations and market acceptance of features products or services we build for the metaverse is uncertain in addition we have limited experience with consumer hardware products and virtual and augmented reality technology which may enable other companies to compete more effectively than us we may be unsuccessful in our research and product development efforts including if we are unable to develop relationships with key participants in the metaverse or develop products that operate effectively with metaverse technologies products systems networks or standards our metaverse efforts may also divert resources and management attention from other areas of our business we expect to continue to make significant investments in virtual and augmented reality and other technologies to support these efforts and our ability to support these efforts is dependent on generating sufficient profits from other areas of our business in addition as our metaverse efforts evolve we may be subject to a variety of existing or new laws and regulations in the united states and international jurisdictions including in the areas of privacy and ecommerce which may delay or impede the development of our products and services increase our operating costs require significant management time and attention or otherwise harm our business as a result of these or other factors our metaverse strategy and investments may not be successful in the foreseeable future or at all which could adversely affect our business reputation or financial results 

if we are not able to maintain and enhance our brands our ability to expand our base of users marketers and developers may be impaired and our business and financial results may be harmed 

we believe that our brands have significantly contributed to the success of our business we also believe that maintaining and enhancing our brands is critical to expanding our base of users marketers and developers many of our new users are referred by existing users maintaining and enhancing our brands will depend largely on our ability to continue to provide useful reliable trustworthy and innovative products which we may not do successfully we may introduce new products or terms of service or policies that users do not like which may negatively affect our brands additionally the actions of our developers or advertisers may affect our brands if users do not have a positive experience using thirdparty mobile and web applications integrated with our products or interacting with parties that advertise through our products we will also continue to experience media legislative or regulatory scrutiny of our actions or decisions regarding user privacy data use encryption content product design algorithms advertising competition and other issues including actions or decisions in connection with elections or the covid19 pandemic which has in the past adversely affected and may in the future adversely affect our reputation and brands for example beginning in september 2021 we became the subject of media legislative and regulatory scrutiny as a result of a former employees allegations and release of internal company documents relating to among other things our algorithms advertising and user metrics and content enforcement practices as well as misinformation and other undesirable activity on our platform and user wellbeing in addition in march 2018 we announced developments regarding the misuse of certain data by a developer that shared such data with third parties in violation of our terms and policies we also may fail to respond expeditiously or appropriately to the sharing of objectionable content on our services or objectionable practices by advertisers or developers or to otherwise enforce our policies or address user concerns which has occurred in the past and which could erode confidence in our brands our brands may also be negatively affected by the actions of users that are deemed to be hostile or inappropriate to other users by the actions of users acting under false or inauthentic identities by the use of our products or services to disseminate information that is deemed to be misleading or intended to manipulate opinions by perceived or actual efforts by governments to obtain access to user information for securityrelated purposes or to censor certain content on our platform by the use of our products or services for illicit or objectionable ends including for example any such actions around the pandemic or elections in the united states and around the world by decisions or recommendations regarding content on our platform from the independent oversight board by research or media reports concerning the perceived or actual impacts of our products or services on user wellbeing or by our decisions to remove content or suspend participation on our platform by persons who violate our community standards or terms of service maintaining and enhancing our brands will require us to make substantial investments and these investments may not be successful certain of our actions such as the foregoing matter regarding developer misuse of data and concerns around our handling of political speech and advertising hate speech and other content as well as user wellbeing issues have eroded confidence in our brands and may continue to do so in the future if we 

fail to successfully promote and maintain our brands or if we incur excessive expenses in this effort our business and financial results may be adversely affected 

we may not be able to continue to successfully maintain or grow usage of and engagement with mobile and web applications that integrate with facebook and our other products 

we have made and are continuing to make investments to enable developers to build grow and monetize mobile and web applications that integrate with facebook and our other products such existing and prospective developers may not be successful in building growing or monetizing mobile andor web applications that create and maintain user engagement additionally developers may choose to build on other platforms including mobile platforms controlled by third parties rather than building products that integrate with facebook and our other products we are continuously seeking to balance the distribution objectives of our developers with our desire to provide an optimal user experience and we may not be successful in achieving a balance that continues to attract and retain such developers for example from time to time we have taken actions to reduce the volume of communications from these developers to users on facebook and our other products with the objective of enhancing the user experience and such actions have reduced distribution from user engagement with and our monetization opportunities from mobile and web applications integrated with our products in addition as part of our efforts related to privacy safety and security we conduct investigations and audits of platform applications from time to time and we also have announced several product changes that restrict developer access to certain user data in some instances these actions as well as other actions to enforce our policies applicable to developers have adversely affected or will adversely affect our relationships with developers if we are not successful in our efforts to maintain or grow the number of developers that choose to build products that integrate with facebook and our other products or if we are unable to continue to build and maintain good relations with such developers our user growth and user engagement and our financial results may be adversely affected 

risks related to our business operations and financial results 

the covid19 pandemic has previously had and may in the future have a significant adverse impact on our advertising revenue and also exposes our business to other risks 

the covid19 pandemic has resulted in authorities implementing numerous preventative measures from time to time to contain or mitigate the outbreak of the virus such as travel bans and restrictions limitations on business activity quarantines and shelterinplace orders these measures have caused and are continuing to cause business slowdowns or shutdowns in certain affected countries and regions which have previously significantly impacted our business and results of operations for example in the second quarter of 2020 our advertising revenue grew 10 yearoveryear which was the slowest growth rate for any fiscal quarter since our initial public offering while our advertising revenue growth rate improved in subsequent quarters there can be no assurance that it will not decrease again as a result of the effects of the pandemic in addition we believe that the pandemic previously contributed to an acceleration in the growth of online commerce which in turn increased demand for our advertising services more recently we believe this growth has moderated in many regions and we may experience reduced advertising demand and related declines in pricing in future periods to the extent this trend continues which could adversely affect our advertising revenue growth the demand for and pricing of our advertising services may be materially and adversely impacted by the pandemic for the foreseeable future and we are unable to predict the duration or degree of such impact with any certainty in addition to the impact on our advertising business the pandemic exposes our business operations and workforce to a variety of other risks including 

• volatility in the size of our user base and user engagement particularly for our messaging products whether as a result of shelterinplace measures or other factors 

• delays in product development or releases or reductions in manufacturing production and sales of consumer hardware as a result of inventory shortages supply chain or labor shortages 

• increased misuse of our products and services or user data by third parties including improper advertising practices or other activity inconsistent with our terms contracts or policies misinformation or other illicit or objectionable material on our platforms election interference or other undesirable activity 

• adverse impacts to our efforts to combat misuse of our products and services and user data as a result of limitations on our safety security and content review efforts while our workforce is working remotely such as the necessity to rely more heavily on artificial intelligence to perform tasks that our workforce is unable to perform 

  

• significant volatility and disruption of global financial markets which could cause fluctuations in currency exchange rates or negatively impact our ability to access capital in the future 

• negative impact on our workforce productivity product development and research and development due to difficulties resulting from our personnel working remotely 

• illnesses to key employees or a significant portion of our workforce which may result in inefficiencies delays and disruptions in our business and 

• increased volatility and uncertainty in the financial projections we use as the basis for estimates used in our financial statements 

any of these developments may adversely affect our business harm our reputation or result in legal or regulatory actions against us the persistence of covid19 and the preventative measures implemented to help limit the spread of the illness have impacted and will continue to impact our ability to operate our business and may materially and adversely impact our business financial condition and results of operations 

our business is highly competitive competition presents an ongoing threat to the success of our business 

we compete with companies providing connection sharing discovery and communication products and services to users online as well as companies that sell advertising to businesses looking to reach consumers andor develop tools and systems for managing and optimizing advertising campaigns we face significant competition in every aspect of our business including but not limited to companies that facilitate the ability of users to share communicate and discover content and information online or enable marketers to reach their existing or prospective audiences including for example alphabet google and youtube amazon apple bytedance tiktok microsoft snap snapchat tencent wechat and twitter we compete to attract engage and retain people who use our products to attract and retain businesses that use our free or paid business and advertising services and to attract and retain developers who build compelling mobile and web applications that integrate with our products we also compete with companies that develop and deliver consumer hardware and virtual and augmented reality products and services as we introduce or acquire new products as our existing products evolve or as other companies introduce new products and services including as part of efforts to develop the metaverse we may become subject to additional competition 

some of our current and potential competitors may have greater resources experience or stronger competitive positions in certain product segments geographic regions or user demographics than we do for example some of our competitors may be domiciled in different countries and subject to political legal and regulatory regimes that enable them to compete more effectively than us these factors may allow our competitors to respond more effectively than us to new or emerging technologies and changes in market conditions we believe that some users particularly younger users are aware of and actively engaging with other products and services similar to or as a substitute for our products and services and we believe that some users have reduced their use of and engagement with our products and services in favor of these other products and services in the event that users increasingly engage with other products and services we may experience a decline in use and engagement in key user demographics or more broadly in which case our business would likely be harmed 

our competitors may develop products features or services that are similar to ours or that achieve greater acceptance may undertake more farreaching and successful product development efforts or marketing campaigns or may adopt more aggressive pricing policies some competitors may gain a competitive advantage against us in areas where we operate including by making acquisitions by limiting our ability to deliver target or measure the effectiveness of ads by imposing fees or other charges related to our delivery of ads by making access to our products more difficult or impossible by making it more difficult to communicate with our users or by integrating competing platforms applications or features into products they control such as mobile device operating systems search engines browsers or ecommerce platforms for example each of apple and google have integrated competitive products with ios and android respectively in addition apple has released changes to ios that limit our ability and the ability of others in the digital advertising industry to target and 

measure ads effectively as a result our competitors may and in some cases will acquire and engage users or generate advertising or other revenue at the expense of our own efforts which would negatively affect our business and financial results in addition from time to time we may take actions in response to competitive threats but we cannot assure you that these actions will be successful or that they will not negatively affect our business and financial results 

we believe that our ability to compete effectively depends upon many factors both within and beyond our control including 

• the popularity usefulness ease of use performance and reliability of our products compared to our competitors products 

• the size and composition of our user base 

• the engagement of users with our products and competing products 

• our ability to attract and retain businesses who use our free or paid business and advertising services 

• the timing and market acceptance of products including developments and enhancements to our or our competitors products 

• our safety and security efforts and our ability to protect user data and to provide users with control over their data 

• our ability to distribute our products to new and existing users 

• our ability to monetize our products 

• the frequency size format quality and relative prominence of the ads displayed by us or our competitors 

• customer service and support efforts 

• marketing and selling efforts including our ability to measure the effectiveness of our ads and to provide marketers with a compelling return on their investments 

• our ability to establish and maintain developers interest in building mobile and web applications that integrate with facebook and our other products 

• our ability to establish and maintain publisher interest in integrating their content with facebook and our other products 

• changes mandated by legislation regulatory authorities or litigation some of which may have a disproportionate effect on us 

• acquisitions or consolidation within our industry which may result in more formidable competitors 

• our ability to attract retain and motivate talented employees particularly software engineers designers and product managers 

• our ability to costeffectively manage and grow our operations and 

• our reputation and brand strength relative to those of our competitors 

if we are not able to compete effectively our user base level of user engagement and ability to deliver ad impressions may decrease we may become less attractive to developers and marketers and our revenue and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected 

unfavorable media coverage negatively affects our business from time to time 

we receive a high degree of media coverage around the world unfavorable publicity regarding for example our privacy practices advertising policies product changes product quality litigation or regulatory activity government surveillance the actions of our advertisers the actions of our developers whose products are integrated with our products the use of our products or services for illicit or objectionable ends the substance or enforcement of our community standards terms of service or other policies the actions of our users the quality and integrity of content shared on our platform the perceived or actual impacts of our products or services on user wellbeing or the actions of other companies that provide similar services to ours has in the past and could in the future adversely affect our reputation for example we have been the subject of significant media coverage involving concerns around our handling of political speech and advertising hate speech and other content as well as user wellbeing issues and we continue to receive negative publicity related to these topics beginning in september 2021 we became the subject of significant media coverage as a result of allegations and the release of internal company documents by a former employee in addition we have been and may in the future be subject to negative publicity in connection with our handling of misinformation and other illicit or objectionable use of our products or services including in connection with the covid19 pandemic and elections in the united states and around the world any such negative publicity could have an adverse effect on the size engagement and loyalty of our user base and marketer demand for advertising on our products which could result in decreased revenue and adversely affect our business and financial results and we have experienced such adverse effects to varying degrees from time to time 

our financial results will fluctuate from quarter to quarter and are difficult to predict 

our quarterly financial results have fluctuated in the past and will fluctuate in the future additionally we have a limited operating history with the current scale of our business which makes it difficult to forecast our future results as a result you should not rely upon our past quarterly financial results as indicators of future performance you should take into account the risks and uncertainties frequently encountered by companies in rapidly evolving markets our financial results in any given quarter can be influenced by numerous factors many of which we are unable to predict or are outside of our control including 

• our ability to maintain and grow our user base and user engagement particularly for our products that deliver ad impressions 

• our ability to attract and retain marketers in a particular period 

• our ability to recognize revenue or collect payments from marketers in a particular period including as a result of the effects of the covid19 pandemic 

• fluctuations in spending by our marketers due to seasonality such as historically strong spending in the fourth quarter of each year episodic regional or global events including the covid19 pandemic or other factors 

• the frequency prominence size format and quality of ads shown to users 

• the success of technologies designed to block the display of ads 

• changes to thirdparty policies that limit our ability to deliver target or measure the effectiveness of advertising including changes by mobile operating system and browser providers such as apple and google 

• the pricing of our ads and other products 

• the diversification and growth of revenue sources beyond advertising on facebook and instagram 

• our ability to generate revenue from payments or the sale of our consumer hardware products or other products we may introduce in the future 

• changes to existing products or services or the development and introduction of new products or services by us or our competitors 

• user behavior or product changes that may reduce traffic to features or products that we successfully monetize 

• increases in marketing sales and other operating expenses that we will incur to grow and expand our operations and to remain competitive including costs related to our data centers and technical infrastructure 

• costs related to our privacy safety security and content review efforts including as a result of implementing changes to our practices whether voluntarily in connection with laws regulations regulatory actions or decisions or recommendations from the independent oversight board or otherwise 

• costs and expenses related to the development manufacturing and delivery of our consumer hardware products 

• our ability to maintain gross margins and operating margins 

• costs related to acquisitions including costs associated with amortization and additional investments to develop the acquired technologies 

• charges associated with impairment of any assets on our balance sheet 

• our ability to obtain equipment components and labor for our data centers and other technical infrastructure in a timely and costeffective manner 

• system failures or outages or government blocking which could prevent us from serving ads for any period of time 

• breaches of security or privacy and the costs associated with any such breaches and remediation 

• changes in the manner in which we distribute our products or inaccessibility of our products due to thirdparty actions 

• fees paid to third parties for content or the distribution of our products 

• refunds or other concessions provided to advertisers 

• sharebased compensation expense including acquisitionrelated expense 

• adverse litigation judgments settlements or other litigationrelated costs 

• changes in the legislative or regulatory environment including with respect to privacy data protection and content or actions by governments or regulators including fines orders or consent decrees 

• the overall tax rate for our business which is affected by the mix of income we earn in the us and in jurisdictions with different tax rates the effects of sharebased compensation the effects of integrating intellectual property from acquisitions the effects of changes in our business or structure and the effects of discrete items such as legal and tax settlements and tax elections 

• the impact of changes in tax laws or judicial or regulatory interpretations of tax laws which are recorded in the period such laws are enacted or interpretations are issued and may significantly affect the effective tax rate of that period 

• tax obligations that may arise from resolutions of tax examinations including the examination we are currently under by the internal revenue service irs that materially differ from the amounts we have anticipated 

• fluctuations in currency exchange rates and changes in the proportion of our revenue and expenses denominated in foreign currencies 

• trading activity in our share repurchase program 

• fluctuations in the market values of our investments in marketable securities in the valuation of our equity investments and in interest rates 

• changes in us generally accepted accounting principles and 

• changes in regional or global business or macroeconomic conditions including as a result of the covid19 pandemic which may impact the other factors described above 

our rates of growth may be volatile in the near term as a result of the covid19 pandemic and we expect they will decline over time in the future 

we have in the past experienced and may in the future experience volatility in our user and revenue growth rates as a result of the covid19 pandemic although we are unable to predict the duration or degree of such volatility with any certainty in the long term we expect that our user growth rate will generally decline over time as the size of our active user base increases and the size of our active user base may fluctuate or decline in one or more markets particularly as we achieve greater market penetration we also expect our revenue growth rate will continue to decline over time as our revenue increases to higher levels as our growth rates experience volatility or decline investors perceptions of our business may be adversely affected and the trading price of our class a common stock could decline 

our costs are continuing to grow and some of our investments particularly our investments in virtual and augmented reality have the effect of reducing our operating margin and profitability if our investments are not successful longerterm our business and financial performance will be harmed 

operating our business is costly and we expect our expenses to continue to increase in the future as we broaden our user base as users increase the amount and types of content they consume and the data they share with us for example with respect to video as we develop and implement new products as we market new and existing products and promote our brands as we continue to expand our technical infrastructure as we continue to invest in new and unproven technologies and as we continue to hire additional employees and contractors to support our expanding operations including our efforts to focus on privacy safety security and content review in addition from time to time we are subject to settlements judgments fines or other monetary penalties in connection with legal and regulatory developments that may be material to our business we are also continuing to increase our investments in new platforms and technologies including as we continue our efforts related to building the metaverse some of these investments particularly our significant investments in virtual and augmented reality have generated only limited revenue and reduced our operating margin and profitability and we expect the adverse financial impact of such investments to continue for the foreseeable future for example our investments in reality labs reduced our 2021 overall operating profit by approximately 10 billion and we expect our investments to increase in future periods if our investments are not successful longerterm our business and financial performance will be harmed 

we plan to continue to make acquisitions and pursue other strategic transactions which could impact our financial condition or results of operations and may adversely affect the price of our common stock 

as part of our business strategy we have made and intend to continue to make acquisitions to add specialized employees and complementary companies products or technologies and from time to time may enter into other strategic transactions such as investments and joint ventures we may not be able to find suitable acquisition candidates and we may not be able to complete acquisitions or other strategic transactions on favorable terms or at all including as a result of regulatory challenges for example in 2021 the united kingdom competition and markets authority issued an order directing us to divest our giphy acquisition which we have appealed in some cases the costs of such acquisitions or other strategic transactions may be substantial and there is no assurance that we will realize expected synergies from future growth and potential monetization opportunities for our acquisitions or a favorable return on investment for our strategic investments 

we may pay substantial amounts of cash or incur debt to pay for acquisitions or other strategic transactions which has occurred in the past and could adversely affect our liquidity the incurrence of indebtedness would also result in increased fixed obligations and increased interest expense and could also include covenants or other restrictions that would impede our ability to manage our operations we may also issue equity securities to pay for acquisitions and we regularly grant rsus to retain the employees of acquired companies which could increase our expenses adversely affect our financial results and 

result in dilution to our stockholders in addition any acquisitions or other strategic transactions we announce could be viewed negatively by users marketers developers or investors which may adversely affect our business or the price of our class a common stock 

we may also discover liabilities deficiencies or other claims associated with the companies or assets we acquire that were not identified in advance which may result in significant unanticipated costs the effectiveness of our due diligence review and our ability to evaluate the results of such due diligence are dependent upon the accuracy and completeness of statements and disclosures made or actions taken by the companies we acquire or their representatives as well as the limited amount of time in which acquisitions are executed in addition we may fail to accurately forecast the financial impact of an acquisition or other strategic transaction including tax and accounting charges acquisitions or other strategic transactions may also result in our recording of significant additional expenses to our results of operations and recording of substantial finitelived intangible assets on our balance sheet upon closing any of these factors may adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations 

we may not be able to successfully integrate our acquisitions and we incur significant costs to integrate and support the companies we acquire 

the integration of acquisitions requires significant time and resources particularly with respect to companies that have significant operations or that develop products where we do not have prior experience and we may not manage these processes successfully we continue to make substantial investments of resources to support our acquisitions which has in the past resulted and we expect will in the future result in significant ongoing operating expenses and the diversion of resources and management attention from other areas of our business we cannot assure you that these investments will be successful if we fail to successfully integrate the companies we acquire we may not realize the benefits expected from the transaction and our business may be harmed 

our business is dependent on our ability to maintain and scale our technical infrastructure and any significant disruption in our service including as a result of the covid19 pandemic could damage our reputation result in a potential loss of users and engagement and adversely affect our financial results 

our reputation and ability to attract retain and serve our users is dependent upon the reliable performance of our products and our underlying technical infrastructure we have in the past experienced and may in the future experience interruptions in the availability or performance of our products from time to time our systems may not be adequately designed or may not operate with the reliability and redundancy necessary to avoid performance delays or outages that could be harmful to our business if our products are unavailable when users attempt to access them or if they do not load as quickly as expected users may not use our products as often in the future or at all and our ability to serve ads may be disrupted any of which could adversely affect our business and financial performance we have experienced such issues to varying degrees from time to time for example in october 2021 a combination of an error and a bug resulted in an approximately sixhour outage of our services in addition as the amount and types of information shared on our products continue to grow and evolve as the usage patterns of our global community continue to evolve and as our internal operational demands continue to grow we will need an increasing amount of technical infrastructure including network capacity and computing power to continue to satisfy our needs it is possible that we may fail to continue to effectively scale and grow our technical infrastructure to accommodate these increased demands which may adversely affect our user engagement and advertising revenue growth in addition our business may be subject to interruptions delays or failures resulting from earthquakes adverse weather conditions other natural disasters power loss terrorism geopolitical conflict other physical security threats cyberattacks or other catastrophic events global climate change could result in certain types of natural disasters occurring more frequently or with more intense effects any such events may result in users being subject to service disruptions or outages and we may not be able to recover our technical infrastructure and user data in a timely manner to restart or provide our services which may adversely affect our financial results we also have been and may in the future be subject to increased energy or other costs to maintain the availability or performance of our products in connection with any such events 

in 2020 the increase in the use of our products as a result of the covid19 pandemic increased demands on our technical infrastructure we may not be able to accommodate any such demands in the future including as a result of our reduced data center operations and personnel working remotely during the pandemic 

a substantial portion of our network infrastructure is provided by third parties any disruption or failure in the services 

we receive from these providers could harm our ability to handle existing or increased traffic and could significantly harm our business any financial or other difficulties these providers face may adversely affect our business and we exercise little control over these providers which increases our vulnerability to problems with the services they provide due to the effects of the covid19 pandemic we have experienced and expect to continue to experience supply and labor shortages and other disruptions in logistics and the supply chain for our technical infrastructure as a result we have had to make certain changes to our procurement practices and in the future we may not be able to procure sufficient components equipment or services from third parties to satisfy our needs or we may be required to procure such components equipment or services on unfavorable terms 

any of these developments may result in interruptions in the availability or performance of our products require unfavorable changes to existing products delay the introduction of future products or otherwise adversely affect our business and financial results 

we could experience unforeseen difficulties in building and operating key portions of our technical infrastructure 

we have designed and built our own data centers and key portions of our technical infrastructure through which we serve our products and we plan to continue to significantly expand the size of our infrastructure primarily through data centers subsea and terrestrial fiber optic cable systems and other projects the infrastructure expansion we are undertaking is complex and involves projects in multiple locations around the world including in emerging markets that expose us to increased risks relating to anticorruption compliance and political challenges among others we have in the past suspended and may in the future suspend certain of these projects as a result of the covid19 pandemic additional unanticipated delays or disruptions in the completion of these projects including due to any shortage of labor necessary in building portions of such projects or availability of components challenges in obtaining required government or regulatory approvals or other geopolitical challenges or actions by governments whether as a result of the pandemic trade disputes or otherwise may lead to increased project costs operational inefficiencies interruptions in the delivery or degradation of the quality or reliability of our products or impairment of assets on our balance sheet in addition there may be issues related to this infrastructure that are not identified during the testing phases of design and implementation which may only become evident after we have started to fully utilize the underlying equipment that could further degrade the user experience or increase our costs further much of our technical infrastructure is located outside the united states and it is possible that action by a foreign government or our response to such government action could result in the impairment of a portion of our technical infrastructure which may interrupt the delivery or degrade the quality or reliability of our products and lead to a negative user experience or increase our costs any of these events could adversely affect our business reputation or financial results 

real or perceived inaccuracies in our community and other metrics may harm our reputation and negatively affect our business 

the numbers for our key metrics which include our family metrics dap map and average revenue per person arpp and facebook metrics daus maus and average revenue per user arpu are calculated using internal company data based on the activity of user accounts while these numbers are based on what we believe to be reasonable estimates of our user base for the applicable period of measurement there are inherent challenges in measuring usage of our products across large online and mobile populations around the world the methodologies used to measure these metrics require significant judgment and are also susceptible to algorithm or other technical errors in addition we are continually seeking to improve our estimates of our user base and such estimates may change due to improvements or changes in our methodology we regularly review our processes for calculating these metrics and from time to time we discover inaccuracies in our metrics or make adjustments to improve their accuracy which can result in adjustments to our historical metrics our ability to recalculate our historical metrics may be impacted by data limitations or other factors that require us to apply different methodologies for such adjustments we generally do not intend to update previously disclosed family metrics for any such inaccuracies or adjustments that are within the error margins disclosed below 

in addition our family metrics and facebook metrics estimates will differ from estimates published by third parties due to differences in methodology 

many people in our community have user accounts on more than one of our products and some people have multiple user accounts within an individual product accordingly for our family metrics we do not seek to count the total number of user accounts across our products because we believe that would not reflect the actual size of our community rather our family metrics represent our estimates of the number of unique people using at least one of facebook instagram messenger 

and whatsapp we do not require people to use a common identifier or link their accounts to use multiple products in our family and therefore must seek to attribute multiple user accounts within and across products to individual people to calculate these metrics we rely upon complex techniques algorithms and machine learning models that seek to count the individual people behind user accounts including by matching multiple user accounts within an individual product and across multiple products when we believe they are attributable to a single person and counting such group of accounts as one person these techniques and models require significant judgment are subject to data and other limitations discussed below and inherently are subject to statistical variances and uncertainties we estimate the potential error in our family metrics primarily based on user survey data which itself is subject to error as well while we expect the error margin for our family metrics to vary from period to period we estimate that such margin generally will be approximately 3 of our worldwide map at our scale it is very difficult to attribute multiple user accounts within and across products to individual people and it is possible that the actual numbers of unique people using our products may vary significantly from our estimates potentially beyond our estimated error margins as a result it is also possible that our family metrics may indicate changes or trends in user numbers that do not match actual changes or trends 

to calculate our estimates of family dap and map we currently use a series of machine learning models that are developed based on internal reviews of limited samples of user accounts and calibrated against user survey data we apply significant judgment in designing these models and calculating these estimates for example to match user accounts within individual products and across multiple products we use data signals such as similar device information ip addresses and user names we also calibrate our models against data from periodic user surveys of varying sizes and frequency across our products which are inherently subject to error the timing and results of such user surveys have in the past contributed and may in the future contribute to changes in our reported family metrics from period to period in addition our data limitations may affect our understanding of certain details of our business and increase the risk of error for our family metrics estimates our techniques and models rely on a variety of data signals from different products and we rely on more limited data signals for some products compared to others for example as a result of limited visibility into encrypted products we have fewer data signals from whatsapp user accounts and primarily rely on phone numbers and device information to match whatsapp user accounts with accounts on our other products similarly although messenger kids users are included in our family metrics we do not seek to match their accounts with accounts on our other applications for purposes of calculating dap and map any loss of access to data signals we use in our process for calculating family metrics whether as a result of our own product decisions actions by thirdparty browser or mobile platforms regulatory or legislative requirements limitations while our personnel work remotely during the covid19 pandemic or other factors also may impact the stability or accuracy of our reported family metrics as well as our ability to report these metrics at all our estimates of family metrics also may change as our methodologies evolve including through the application of new data signals or technologies product changes or other improvements in our user surveys algorithms or machine learning that may improve our ability to match accounts within and across our products or otherwise evaluate the broad population of our users in addition such evolution may allow us to identify previously undetected violating accounts as defined below 

we regularly evaluate our family metrics to estimate the percentage of our map consisting solely of violating accounts we define violating accounts as accounts which we believe are intended to be used for purposes that violate our terms of service including bots and spam in the fourth quarter of 2021 we estimated that approximately 3 of our worldwide map consisted solely of violating accounts such estimation is based on an internal review of a limited sample of accounts and we apply significant judgment in making this determination for example we look for account information and behaviors associated with facebook and instagram accounts that appear to be inauthentic to the reviewers but we have limited visibility into whatsapp user activity due to encryption in addition if we believe an individual person has one or more violating accounts we do not include such person in our violating accounts estimation as long as we believe they have one account that does not constitute a violating account from time to time we disable certain user accounts make product changes or take other actions to reduce the number of violating accounts among our users which may also reduce our dap and map estimates in a particular period we intend to disclose our estimates of the percentage of our map consisting solely of violating accounts on an annual basis violating accounts are very difficult to measure at our scale and it is possible that the actual number of violating accounts may vary significantly from our estimates 

we also regularly evaluate our facebook metrics to estimate the number of duplicate and false accounts among our maus a duplicate account is one that a user maintains in addition to his or her principal account we divide false accounts into two categories 1 usermisclassified accounts where users have created personal profiles for a business organization or nonhuman entity such as a pet such entities are permitted on facebook using a page rather than a personal profile under our terms of service and 2 violating accounts which represent user profiles that we believe are intended to be used for purposes that violate our terms of service such as bots and spam the estimates of duplicate and false accounts 

are based on an internal review of a limited sample of accounts and we apply significant judgment in making this determination for example to identify duplicate accounts we use data signals such as identical ip addresses and similar user names and to identify false accounts we look for names that appear to be fake or other behavior that appears inauthentic to the reviewers any loss of access to data signals we use in this process whether as a result of our own product decisions actions by thirdparty browser or mobile platforms regulatory or legislative requirements limitations while our personnel work remotely during the covid19 pandemic or other factors also may impact the stability or accuracy of our estimates of duplicate and false accounts our estimates also may change as our methodologies evolve including through the application of new data signals or technologies or product changes that may allow us to identify previously undetected duplicate or false accounts and may improve our ability to evaluate a broader population of our users duplicate and false accounts are very difficult to measure at our scale and it is possible that the actual number of duplicate and false accounts may vary significantly from our estimates 

in the fourth quarter of 2021 we estimated that duplicate accounts may have represented approximately 11 of our worldwide maus we believe the percentage of duplicate accounts is meaningfully higher in developing markets such as the philippines and vietnam as compared to more developed markets in the fourth quarter of 2021 we estimated that false accounts may have represented approximately 5 of our worldwide maus our estimation of false accounts can vary as a result of episodic spikes in the creation of such accounts which we have seen originate more frequently in specific countries such as indonesia nigeria and vietnam from time to time we disable certain user accounts make product changes or take other actions to reduce the number of duplicate or false accounts among our users which may also reduce our dau and mau estimates in a particular period we intend to disclose our estimates of the number of duplicate and false accounts among our maus on an annual basis 

other data limitations also may affect our understanding of certain details of our business for example while userprovided data indicates a decline in usage among younger users this age data may be unreliable because a disproportionate number of our younger users register with an inaccurate age accordingly our understanding of usage by age group may not be complete 

in addition our data regarding the geographic location of our users is estimated based on a number of factors such as the users ip address and selfdisclosed location these factors may not always accurately reflect the users actual location for example a user may appear to be accessing facebook from the location of the proxy server that the user connects to rather than from the users actual location the methodologies used to measure our metrics are also susceptible to algorithm or other technical errors and our estimates for revenue by user location and revenue by user device are also affected by these factors 

in addition from time to time we provide or rely on certain other metrics and estimates including those relating to the reach and effectiveness of our ads many of our metrics involve the use of estimations and judgments and our metrics and estimates are subject to software bugs inconsistencies in our systems and human error such metrics and estimates also change from time to time due to improvements or changes in our terminology or methodology including as a result of loss of access to data signals we use in calculating such metrics and estimates we have in the past been and may in the future be subject to litigation as well as marketer regulatory and other inquiries regarding the accuracy of such metrics and estimates where marketers developers or investors do not perceive our metrics or estimates to be accurate or where we discover material inaccuracies in our metrics or estimates we may be subject to liability our reputation may be harmed and marketers and developers may be less willing to allocate their budgets or resources to our products that deliver ad impressions which could negatively affect our business and financial results 

we cannot assure you that we will effectively manage our growth 

our employee headcount and the scope and complexity of our business have increased significantly with the number of employees increasing to 71970 as of december 31 2021 from 58604 as of december 31 2020 and we expect headcount growth to continue for the foreseeable future in addition we plan to continue to hire a number of employees and contractors to continue to bolster various privacy safety security and content review initiatives as well as other functions to support our expected growth the growth and expansion of our business and products create significant challenges for our management operational and financial resources including managing multiple relationships with users marketers developers and other third parties as our operations and the number of our thirdparty relationships continue to grow our information technology systems or our internal controls and procedures may not be adequate to support such growth in addition some members of our management do not have significant experience managing a large global business operation so our management may not 

be able to manage such growth effectively additionally the vast majority of our personnel are currently working remotely as a result of the covid19 pandemic which limits their ability to perform certain job functions and may negatively impact productivity in the long term we may experience such challenges to productivity and collaboration as some personnel transition to working remotely on a regular basis and we may experience difficulties integrating recently hired personnel when our offices reopen to effectively manage our growth we must continue to adapt to a remote work environment improve our operational financial and management processes and systems and effectively expand train and manage our personnel as our organization continues to grow and we are required to implement more complex organizational management structures we may find it increasingly difficult to maintain the benefits of our corporate culture including our ability to quickly develop and launch new and innovative products this could negatively affect our business performance 

we have significant international operations and plan to continue expanding our operations abroad where we have more limited operating experience and this may subject us to increased business economic and legal risks that could affect our financial results 

we have significant international operations and plan to continue the international expansion of our business operations and the translation of our products we currently make facebook available in more than 100 different languages and we have offices or data centers in more than 30 different countries we may enter new international markets where we have limited or no experience in marketing selling and deploying our products our products are generally available globally but some or all of our products or functionality may not be available in certain markets due to legal and regulatory complexities for example several of our products are not generally available in china we also outsource certain operational functions to thirdparty vendors globally if we fail to deploy manage or oversee our international operations successfully our business may suffer in addition we are subject to a variety of risks inherent in doing business internationally including 

• political social or economic instability 

• risks related to legal regulatory and other government scrutiny applicable to us companies with sales and operations in foreign jurisdictions including with respect to privacy tax law enforcement content trade compliance supply chain competition consumer protection intellectual property environmental health and safety licensing and infrastructure matters 

• potential damage to our brand and reputation due to compliance with local laws including potential censorship or requirements to provide user information to local authorities 

• enhanced difficulty in reviewing content on our platform and enforcing our community standards across different languages and countries 

• fluctuations in currency exchange rates and compliance with currency controls 

• foreign exchange controls and tax and other regulations and orders that might prevent us from repatriating cash earned in countries outside the united states or otherwise limit our ability to move cash freely and impede our ability to invest such cash efficiently 

• higher levels of credit risk and payment fraud 

• enhanced difficulties of integrating any foreign acquisitions 

• burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws including laws related to taxation content removal content moderation data localization data protection ecommerce and payments and regulatory oversight 

• reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries 

• difficulties in staffing managing and overseeing global operations and the increased travel infrastructure and legal compliance costs associated with multiple international locations including difficulties arising from personnel working remotely during the covid19 pandemic 

• compliance with statutory equity requirements and management of tax consequences and 

• geopolitical events affecting us our marketers or our industry including trade disputes and pandemics 

in addition we must manage the potential conflicts between locally accepted business practices in any given jurisdiction and our obligations to comply with laws and regulations including anticorruption laws or regulations applicable to us such as the us foreign corrupt practices act and the uk bribery act 2010 we also must manage our obligations to comply with laws and regulations related to import and export controls trade restrictions and sanctions including regulations established by the us office of foreign assets control government agencies and authorities have a broad range of civil and criminal penalties they may seek to impose against companies for violations of anticorruption laws or regulations import and export controls trade restrictions sanctions and other laws rules and regulations 

if we are unable to expand internationally and manage the complexity of our global operations successfully our financial results could be adversely affected we also may be required to or elect to cease or modify our operations or the offering of our products and services in certain regions including as a result of the risks described above which could adversely affect our business user growth and engagement and financial results 

we face design manufacturing and supply chain risks that if not properly managed could adversely impact our financial results 

we face a number of risks related to design manufacturing and supply chain management with respect to our consumer hardware products for example the consumer hardware products we sell from time to time have had and in the future may have quality issues resulting from the design or manufacture of the products or from the software used in the products sometimes these issues may be caused by components we purchase from other manufacturers or suppliers our brand and financial results could be adversely affected by any such quality issues other failures to meet our customers expectations or findings of our consumer hardware products to be defective 

we rely on third parties to manufacture and manage the logistics of transporting and distributing our consumer hardware products which subjects us to a number of risks that have been exacerbated as a result of the covid19 pandemic we have experienced and may in the future experience supply or labor shortages or other disruptions in logistics and the supply chain which could result in shipping delays and negatively impact our operations product development and sales we could be negatively affected if we are not able to engage third parties with the necessary capabilities or capacity on reasonable terms or if those we engage with fail to meet their obligations whether due to financial difficulties manufacturing or supply constraints or other reasons or make adverse changes in the pricing or other material terms of such arrangements with them the manufacturing distribution and sale of our consumer hardware products also may be negatively impacted by macroeconomic conditions geopolitical challenges trade disputes or other actions by governments that subject us to supply shortages increased costs or supply chain disruptions 

we also require the suppliers and business partners of our consumer hardware products to comply with laws and certain company policies regarding sourcing practices and standards on labor health and safety the environment and business ethics but we do not control them or their practices and standards if any of them violates laws fails to implement changes in accordance with newly enacted laws or implements practices or standards regarded as unethical corrupt or noncompliant we could experience supply chain disruptions government action or fines canceled orders or damage to our reputation 

we face inventory risk with respect to our consumer hardware products 

we are exposed to inventory risks with respect to our consumer hardware products as a result of rapid changes in product cycles and pricing unsafe or defective merchandise supply chain disruptions changes in consumer demand and consumer spending patterns changes in consumer tastes with respect to our consumer hardware products and other factors the demand for our products can also change significantly between the time inventory or components are ordered and the date of sale while we endeavor to accurately predict these trends and avoid overstocking or understocking consumer hardware products we may sell from time to time we have experienced difficulties in accurately predicting and meeting the consumer demand for our products in addition when we begin selling or manufacturing a new consumer hardware product or enter new international markets it may be difficult to establish vendor relationships determine appropriate product or component selection and accurately forecast demand the acquisition of certain types of inventory or components may require significant leadtime and prepayment and they may not be returnable any one of the foregoing factors may adversely 

affect our operating results 

we are involved in numerous class action lawsuits and other litigation matters that are expensive and time consuming and if resolved adversely could harm our business financial condition or results of operations 

we are involved in numerous lawsuits including stockholder derivative lawsuits and putative class action lawsuits many of which claim statutory damages andor seek significant changes to our business operations and we anticipate that we will continue to be a target for numerous lawsuits in the future because of the scale of our user advertiser and developer base the plaintiffs in class action cases filed against us typically claim enormous monetary damages even if the alleged peruser or entity harm is small or nonexistent in addition we have in the past and may in the future be subject to additional class action lawsuits based on claims related to advertising antitrust privacy biometrics content algorithms employment activities on our platform consumer protection or product performance or other claims related to the use of consumer hardware and software including virtual reality technology and products which are new and unproven for example we are currently the subject of multiple putative class action suits in connection with our platform and user data practices and the misuse of certain data by a developer that shared such data with third parties in violation of our terms and policies the disclosure of our earnings results for the second quarter of 2018 our acquisitions of instagram and whatsapp as well as other alleged anticompetitive conduct and a former employees allegations and release of internal company documents beginning in september 2021 the results of any such lawsuits and claims cannot be predicted with certainty and any negative outcome from any such lawsuits could result in payments of substantial monetary damages or fines or undesirable changes to our products or business practices and accordingly our business financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

there can be no assurances that a favorable final outcome will be obtained in all our cases and defending any lawsuit is costly and can impose a significant burden on management and employees any litigation to which we are a party may result in an onerous or unfavorable judgment that may not be reversed upon appeal or in payments of substantial monetary damages or fines or we may decide to settle lawsuits on similarly unfavorable terms which has occurred in the past and which could adversely affect our business financial conditions or results of operations 

we may have exposure to greater than anticipated tax liabilities 

our tax obligations including income and nonincome taxes are based in part on our corporate operating structure and intercompany arrangements including the manner in which we operate our business develop value manage protect and use our intellectual property and the valuations of our intercompany transactions the tax laws applicable to our business including the laws of the united states and other jurisdictions are subject to interpretation and certain jurisdictions are aggressively interpreting their laws in new ways in an effort to raise additional tax revenue from companies such as meta we are subject to regular review and audit by us federal state and foreign tax authorities tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken including our methodologies for valuing developed technology or intercompany arrangements and any adverse outcome of such a review or audit could increase our worldwide effective tax rate increase the amount of nonincome taxes imposed on our business and harm our financial position results of operations and cash flows for example in 2016 and 2018 the irs issued formal assessments relating to transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries in conjunction with the examination of the 2010 through 2013 tax years although we disagree with the irss position and are litigating this issue the ultimate resolution is uncertain and if resolved in a manner unfavorable to us may adversely affect our financial results 

the determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires significant judgment by management and there are many transactions where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain our provision for income taxes is determined by the manner in which we operate our business and any changes to such operations or laws applicable to such operations may affect our effective tax rate although we believe that our provision for income taxes and estimates of our nonincome tax liabilities are reasonable the ultimate settlement may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements and may materially affect our financial results in the period or periods for which such determination is made 

our future income tax rates could be volatile and difficult to predict due to changes in jurisdictional profit split changes in the amount and recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities or by changes in tax laws regulations or accounting principles 

changes in tax laws or tax rulings could materially affect our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

the tax regimes we are subject to or operate under including income and nonincome taxes are unsettled and may be subject to significant change changes in tax laws or tax rulings or changes in interpretations of existing laws could materially affect our financial position results of operations and cash flows for example the 2017 tax cuts and jobs act tax act enacted in december 2017 had a significant impact on our tax obligations and effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2017 the issuance of additional regulatory or accounting guidance related to the tax act or other executive or congressional actions in the united states or globally could materially increase our tax obligations and significantly impact our effective tax rate in the period such guidance is issued or such actions take effect and in future periods in addition many countries have recently proposed or recommended changes to existing tax laws or have enacted new laws that could significantly increase our tax obligations in many countries where we do business or require us to change the manner in which we operate our business 

over the last several years the organization for economic cooperation and development has been working on a base erosion and profit shifting project that if implemented would change various aspects of the existing framework under which our tax obligations are determined in many of the countries in which we do business in 2021 more than 140 countries tentatively signed on to a framework that imposes a minimum tax rate of 15 among other provisions as this framework is subject to further negotiation and implementation by each member country the timing and ultimate impact of any such changes on our tax obligations are uncertain similarly the european commission and several countries have issued proposals that would apply to various aspects of the current tax framework under which we are taxed these proposals include changes to the existing framework to calculate income tax as well as proposals to change or impose new types of nonincome taxes including taxes based on a percentage of revenue for example several jurisdictions have proposed or enacted taxes applicable to digital services which include business activities on digital advertising and online marketplaces and which apply to our business 

the european commission has conducted investigations in multiple countries focusing on whether local country tax rulings or tax legislation provides preferential tax treatment that violates european union state aid rules and concluded that certain member states including ireland have provided illegal state aid in certain cases these investigations may result in changes to the tax treatment of our foreign operations 

due to the large and expanding scale of our international business activities many of these types of changes to the taxation of our activities described above could increase our worldwide effective tax rate increase the amount of nonincome taxes imposed on our business and harm our financial position results of operations and cash flows such changes may also apply retroactively to our historical operations and result in taxes greater than the amounts estimated and recorded in our financial statements 

given our levels of sharebased compensation our tax rate may vary significantly depending on our stock price 

the tax effects of the accounting for sharebased compensation may significantly impact our effective tax rate from period to period in periods in which our stock price is higher than the grant price of the sharebased compensation vesting in that period we will recognize excess tax benefits that will decrease our effective tax rate for example in 2021 excess tax benefits recognized from sharebased compensation decreased our provision for income taxes by 113 billion and our effective tax rate by two percentage points as compared to the tax rate without such benefits in future periods in which our stock price is lower than the grant price of the sharebased compensation vesting in that period our effective tax rate may increase the amount and value of sharebased compensation issued relative to our earnings in a particular period will also affect the magnitude of the impact of sharebased compensation on our effective tax rate these tax effects are dependent on our stock price which we do not control and a decline in our stock price could significantly increase our effective tax rate and adversely affect our financial results 

if our goodwill or intangible assets become impaired we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings 

we review our intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable such as a decline in stock price and market capitalization we test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level at least annually if such goodwill or intangible assets are deemed to be impaired an impairment loss equal to the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the assets would be recognized we may be required to record a significant charge in our financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill 

or intangible assets is determined which would negatively affect our results of operations 

the loss of one or more of our key personnel or our failure to attract and retain other highly qualified personnel in the future could harm our business 

we currently depend on the continued services and performance of our key personnel including mark zuckerberg and sheryl k sandberg although we have entered into employment agreements with mr zuckerberg and ms sandberg the agreements have no specific duration and constitute atwill employment in addition many of our key technologies and systems are custommade for our business by our personnel the loss of key personnel including members of management as well as key engineering product development marketing and sales personnel could disrupt our operations and have an adverse effect on our business 

as we continue to grow we cannot guarantee we will continue to attract and retain the personnel we need to maintain our competitive position in particular we intend to continue to hire a significant number of technical personnel in the foreseeable future and we expect to continue to face significant challenges in hiring such personnel particularly for engineering talent whether as a result of competition with other companies or other factors as we continue to mature the incentives to attract retain and motivate employees provided by our equity awards or by future arrangements may not be as effective as in the past and if we issue significant equity to attract additional employees or to retain our existing employees we would incur substantial additional sharebased compensation expense and the ownership of our existing stockholders would be further diluted our ability to attract retain and motivate employees may also be adversely affected by stock price volatility in addition restrictive immigration policies or legal or regulatory developments relating to immigration may negatively affect our efforts to attract and hire new personnel as well as retain our existing personnel  if we do not succeed in attracting hiring and integrating excellent personnel or retaining and motivating existing personnel we may be unable to grow effectively 

our ceo has control over key decision making as a result of his control of a majority of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock 

mark zuckerberg our founder chairman and ceo is able to exercise voting rights with respect to a majority of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock and therefore has the ability to control the outcome of matters submitted to our stockholders for approval including the election of directors and any merger consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets this concentrated control could delay defer or prevent a change of control merger consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets that our other stockholders support or conversely this concentrated control could result in the consummation of such a transaction that our other stockholders do not support this concentrated control could also discourage a potential investor from acquiring our class a common stock which has limited voting power relative to the class b common stock and might harm the trading price of our class a common stock in addition mr zuckerberg has the ability to control the management and major strategic investments of our company as a result of his position as our ceo and his ability to control the election or in some cases the replacement of our directors in the event of his death the shares of our capital stock that mr zuckerberg owns will be transferred to the persons or entities that he has designated as a board member and officer mr zuckerberg owes a fiduciary duty to our stockholders and must act in good faith in a manner he reasonably believes to be in the best interests of our stockholders as a stockholder even a controlling stockholder mr zuckerberg is entitled to vote his shares and shares over which he has voting control as governed by a voting agreement in his own interests which may not always be in the interests of our stockholders generally 

we cannot guarantee that our share repurchase program will be fully consummated or that it will enhance longterm stockholder value share repurchases could also increase the volatility of the trading price of our stock and will diminish our cash reserves 

although our board of directors has authorized a share repurchase program that does not have an expiration date the program does not obligate us to repurchase any specific dollar amount or to acquire any specific number of shares of our class a common stock we cannot guarantee that the program will be fully consummated or that it will enhance longterm stockholder value the program could affect the trading price of our stock and increase volatility and any announcement of a termination of this program may result in a decrease in the trading price of our stock in addition this program will diminish our cash reserves 

risks related to government regulation and enforcement 

actions by governments that restrict access to facebook or our other products in their countries censor or moderate content on our products in their countries or otherwise impair our ability to sell advertising in their countries could substantially harm our business and financial results 

governments from time to time seek to censor or moderate content available on facebook or our other products in their country restrict access to our products from their country partially or entirely or impose other restrictions that may affect the accessibility of our products in their country for an extended period of time or indefinitely for example user access to facebook and certain of our other products has been or is currently restricted in whole or in part in china iran and north korea in addition government authorities in other countries may seek to restrict user access to our products if they consider us to be in violation of their laws or a threat to public safety or for other reasons and certain of our products have been restricted by governments in other countries from time to time for example in june 2020 hong kong adopted a national security law that provides authorities with the ability to obtain information remove and block access to content and suspend user services and if we are found to be in violation of this law then the use of our products may be restricted in addition if we are required to or elect to make changes to our marketing and sales or other operations in hong kong as a result of the national security law our revenue and business in the region will be adversely affected it is also possible that government authorities could take action that impairs our ability to sell advertising including in countries where access to our consumerfacing products may be blocked or restricted for example we generate meaningful revenue from a limited number of resellers representing advertisers based in china and it is possible that the chinese government could take action that reduces or eliminates our chinabased advertising revenue whether as a result of the trade dispute with the united states in response to content issues or information requests in hong kong or elsewhere or for other reasons or take other action against us such as imposing taxes or other penalties which could adversely affect our financial results similarly if we are found to be out of compliance with certain legal requirements for social media companies in turkey the turkish government could take action to reduce or eliminate our turkeybased advertising revenue or otherwise adversely impact access to our products in the event that content shown on facebook or our other products is subject to censorship access to our products is restricted in whole or in part in one or more countries we are required to or elect to make changes to our operations or other restrictions are imposed on our products or our competitors are able to successfully penetrate new geographic markets or capture a greater share of existing geographic markets that we cannot access or where we face other restrictions our ability to retain or increase our user base user engagement or the level of advertising by marketers may be adversely affected we may not be able to maintain or grow our revenue as anticipated and our financial results could be adversely affected 

our business is subject to complex and evolving us and foreign laws and regulations regarding privacy data use and data protection content competition safety and consumer protection ecommerce and other matters many of these laws and regulations are subject to change and uncertain interpretation and could result in claims changes to our products and business practices monetary penalties increased cost of operations or declines in user growth or engagement or otherwise harm our business 

we are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the united states and abroad that involve matters central to our business including privacy data use data protection and personal information biometrics encryption rights of publicity content intellectual property advertising marketing distribution data security data retention and deletion data localization and storage data disclosure artificial intelligence electronic contracts and other communications competition protection of minors consumer protection civil rights telecommunications product liability ecommerce taxation economic or other trade controls including sanctions anticorruption and political law compliance securities law compliance and online payment services the introduction of new products expansion of our activities in certain jurisdictions or other actions that we may take may subject us to additional laws regulations or other government scrutiny in addition foreign data protection privacy content competition consumer protection and other laws and regulations can impose different obligations or be more restrictive than those in the united states 

these us federal and state and foreign laws and regulations which in some cases can be enforced by private parties in addition to government entities are constantly evolving and can be subject to significant change as a result the application interpretation and enforcement of these laws and regulations are often uncertain particularly in the new and rapidly evolving industry in which we operate and may be interpreted and applied inconsistently from country to country and inconsistently with our current policies and practices for example regulatory or legislative actions affecting the manner in which we display content to our users or obtain consent to various practices could adversely affect user growth and engagement such actions could affect the manner in which we provide our services or adversely affect our financial results 

we are also subject to evolving laws and regulations that dictate whether how and under what circumstances we can transfer process andor receive certain data that is critical to our operations including data shared between countries or regions in which we operate and data shared among our products and services for example in 2016 the european union and united states agreed to a transfer framework for data transferred from the european union to the united states called the privacy shield but the privacy shield was invalidated in july 2020 by the court of justice of the european union cjeu in addition the other bases upon which meta relies to transfer such data such as standard contractual clauses sccs have been subjected to regulatory and judicial scrutiny for example the cjeu considered the validity of sccs as a basis to transfer user data from the european union to the united states following a challenge brought by the irish data protection commission idpc although the cjeu upheld the validity of sccs in july 2020 our continued reliance on sccs will be the subject of future regulatory consideration in particular in august 2020 we received a preliminary draft decision from the idpc that preliminarily concluded that meta platforms irelands reliance on sccs in respect of european user data does not achieve compliance with the gdpr and preliminarily proposed that such transfers of user data from the european union to the united states should therefore be suspended meta platforms ireland challenged procedural aspects of this idpc inquiry in a judicial review commenced in the irish high court in september 2020 in may 2021 the court rejected meta platforms irelands procedural challenges and the inquiry subsequently recommenced we believe a final decision in this inquiry may issue as early as the first half of 2022 if a new transatlantic data transfer framework is not adopted and we are unable to continue to rely on sccs or rely upon other alternative means of data transfers from europe to the united states we will likely be unable to offer a number of our most significant products and services including facebook and instagram in europe which would materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations in addition we have been managing investigations and lawsuits in europe india and other jurisdictions regarding the august 2016 update to whatsapps terms of service and privacy policy and its sharing of certain data with other meta products and services including a lawsuit currently pending before the supreme court of india and also became subject to government inquiries and lawsuits regarding the 2021 update to whatsapps terms of service and privacy policy if we are unable to transfer data between and among countries and regions in which we operate or if we are restricted from sharing data among our products and services it could affect our ability to provide our services the manner in which we provide our services or our ability to target ads which could adversely affect our financial results 

we have been subject to other significant legislative and regulatory developments in the past and proposed or new legislation and regulations could significantly affect our business in the future for example we have implemented a number of product changes and controls as a result of requirements under the european general data protection regulation gdpr and may implement additional changes in the future the gdpr also requires submission of personal data breach notifications to our lead european union privacy regulator the idpc and includes significant penalties for noncompliance with the notification obligation as well as other requirements of the regulation the gdpr is still a relatively new law its interpretation is still evolving and draft decisions in investigations by the idpc are subject to review by other european privacy regulators as part of the gdprs consistency mechanism which may lead to significant changes in the final outcome of such investigations as a result the interpretation and enforcement of the gdpr as well as the imposition and amount of penalties for noncompliance are subject to significant uncertainty in addition brazil the united kingdom and other countries have enacted similar data protection regulations imposing data privacyrelated requirements on products and services offered to users in their respective jurisdictions the california consumer privacy act ccpa which took effect in january 2020 and its successor the california privacy rights act cpra which will take effect in january 2023 also establish certain transparency rules and create new data privacy rights for users including limitations on our use of certain sensitive personal information and more ability for users to control how their data is shared with third parties these laws and regulations are evolving and subject to interpretation and resulting limitations on our advertising services or reductions of advertising by marketers have to some extent adversely affected and will continue to adversely affect our advertising business for example regulators continue to issue guidance concerning the eprivacy directives requirements regarding the use of cookies and similar technologies in addition effective december 2020 the eprivacy directive includes additional limitations on the use of data across messaging products and includes significant penalties for noncompliance changes to our products or business practices as a result of these or similar developments may adversely affect our advertising business similarly there are a number of legislative proposals in the european union the united states at both the federal and state level as well as other jurisdictions that could impose new obligations or limitations in areas affecting our business for example the proposed digital markets act in the european union and pending proposals to modify competition laws in the united states and other jurisdictions could cause us to incur significant compliance costs and could potentially impose new restrictions and requirements on companies like ours including in areas such as the combination of data across services mergers and acquisitions and product design in addition some countries such as india are considering or have passed legislation implementing data protection requirements or requiring local storage and processing of data or similar 

requirements that could increase the cost and complexity of delivering our services new legislation or regulatory decisions that restrict our ability to collect and use information about minors may also result in limitations on our advertising services or our ability to offer products and services to minors in certain jurisdictions 

these laws and regulations as well as any associated claims inquiries or investigations or any other government actions have in the past led to and may in the future lead to unfavorable outcomes including increased compliance costs delays or impediments in the development of new products negative publicity and reputational harm increased operating costs diversion of management time and attention and remedies that harm our business including fines or demands or orders that we modify or cease existing business practices 

we have been subject to regulatory and other government investigations enforcement actions and settlements and we expect to continue to be subject to such proceedings and other inquiries in the future which could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner materially adverse to our business 

we receive formal and informal inquiries from government authorities and regulators regarding our compliance with laws and regulations many of which are evolving and subject to interpretation we are and expect to continue to be the subject of investigations inquiries data requests requests for information actions and audits in the united states europe and around the world particularly in the areas of privacy data protection law enforcement consumer protection civil rights content moderation and competition as we continue to grow and expand our operations in addition we are currently and may in the future be subject to regulatory orders or consent decrees for example data protection competition and consumer protection authorities in the european union and other jurisdictions have initiated actions investigations or administrative orders seeking to restrict the ways in which we collect and use information or impose sanctions and other authorities may do the same in addition beginning in march 2018 we became subject to ftc state attorneys general and other government inquiries in the united states europe and other jurisdictions in connection with our platform and user data practices as well as the misuse of certain data by a developer that shared such data with third parties in violation of our terms and policies in july 2019 we entered into a settlement and modified consent order to resolve the ftc inquiry which was approved by the federal court and took effect in april 2020 among other matters our settlement with the ftc required us to pay a penalty of 50 billion and to significantly enhance our practices and processes for privacy compliance and oversight the state attorneys general inquiry and certain government inquiries in other jurisdictions remain ongoing beginning in september 2018 we also became subject to idpc and other government inquiries in connection with a thirdparty cyberattack that exploited a vulnerability in facebooks code to steal user access tokens and access certain profile information from user accounts on facebook we also notify the idpc our lead european union privacy regulator under the gdpr of certain other personal data breaches and privacy issues and are subject to inquiries and investigations by the idpc and other european regulators regarding various aspects of our regulatory compliance 

in addition we are subject to various litigation and formal and informal inquiries and investigations by competition authorities in the united states europe and other jurisdictions which relate to many aspects of our business including with respect to users and advertisers as well as our industry such inquiries investigations and lawsuits concern among other things our business practices in the areas of social networking or social media services digital advertising andor mobile or online applications as well as our acquisitions for example in june 2019 we were informed by the ftc that it had opened an antitrust investigation of our company in addition beginning in the third quarter of 2019 we became the subject of antitrust inquiries and investigations by the us department of justice and state attorneys general beginning in december 2020 we also became subject to lawsuits by the ftc and the attorneys general from 46 states the territory of guam and the district of columbia in the us district court for the district of columbia alleging that we violated antitrust laws including by acquiring instagram in 2012 and whatsapp in 2014 and by maintaining conditions on access to our platform among other things the complaints of the ftc and attorneys general both sought a permanent injunction against our companys alleged violations of the antitrust laws and other equitable relief including divestiture or reconstruction of instagram and whatsapp we are also subject to other government inquiries and investigations relating to our business activities and disclosure practices for example beginning in september 2021 we became subject to government investigations and requests relating to allegations and the release of internal company documents by a former employee 

orders issued by or inquiries or enforcement actions initiated by government or regulatory authorities could cause us to incur substantial costs expose us to unanticipated civil and criminal liability or penalties including substantial monetary remedies interrupt or require us to change our business practices in a manner materially adverse to our business result in negative publicity and reputational harm divert resources and the time and attention of management from our business or subject us to other structural or behavioral remedies that adversely affect our business and we have experienced some of 

these adverse effects to varying degrees from time to time 

compliance with our ftc consent order the gdpr the ccpa the eprivacy directive and other regulatory and legislative privacy requirements require significant operational resources and modifications to our business practices and any compliance failures may have a material adverse effect on our business reputation and financial results 

we are engaged in ongoing privacy compliance and oversight efforts including in connection with our modified consent order with the ftc requirements of the gdpr and other regulatory and legislative requirements around the world such as the ccpa and the eprivacy directive in particular we are maintaining a comprehensive privacy program in connection with the ftc consent order that includes substantial management and board of directors oversight stringent operational requirements and reporting obligations prohibitions against making misrepresentations relating to user data a process to regularly certify our compliance with the privacy program to the ftc and regular assessments of our privacy program by an independent thirdparty assessor which has been and will continue to be challenging and costly to maintain and enhance these compliance and oversight efforts are increasing demand on our systems and resources and require significant new and ongoing investments including investments in compliance processes personnel and technical infrastructure we are reallocating resources internally to assist with these efforts and this has had and will continue to have an adverse impact on our other business initiatives in addition these efforts require substantial modifications to our business practices and make some practices such as product and ads development more difficult timeconsuming and costly as a result we believe our ability to develop and launch new features products and services in a timely manner has been and will continue to be adversely affected we also expect that our privacy compliance and oversight efforts will require significant time and attention from our management and board of directors the requirements of the ftc consent order and other privacyrelated laws and regulations are complex and apply broadly to our business and from time to time we notify relevant authorities of instances where we are not in full compliance with these requirements or otherwise discover privacy issues and we expect to continue to do so as any such issues arise in the future in addition regulatory and legislative privacy requirements are constantly evolving and can be subject to significant change and uncertain interpretation if we are unable to successfully implement and comply with the mandates of the ftc consent order gdpr ccpa eprivacy directive or other regulatory or legislative requirements or if we are found to be in violation of the consent order or other applicable requirements we may be subject to regulatory or governmental investigations or lawsuits which may result in significant monetary fines judgments or other penalties and we may also be required to make additional changes to our business practices any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business reputation and financial results 

we may incur liability as a result of information retrieved from or transmitted over the internet or published using our products or as a result of claims related to our products and legislation regulating content on our platform may require us to change our products or business practices and may adversely affect our business and financial results 

we have faced currently face and will continue to face claims relating to information or content that is published or made available on our products including our policies and enforcement actions with respect to such information or content in particular the nature of our business exposes us to claims related to defamation dissemination of misinformation or news hoaxes discrimination harassment intellectual property rights rights of publicity and privacy personal injury torts laws regulating hate speech or other types of content online safety consumer protection and breach of contract among others this risk is enhanced in certain jurisdictions outside the united states where our protection from liability for thirdparty actions may be unclear or where we may be less protected under local laws than we are in the united states for example in april 2019 the european union passed a directive the european copyright directive expanding online platform liability for copyright infringement and regulating certain uses of news content online which member states are currently implementing into their national laws in addition the european union revised the european audiovisual media service directive to apply to online videosharing platforms which member states are expected to implement by 2021 in the united states there have been and continue to be various legislative and executive efforts to remove or restrict the scope of the protections available to online platforms under section 230 of the communications decency act as well as to impose new obligations on online platforms with respect to commerce listings user content counterfeit goods and copyrightinfringing material and our current protections from liability for thirdparty content in the united states could decrease or change we could incur significant costs investigating and defending such claims and if we are found liable significant damages we could also face fines orders restricting or blocking our services in particular geographies or other governmentimposed remedies as a result of content hosted on our services for example legislation in germany and india has resulted in the past and may result in the future in the imposition of fines or other penalties for failure to comply with certain content removal law enforcement cooperation and disclosure obligations numerous other countries in europe the middle east asiapacific and latin america are considering or have implemented similar legislation imposing potentially significant penalties including fines 

service throttling or advertising bans for failure to remove certain types of content or follow certain processes for example we have been subject to fines and may in the future be subject to other penalties in connection with social media legislation in russia and turkey contentrelated legislation also has required us in the past and may require us in the future to change our products or business practices increase our costs or otherwise impact our operations or our ability to provide services in certain geographies for example the european copyright directive requires certain online services to obtain authorizations for copyrighted content or to implement measures to prevent the availability of that content which may require us to make substantial investments in compliance processes member states laws implementing the european copyright directive may also require online platforms to pay for content in addition our compliance costs may significantly increase as a result of the digital services act proposed in the european union which is expected to take effect in 2023 and other contentrelated legislative developments such as online safety bills in ireland and the united kingdom in the united states changes to section 230 of the communications decency act or new state or federal contentrelated legislation may increase our costs or require significant changes to our products business practices or operations which could adversely affect user growth and engagement any of the foregoing events could adversely affect our business and financial results 

payment transactions may subject us to additional regulatory requirements and other risks that could be costly and difficult to comply with or that could harm our business 

several of our products offer payments functionality including enabling our users to purchase virtual and digital goods from developers that offer applications using our payments infrastructure send money to other users and make donations to certain charitable organizations among other activities we are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the united states europe and elsewhere including those governing antimoney laundering and counterterrorist financing money transmission stored value gift cards and other prepaid access instruments electronic funds transfer virtual currency consumer protection charitable fundraising trade sanctions and import and export restrictions depending on how our payments products evolve we may also be subject to other laws and regulations including those governing gambling banking and lending in some jurisdictions the application or interpretation of these laws and regulations is not clear to increase flexibility in how our use of payments may evolve and to mitigate regulatory uncertainty we have received certain payments licenses in the united states the european economic area and other jurisdictions which will generally require us to demonstrate compliance with many domestic and foreign laws in these areas our efforts to comply with these laws and regulations could be costly and result in diversion of management time and effort and may still not guarantee compliance in the event that we are found to be in violation of any such legal or regulatory requirements we may be subject to monetary fines or other penalties such as a cease and desist order or we may be required to make product changes any of which could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results 

in addition we are subject to a variety of additional risks as a result of payments transactions including increased costs and diversion of management time and effort and other resources to deal with bad transactions or customer disputes potential fraudulent or otherwise illegal activity by users developers employees or third parties restrictions on the investment of consumer funds used to transact payments and additional disclosure and reporting requirements we have also launched certain payments functionality on whatsapp and have announced plans to develop digital payments products and services which may subject us to many of the foregoing risks and additional licensing requirements 

our digital payments initiatives subject us to significant regulatory scrutiny and other risks that could adversely affect our business reputation or financial results 

we are pursuing digital payments initiatives such as novi a digital wallet that we expect to offer as both a standalone application and subsequently integrated in other meta products these initiatives may use blockchainbased assets such as the usdp stablecoin issued by paxos trust company which is being used in a novi pilot program in the united states and guatemala beginning in october 2021 our future initiatives to support commerce in the metaverse also may use blockchainbased assets in digital payments use of blockchainbased assets in payments are a relatively new and unproven technology and the laws and regulations surrounding them are uncertain and evolving these digital payments efforts have drawn significant scrutiny from governments and regulators in multiple jurisdictions and we expect that scrutiny to continue we are participating in responses to inquiries from governments and regulators related to our digital payments initiatives and adverse government or regulatory actions or negative publicity resulting from such participation may adversely affect our reputation and harm our business 

as our digital payments initiatives evolve we may be subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the united states and international jurisdictions including those governing payments financial services virtual currency antimoney 

laundering counterterrorism financing trade sanctions data protection tax consumer protection and competition in many jurisdictions the application or interpretation of these laws and regulations is not clear particularly with respect to evolving laws and regulations that are applied to blockchain and digital payments in addition novi has also received state money transmitter licenses in the united states with more pending approval and has other financial services license applications pending in certain other countries that would allow us to conduct digital wallet activities in those countries these licenses laws and regulations as well as any associated inquiries or investigations may delay or impede the development of digital payments products and services we offer increase our operating costs require significant management time and attention or otherwise harm our business 

in addition market acceptance of digital payments products and services is subject to significant uncertainty as such there can be no assurance that digital payments products and services we offer will be made available in a timely manner or at all we do not have significant prior experience with blockchainbased technology which may adversely affect our ability to successfully develop and market such digital payments products and services we will also incur increased costs in connection with these efforts and our investments may not be successful any of these events could adversely affect our business reputation or financial results 

risks related to data security and intellectual property 

security breaches improper access to or disclosure of our data or user data other hacking and phishing attacks on our systems or other cyber incidents could harm our reputation and adversely affect our business 

our industry is prone to cyberattacks by third parties seeking unauthorized access to our data or users data or to disrupt our ability to provide service our products and services involve the collection storage processing and transmission of a large amount of data any failure to prevent or mitigate security breaches and improper access to or disclosure of our data or user data including personal information content or payment information from users or information from marketers could result in the loss modification disclosure destruction or other misuse of such data which could harm our business and reputation and diminish our competitive position in addition computer malware viruses social engineering such as spear phishing attacks scraping and general hacking continue to be prevalent in our industry have occurred on our systems in the past and will occur on our systems in the future we also regularly encounter attempts to create false or undesirable user accounts purchase ads or take other actions on our platform for purposes such as spamming spreading misinformation or other objectionable ends as a result of our prominence the size of our user base the types and volume of personal data and content on our systems and the evolving nature of our products and services including our efforts involving new and emerging technologies we believe that we are a particularly attractive target for such breaches and attacks including from nation states and highly sophisticated statesponsored or otherwise wellfunded actors our efforts to address undesirable activity on our platform also increase the risk of retaliatory attacks such breaches and attacks may cause interruptions to the services we provide degrade the user experience cause users or marketers to lose confidence and trust in our products impair our internal systems or result in financial harm to us our efforts to protect our company data or the information we receive and to disable undesirable activities on our platform may also be unsuccessful due to software bugs or other technical malfunctions employee contractor or vendor error or malfeasance including defects or vulnerabilities in our vendors information technology systems or offerings government surveillance breaches of physical security of our facilities or technical infrastructure or other threats that evolve in addition third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or users to disclose information in order to gain access to our data or our users data cyberattacks continue to evolve in sophistication and volume and inherently may be difficult to detect for long periods of time although we have developed systems and processes that are designed to protect our data and user data to prevent data loss to disable undesirable accounts and activities on our platform and to prevent or detect security breaches we cannot assure you that such measures will provide absolute security that we will be able to react in a timely manner or that our remediation efforts will be successful the changes in our work environment as a result of the covid19 pandemic could also impact the security of our systems as well as our ability to protect against attacks and detect and respond to them quickly 

in addition some of our developers or other partners such as those that help us measure the effectiveness of ads may receive or store information provided by us or by our users through mobile or web applications integrated with our products we provide limited information to such third parties based on the scope of services provided to us however if these third parties or developers fail to adopt or adhere to adequate data security practices or in the event of a breach of their networks our data or our users data may be improperly accessed used or disclosed 

we experience such cyberattacks and other security incidents of varying degrees from time to time and we incur 

significant costs in protecting against or remediating such incidents in addition we are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the united states and abroad relating to cybersecurity and data protection as well as obligations under our modified consent order with the ftc as a result affected users or government authorities could initiate legal or regulatory actions against us in connection with any actual or perceived security breaches or improper access to or disclosure of data which has occurred in the past and which could cause us to incur significant expense and liability or result in orders or consent decrees forcing us to modify our business practices such incidents or our efforts to remediate such incidents may also result in a decline in our active user base or engagement levels any of these events could have a material and adverse effect on our business reputation or financial results 

for example in september 2018 we announced our discovery of a thirdparty cyberattack that exploited a vulnerability in facebooks code to steal user access tokens which were then used to access certain profile information from approximately 29 million user accounts on facebook the events surrounding this cyberattack became the subject of irish data protection commission and other government inquiries any such inquiries could subject us to substantial fines and costs require us to change our business practices divert resources and the attention of management from our business or adversely affect our business 

we anticipate that our ongoing efforts related to privacy safety security and content review will identify additional instances of misuse of user data or other undesirable activity by third parties on our platform 

in addition to our efforts to mitigate cybersecurity risks we are making significant investments in privacy safety security and content review efforts to combat misuse of our services and user data by third parties including investigations and audits of platform applications as well as other enforcement efforts as a result of these efforts we have discovered and announced and anticipate that we will continue to discover and announce additional incidents of misuse of user data or other undesirable activity by third parties we may not discover all such incidents or activity whether as a result of our data or technical limitations including our lack of visibility over our encrypted services the scale of activity on our platform challenges related to our personnel working remotely during the covid19 pandemic the allocation of resources to other projects or other factors and we may be notified of such incidents or activity by the independent privacy assessor required under our modified consent order with the ftc the media or other third parties such incidents and activities have in the past and may in the future include the use of user data or our systems in a manner inconsistent with our terms contracts or policies the existence of false or undesirable user accounts election interference improper advertising practices activities that threaten peoples safety on or offline or instances of spamming scraping data harvesting unsecured datasets or spreading misinformation we may also be unsuccessful in our efforts to enforce our policies or otherwise remediate any such incidents consequences of any of the foregoing developments include negative effects on user trust and engagement harm to our reputation and brands changes to our business practices in a manner adverse to our business and adverse effects on our business and financial results any such developments may also subject us to additional litigation and regulatory inquiries which could subject us to monetary penalties and damages divert managements time and attention and lead to enhanced regulatory oversight 

our products and internal systems rely on software and hardware that is highly technical and any errors bugs or vulnerabilities in these systems or failures to address or mitigate technical limitations in our systems could adversely affect our business 

our products and internal systems rely on software and hardware including software and hardware developed or maintained internally andor by third parties that is highly technical and complex in addition our products and internal systems depend on the ability of such software and hardware to store retrieve process and manage immense amounts of data the software and hardware on which we rely has contained and will in the future contain errors bugs or vulnerabilities and our systems are subject to certain technical limitations that may compromise our ability to meet our objectives some errors bugs or vulnerabilities inherently may be difficult to detect and may only be discovered after the code has been released for external or internal use for example in september 2018 we announced our discovery of a thirdparty cyberattack that exploited a vulnerability in facebooks code to steal user access tokens and access certain profile information from user accounts on facebook errors bugs vulnerabilities design defects or technical limitations within the software and hardware on which we rely or human error in using such systems have in the past led to and may in the future lead to outcomes including a negative experience for users and marketers who use our products compromised ability of our products to perform in a manner consistent with our terms contracts or policies delayed product introductions or enhancements targeting measurement or billing errors compromised ability to protect the data of our users andor our intellectual property or other data or reductions in our ability to provide some or all of our services for example we make 

commitments to our users as to how their data will be used within and across our products and our systems are subject to errors bugs and technical limitations that may prevent us from fulfilling these commitments reliably in addition any errors bugs vulnerabilities or defects in our systems or the software and hardware on which we rely failures to properly address or mitigate the technical limitations in our systems or associated degradations or interruptions of service or failures to fulfill our commitments to our users have in the past led to and may in the future lead to outcomes including damage to our reputation loss of users loss of marketers loss of revenue regulatory inquiries litigation or liability for fines damages or other remedies any of which could adversely affect our business and financial results 

if we are unable to protect our intellectual property the value of our brands and other intangible assets may be diminished and our business may be adversely affected 

we rely and expect to continue to rely on a combination of confidentiality assignment and license agreements with our employees consultants and third parties with whom we have relationships as well as trademark copyright patent trade secret and domain name protection laws to protect our proprietary rights in the united states and internationally we have filed various applications for protection of certain aspects of our intellectual property and we currently hold a significant number of registered trademarks and issued patents in multiple jurisdictions and have acquired patents and patent applications from third parties third parties may knowingly or unknowingly infringe our proprietary rights third parties may challenge proprietary rights held by us and pending and future trademark and patent applications may not be approved in addition effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which we operate or intend to operate our business in any or all of these cases we may be required to expend significant time and expense in order to prevent infringement or to enforce our rights although we have generally taken measures to protect our proprietary rights there can be no assurance that others will not offer products or concepts that are substantially similar to ours and compete with our business in addition we regularly contribute software source code under open source licenses and have made other technology we developed available under other open licenses and we include open source software in our products as a result of our open source contributions and the use of open source in our products we may license or be required to license or disclose code andor innovations that turn out to be material to our business and may also be exposed to increased litigation risk if the protection of our proprietary rights is inadequate to prevent unauthorized use or appropriation by third parties the value of our brands and other intangible assets may be diminished and competitors may be able to more effectively mimic our products services and methods of operations any of these events could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results 

we are currently and expect to be in the future party to patent lawsuits and other intellectual property rights claims that are expensive and time consuming and if resolved adversely could have a significant impact on our business financial condition or results of operations 

companies in the internet technology and media industries own large numbers of patents copyrights trademarks and trade secrets and frequently enter into litigation based on allegations of infringement misappropriation or other violations of intellectual property or other rights in addition various nonpracticing entities that own patents and other intellectual property rights often attempt to aggressively assert their rights in order to extract value from technology companies furthermore from time to time we may introduce or acquire new products including in areas where we historically have not competed which could increase our exposure to patent and other intellectual property claims from competitors and nonpracticing entities 

from time to time we receive notice from patent holders and other parties alleging that certain of our products and services or user content infringe their intellectual property rights we presently are involved in a number of intellectual property lawsuits and as we face increasing competition and gain an increasingly high profile we expect the number of patent and other intellectual property claims against us to grow defending patent and other intellectual property litigation is costly and can impose a significant burden on management and employees and there can be no assurances that favorable final outcomes will be obtained in all cases in addition plaintiffs may seek and we may become subject to preliminary or provisional rulings in the course of any such litigation including potential preliminary injunctions requiring us to cease some or all of our operations we may decide to settle such lawsuits and disputes on terms that are unfavorable to us similarly if any litigation to which we are a party is resolved adversely we may be subject to an unfavorable judgment that may not be reversed upon appeal the terms of such a settlement or judgment may require us to cease some or all of our operations or pay substantial amounts to the other party in addition we may have to seek a license to continue practices found to be in violation of a third partys rights which may not be available on reasonable terms or at all and may significantly increase our operating costs and expenses as a result we may also be required to develop alternative noninfringing technology or 

practices or discontinue the practices the development of alternative noninfringing technology or practices could require significant effort and expense could result in less effective technology or practices or otherwise negatively affect the user experience or may not be feasible we have experienced unfavorable outcomes in such disputes and litigation in the past and our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected as a result of an unfavorable resolution of the disputes and litigation referred to above

our class b common stock has ten votes per share and our class a common stock has one vote per share stockholders who hold shares of class b common stock including certain of our executive officers employees and directors and their affiliates together hold a substantial majority of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock because of the tentoone voting ratio between our class b and class a common stock the holders of our class b common stock collectively control a majority of the combined voting power of our common stock and therefore are able to control all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval so long as the shares of class b common stock represent at least 91 of all outstanding shares of our class a and class b common stock this concentrated control will limit or preclude your ability to influence corporate matters for the foreseeable future 

transfers by holders of class b common stock will generally result in those shares converting to class a common stock subject to limited exceptions such as certain transfers effected for estate planning or charitable purposes the conversion of class b common stock to class a common stock will have the effect over time of increasing the relative voting power of those holders of class b common stock who retain their shares in the long term if for example mr zuckerberg retains a significant portion of his holdings of class b common stock for an extended period of time he could in the future continue to control a majority of the combined voting power of our outstanding capital stock 

our status as a controlled company could make our class a common stock less attractive to some investors or otherwise harm our stock price 

because we qualify as a controlled company under the corporate governance rules for nasdaqlisted companies we are not required to have a majority of our board of directors be independent nor are we required to have a compensation committee or an independent nominating function in the future we could elect not to have a majority of our board of directors be independent or not to have a compensation committee or an independent nominating function accordingly should the interests of our controlling stockholder differ from those of other stockholders the other stockholders may not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the corporate governance rules for nasdaqlisted companies our status as a controlled company could make our class a common stock less attractive to some investors or otherwise harm our stock price 

delaware law and provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could make a merger tender offer or proxy contest difficult thereby depressing the trading price of our class a common stock 

our status as a delaware corporation and the antitakeover provisions of the delaware general corporation law may discourage delay or prevent a change in control by prohibiting us from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years after the person becomes an interested stockholder even if a change of control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders in addition our current certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that may make the acquisition of our company more difficult including the following 

• until the first date on which the outstanding shares of our class b common stock represent less than 35 of the combined voting power of our common stock any transaction that would result in a change in control of our 

company requires the approval of a majority of our outstanding class b common stock voting as a separate class 

• we currently have a dual class common stock structure which provides mr zuckerberg with the ability to control the outcome of matters requiring stockholder approval even if he owns significantly less than a majority of the shares of our outstanding class a and class b common stock 

• when the outstanding shares of our class b common stock represent less than a majority of the combined voting power of common stock certain amendments to our certificate of incorporation or bylaws will require the approval of twothirds of the combined vote of our thenoutstanding shares of class a and class b common stock 

• when the outstanding shares of our class b common stock represent less than a majority of the combined voting power of our common stock vacancies on our board of directors will be able to be filled only by our board of directors and not by stockholders 

• when the outstanding shares of our class b common stock represent less than a majority of the combined voting power of our common stock our board of directors will be classified into three classes of directors with staggered threeyear terms and directors will only be able to be removed from office for cause 

• when the outstanding shares of our class b common stock represent less than a majority of the combined voting power of our common stock our stockholders will only be able to take action at a meeting of stockholders and not by written consent 

• only our chairman our chief executive officer our president or a majority of our board of directors are authorized to call a special meeting of stockholders 

• advance notice procedures apply for stockholders to nominate candidates for election as directors or to bring matters before an annual meeting of stockholders 

• our certificate of incorporation authorizes undesignated preferred stock the terms of which may be established and shares of which may be issued without stockholder approval and 

• certain litigation against us can only be brought in delaware

 item 3 legal proceedings 

beginning on march 20 2018 multiple putative class actions and derivative actions were filed in state and federal courts in the united states and elsewhere against us and certain of our directors and officers alleging violations of securities laws breach of fiduciary duties and other causes of action in connection with our platform and user data practices as well as the misuse of certain data by a developer that shared such data with third parties in violation of our terms and policies and seeking unspecified damages and injunctive relief beginning on july 27 2018 two putative class actions were filed in federal court in the united states against us and certain of our directors and officers alleging violations of securities laws in connection with the disclosure of our earnings results for the second quarter of 2018 and seeking unspecified damages these two actions subsequently were transferred and consolidated in the us district court for the northern district of california with the putative securities class action described above relating to our platform and user data practices on september 25 2019 the district court granted our motion to dismiss the consolidated putative securities class action with leave to amend on november 15 2019 a second amended complaint was filed in the consolidated putative securities class action on august 7 2020 the district court granted our motion to dismiss the second amended complaint with leave to amend on october 16 2020 a third amended complaint was filed in the consolidated putative securities class action on december 20 2021 the district court granted our motion to dismiss the third amended complaint with prejudice on january 17 2022 the plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal of the order dismissing their case in addition our platform and user data practices as well as the events surrounding the misuse of certain data by a developer became the subject of us federal trade commission ftc state attorneys general and other government inquiries in the united states europe and other jurisdictions we entered into a settlement and modified consent order to resolve the ftc inquiry which took effect in april 2020 and required us to pay a penalty of 50 billion and to significantly enhance our practices and processes for privacy compliance and oversight the state attorneys general inquiry and certain government inquiries in other jurisdictions remain ongoing and could subject us to additional substantial fines and costs require us to change our business practices divert resources and the attention of management from our business or adversely affect our business on july 16 2021 a stockholder derivative action was filed in delaware chancery court against certain of our directors and officers asserting breach of fiduciary duty and related claims relating to our historical platform and user data practices as well as our settlement with the ftc on july 20 2021 other stockholders filed an amended derivative complaint in a related delaware chancery court action asserting breach of fiduciary duty and related claims against certain of our current and former directors and officers in connection with our historical platform and user data practices on november 4 2021 the lead plaintiffs filed a second amended and consolidated complaint in the stockholder derivative action we believe the lawsuits described above are without merit and we are vigorously defending them 

we also notify the irish data protection commission idpc our lead european union privacy regulator under the general data protection regulation gdpr of certain other personal data breaches and privacy issues and are subject to inquiries and investigations by the idpc and other european regulators regarding various aspects of our regulatory compliance for example in august 2020 we received a preliminary draft decision from the idpc that preliminarily concluded that meta platforms irelands reliance on standard contractual clauses in respect of european user data does not achieve compliance with the gdpr and preliminarily proposed that such transfers of user data from the european union to the united states should therefore be suspended meta platforms ireland challenged procedural aspects of this idpc inquiry in a judicial review commenced in the irish high court in september 2020 on may 14 2021 the court rejected meta platforms irelands procedural challenges and the inquiry subsequently recommenced we believe a final decision in this 

inquiry may issue as early as the first half of 2022 for additional information see part i item 1a risk factors—our business is subject to complex and evolving us and foreign laws and regulations regarding privacy data use and data protection content competition safety and consumer protection ecommerce and other matters in this annual report on form 10k any such inquiries or investigations could subject us to substantial fines and costs require us to change our business practices divert resources and the attention of management from our business or adversely affect our business 

in addition we are subject to various litigation and government inquiries and investigations formal or informal by competition authorities in the united states europe and other jurisdictions such investigations inquiries and lawsuits concern among other things our business practices in the areas of social networking or social media services digital advertising andor mobile or online applications as well as our acquisitions for example in june 2019 we were informed by the ftc that it had opened an antitrust investigation of our company on december 9 2020 the ftc filed a complaint against us in the us district court for the district of columbia alleging that we engaged in anticompetitive conduct and unfair methods of competition in violation of section 5 of the federal trade commission act and section 2 of the sherman act including by acquiring instagram in 2012 and whatsapp in 2014 and by maintaining conditions on access to our platform in addition beginning in the third quarter of 2019 we became the subject of antitrust investigations by the us department of justice and state attorneys general on december 9 2020 the attorneys general from 46 states the territory of guam and the district of columbia filed a complaint against us in the us district court for the district of columbia alleging that we engaged in anticompetitive conduct in violation of section 2 of the sherman act including by acquiring instagram in 2012 and whatsapp in 2014 and by maintaining conditions on access to our platform the complaint also alleged that we violated section 7 of the clayton act by acquiring instagram and whatsapp the complaints of the ftc and attorneys general both sought a permanent injunction against our companys alleged violations of the antitrust laws and other equitable relief including divestiture or reconstruction of instagram and whatsapp on june 28 2021 the court granted our motions to dismiss the complaints filed by the ftc and attorneys general dismissing the ftcs complaint with leave to amend and dismissing the attorneys generals case without prejudice on july 28 2021 the attorneys general filed a notice of appeal of the order dismissing their case on august 19 2021 the ftc filed an amended complaint and on october 4 2021 we filed a motion to dismiss this amended complaint on january 11 2022 the court denied our motion to dismiss the ftcs amended complaint multiple putative class actions have also been filed in state and federal courts in the united states against us alleging violations of antitrust laws and other causes of action in connection with these acquisitions and other alleged anticompetitive conduct and seeking damages and unspecified injunctive relief several of the cases brought on behalf of certain advertisers and users were consolidated in the us district court for the northern district of california on january 14 2022 the court granted in part and denied in part our motion to dismiss the consolidated actions we believe these lawsuits are without merit and we are vigorously defending them the result of such litigation investigations or inquiries could subject us to substantial monetary remedies and costs interrupt or require us to change our business practices divert resources and the attention of management from our business or subject us to other structural or behavioral remedies that adversely affect our business 

we are also subject to other government inquiries and investigations relating to our business activities and disclosure practices for example beginning in september 2021 we became subject to government investigations and requests relating to a former employees allegations and release of internal company documents concerning among other things our algorithms advertising and user metrics and content enforcement practices as well as misinformation and other undesirable activity on our platform and user wellbeing  beginning on october 27 2021 multiple putative class actions were filed in federal court in the united states against us and certain of our directors and officers alleging violations of securities laws in connection with the same matters we believe these lawsuits are without merit and we are vigorously defending them 

in addition we are subject to litigation and other proceedings involving law enforcement and other regulatory agencies including in particular in brazil russia and other countries in europe in order to ascertain the precise scope of our legal obligations to comply with the requests of those agencies including our obligation to disclose user information in particular circumstances a number of such instances have resulted in the assessment of fines and penalties against us we believe we have multiple legal grounds to satisfy these requests or prevail against associated fines and penalties and we intend to vigorously defend such fines and penalties 

we are also party to various other legal proceedings claims and regulatory tax or government inquiries and investigations that arise in the ordinary course of business and we may in the future be subject to additional legal proceedings and disputes

to supplement our consolidated financial statements which are prepared and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap we present revenue on a constant currency basis and free cash flow which are nongaap financial measures revenue on a constant currency basis is presented in the section entitled  — revenue — foreign exchange impact on revenue to calculate revenue on a constant currency basis we translated revenue for the full year 2021 using 2020 monthly exchange rates for our settlement or billing currencies other than the us dollar for a full description of our free cash flow nongaap measure see the section entitled  — liquidity and capital resources—free cash flow 

these nongaap financial measures are not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for or superior to financial information prepared and presented in accordance with gaap these measures may be different from non‑gaap financial measures used by other companies limiting their usefulness for comparison purposes moreover presentation of revenue on a constant currency basis is provided for yearoveryear comparison purposes and investors should be cautioned that the effect of changing foreign currency exchange rates has an actual effect on our operating results we believe these nongaap financial measures provide investors with useful supplemental information about the financial performance of our business enable comparison of financial results between periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in operating our business 

executive overview of full year 2021 results 

our key community metrics and financial results for 2021 are as follows 

family of apps metrics 

• family daily active people dap was 282 billion on average for december 2021 an increase of 8 yearoveryear 

• family monthly active people map was 359 billion as of december 31 2021 an increase of 9 yearoveryear

• ad impressions delivered across our family of apps increased by 10 yearoveryear in 2021 and the average price per ad increased by 24 yearoveryear in 2021 

consolidated and segment results 

beginning in the fourth quarter of 2021 we report our financial results based on two reportable segments family of apps foa and reality labs rl foa includes facebook instagram messenger whatsapp and other services rl includes our augmented and virtual reality related consumer hardware software and content 



• net income was 3937 billion with diluted earnings per share of 1377 for the year ended december 31 2021 

• capital expenditures including principal payments on finance leases were 1924 billion for the year ended december 31 2021

• cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities were 480 billion as of december 31 2021 

• headcount was 71970 as of december 31 2021 an increase of 23 yearoveryear 

our mission is to give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together all of our products including our apps share the vision of helping to bring the metaverse to life 

in 2021 we continued to focus on our main revenue growth priorities i helping marketers use our products to connect with consumers where they are and ii making our ads more relevant and effective we also continued to invest based on the following company priorities i continue making progress on the major social issues facing the internet and our company including privacy safety and security ii build new experiences that meaningfully improve peoples lives today and set the stage for even bigger improvements in the future iii keep building our business by supporting the millions of businesses that rely on our services to grow and create jobs and iv communicate more transparently about what were doing and the role our services play in the world 

our advertising revenue growth in the second half of 2021 was adversely affected by reduced marketer spending as a result of limitations on our ad targeting and measurement tools arising from changes to the ios operating system we expect that future advertising revenue growth will continue to be adversely affected by these and other limitations on our ad targeting and measurement tools arising from changes to the regulatory environment and thirdparty mobile operating systems and browsers 

our business and results of operations have also been impacted by the covid19 pandemic and the preventative measures implemented by authorities from time to time to help limit the spread of the illness which have caused and are continuing to cause business slowdowns or shutdowns in certain affected countries and regions beginning in the first quarter of 2020 we experienced significant increases in the size and engagement of our active user base across a number of regions as a result of the covid19 pandemic more recently we have seen these pandemicrelated trends subside particularly in certain developed markets we are unable to predict the impact of the pandemic on user growth and engagement with any certainty and these trends may continue to be subject to volatility 

the covid19 pandemic has also had a varied impact on the demand for and pricing of our ads from period to period while we experienced a reduction in demand and a related decline in pricing during the onset of the pandemic we believe the pandemic subsequently contributed to an acceleration in the growth of online commerce particularly during the second half of 2020 and we experienced increasing demand for advertising as a result of this trend more recently we believe this growth has moderated in many regions which to some extent adversely affected our advertising revenue growth in the second half of 2021 we may experience reduced advertising demand and related declines in pricing in future periods to the extent this trend continues which could adversely affect our advertising revenue growth however the impact of the 

pandemic on user growth and engagement the demand for and pricing of our advertising services as well as on our overall results of operations remains highly uncertain for the foreseeable future 

user growth and engagement were also impacted by a number of other factors in the second half of 2021 for example competitive products and services have reduced some users engagement with our products and services and in response to competitive pressures we have introduced new features such as reels which is growing in usage but is not currently monetized at the same rate as our feed or stories products we also saw a deceleration in our community growth rates as the size of our community continued to increase in addition we experienced yearoveryear declines in ad impressions delivered in the united states  canada region these trends adversely affected advertising revenue growth in the second half of 2021 and we expect will continue to affect our advertising revenue growth in the foreseeable future other global and regional business and macroeconomic conditions also have had and we believe will continue to have an impact on our user growth and engagement and advertising revenue growth 

we anticipate that additional investments in our data center capacity servers network infrastructure and office facilities as well as scaling our headcount to support our growth including in our reality labs initiatives will continue to drive expense growth in 2022 we expect 2022 capit al expenditures to be in the range of 2934 billion and total expenses to be in the range of 9095 billion in 2022 we also expect that our yearoveryear total expense growth rates may significantly exceed our yearoveryear revenue growth rates which would adversely affect our operating margin and profitability 

trends in our family metrics 

the numbers for our key family metrics our dap map and average revenue per person arpp do not include users on our other products unless they would otherwise qualify as dap or map respectively based on their other activities on our family products 

trends in the number of people in our community affect our revenue and financial results by influencing the number of ads we are able to show the value of our ads to marketers the volume of payments transactions as well as our expenses and capital expenditures substantially all of our daily and monthly active people as defined below access our family products on mobile devices 

• daily active people dap we define a daily active person as a registered and loggedin user of facebook instagram messenger andor whatsapp collectively our family of products who visited at least one of these family products through a mobile device application or using a web or mobile browser on a given day we do not require people to use a common identifier or link their accounts to use multiple products in our family and therefore must seek to attribute multiple user accounts within and across products to individual people our calculations of dap rely upon complex techniques algorithms and machine learning models that seek to estimate the underlying number of unique people using one or more of these products including by matching user accounts within an individual product and across multiple products when we believe they are attributable to a single person and counting such group of accounts as one person as these techniques and models require significant judgment are developed based on internal reviews of limited samples of user accounts and are calibrated against user survey data there is necessarily some margin of error in our estimates we view dap and dap as a percentage of map as measures of engagement across our products for additional information see the section entitled limitations of key metrics and other data in this annual report on form 10k 



note we report the numbers of dap and map as specific amounts but these numbers are estimates of the numbers of unique people using our products and are subject to statistical variances and errors while we expect the error margin for these estimates to vary from period to period we estimate that such margin generally will be approximately 3 of our worldwide map at our scale it is very difficult to attribute multiple user accounts within and across products to individual people and it is possible that the actual numbers of unique people using our products may vary significantly from our estimates potentially beyond our estimated error margins for additional information see the section entitled limitations of key metrics and other data in this annual report on form 10k in the second quarter of 2020 we updated our family metrics calculations to reflect recent data from a periodic whatsapp user survey and to incorporate certain methodology improvements and we estimate such updates contributed an aggregate of approximately 40 million dap to our reported worldwide dap in june 2020 in the first quarter of 2021 we updated our family metrics calculations to maintain calibration of our models against recent user survey data and we estimate such update contributed an aggregate of approximately 60 million dap to our reported worldwide dap in march 2021 

worldwide dap increased 8 to 282 billion on average during december 2021 from 260 billion during december 2020 

• monthly active people map we define a monthly active person as a registered and loggedin user of one or more family products who visited at least one of these family products through a mobile device application or using a web or mobile browser in the last 30 days as of the date of measurement we do not require people to use a common identifier or link their accounts to use multiple products in our family and therefore must seek to attribute multiple user accounts within and across products to individual people our calculations of map rely upon complex techniques algorithms and machine learning models that seek to estimate the underlying number of unique people using one or more of these products including by matching user accounts within an individual product and across multiple products when we believe they are attributable to a single person and counting such group of accounts as one person as these techniques and models require significant judgment are developed based on internal reviews of limited samples of user accounts and are calibrated against user survey data there is necessarily some margin of error in our estimates we view map as a measure of the size of our global active community of people using our products for additional information see the section entitled limitations of key metrics and other data in this annual report on form 10k 

note we report the numbers of dap and map as specific amounts but these numbers are estimates of the numbers of unique people using our products and are subject to statistical variances and errors while we expect the error margin for these estimates to vary from period to period we estimate that such margin generally will be approximately 3 of our worldwide map at our scale it is very difficult to attribute multiple user accounts within and across products to individual people and it is possible that the actual numbers of unique people using our products may vary significantly from our estimates potentially beyond our estimated error margins for additional information see the section entitled limitations of key metrics and other data in this annual report on form 10k in the second quarter of 2020 we updated our family metrics calculations to reflect recent data from a periodic whatsapp user survey and to incorporate certain methodology improvements and we estimate such updates contributed an aggregate of approximately 50 million map to our reported worldwide map in june 2020 in the first quarter of 2021 we updated our family metrics calculations to maintain calibration of our models against recent user survey data and we estimate such update contributed an aggregate of approximately 70 million map to our reported worldwide map in march 2021 

as of december 31 2021 we had 359 billion map an increase of 9 from 330 billion as of december 31 2020 

• average revenue per person arpp we define arpp as our total revenue during a given quarter divided by the average of the number of map at the beginning and end of the quarter while arpp includes all sources of revenue the number of map used in this calculation only includes users of our family products as described in the definition of map above we estimate that the share of revenue from users who are not also map was not material 



note nonadvertising revenue includes rl revenue generated from the delivery of consumer hardware products and foa other revenue which consists of net fees we receive from developers using our payments infrastructure and revenue from various other sources 

our annual worldwide arpp in 2021 which represents the sum of quarterly arpp during such period was 3368 an increase of 22 from 2020 

trends in our facebook user metrics 

the numbers for our key facebook metrics our daus maus and average revenue per user arpu do not include users on instagram whatsapp or our other products unless they would otherwise qualify as daus or maus respectively based on their other activities on facebook 

trends in the number of users affect our revenue and financial results by influencing the number of ads we are able to show the value of our ads to marketers the volume of payments transactions as well as our expenses and capital expenditures substantially all of our daily and monthly active users as defined below access facebook on mobile devices 

• daily active users daus we define a daily active user as a registered and loggedin facebook user who visited facebook through our website or a mobile device or used our messenger application and is also a registered facebook user on a given day we view daus and daus as a percentage of maus as measures of user engagement on facebook 







note for purposes of reporting daus maus and arpu by geographic region europe includes all users in russia and turkey and rest of world includes all users in africa latin america and the middle east 

worldwide daus increased 5 to 193 billion on aver age during december 2021 from 184 billion during december 2020 users in india bangladesh and vietnam represented the top three sources of growth in daus during december 2021 relative to the same period in 2020 

• monthly active users maus we define a monthly active user as a registered and loggedin facebook user who visited facebook through our website or a mobile device or used our messenger application and is also a registered facebook user in the last 30 days as of the date of measurement maus are a measure of the size of our global active user community on facebook 

as of december 31 2021 we had 291 billion maus an increase of 4 from december 31 2020 users in india vietnam and bangladesh represented the top three sources of growth in 2021 relative to the same period in 2020 

trends in our monetization by facebook user geography 

we calculate our revenue by user geography based on our estimate of the geography in which ad impressions are delivered virtual and digital goods are purchased or consumer hardware products are shipped we define arpu as our total revenue in a given geography during a given quarter divided by the average of the number of maus in the geography at the beginning and end of the quarter while arpu includes all sources of revenue the number of maus used in this calculation only includes users of facebook and messenger as described in the definition of mau above while the share of revenue from users who are not also facebook or messenger maus has grown over time we estimate that revenue from users who are facebook or messenger maus represents the substantial majority of our total revenue see average revenue per person arpp above for our estimates of trends in our monetization of our family products the geography of our users affects our revenue and financial results because we currently monetize users in different geographies at different average rates our revenue and arpu in regions such as united states  canada and europe are relatively higher primarily due to the size and maturity of those online and mobile advertising markets for example arpu in 2021 in the united states  canada region was more than 12 times higher than in the asiapacific region 





 

note nonadvertising revenue includes rl revenue generated from the delivery of consumer hardware products and foa other revenue which consists of net fees we receive from developers using our payments infrastructure and revenue from various other sources 

our revenue by user geography in the charts above is geographically apportioned based on our estimation of the geographic location of our users when they perform a revenuegenerating activity this allocation differs from our revenue disaggregated by geography disclosure in note 2 — revenue in our consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 financial statements and supplemental data where revenue is geographically apportioned based on the addresses of our customers 

our annual worldwide arpu in 2021 which represents the sum of quarterly arpu during such period was 4096 an increase of 28 from 2020 for 2021 arpu increased by 40 in rest of world 35 in europe 31 in the united states  canada and 26 in asia‑pacific as compared with 2020 in addition user growth was more rapid in geographies with relatively lower arpu such as asia‑pacific and rest of world we expect that user growth in the future will be primarily concentrated in those regions where arpu is relatively lower such that worldwide arpu may continue to increase at a slower rate relative to arpu in any geographic region or potentially decrease even if arpu increases in each geographic region 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with us gaap the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue costs and expenses and related disclosures on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates and assumptions based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances our actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if the nature of the estimates or assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change and the impact of the estimates and assumptions on our consolidated financial statements is material we believe that the assumptions and estimates associated with gross vs net in revenue recognition valuation of equity investments income taxes loss contingencies and valuation of longlived assets including goodwill intangible assets and property and equipment and their associated estimated useful lives when applicable have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements therefore we consider these to be our critical accounting policies and estimates for further information on all of our significant accounting policies see note 1 — summary of significant accounting policies in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data of this annual report on form 10k 

gross vs net in revenue recognition 

for revenue generated from arrangements that involve third parties there is significant judgment in evaluating whether we are the principal and report revenue on a gross basis or the agent and report revenue on a net basis in this assessment we consider if we obtain control of the specified goods or services before they are transferred to the customer as well as other indicators such as the party primarily responsible for fulfillment inventory risk and discretion in establishing price the assessment of whether we are considered the principal or the agent in a transaction could impact our revenue and cost of revenue recognized on the consolidated statements of income 

valuation of equity investments 

for our equity securities without readily determinable fair values accounted for using the measurement alternative determining whether an equity security issued by the same issuer is similar to the equity security we hold may require judgment in a assessment of differences in rights and obligations associated with the instruments such as voting rights distribution rights and preferences and conversion features and b adjustments to the observable price for differences such as but not limited to rights and obligations control premium liquidity or principal or most advantageous markets in addition the identification of observable transactions will depend on the timely reporting of these transactions from our investee companies which may occur in a period subsequent to when the transactions take place therefore our fair value adjustment for these observable transactions may occur in a period subsequent to when the transaction actually occurred for equity investments we perform a qualitative assessment at each reporting date to determine whether there are triggering events for impairment the qualitative assessment considers factors such as but not limited to the investees financial condition and business outlook industry and sector performance regulatory economic or technological environment operational and financing cash flows and other relevant events and factors affecting the investee when indicators of impairment exist we estimate the fair value of our equity investments using the market approach andor the income approach and recognize impairment loss in the consolidated statements of income if the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value estimating fair value requires judgment and use of estimates such as discount rates forecast cash flows holding period and market data of comparable companies among others 

income taxes 

we are subject to income taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes and income tax assets and liabilities including evaluating uncertainties in the application of accounting principles and complex tax laws 

we recognize tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if we believe that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position these uncertain tax positions include our estimates for transfer pricing that have been developed based upon analyses of appropriate 

armslength prices similarly our estimates related to uncertain tax positions concerning research and development tax credits are based on an assessment of whether our available documentation corroborating the nature of our activities supporting the tax credits will be sufficient although we believe that we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions including net interest and penalties we can provide no assurance that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be materially different we make adjustments to these reserves in accordance with the income tax accounting guidance when facts and circumstances change such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts recorded such differences will affect the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made and could have a material impact on our financial condition and operating results 

loss contingencies 

we are involved in legal proceedings claims and regulatory tax or government inquiries and investigations that arise in the ordinary course of business certain of these matters include speculative claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts of damages additionally we are required to comply with various legal and regulatory obligations around the world and we regularly become subject to new laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate the requirements for complying with these obligations may be uncertain and subject to interpretation and enforcement by regulatory and other authorities and any failure to comply with such obligations could eventually lead to asserted legal or regulatory action with respect to these matters asserted and unasserted we evaluate the associated developments on a regular basis and accrue a liability when we believe that it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated if we determine there is a reasonable possibility that we may incur a loss and the loss or range of loss can be reasonably estimated we disclose the possible loss in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements to the extent material 

we review the developments in our contingencies that could affect the amount of the provisions that have been previously recorded and the matters and related reasonably possible losses disclosed we make adjustments to our provisions and changes to our disclosures accordingly to reflect the merits of our defenses and the impact of negotiations settlements regulatory proceedings rulings advice of legal counsel and updated information significant judgment is required to determine the probability of loss and the estimated amount of loss including when and if the probability and estimate has changed for asserted and unasserted matters certain factors in particular have resulted in significant changes to these estimates and judgments in prior quarters based on updated information available for example in certain jurisdictions where we operate fines and penalties may be the result of new laws and preliminary interpretations regarding the basis of assessing damages which may make it difficult to estimate what such fines and penalties would amount to if successfully asserted against us in addition certain government inquiries and investigations such as matters before our lead european union privacy regulator the idpc are subject to review by other regulatory bodies before decisions are finalized which can lead to significant changes in the outcome of an inquiry as a result of these and other factors we reasonably expect that our estimates and judgments with respect to our contingencies may continue to be revised in future quarters 

the ultimate outcome of these matters such as whether the likelihood of loss is remote reasonably possible or probable or if and when the reasonably possible range of loss is estimable is inherently uncertain therefore if one or more of these matters were resolved against us for amounts in excess of managements estimates of losses our results of operations and financial condition including in a particular reporting period in which any such outcome becomes probable and estimable could be materially adversely affected see note 11 — commitments and contingencies and note 14 — income taxes of the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data and part i item 3 legal proceedings of this annual report on form 10k for additional information regarding these contingencies 

valuation of longlived assets including goodwill intangible assets and property and equipment and estimated useful lives 

we allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired liabilities assumed and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values the excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill to reporting units based on the expected benefit from the business combination such valuations require management to make significant estimates and assumptions especially with respect to intangible assets significant estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include but are not limited to estimated replacement costs and future expected cash flows from acquired users acquired technology acquired patents and trade names from a market participant perspective useful lives and discount rates managements estimates of fair value are based 

upon assumptions believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and as a result actual results may differ from estimates allocation of purchase consideration to identifiable assets and liabilities affects our amortization expense as acquired finitelived intangible assets are amortized over the useful life whereas any indefinitelived intangible assets including goodwill are not amortized during the measurement period which is not to exceed one year from the acquisition date we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill upon the conclusion of the measurement period any subsequent adjustments are recorded to earnings 

goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value we have two reporting units subject to goodwill impairment testing as of december 31 2021 no impairment of goodwill has been identified 

longlived assets including property and equipment and finitelived intangible assets are reviewed for possible impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable the evaluation is performed at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities recoverability of these assets is measured by a comparison of the carrying amounts to the future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate from the use and eventual disposition if such review indicates that the carrying amount of property and equipment and intangible assets is not recoverable the carrying amount of such assets is reduced to fair value we have not recorded any material impairment charges during the years presented 

the useful lives of our longlived assets including property and equipment and finitelived intangible assets are determined by management when those assets are initially recognized and are routinely reviewed for the remaining estimated useful lives the current estimate of useful lives represents our best estimate based on current facts and circumstances but may differ from the actual useful lives due to changes in future circumstances such as changes to our business operations changes in the planned use of assets and technological advancements when we change the estimated useful life assumption for any asset the remaining carrying amount of the asset is accounted for prospectively and depreciated or amortized over the revised estimated useful life 

in connection with our periodic reviews of the estimated useful lives of property and equipment we extended the estimated average useful lives of our server and network assets category the effect of the 2021 change was a reduction in depreciation expense of 620 million and an increase in net income of 516 million or 018 per diluted share the impact from the changes in our estimates was calculated based on the asset bases existing as of the effective dates of the changes and applying the revised useful lives prospectively see note 1 — summary of significant accounting policies in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data of this annual report on form 10k for additional information regarding changes in the estimated useful lives of our property and equipment 

components of results of operations 

revenue 

family of apps foa 

advertising we generate substantially all of our revenue from advertising our advertising revenue is generated by displaying ad products on facebook instagram messenger and thirdparty affiliated websites or mobile applications marketers pay for ad products either directly or through their relationships with advertising agencies or resellers based on the number of impressions delivered or the number of actions such as clicks taken by users 

we recognize revenue from the display of impressionbased ads in the contracted period in which the impressions are delivered impressions are considered delivered when an ad is displayed to a user we recognize revenue from the delivery of actionbased ads in the period in which a user takes the action the marketer contracted for the number of ads we show is subject to methodological changes as we continue to evolve our ads business and the structure of our ads products we calculate price per ad as total advertising revenue divided by the number of ads delivered representing the effective price paid per impression by a marketer regardless of their desired objective such as impression or action for advertising revenue arrangements where we are not the principal we recognize revenue on a net basis 

other revenue other revenue consists of net fees we receive from developers using our payments infrastructure and revenue from various other sources

family of apps 

foa revenue in 2021 increased 3083 billion or 36 compared to 2020 the increase was mostly driven by an increase in advertising revenue 

advertising 

advertising revenue in 2021 increased 3076 billion or 37 compared to 2020 as a result of increases in both the average price per ad and the number of ads delivered in 2021 the average price per ad increased by 24 as compared with a decrease of approximately 10 in 2020 the increase in average price per ad in 2021 was mainly caused by a recovery from declines in advertising demand in the first two quarters of 2020 due to the onset of the covid19 pandemic additionally overall advertising demand increased as compared to 2020 across our ad products and in all regions in part due to the continued growth of online commerce in 2021 the number of ads delivered increased by 10 as compared with an approximate 34 increase in 2020 the increase in the ads delivered in 2021 was driven by increases in users and the number and frequency of ads displayed across our products we anticipate that future advertising revenue growth will be driven by a combination of price and the number of ads delivered 

reality labs 

rl revenue increased 114 billion or 100 from 2020 to 2021 and 638 million or 127 from 2019 to 2020 the increases in both periods were mostly driven by increases in the volume of our consumer hardware products sold 

revenue seasonality and customer concentration 

revenue is traditionally seasonally strong in the fourth quarter of each year due in part to seasonal holiday demand we believe that this seasonality in both advertising revenue and rl consumer hardware sales affects our quarterly results which generally reflect significant growth in revenue between the third and fourth quarters and a decline between the fourth and subsequent first quarters for instance our total revenue increased 16 31 and 19 between the third and fourth quarters of 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively while total revenue for the first quarters of 2021 2020 and 2019 declined 7 16 and 11 compared to the fourth quarters of 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively we note the decline in total revenue in the first quarter of 2020 was exacerbated by the nonseasonal impact of the onset of the covid19 pandemic 

no customer represented 10 or more of total revenue during the years ended december 31 2021 2020 and 2019 

foreign exchange impact on revenue 

the general weakening of the us dollar relative to certain foreign currencies in the full year 2021 compared to the same period in 2020 had a favorable impact on revenue if we had translated revenue for the full year 2021 using the prior years monthly exchange rates for our settlement or billing currencies other than the us dollar our total revenue and advertising revenue would have been 11629 billion and 11331 billion respectively using these constant rates total revenue and advertising revenue would have been 164 billion and 162 billion lower than actual total revenue and advertising revenue respectively for the full year 2021 using the same constant rates full year 2021 total revenue and advertising revenue would have been 3032 billion and 2915 billion respectively higher than actual total revenue and advertising revenue for the full year 2020 

cost of revenue 



cost of revenue in 2021 increased 596 billion or 36 compared to 2020 the majority of the increase was due to an increase in reality labs cost of products sold and an increase in operational expenses related to our data centers and technical infrastructure partially offset by a decrease in the depreciation growth rate mostly due to increases in the useful lives of servers and network assets to a lesser extent costs associated with partner arrangements including traffic acquisition and payment processing costs also increased 

see note 1 — summary of significant accounting policies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 of this annual report on form 10k for additional information regarding changes in the estimated useful lives of our servers and network assets 

in 2022 we anticipate that cost of revenue will increase as we continue to expand our data center capacity and technical infrastructure to support user growth and engagement and the delivery of new products and services and to a lesser extent due to higher content costs 

research and development 

   

research and development expenses in 2021 increased 621 billion or 34 compared to 2020 the increase was primarily due to an increase in payroll and related expenses as a result of a 30 growth in employee headcount from december 31 2020 to december 31 2021 in engineering and other technical functions supporting our continued investment in our family of products and reality labs to a lesser extent realty labs technology development costs also increased 

in 2022 we plan to continue to hire software engineers and other technical employees and to increase our investment to support our research and development initiatives in our family of products and in reality labs 

marketing and sales 



marketing and sales expenses in 2021 increased 245 billion or 21 compared to 2020 the increase was primarily due to increases in marketing and promotional expenses payroll and related expenses and product and community operations expenses our payroll and related expenses increased as a result of a 9 increase in employee headcount from december 31 2020 to december 31 2021 in our marketing and sales functions 

in 2022 we plan to continue the hiring of marketing and sales employees to support our marketing sales and partnership efforts and we anticipate marketing expenses will increase 

general and administrative 

   

general and administrative expenses in 2021 increased 327 billion or 50 compared to 2020 the increase was primarily due to increases in legalrelated costs and payroll and related expenses our payroll and related expenses increased as a result of a 25 increase in employee headcount from december 31 2020 to december 31 2021 in our general and administrative functions 

see note 11 — commitments and contingencies in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data and part i item 3 legal proceedings of this annual report on form 10k for additional information regarding estimated fines settlements or other losses in connection with legalrelated costs 

in 2022 we plan to continue to increase general and administrative expenses to support overall company growth we may also incur significant discrete charges such as legalrelated accruals and settlement costs in general and administrative expenses 

segment profitability 

the following table sets forth income loss from operations by segment for comparative purposes amounts in prior periods have been recast 



family of apps 

foa income from operations in 2021 increased 1765 billion or 45 compared to 2020  the increase was due to the growth in advertising revenue partially offset by an increase in costs and expenses the majority of which was due to an increase in payroll and related expenses as a result of higher employee headcount higher legalrelated costs and increases in costs related to our data centers and technical infrastructure 

foa income from operations in 2020 increased 1081 billion or 38 compared to 2019 the increase was due to the growth in advertising revenue and a onetime 50 billion ftc settlement accrual recorded in 2019 partially offset by an increase in costs and expenses the majority of which was due to an increase in payroll and related expenses as a result of higher employee headcount increases in costs related to our data centers and technical infrastructure and higher marketing and promotional expenses 

reality labs 

rl loss from operations in 2021 increased 357 billion or 54 compared to 2020 and in 2020 increased 212 billion  or 47 compared to 2019  the majority of the increases in loss from operations in both periods were driven by increases in payroll and related expenses primarily due to the growth in rl research and development headcount and higher gross losses from increases in volume of consumer hardware sales 

interest and other income net 

   

interest and other income net in 2021 increased 22 million or 4 compared to 2020 the increase was due to an increase in other income from net unrealized gains recognized for our equity investments partially offset by a decrease in interest income as a result of lower interest rates compared to 2020 

provision for income taxes 



our provision for income taxes in 2021 increased 388 billion or 96 compared to 2020 primarily due to an increase in income from operations and the effects of the tax election described below 

our effective tax rate in 2021 increased compared to 2020 mostly due to the effects of the tax election described below and tax effects of a shift in jurisdictional mix of earnings 

in the third quarter of 2020 as part of finalizing our us income tax return we elected to capitalize and amortize certain research and development expenses for us income tax purposes as a result we recorded a total of 107 billion income tax benefit for the year ended december 31 2020 

effective tax rate items  our effective tax rate in the future will depend upon the proportion between the following items and income before provision for income taxes us tax benefits from foreignderived intangible income tax effects from sharebased compensation tax effects of integrating intellectual property from acquisitions settlement of tax contingency items tax effects of changes in our business and the effects of changes in tax law 

the accounting for sharebased compensation may increase or decrease our effective tax rate based upon the difference between our sharebased compensation expense and the deductions taken on our tax return which depend upon the stock price at the time of employee award vesting if our stock price remains constant to the january 28 2022 price and absent us tax legislation changes and other onetime events we expect our effective tax rate for the full year 2022 to be similar to the effective tax rate for the full year 2021 this includes the effects of the mandatory capitalization and amortization of research and development expenses starting in 2022 as required by the 2017 tax cuts and jobs act tax act the mandatory capitalization requirement increases our cash tax liabilities but also decreases our effective tax rate due to increasing the foreignderived intangible income deduction if the mandatory capitalization requirement is deferred our effective tax rate in 2022 could be a few percentage points higher when compared to current law and our cash tax liabilities could be several billion dollars lower 

integrating intellectual property from acquisitions into our business generally involves intercompany transactions that have the impact of increasing our provision for income taxes consequently our provision for income taxes and our effective tax rate may initially increase in the period of an acquisition and integration the magnitude of this impact will depend upon the specific type size and taxing jurisdictions of the intellectual property as well as the relative contribution to income in subsequent periods 

see note 14 — income taxes in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data of this annual report on form 10k for additional information regarding income tax contingencies 

liquidity and capital resources 

our principal sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents marketable securities and cash generated from operations cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities consist mostly of cash on deposit with banks investments in money market funds investments in us government securities us government agency securities and investment grade corporate debt securities cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities were 480 billion as of december 31 2021 a decrease of 1396 billion from december 31 2020 the decrease was primarily due to 4454 billion for repurchases of our class a common stock 1924 billion for capital expenditures including principal payments on finance leases and 551 billion of taxes paid related to net share settlement of employee restricted stock units rsu awards offset by 5768 billion of cash generated from operations for the year ended december 31 2021 

cash paid for income taxes was 852 billion for the year ended december 31 2021 as of december 31 2021 our federal net operating loss carryforward was 1061 billion and our federal tax credit carryforward was 527 million we anticipate the utilization of a significant portion of these net operating losses and credits within the next two years 

our board of directors has authorized a share repurchase program of our class a common stock which commenced in january 2017 and does not have an expiration date in 2021 we repurchased and subsequently retired 136 million shares of our class a common stock for 4481 billion as of december 31 2021 3879 billion remained available and authorized for repurchases 

as of december 31 2021 1061 billion of the 480 billion in cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities was held by our foreign subsidiaries the tax act imposed a mandatory transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings and eliminated us taxes on foreign subsidiary distributions as a result earnings in foreign jurisdictions are available for distribution to the us without incremental us taxes 

we currently anticipate that our available funds and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our operational cash needs and fund our share repurchase program for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future 

the following table presents our cash flows in millions 



cash provided by operating activities 

cash provided by operating activities during 2021 mostly consisted of 3937 billion net income adjusted for certain noncash items including 916 billion of sharebased compensation expense and 797 billion of depreciation and amortization the increase in cash flow from operating activities during 2021 compared to 2020 was primarily du e to higher net income as adjusted for certain noncash items such as sharebased compensation expense and deferred income taxes partially offset by changes in working capital 

cash used in investing activities 

cash used in investing activities during 2021 primarily consisted of 1857 billion of purchases of property and equipment as we continued to invest in data centers servers office facilities and network infrastructure offset by 1218 billion of net sales and maturities of marketable securities the decrease in cash used in investing activities during 2021 compared to 2020 was mostly due to decreases in net purchases of marketable securities and equity investments partially offset by an increase in purchases of property and equipment 

we anticipate making capital expenditures of approximately 29 billion to 34 billion in 2022 

cash used in financing activities 

cash used in financing activities during 2021 mostly consisted of 4454 billion for repurchases of our class a common stock and 551 billion of taxes paid related to net share settlement of rsus the increase in cash used in financing activities during 2021 compared to 2020 was mostly due to the increase in repurchases of our class a common stock 

free cash flow 

in addition to other financial measures presented in accordance with us gaap we monitor free cash flow fcf as a nongaap measure to manage our business make planning decisions evaluate our performance and allocate resources we define fcf as net cash provided by operating activities reduced by net purchases of property and equipment and principal payments on finance leases 

we believe that fcf is one of the key financial indicators of our business performance over the long term and provides useful information regarding how cash provided by operating activities compares to the property and equipment investments required to maintain and grow our business 

we have chosen our definition for fcf because we believe that this methodology can provide useful supplemental information to help investors better understand underlying trends in our business we use fcf in discussions with our senior management and board of directors 

fcf has limitations as an analytical tool and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of other gaap financial measures such as net cash provided by operating activities fcf is not intended to represent our residual cash flow available for discretionary expenses some of the limitations of fcf are 

• fcf does not reflect our future contractual commitments and 

• other companies in our industry present similarly titled measures differently than we do limiting their usefulness as comparative measures 

management compensates for the inherent limitations associated with using the fcf measure through disclosure of such limitations presentation of our financial statements in accordance with gaap and reconciliation of fcf to the most directly comparable gaap measure net cash provided by operating activities as presented below 

the following is a reconciliation of fcf to the most comparable gaap measure net cash provided by operating activities in millions 



offbalance sheet arrangements 

as of december 31 2021 we did not have any offbalance sheet arrangements that are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources 

contractual obligations 

our principal commitments consist mostly of obligations under operating leases and other contractual commitments our operating lease obligations mostly include among others certain of our offices data centers colocations and land our other contractual commitments are primarily related to our investments in servers network infrastructure and reality labs the following table summarizes our commitments to settle contractual obligations in cash as of december 31 2021 in millions 



 

1 includes variable lease payments that were fixed subsequent to lease commencement or modification 

additionally as part of the normal course of business we may also enter into multiyear agreements to purchase renewable energy that do not specify a fixed or minimum volume commitment or to purchase certain server components that do not specify a fixed or minimum price commitment these agreements are generally entered into in order to secure either volume or price using projected market prices or expected volume consumption the total estimated spend is approximately 806 billion the ultimate spend under these agreements may vary and will be based on prevailing market prices or actual volume purchased 

our other liabilities also include 440 billion related to the uncertain tax positions as of december 31 2021 due to uncertainties in the timing of the completion of tax audits the timing of the resolution of these positions is uncertain and we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years beyond 12 months as a result this amount is not included in the above contractual obligations table 

contingencies 

we are involved in legal proceedings claims and regulatory tax or government inquiries and investigations we record a liability when we believe that it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and that the amount can be reasonably estimated if we determine there is a reasonable possibility that we may incur a loss and the loss or range of loss can be estimated we disclose the possible loss in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements to the extent material significant judgment is required to determine both probability and the estimated amount of loss such matters are inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties some of which are beyond our control should any of these estimates and assumptions change or prove to be incorrect it could have a material impact on our results of operations financial position and cash flows

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to market risks including changes to foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and equity investment risk 

foreign currency exchange risk 

we have foreign currency risks related to our revenue and operating expenses denominated in currencies other than the us dollar primarily the euro accordingly changes in exchange rates and in particular a strengthening of the us dollar have in the past and may in the future negatively affect our revenue and other operating results as expressed in us dollars 

we have experienced and will continue to experience fluctuations in our net income as a result of transaction gains or losses related to revaluing monetary asset and liability balances that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the entities in which they are recorded at this time we have not entered into but in the future we may enter into derivatives or other financial instruments in an attempt to hedge our foreign currency exchange risk it is difficult to predict the effect hedging activities would have on our results of operations foreign currency losses of 140 million 129 million and 105 million were recognized in 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively as interest and other income net in our consolidated statements of income 

interest rate sensitivity 

our exposure to changes in interest rates relates primarily to interest earned and market value on our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities 

our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities consist of cash certificates of deposit time deposits money market funds us government securities us government agency securities and investment grade corporate debt securities our investment policy and strategy are focused on preservation of capital and supporting our liquidity requirements changes in us interest rates affect the interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities and the market value of those securities a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would have resulted in a decrease of 714 million and 794 million in the market value of our availableforsale debt securities as of december 31 2021 and december 31 2020 respectively any realized gains or losses resulting from such interest rate changes would only occur if we sold the investments prior to maturity 

equity investment risk 

our equity investments are subject to a wide variety of marketrelated risks that could have a material impact on the carrying value of our holdings we continually evaluate our equity investments in privatelyheld companies 

our equity investments are investments in equity securities of privatelyheld companies without readily determinable fair values we elected to account for most of our equity investments using the measurement alternative which is cost less any impairment adjusted for changes in fair value resulting from observable transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer we perform a qualitative assessment at each reporting date to determine whether there are triggering events for impairment the qualitative assessment considers factors such as but not limited to the investees financial condition and business outlook industry and sector performance economic or technological environment and other relevant events and factors affecting the investee valuations of our equity investments are complex due to the lack of readily available market data and observable transactions volatility in the global economic climate and financial markets including recent and ongoing effects related to the impact of the covid19 pandemic which requires significant judgments could result in a material impairment charge on our equity investments equity investments accounted for under the equity method were immaterial as of december 31 2021 and december 31 2020 our total equity investments had a carrying value of 678 billion and 623 billion as of december 31 2021 and december 31 2020 respectively

competition 

our business is characterized by innovation rapid change and disruptive technologies we compete with companies providing connection and communication products and services to users online as well as companies that sell advertising to businesses looking to reach consumers andor develop tools and systems for managing and optimizing advertising campaigns we face significant competition in every aspect of our business including but not limited to companies that facilitate the ability of users to share communicate and discover content and information online or enable marketers to reach their existing or prospective audiences including for example google apple youtube tencent snap twitter bytedance microsoft and amazon we compete to attract engage and retain people who use our products to attract and retain businesses who use our free or paid business and advertising services and to attract and retain developers to build compelling mobile and web applications that integrate with our products we also compete with companies that develop and deliver consumer hardware and virtual reality products and services as we introduce or acquire new products as our existing products evolve or as other companies introduce new products and services we may become subject to additional competition 

technology 

our product development philosophy is centered on continuous innovation in creating and improving products that are social by design which means that our products are designed to place people and their social interactions at the core of the product experience as our user base grows as engagement with products like video and vr increases and as we deepen our investment in new technologies like artificial intelligence our computing needs continue to expand we make significant investments in technology both to improve our existing products and services and to develop new ones as well as for our marketers and developers we are also investing in protecting the security privacy and integrity of our platform by investing in both people and technology to strengthen our systems against abuse 

sales and operations 

the majority of our marketers use our selfservice ad platform to launch and manage their advertising campaigns we also have a global sales force that is focused on attracting and retaining advertisers and providing support to them throughout the stages of the marketing cycle from prepurchase decisionmaking to realtime optimizations to postcampaign analytics we work directly with these advertisers as well as through advertising agencies and resellers we operate in more than 80 cities around the globe the majority of which have a sales presence we also invest in and rely on selfservice tools to provide direct customer support to our users and partners 

marketing 

historically our communities have generally grown organically with people inviting their friends to connect with them supported by internal efforts to stimulate awareness and interest in addition we have invested and will continue to invest in marketing our products and services to grow our brand and help build community around the world 

intellectual property 

to establish and protect our proprietary rights we rely on a combination of patents trademarks copyrights trade secrets including knowhow license agreements confidentiality procedures nondisclosure agreements with third parties employee disclosure and invention assignment agreements and other contractual rights in addition to further protect our proprietary rights from time to time we have purchased patents and patent applications from third parties we do not believe that our proprietary technology is dependent on any single patent or copyright or groups of related patents or copyrights we believe the duration of our patents is adequate relative to the expected lives of our products 

government regulation 

we are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the united states and abroad that involve matters central to our business many of which are still evolving and being tested in courts and could be interpreted in ways that could harm our business these laws and regulations involve matters including privacy data use data protection and personal information rights of publicity content intellectual property advertising marketing distribution data security data retention and deletion data localization and storage data disclosure artificial intelligence electronic contracts and other communications competition protection of minors consumer protection telecommunications product liability ecommerce taxation economic or other trade prohibitions or sanctions anticorruption and political law compliance securities law compliance and online payment services in particular we are subject to federal state and foreign laws regarding privacy and protection of peoples data foreign data protection privacy content competition and other laws and regulations can impose different obligations or be more restrictive than those in the united states 

these us federal and state and foreign laws and regulations which in some cases can be enforced by private parties in addition to government entities are constantly evolving and can be subject to significant change as a result the application interpretation and enforcement of these laws and regulations are often uncertain particularly in the new and rapidly evolving industry in which we operate and may be interpreted and applied inconsistently from country to country and inconsistently with our current policies and practices for example regulatory or legislative actions affecting the manner in which we display content to our users or obtain consent to various practices or otherwise relating to content that is made available on our products could adversely affect our financial results in the united states there have been and continue to be various efforts to remove or restrict the scope of the protections available to online platforms under section 230 of the communications decency act and any such changes may increase our costs or require significant changes to our products business practices or operations which could adversely affect our business and financial results 

we are also subject to evolving laws and regulations that dictate whether how and under what circumstances we can transfer process andor receive certain data that is critical to our operations including data shared between countries or regions in which we operate and data shared among our products and services if we are unable to transfer data between and among countries and regions in which we operate or if we are restricted from sharing data among our products and services it could affect our ability to provide our services the manner in which we provide our services or our ability to target ads which could adversely affect our financial results for example the privacy shield a transfer framework we relied upon for data transferred from the european union to the united states was invalidated in july 2020 by the court of justice of the european union cjeu in addition the other bases upon which facebook relies to transfer such data such as standard contractual clauses sccs have been subjected to regulatory and judicial scrutiny in august 2020 we received a preliminary draft decision from the irish data protection commission idpc that preliminarily concluded that facebook irelands reliance on sccs in respect of european user data does not achieve compliance with the gdpr and preliminarily proposed that such transfers of user data from the european union to the united states should therefore be suspended facebook ireland challenged procedural aspects of this idpc inquiry in a judicial review commenced in the irish high court in september 2020 while we also rely upon alternative legal bases for data transfers if a new transatlantic data transfer framework is not adopted and we are unable to continue to rely on sccs or validly rely upon other alternative means of data transfers from europe to the united states we may be unable to operate material portions of our business in europe as a result of the cjeus invalidation of the privacy shield and any final decision of idpc which would materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

proposed or new legislation and regulations could also significantly affect our business for example the european general data protection regulation gdpr took effect in may 2018 and applies to all of our products and services used by people in europe the gdpr includes operational requirements for companies that receive or process personal data of residents of the european union that are different from those previously in place in the european union and includes significant penalties for noncompliance the brazilian general data protection law recently took effect and imposes data privacyrelated requirements similar to gdpr on products and services offered to users in brazil the california consumer privacy act which took effect in january 2020 also establishes certain transparency rules and creates new data privacy rights for users in addition effective december 2020 the european unions eprivacy directive includes additional limitations on the use of data across messaging products and includes significant penalties for noncompliance changes to our products or business practices as a result of these developments may adversely affect our advertising business similarly there are a number of legislative proposals in the european union the united states at both the federal and state level as well as other jurisdictions that could impose new obligations or limitations in areas affecting our business such as liability for copyright infringement in addition some countries are considering or have passed legislation implementing data protection requirements or requiring local storage and processing of data or similar requirements that could increase the cost and complexity of delivering our services 

we are and expect to continue to be the subject of investigations inquiries data requests requests for information actions and audits by government authorities and regulators in the united states europe and around the world particularly in the areas of privacy data protection law enforcement consumer protection and competition as we continue to grow and expand our operations we are also currently and may in the future be subject to regulatory orders or consent decrees including the modified consent order we entered into with the us federal trade commission ftc which took effect in april 2020 and among other matters requires us to implement a comprehensive expansion of our privacy program orders issued by or inquiries or enforcement actions initiated by government or regulatory authorities could cause us to incur substantial costs expose us to unanticipated civil and criminal liability or penalties including substantial monetary remedies interrupt or require us to change our business practices in a manner materially adverse to our business result in negative publicity and reputational harm divert resources and the time and attention of management from our business or subject us to other structural or behavioral remedies that adversely affect our business

risks related to our product offerings 

if we fail to retain existing users or add new users or if our users decrease their level of engagement with our products our revenue financial results and business may be significantly harmed 

the size of our user base and our users level of engagement are critical to our success our financial performance has been and will continue to be significantly determined by our success in adding retaining and engaging active users of our products particularly for facebook and instagram we anticipate that our active user growth rate will generally decline over time as the size of our active user base increases and we expect that the size of our active user base will fluctuate or decline in one or more markets from time to time particularly in markets where we have achieved higher penetration rates for example beginning in the first quarter of 2020 we experienced significant increases in the size and engagement of our active user base across a number of regions as a result of the covid19 pandemic more recently we have seen user growth and engagement returning to prepandemic trends and in each of the third and fourth quarters of 2020 we experienced slight declines on a quarteroverquarter basis in the number of daily active users on facebook in the united states  canada region we are unable to predict the impact of the pandemic on user growth and engagement with any certainty and we expect these trends to continue to be subject to volatility if people do not perceive our products to be useful reliable and trustworthy we may not be able to attract or retain users or otherwise maintain or increase the frequency and duration of their engagement a number of other social networking companies that achieved early popularity have since seen their active user bases or levels of engagement decline in some cases precipitously there is no guarantee that we will not experience a similar erosion of our active user base or engagement levels our user engagement patterns have changed over time and user engagement can be difficult to measure particularly as we introduce new and different products and services any number of factors can negatively affect user retention growth and engagement including if 

• users increasingly engage with other competitive products or services 

• we fail to introduce new features products or services that users find engaging or if we introduce new products or services or make changes to existing products and services that are not favorably received 

• users feel that their experience is diminished as a result of the decisions we make with respect to the frequency prominence format size and quality of ads that we display 

• users have difficulty installing updating or otherwise accessing our products on mobile devices as a result of actions by us or third parties that we rely on to distribute our products and deliver our services 

• user behavior on any of our products changes including decreases in the quality and frequency of content shared on our products and services 

• we are unable to continue to develop products for mobile devices that users find engaging that work with a variety of mobile operating systems and networks and that achieve a high level of market acceptance 

• there are decreases in user sentiment due to questions about the quality or usefulness of our products or our user data practices concerns about the nature of content made available on our products or concerns related to privacy safety security wellbeing or other factors 

• we are unable to manage and prioritize information to ensure users are presented with content that is appropriate interesting useful and relevant to them 

• we are unable to obtain or attract engaging thirdparty content 

• we are unable to successfully maintain or grow usage of and engagement with mobile and web applications that integrate with facebook and our other products 

• users adopt new technologies where our products may be displaced in favor of other products or services or may not be featured or otherwise available 

• there are changes mandated by legislation government and regulatory authorities or litigation that adversely affect our products or users 

• we are unable to operate material portions of our business in europe or are otherwise limited in such operations as a result of european regulators courts or legislative bodies determining that our reliance on standard contractual clauses sccs or other legal bases we rely upon to transfer user data from the european union to the united states is invalid 

• there is decreased engagement with our products or failure to accept our terms of service as part of privacyfocused changes that we have implemented or may implement in the future whether voluntarily in connection with the general data protection regulation gdpr the european unions eprivacy directive the california consumer privacy act ccpa or other laws regulations or regulatory actions or otherwise 

• technical or other problems prevent us from delivering our products in a rapid and reliable manner or otherwise affect the user experience such as security breaches or failure to prevent or limit spam or similar content 

• we adopt terms policies or procedures related to areas such as sharing content user data or advertising or take actions to enforce our policies that are perceived negatively by our users or the general public including as a result of decisions or recommendations from the independent oversight board regarding content on our platform 

• we elect to focus our product decisions on longerterm initiatives that do not prioritize nearterm user growth and engagement 

• we make changes in how we promote different products and services across our family of products 

• initiatives designed to attract and retain users and engagement are unsuccessful or discontinued whether as a result of actions by us third parties or otherwise 

• thirdparty initiatives that may enable greater use of our products including lowcost or discounted data plans are discontinued 

• there is decreased engagement with our products as a result of taxes imposed on the use of social media or other mobile applications in certain countries internet shutdowns or other actions by governments that affect the accessibility of our products in their countries 

• we fail to provide adequate customer service to users marketers developers or other partners 

• we developers whose products are integrated with our products or other partners and companies in our industry are the subject of adverse media reports or other negative publicity including as a result of our or their user data practices or 

• our current or future products such as our development tools and application programming interfaces that enable developers to build grow and monetize mobile and web applications reduce user activity on our products by making it easier for our users to interact and share on thirdparty mobile and web applications 

from time to time certain of these factors have negatively affected user retention growth and engagement to varying degrees if we are unable to maintain or increase our user base and user engagement particularly for our significant revenuegenerating products like facebook and instagram our revenue and financial results may be adversely affected any significant decrease in user retention growth or engagement could render our products less attractive to users marketers and developers which is likely to have a material and adverse impact on our revenue business financial condition and results of operations if our active user growth rate continues to slow we will become increasingly dependent on our ability to maintain or increase levels of user engagement and monetization in order to drive revenue growth 

we generate substantially all of our revenue from advertising the loss of marketers or reduction in spending by marketers could seriously harm our business 

substantially all of our revenue is currently generated from third parties advertising on facebook and instagram as is common in the industry our marketers do not have longterm advertising commitments with us many of our marketers spend only a relatively small portion of their overall advertising budget with us marketers will not continue to do business with us or they will reduce the budgets they are willing to commit to us if we do not deliver ads in an effective manner or if they do not believe that their investment in advertising with us will generate a competitive return relative to other alternatives we have implemented and we will continue to implement changes to our user data practices some of these changes reduce our ability to effectively target ads which has to some extent adversely affected and will continue to adversely affect our advertising business if we are unable to provide marketers with a suitable return on investment the pricing of our ads may not increase or may decline in which case our revenue and financial results may be harmed 

our advertising revenue can also be adversely affected by a number of other factors including 

• decreases in user engagement including time spent on our products 

• our inability to continue to increase user access to and engagement with our products 

• product changes or inventory management decisions we may make that change the size format frequency or relative prominence of ads displayed on our products or of other unpaid content shared by marketers on our products

• changes to thirdparty policies that limit our ability to deliver target or measure the effectiveness of advertising including changes by mobile operating system and browser providers such as apple and google 

• adverse government actions or legislative regulatory or other legal developments relating to advertising including developments that may impact our ability to deliver target or measure the effectiveness of advertising 

• user behavior or product changes that may reduce traffic to features or products that we successfully monetize including as a result of increased usage of the stories format or our messaging products 

• reductions of advertising by marketers due to our efforts to implement or enforce advertising policies that protect the security and integrity of our platform 

• the availability accuracy utility and security of analytics and measurement solutions offered by us or third parties that demonstrate the value of our ads to marketers or our ability to further improve such tools 

• loss of advertising market share to our competitors including if prices to purchase our ads increase or if competitors offer lower priced more integrated or otherwise more effective products 

• limitations on our ability to operate material portions of our business in europe as a result of european regulators courts or legislative bodies determining that our reliance on sccs or other legal bases we rely upon to transfer user data from the european union to the united states is invalid 

• changes in our marketing and sales or other operations that we are required to or elect to make as a result of risks related to complying with foreign laws or regulatory requirements or other government actions 

• decisions by marketers to reduce their advertising as a result of adverse media reports or other negative publicity involving us our user data practices our advertising metrics or tools content on our products our efforts to implement or enforce policies relating to content on our products including as a result of decisions or recommendations from the independent oversight board developers with mobile and web applications that are integrated with our products or other companies in our industry 

• reductions of advertising by marketers due to objectionable content made available on our products by third parties questions about our user data practices concerns about brand safety or potential legal liability or uncertainty regarding their own legal and compliance obligations for example a number of marketers announced that they paused advertising with us in july 2020 due to concerns about content on our products 

• the effectiveness of our ad targeting or degree to which users opt out of the use of data for ads including as a result of product changes and controls that we have implemented or may implement in the future in connection with the gdpr eprivacy directive california consumer privacy act ccpa other laws regulations or regulatory actions or otherwise that impact our ability to use data for advertising purposes

• changes in the composition of our marketer base or our inability to maintain or grow our marketer base and 

• the impact of macroeconomic conditions whether in the advertising industry in general or among specific types of marketers or within particular geographies 

from time to time certain of these factors have adversely affected our advertising revenue to varying degrees the occurrence of any of these or other factors in the future could result in a reduction in demand for our ads which may reduce the prices we receive for our ads or cause marketers to stop advertising with us altogether either of which would negatively affect our revenue and financial results for example macroeconomic conditions have affected and may in the future affect marketers ability or willingness to spend with us as we have seen with the regional and worldwide economic disruption related to the covid19 pandemic and associated declines in advertising activity on our products the effects of the pandemic previously resulted in reduced demand for our ads a related decline in pricing of our ads and additional demands on our technical infrastructure as a result of increased usage of our services and any similar occurrences in the future may impair our ability to maintain or increase the quantity or quality of ads shown to users and adversely affect our revenue and financial results 

our advertising revenue is dependent on targeting and measurement tools that incorporate data signals from user activity on websites and services that we do not control and changes to the regulatory environment thirdparty mobile operating systems and browsers and our own products have impacted and we expect will continue to impact the availability of such signals which will adversely affect our advertising revenue 

we rely on data signals from user activity on websites and services that we do not control in order to deliver relevant and effective ads to our users our advertising revenue is dependent on targeting and measurement tools that incorporate these signals and any changes in our ability to use such signals will adversely affect our business for example legislative and regulatory developments such as the gdpr eprivacy directive and ccpa have impacted and we expect will continue to impact our ability to use such signals in our ad products in particular we have seen an increasing number of users opt out of certain types of ad targeting in europe following adoption of the gdpr and we have introduced product changes that limit data signal use for certain users in california following adoption of the ccpa regulatory guidance or decisions or new legislation may require us to make additional changes to our products in the future that further reduce our ability to use these signals in addition mobile operating system and browser providers such as apple and google have announced product changes as well as future plans to limit the ability of application developers to collect and use these signals to target and measure advertising for example in june 2020 apple announced that it plans to make certain changes to its products and data use policies in connection with the release of its ios 14 operating system that will reduce our and other ios developers ability to target and measure advertising which we expect will in turn reduce the budgets marketers are willing to commit to us and other advertising platforms in addition we have implemented and may continue to implement product changes that give users the ability to limit our use of such data signals to improve ads and other experiences on our products and services including our offfacebook activity tool and our worldwide offering of certain product changes we implemented in connection with the gdpr these developments have limited our ability to target and measure the effectiveness of ads on our platform and negatively impacted our advertising revenue and if we are unable to mitigate these developments as they take further effect in the future our targeting and measurement capabilities will be materially and adversely affected which would in turn significantly impact our future advertising revenue growth 

our user growth engagement and monetization on mobile devices depend upon effective operation with mobile operating systems networks technologies products and standards that we do not control 

the substantial majority of our revenue is generated from advertising on mobile devices there is no guarantee that popular mobile devices will continue to feature facebook or our other products or that mobile device users will continue to use our products rather than competing products we are dependent on the interoperability of facebook and our other products with popular mobile operating systems networks technologies products and standards that we do not control such as the android and ios operating systems and mobile browsers any changes bugs or technical issues in such systems or changes in our relationships with mobile operating system partners handset manufacturers browser developers or mobile carriers or in their terms of service or policies that degrade our products functionality reduce or eliminate our ability to update or distribute our products give preferential treatment to competitive products limit our ability to deliver target or measure the effectiveness of ads or charge fees related to the distribution of our products or our delivery of ads could adversely affect the usage of facebook or our other products and monetization on mobile devices for example apple previously released an update to its safari browser that limits the use of thirdparty cookies which reduces our ability to provide the most relevant ads to our users and impacts monetization and more recently announced changes to ios 14 that will limit our ability to target and measure ads effectively we expect that any similar changes to its googles or other browser or mobile platforms will further limit our ability to target and measure the effectiveness of ads and impact monetization additionally in order to deliver high quality mobile products it is important that our products work well with a range of mobile technologies products systems networks and standards that we do not control and that we have good relationships with handset manufacturers mobile carriers and browser developers we may not be successful in maintaining or developing relationships with key participants in the mobile ecosystem or in developing products that operate effectively with these technologies products systems networks or standards in the event that it is more difficult for our users to access and use facebook or our other products on their mobile devices or if our users choose not to access or use facebook or our other products on their mobile devices or use mobile products that do not offer access to facebook or our other products our user growth and user engagement could be harmed from time to time we may also take actions regarding the distribution of our products or the operation of our business based on what we believe to be in our longterm best interests such actions may adversely affect our users and our relationships with the operators of mobile operating systems handset manufacturers mobile carriers browser developers other business partners or advertisers and there is no assurance that these actions will result in the anticipated longterm benefits in the event that our users are adversely affected by these actions or if our relationships with such third parties deteriorate our user growth engagement and monetization could be adversely affected 

and our business could be harmed we have in the past experienced challenges in operating with mobile operating systems networks technologies products and standards that we do not control and any such occurrences in the future may negatively impact our user growth engagement and monetization on mobile devices which may in turn materially and adversely affect our business and financial results 

our new products and changes to existing products could fail to attract or retain users or generate revenue and profits 

our ability to retain increase and engage our user base and to increase our revenue depends heavily on our ability to continue to evolve our existing products and to create successful new products both independently and in conjunction with developers or other third parties we may introduce significant changes to our existing products or acquire or introduce new and unproven products including using technologies with which we have little or no prior development or operating experience for example we do not have significant experience with consumer hardware products or virtual or augmented reality technology which may adversely affect our ability to successfully develop and market these products and technologies we continue to incur substantial costs and we may not be successful in generating profits in connection with these efforts in addition the introduction of new products or changes to existing products may result in new or enhanced governmental or regulatory scrutiny litigation or other complications that could adversely affect our business and financial results we have also invested and expect to continue to invest significant resources in growing our whatsapp and messenger products to support increasing usage of such products we have historically monetized messaging in only a limited fashion and we may not be successful in our efforts to generate meaningful revenue or profits from messaging over the long term in addition we are moving forward with plans to implement endtoend encryption across our messaging services as well as facilitate crossapp communication between these platforms which plans have drawn governmental and regulatory scrutiny in multiple jurisdictions if our new or enhanced products fail to engage users marketers or developers or if our business plans are unsuccessful we may fail to attract or retain users or to generate sufficient revenue operating margin or other value to justify our investments and our business may be adversely affected 

we make product and investment decisions that may not prioritize shortterm financial results and may not produce the longterm benefits that we expect 

we frequently make product and investment decisions that may not prioritize shortterm financial results if we believe that the decisions are consistent with our mission and benefit the aggregate user experience and will thereby improve our financial performance over the long term for example we have implemented and we will continue to implement changes to our user data practices some of these changes reduce our ability to effectively target ads which has to some extent adversely affected and will continue to adversely affect our advertising business for example our offfacebook activity tool enables users to place limits on our storage and use of information about their interactions with advertisers apps and websites which reduces our ability to deliver the most relevant and effective ads to our users similarly from time to time we update our news feed ranking algorithm to optimize the user experience and these changes have had and may in the future have the effect of reducing time spent and some measures of user engagement with facebook which could adversely affect our financial results from time to time we may also change the size frequency or relative prominence of ads in order to improve ad quality and overall user experience in addition we have made and we expect to continue to make other changes to our products which may adversely affect the distribution of content of publishers marketers and developers and could reduce their incentive to invest in their efforts on facebook or our other products we also may introduce new features or other changes to existing products or introduce new standalone products that attract users away from properties formats or use cases where we have more proven means of monetization for example we previously introduced the stories format which we do not currently monetize at the same rate as news feed in addition as we focus on growing users and engagement across our family of products from time to time these efforts have reduced and may in the future reduce engagement with one or more products and services in favor of other products or services that we monetize less successfully or that are not growing as quickly these decisions may adversely affect our business and results of operations and may not produce the longterm benefits that we expect 

if we are not able to maintain and enhance our brands our ability to expand our base of users marketers and developers may be impaired and our business and financial results may be harmed 

we believe that our brands have significantly contributed to the success of our business we also believe that maintaining and enhancing our brands is critical to expanding our base of users marketers and developers many of our new users are referred by existing users maintaining and enhancing our brands will depend largely on our ability to continue to provide useful reliable trustworthy and innovative products which we may not do successfully we may introduce new 

products or terms of service or policies that users do not like which may negatively affect our brands additionally the actions of our developers or advertisers may affect our brands if users do not have a positive experience using thirdparty mobile and web applications integrated with our products or interacting with parties that advertise through our products we will also continue to experience media legislative or regulatory scrutiny of our actions or decisions regarding user privacy data use encryption content advertising competition and other issues including actions or decisions in connection with elections or the covid‑19 pandemic which has in the past adversely affected and may in the future adversely affect our reputation and brands for example in march 2018 we announced developments regarding the misuse of certain data by a developer that shared such data with third parties in violation of our terms and policies we also may fail to respond expeditiously or appropriately to the sharing of objectionable content on our services or objectionable practices by advertisers or developers or to otherwise address user concerns which has occurred in the past and which could erode confidence in our brands our brands may also be negatively affected by the actions of users that are deemed to be hostile or inappropriate to other users by the actions of users acting under false or inauthentic identities by the use of our products or services to disseminate information that is deemed to be misleading or intended to manipulate opinions by perceived or actual efforts by governments to obtain access to user information for securityrelated purposes or to censor certain content on our platform by the use of our products or services for illicit or objectionable ends including for example any such actions around the pandemic or elections in the united states and around the world by decisions or recommendations regarding content on our platform from the independent oversight board or by our decisions to remove content or suspend participation on our platform by persons who violate our community standards or terms of service maintaining and enhancing our brands will require us to make substantial investments and these investments may not be successful certain of our past actions such as the foregoing matter regarding developer misuse of data and concerns around our handling of political speech and advertising hate speech and other content have eroded confidence in our brands and if we fail to successfully promote and maintain our brands or if we incur excessive expenses in this effort our business and financial results may be adversely affected 

we may not be able to continue to successfully maintain or grow usage of and engagement with mobile and web applications that integrate with facebook and our other products 

we have made and are continuing to make investments to enable developers to build grow and monetize mobile and web applications that integrate with facebook and our other products such existing and prospective developers may not be successful in building growing or monetizing mobile andor web applications that create and maintain user engagement additionally developers may choose to build on other platforms including mobile platforms controlled by third parties rather than building products that integrate with facebook and our other products we are continuously seeking to balance the distribution objectives of our developers with our desire to provide an optimal user experience and we may not be successful in achieving a balance that continues to attract and retain such developers for example from time to time we have taken actions to reduce the volume of communications from these developers to users on facebook and our other products with the objective of enhancing the user experience and such actions have reduced distribution from user engagement with and our monetization opportunities from mobile and web applications integrated with our products in addition as part of our efforts related to privacy safety and security we conduct investigations and audits of platform applications from time to time and we also have announced several product changes that restrict developer access to certain user data in some instances these actions as well as other actions to enforce our policies applicable to developers have adversely affected or will adversely affect our relationships with developers if we are not successful in our efforts to maintain or grow the number of developers that choose to build products that integrate with facebook and our other products or if we are unable to continue to build and maintain good relations with such developers our user growth and user engagement and our financial results may be adversely affected 

risks related to our business operations and financial results 

the covid19 pandemic has had and may in the future have a significant adverse impact on our advertising revenue and also exposes our business to other risks 

the covid19 pandemic has resulted in authorities implementing numerous preventative measures to contain or mitigate the outbreak of the virus such as travel bans and restrictions limitations on business activity quarantines and shelterinplace orders these measures have caused and are continuing to cause business slowdowns or shutdowns in affected areas both regionally and worldwide which have significantly impacted our business and results of operations for example in the second quarter of 2020 our advertising revenue grew 10 yearoveryear which was the slowest growth rate for any fiscal quarter since our initial public offering while our advertising revenue growth rate improved in subsequent 

quarters there can be no assurance that it will not decrease again as a result of the effects of the pandemic in addition we believe that the pandemic has contributed to an acceleration in the shift of commerce from offline to online as well as increasing consumer demand for purchasing products as opposed to services which in turn have increased demand for our advertising services however it is possible that this increased demand may not continue in future periods and may even recede as the effects of the pandemic subside which could adversely affect our advertising revenue growth the demand for and pricing of our advertising services may be materially and adversely impacted by the pandemic for the foreseeable future and we are unable to predict the duration or degree of such impact with any certainty in addition to the impact on our advertising business the pandemic exposes our business operations and workforce to a variety of other risks including 

• volatility in the size of our user base and user engagement particularly for our messaging products whether as a result of shelterinplace measures or other factors 

• decreased user engagement as a result of users inability to purchase data packs or devices to access our products and services 

• interruptions in the accessibility or performance of our products and services due to capacity constraints from increased usage or product changes we implement to maintain accessibility of our services such as reducing the quality of video to reduce bandwidth usage 

• delays in product development or releases or reductions in manufacturing production and sales of consumer hardware as a result of inventory shortages supply chain or labor shortages or diversion of our efforts and resources to projects related to covid19 

• increased misuse of our products and services or user data by third parties including improper advertising practices or other activity inconsistent with our terms contracts or policies misinformation or other illicit or objectionable material on our platforms election interference or other undesirable activity 

• adverse impacts to our efforts to combat misuse of our products and services and user data as a result of limitations on our safety security and content review efforts while our workforce is working remotely such as the necessity to rely more heavily on artificial intelligence to perform tasks that our workforce is unable to perform 

• our inability to recognize revenue collect payment or generate future revenue from marketers including from those that have been or may be forced to close their businesses or are otherwise impacted by the economic downturn 

• increased expenses resulting from our initiatives or donations related to the pandemic 

• significant volatility and disruption of global financial markets which could cause fluctuations in currency exchange rates or negatively impact our ability to access capital in the future 

• negative impact on our workforce productivity product development and research and development due to difficulties resulting from our personnel working remotely 

• illnesses to key employees or a significant portion of our workforce which may result in inefficiencies delays and disruptions in our business and 

• increased volatility and uncertainty in the financial projections we use as the basis for estimates used in our financial statements 

any of these developments may adversely affect our business harm our reputation or result in legal or regulatory actions against us the persistence of covid19 and the preventative measures implemented to help limit the spread of the illness have impacted and will continue to impact our ability to operate our business and may materially and adversely impact our business financial condition and results of operations 

our business is highly competitive competition presents an ongoing threat to the success of our business 

we compete with companies providing connection and communication products and services to users online as well as companies that sell advertising to businesses looking to reach consumers andor develop tools and systems for managing 

and optimizing advertising campaigns we face significant competition in every aspect of our business including but not limited to companies that facilitate the ability of users to share communicate and discover content and information online or enable marketers to reach their existing or prospective audiences including for example google apple youtube tencent snap twitter bytedance microsoft and amazon we compete to attract engage and retain people who use our products to attract and retain businesses that use our free or paid business and advertising services and to attract and retain developers who build compelling mobile and web applications that integrate with our products we also compete with companies that develop and deliver consumer hardware and virtual reality products and services as we introduce or acquire new products as our existing products evolve or as other companies introduce new products and services we may become subject to additional competition 

some of our current and potential competitors may have greater resources or stronger competitive positions in certain product segments geographic regions or user demographics than we do for example some of our competitors may be domiciled in different countries and subject to political legal and regulatory regimes that enable them to compete more effectively than us these factors may allow our competitors to respond more effectively than us to new or emerging technologies and changes in market conditions we believe that some users particularly younger users are aware of and actively engaging with other products and services similar to or as a substitute for our products and services and we believe that some users have reduced their use of and engagement with our products and services in favor of these other products and services in the event that users increasingly engage with other products and services we may experience a decline in use and engagement in key user demographics or more broadly in which case our business would likely be harmed 

our competitors may develop products features or services that are similar to ours or that achieve greater acceptance may undertake more farreaching and successful product development efforts or marketing campaigns or may adopt more aggressive pricing policies some competitors may gain a competitive advantage against us in areas where we operate including by making acquisitions by limiting our ability to deliver target or measure the effectiveness of ads by imposing fees or other charges related to our delivery of ads by making access to our products more difficult or impossible by making it more difficult to communicate with our users or by integrating competing platforms applications or features into products they control such as mobile device operating systems search engines browsers or ecommerce platforms for example each of apple and google have integrated competitive products with ios and android respectively in addition apple has announced changes to ios 14 that will limit our ability and the ability of others in the digital advertising industry to target and measure ads effectively as a result our competitors may and in some cases will acquire and engage users or generate advertising or other revenue at the expense of our own efforts which would negatively affect our business and financial results in addition from time to time we may take actions in response to competitive threats but we cannot assure you that these actions will be successful or that they will not negatively affect our business and financial results 

we believe that our ability to compete effectively depends upon many factors both within and beyond our control including 

• the popularity usefulness ease of use performance and reliability of our products compared to our competitors products 

• the size and composition of our user base 

• the engagement of users with our products and competing products 

• our ability to attract and retain businesses who use our free or paid business and advertising services 

• the timing and market acceptance of products including developments and enhancements to our or our competitors products 

• our safety and security efforts and our ability to protect user data and to provide users with control over their data 

• our ability to distribute our products to new and existing users 

• our ability to monetize our products 

• the frequency size format quality and relative prominence of the ads displayed by us or our competitors 

• customer service and support efforts 

• marketing and selling efforts including our ability to measure the effectiveness of our ads and to provide marketers with a compelling return on their investments 

• our ability to establish and maintain developers interest in building mobile and web applications that integrate with facebook and our other products 

• our ability to establish and maintain publisher interest in integrating their content with facebook and our other products 

• changes mandated by legislation regulatory authorities or litigation some of which may have a disproportionate effect on us 

• acquisitions or consolidation within our industry which may result in more formidable competitors 

• our ability to attract retain and motivate talented employees particularly software engineers designers and product managers 

• our ability to costeffectively manage and grow our operations and 

• our reputation and brand strength relative to those of our competitors 

if we are not able to compete effectively our user base and level of user engagement may decrease we may become less attractive to developers and marketers and our revenue and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected 

unfavorable media coverage negatively affects our business from time to time 

we receive a high degree of media coverage around the world unfavorable publicity regarding for example our privacy practices terms of service advertising policies product changes product quality litigation or regulatory activity government surveillance the actions of our advertisers the actions of our developers whose products are integrated with our products the use of our products or services for illicit or objectionable ends the substance or enforcement of our community standards the actions of our users the quality and integrity of content shared on our platform or the actions of other companies that provide similar services to ours has in the past and could in the future adversely affect our reputation for example we have been the subject of significant media coverage involving concerns around our handling of political speech and advertising hate speech and other content and we continue to receive negative publicity related to these topics in addition we have been and may in the future be subject to negative publicity in connection with our handling of misinformation and other illicit or objectionable use of our products or services including in connection with the covid19 pandemic and elections in the united states and around the world any such negative publicity could have an adverse effect on the size engagement and loyalty of our user base and marketer demand for advertising on our products which could result in decreased revenue and adversely affect our business and financial results and we have experienced such adverse effects to varying degrees from time to time 

our financial results will fluctuate from quarter to quarter and are difficult to predict 

our quarterly financial results have fluctuated in the past and will fluctuate in the future additionally we have a limited operating history with the current scale of our business which makes it difficult to forecast our future results as a result you should not rely upon our past quarterly financial results as indicators of future performance you should take into account the risks and uncertainties frequently encountered by companies in rapidly evolving markets our financial results in any given quarter can be influenced by numerous factors many of which we are unable to predict or are outside of our control including 

• our ability to maintain and grow our user base and user engagement 

• our ability to attract and retain marketers in a particular period 

• our ability to recognize revenue or collect payments from marketers in a particular period including as a result of the effects of the covid19 pandemic 

• fluctuations in spending by our marketers due to seasonality such as historically strong spending in the fourth quarter of each year episodic regional or global events including the covid19 pandemic or other factors 

• the frequency prominence size format and quality of ads shown to users 

• the success of technologies designed to block the display of ads 

• changes to thirdparty policies that limit our ability to deliver target or measure the effectiveness of advertising including changes by mobile operating system and browser providers such as apple and google 

• the pricing of our ads and other products 

• the diversification and growth of revenue sources beyond advertising on facebook and instagram 

• our ability to generate revenue from payments or the sale of our consumer hardware products or other products we may introduce in the future 

• changes to existing products or services or the development and introduction of new products or services by us or our competitors 

• user behavior or product changes that may reduce traffic to features or products that we successfully monetize 

• increases in marketing sales and other operating expenses that we will incur to grow and expand our operations and to remain competitive including costs related to our data centers and technical infrastructure 

• costs related to our privacy safety security and content review efforts including as a result of implementing changes to our practices whether voluntarily in connection with laws regulations regulatory actions or decisions or recommendations from the independent oversight board or otherwise 

• costs and expenses related to the development and delivery of our consumer hardware products 

• our ability to maintain gross margins and operating margins 

• costs related to acquisitions including costs associated with amortization and additional investments to develop the acquired technologies 

• charges associated with impairment of any assets on our balance sheet 

• our ability to obtain equipment components and labor for our data centers and other technical infrastructure in a timely and costeffective manner 

• system failures or outages or government blocking which could prevent us from serving ads for any period of time 

• breaches of security or privacy and the costs associated with any such breaches and remediation 

• changes in the manner in which we distribute our products or inaccessibility of our products due to thirdparty actions 

• fees paid to third parties for content or the distribution of our products 

• refunds or other concessions provided to advertisers 

• sharebased compensation expense including acquisitionrelated expense 

• adverse litigation judgments settlements or other litigationrelated costs 

• changes in the legislative or regulatory environment including with respect to privacy and data protection or actions by governments or regulators including fines orders or consent decrees 

• the overall tax rate for our business which is affected by the mix of income we earn in the us and in jurisdictions with different tax rates the effects of sharebased compensation the effects of integrating intellectual property from acquisitions the effects of changes in our business or structure and the effects of discrete items such as legal and tax settlements and tax elections 

• the impact of changes in tax laws or judicial or regulatory interpretations of tax laws which are recorded in the period such laws are enacted or interpretations are issued and may significantly affect the effective tax rate of that period 

• tax obligations that may arise from resolutions of tax examinations including the examination we are currently under by the internal revenue service irs that materially differ from the amounts we have anticipated 

• fluctuations in currency exchange rates and changes in the proportion of our revenue and expenses denominated in foreign currencies 

• trading activity in our share repurchase program 

• fluctuations in the market values of our investments in marketable securities in the valuation of our equity investments and in interest rates 

• changes in us generally accepted accounting principles and 

• changes in regional or global business or macroeconomic conditions including as a result of the covid19 pandemic which may impact the other factors described above 

we expect our rates of growth to be volatile in the near term as a result of the covid19 pandemic and to decline over time in the future 

we expect our user and revenue growth rates to be volatile in the near term as a result of the covid19 pandemic although we are unable to predict the duration or degree of such volatility with any certainty in the long term we expect that our user growth rate will generally decline over time as the size of our active user base increases and the size of our active user base may fluctuate or decline in one or more markets particularly as we achieve greater market penetration we also expect our revenue growth rate will continue to decline over time as our revenue increases to higher levels as our growth rates experience volatility or decline investors perceptions of our business may be adversely affected and the trading price of our class a common stock could decline 

our costs are continuing to grow and some of our investments particularly our investments in virtual and augmented reality have the effect of reducing our operating margin and profitability if our investments are not successful longerterm our business and financial performance will be harmed 

operating our business is costly and we expect our expenses to continue to increase in the future as we broaden our user base as users increase the amount and types of content they consume and the data they share with us for example with respect to video as we develop and implement new products as we market new and existing products and promote our brands as we continue to expand our technical infrastructure as we continue to invest in new and unproven technologies and as we continue to hire additional employees and contractors to support our expanding operations including our efforts to focus on privacy safety security and content review in addition from time to time we are subject to settlements judgments 

fines or other monetary penalties in connection with legal and regulatory developments that may be material to our business we are also continuing to increase our investments in new platforms and technologies some of these investments particularly our significant investments in virtual and augmented reality have generated only limited revenue and reduced our operating margin and profitability and we expect the adverse financial impact of such investments to continue for the foreseeable future if our investments are not successful longerterm our business and financial performance will be harmed 

we plan to continue to make acquisitions and pursue other strategic transactions which could harm our financial condition or results of operations and may adversely affect the price of our common stock 

as part of our business strategy we have made and intend to continue to make acquisitions to add specialized employees and complementary companies products or technologies and from time to time may enter into other strategic transactions such as investments and joint ventures we may not be able to find suitable acquisition candidates and we may not be able to complete acquisitions or other strategic transactions on favorable terms if at all including as a result of regulatory challenges in some cases the costs of such acquisitions or other strategic transactions may be substantial and there is no assurance that we will receive a favorable return on investment for our acquisitions or other strategic transactions 

we may pay substantial amounts of cash or incur debt to pay for acquisitions or other strategic transactions which has occurred in the past and could adversely affect our liquidity the incurrence of indebtedness would also result in increased fixed obligations and increased interest expense and could also include covenants or other restrictions that would impede our ability to manage our operations we may also issue equity securities to pay for acquisitions and we regularly grant rsus to retain the employees of acquired companies which could increase our expenses adversely affect our financial results and result in dilution to our stockholders in addition any acquisitions or other strategic transactions we announce could be viewed negatively by users marketers developers or investors which may adversely affect our business or the price of our class a common stock 

we may also discover liabilities deficiencies or other claims associated with the companies or assets we acquire that were not identified in advance which may result in significant unanticipated costs the effectiveness of our due diligence review and our ability to evaluate the results of such due diligence are dependent upon the accuracy and completeness of statements and disclosures made or actions taken by the companies we acquire or their representatives as well as the limited amount of time in which acquisitions are executed in addition we may fail to accurately forecast the financial impact of an acquisition or other strategic transaction including tax and accounting charges acquisitions or other strategic transactions may also result in our recording of significant additional expenses to our results of operations and recording of substantial finitelived intangible assets on our balance sheet upon closing any of these factors may adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations 

we may not be able to successfully integrate our acquisitions and we incur significant costs to integrate and support the companies we acquire 

the integration of acquisitions requires significant time and resources and we may not manage these processes successfully our ability to successfully integrate complex acquisitions is unproven particularly with respect to companies that have significant operations or that develop products where we do not have prior experience we continue to make substantial investments of resources to support our acquisitions which will result in significant ongoing operating expenses and may divert resources and management attention from other areas of our business we cannot assure you that these investments will be successful if we fail to successfully integrate the companies we acquire we may not realize the benefits expected from the transaction and our business may be harmed 

our business is dependent on our ability to maintain and scale our technical infrastructure and any significant disruption in our service including as a result of the covid19 pandemic could damage our reputation result in a potential loss of users and engagement and adversely affect our financial results 

our reputation and ability to attract retain and serve our users is dependent upon the reliable performance of our products and our underlying technical infrastructure we have in the past experienced and may in the future experience interruptions in the availability or performance of our products from time to time our systems may not be adequately designed or may not operate with the reliability and redundancy necessary to avoid performance delays or outages that could be harmful to our business if our products are unavailable when users attempt to access them or if they do not load as quickly as expected users may not use our products as often in the future or at all and our ability to serve ads may be 

disrupted any of which could adversely affect our business and financial performance as the amount and types of information shared on facebook and our other products continue to grow and evolve as the usage patterns of our global community continue to evolve and as our internal operational demands continue to grow we will need an increasing amount of technical infrastructure including network capacity and computing power to continue to satisfy our needs it is possible that we may fail to continue to effectively scale and grow our technical infrastructure to accommodate these increased demands which may adversely affect our user engagement and advertising revenue growth in addition our business may be subject to interruptions delays or failures resulting from earthquakes adverse weather conditions other natural disasters power loss terrorism geopolitical conflict other physical security threats cyberattacks or other catastrophic events if such an event were to occur users may be subject to service disruptions or outages and we may not be able to recover our technical infrastructure and user data in a timely manner to restart or provide our services which may adversely affect our financial results 

for example the increase in the use of our products as a result of the covid19 pandemic increased demands on our technical infrastructure additional product development efforts during this time have put additional pressure on our technical infrastructure we may not be able to accommodate these demands including as a result of our reduced data center operations and personnel working remotely during the pandemic 

a substantial portion of our network infrastructure is provided by third parties any disruption or failure in the services we receive from these providers could harm our ability to handle existing or increased traffic and could significantly harm our business any financial or other difficulties these providers face may adversely affect our business and we exercise little control over these providers which increases our vulnerability to problems with the services they provide the effects of the covid19 pandemic have increased the risk of supply or labor shortages or other disruptions in logistics or the supply chain for our technical infrastructure as a result we may not be able to procure sufficient equipment or services from third parties to satisfy our needs or we may be required to procure such services or equipment on unfavorable terms 

any of these developments may result in interruptions in the availability or performance of our products require unfavorable changes to existing products delay the introduction of future products or otherwise adversely affect our business and financial results 

we could experience unforeseen difficulties in building and operating key portions of our technical infrastructure 

we have designed and built our own data centers and key portions of our technical infrastructure through which we serve our products and we plan to continue to significantly expand the size of our infrastructure primarily through data centers subsea and terrestrial fiber optic cable systems and other projects the infrastructure expansion we are undertaking is complex and involves projects in multiple locations around the world including in emerging markets that expose us to increased risks relating to anticorruption compliance and political challenges among others we have in the past suspended and may in the future suspend certain of these projects as a result of the covid19 pandemic additional unanticipated delays or disruptions in the completion of these projects including due to any shortage of labor necessary in building portions of such projects or availability of components challenges in obtaining required government or regulatory approvals or other geopolitical challenges or actions by governments whether as a result of the pandemic trade disputes or otherwise may lead to increased project costs operational inefficiencies interruptions in the delivery or degradation of the quality or reliability of our products or impairment of assets on our balance sheet in addition there may be issues related to this infrastructure that are not identified during the testing phases of design and implementation which may only become evident after we have started to fully utilize the underlying equipment that could further degrade the user experience or increase our costs further much of our technical infrastructure is located outside the united states and it is possible that action by a foreign government or our response to such government action could result in the impairment of a portion of our technical infrastructure which may interrupt the delivery or degrade the quality or reliability of our products and lead to a negative user experience or increase our costs any of these events could adversely affect our business reputation or financial results 

real or perceived inaccuracies in our community and other metrics may harm our reputation and negatively affect our business 

the numbers for our key metrics which include our facebook metrics daus maus and average revenue per user arpu and family metrics dap map and average revenue per person arpp are calculated using internal company data based on the activity of user accounts while these numbers are based on what we believe to be reasonable estimates of our user base for the applicable period of measurement there are inherent challenges in measuring usage of our products across large online and mobile populations around the world the methodologies used to measure these metrics require 

significant judgment and are also susceptible to algorithm or other technical errors in addition we are continually seeking to improve our estimates of our user base and such estimates may change due to improvements or changes in our methodology we regularly review our processes for calculating these metrics and from time to time we discover inaccuracies in our metrics or make adjustments to improve their accuracy which can result in adjustments to our historical metrics our ability to recalculate our historical metrics may be impacted by data limitations or other factors that require us to apply different methodologies for such adjustments we generally do not intend to update previously disclosed family metrics for any such inaccuracies or adjustments that are within the error margins disclosed below 

in addition our facebook metrics and family metrics estimates will differ from estimates published by third parties due to differences in methodology 

we regularly evaluate our facebook metrics to estimate the number of duplicate and false accounts among our maus a duplicate account is one that a user maintains in addition to his or her principal account we divide false accounts into two categories 1 usermisclassified accounts where users have created personal profiles for a business organization or nonhuman entity such as a pet such entities are permitted on facebook using a page rather than a personal profile under our terms of service and 2 violating accounts which represent user profiles that we believe are intended to be used for purposes that violate our terms of service such as bots and spam the estimates of duplicate and false accounts are based on an internal review of a limited sample of accounts and we apply significant judgment in making this determination for example to identify duplicate accounts we use data signals such as identical ip addresses and similar user names and to identify false accounts we look for names that appear to be fake or other behavior that appears inauthentic to the reviewers any loss of access to data signals we use in this process whether as a result of our own product decisions actions by thirdparty browser or mobile platforms regulatory or legislative requirements limitations while our personnel work remotely during the covid19 pandemic or other factors also may impact the stability or accuracy of our estimates of duplicate and false accounts our estimates also may change as our methodologies evolve including through the application of new data signals or technologies or product changes that may allow us to identify previously undetected duplicate or false accounts and may improve our ability to evaluate a broader population of our users duplicate and false accounts are very difficult to measure at our scale and it is possible that the actual number of duplicate and false accounts may vary significantly from our estimates 

in the fourth quarter of 2020 we estimated that duplicate accounts may have represented approximately 11 of our worldwide maus we believe the percentage of duplicate accounts is meaningfully higher in developing markets such as the philippines and vietnam as compared to more developed markets in the fourth quarter of 2020 we estimated that false accounts may have represented approximately 5 of our worldwide maus our estimation of false accounts can vary as a result of episodic spikes in the creation of such accounts which we have seen originate more frequently in specific countries such as indonesia and vietnam from time to time we disable certain user accounts make product changes or take other actions to reduce the number of duplicate or false accounts among our users which may also reduce our dau and mau estimates in a particular period we intend to disclose our estimates of the number of duplicate and false accounts among our maus on an annual basis 

many people in our community have user accounts on more than one of our products and some people have multiple user accounts within an individual product accordingly for our family metrics we do not seek to count the total number of user accounts across our products because we believe that would not reflect the actual size of our community rather our family metrics represent our estimates of the number of unique people using at least one of facebook instagram messenger and whatsapp we do not require people to use a common identifier or link their accounts to use multiple products in our family and therefore must seek to attribute multiple user accounts within and across products to individual people to calculate these metrics we rely upon complex techniques algorithms and machine learning models that seek to count the individual people behind user accounts including by matching multiple user accounts within an individual product and across multiple products when we believe they are attributable to a single person and counting such group of accounts as one person these techniques and models require significant judgment are subject to data and other limitations discussed below and inherently are subject to statistical variances and uncertainties we estimate the potential error in our family metrics primarily based on user survey data which itself is subject to error as well while we expect the error margin for our family metrics to vary from period to period we estimate that such margin generally will be approximately 4 of our worldwide map at our scale it is very difficult to attribute multiple user accounts within and across products to individual people and it is possible that the actual numbers of unique people using our products may vary significantly from our estimates potentially beyond our estimated error margins as a result it is also possible that our family metrics may indicate changes or trends in user numbers that do not match actual changes or trends 

to calculate our estimates of family dap and map we currently use a series of machine learning models that are developed based on internal reviews of limited samples of user accounts and calibrated against user survey data we apply significant judgment in designing these models and calculating these estimates for example to match user accounts within individual products and across multiple products we use data signals such as similar device information ip addresses and user names we also calibrate our models against data from periodic user surveys of varying sizes and frequency across our products which are inherently subject to error the timing and results of such user surveys have in the past contributed and may in the future contribute to changes in our reported family metrics from period to period in addition our data limitations may affect our understanding of certain details of our business and increase the risk of error for our family metrics estimates our techniques and models rely on a variety of data signals from different products and we rely on more limited data signals for some products compared to others for example as a result of limited visibility into encrypted products we have fewer data signals from whatsapp user accounts and primarily rely on phone numbers and device information to match whatsapp user accounts with accounts on our other products similarly although messenger kids users are included in our family metrics we do not seek to match their accounts with accounts on our other applications for purposes of calculating dap and map any loss of access to data signals we use in our process for calculating family metrics whether as a result of our own product decisions actions by thirdparty browser or mobile platforms regulatory or legislative requirements limitations while our personnel work remotely during the covid19 pandemic or other factors also may impact the stability or accuracy of our reported family metrics our estimates of family metrics also may change as our methodologies evolve including through the application of new data signals or technologies product changes or other improvements in our user surveys algorithms or machine learning that may improve our ability to match accounts within and across our products or otherwise evaluate the broad population of our users in addition such evolution may allow us to identify previously undetected violating accounts as defined below 

we regularly evaluate our family metrics to estimate the percentage of our map consisting solely of violating accounts we define violating accounts as accounts which we believe are intended to be used for purposes that violate our terms of service including bots and spam in the fourth quarter of 2020 we estimated that approximately 3 of our worldwide map consisted solely of violating accounts such estimation is based on an internal review of a limited sample of accounts and we apply significant judgment in making this determination for example we look for account information and behaviors associated with facebook and instagram accounts that appear to be inauthentic to the reviewers but we have limited visibility into whatsapp user activity due to encryption in addition if we believe an individual person has one or more violating accounts we do not include such person in our violating accounts estimation as long as we believe they have one account that does not constitute a violating account from time to time we disable certain user accounts make product changes or take other actions to reduce the number of violating accounts among our users which may also reduce our dap and map estimates in a particular period we intend to disclose our estimates of the percentage of our map consisting solely of violating accounts on an annual basis violating accounts are very difficult to measure at our scale and it is possible that the actual number of violating accounts may vary significantly from our estimates 

other data limitations also may affect our understanding of certain details of our business for example while userprovided data indicates a decline in usage among younger users this age data is unreliable because a disproportionate number of our younger users register with an inaccurate age accordingly our understanding of usage by age group may not be complete 

in addition our data regarding the geographic location of our users is estimated based on a number of factors such as the users ip address and selfdisclosed location these factors may not always accurately reflect the users actual location for example a user may appear to be accessing facebook from the location of the proxy server that the user connects to rather than from the users actual location the methodologies used to measure our metrics are also susceptible to algorithm or other technical errors and our estimates for revenue by user location and revenue by user device are also affected by these factors 

in addition from time to time we provide or rely on certain other metrics and estimates including those relating to the reach and effectiveness of our ads many of our metrics involve the use of estimations and judgments and our metrics and estimates are subject to software bugs inconsistencies in our systems and human error where marketers developers or investors do not perceive our metrics or estimates to be accurate or where we discover material inaccuracies in our metrics or estimates we may be subject to liability our reputation may be harmed and marketers and developers may be less willing to allocate their budgets or resources to facebook or our other products which could negatively affect our business and financial results 

we cannot assure you that we will effectively manage our growth 

our employee headcount and the scope and complexity of our business have increased significantly with the number of employees increasing to 58604 as of december 31 2020 from 44942 as of december 31 2019 and we expect headcount growth to continue for the foreseeable future in addition we plan to continue to hire a number of employees and contractors to continue to bolster various privacy safety security and content review initiatives as well as other functions to support our expected growth the growth and expansion of our business and products create significant challenges for our management operational and financial resources including managing multiple relationships with users marketers developers and other third parties as our operations and the number of our thirdparty relationships continue to grow our information technology systems or our internal controls and procedures may not be adequate to support such growth in addition some members of our management do not have significant experience managing a large global business operation so our management may not be able to manage such growth effectively additionally the vast majority of our personnel are currently working remotely as a result of the covid19 pandemic which limits their ability to perform certain job functions and may negatively impact productivity in the long term we may experience such challenges to productivity and collaboration as some personnel transition to working remotely on a regular basis and we may experience difficulties integrating recently hired personnel when our offices reopen to effectively manage our growth we must continue to adapt to a remote work environment improve our operational financial and management processes and systems and effectively expand train and manage our personnel as our organization continues to grow and we are required to implement more complex organizational management structures we may find it increasingly difficult to maintain the benefits of our corporate culture including our ability to quickly develop and launch new and innovative products this could negatively affect our business performance 

we have significant international operations and plan to continue expanding our operations abroad where we have more limited operating experience and this may subject us to increased business economic and legal risks that could affect our financial results 

we have significant international operations and plan to continue the international expansion of our business operations and the translation of our products we currently make facebook available in more than 100 different languages and we have offices or data centers in more than 30 different countries we may enter new international markets where we have limited or no experience in marketing selling and deploying our products our products are generally available globally but some or all of our products or functionality may not be available in certain markets due to legal and regulatory complexities for example facebook and certain of our other products are not generally available in china we also outsource certain operational functions to thirdparty vendors globally if we fail to deploy manage or oversee our international operations successfully our business may suffer in addition we are subject to a variety of risks inherent in doing business internationally including 

• political social or economic instability 

• risks related to legal regulatory and other government scrutiny applicable to us companies with sales and operations in foreign jurisdictions including with respect to privacy tax law enforcement content trade compliance competition consumer protection intellectual property and infrastructure matters 

• potential damage to our brand and reputation due to compliance with local laws including potential censorship or requirements to provide user information to local authorities 

• enhanced difficulty in reviewing content on our platform and enforcing our community standards across different languages and countries 

• fluctuations in currency exchange rates and compliance with currency controls 

• foreign exchange controls and tax and other regulations and orders that might prevent us from repatriating cash earned in countries outside the united states or otherwise limit our ability to move cash freely and impede our ability to invest such cash efficiently 

• higher levels of credit risk and payment fraud 

• enhanced difficulties of integrating any foreign acquisitions 

• burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws including laws related to taxation content removal data localization payments and regulatory oversight 

• reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries 

• difficulties in staffing managing and overseeing global operations and the increased travel infrastructure and legal compliance costs associated with multiple international locations including difficulties arising from personnel working remotely during the covid19 pandemic 

• compliance with statutory equity requirements and management of tax consequences and 

• geopolitical events affecting us our marketers or our industry including trade disputes and pandemics 

in addition we must manage the potential conflicts between locally accepted business practices in any given jurisdiction and our obligations to comply with laws and regulations including anticorruption laws or regulations applicable to us such as the us foreign corrupt practices act and the uk bribery act 2010 we also must manage our obligations to comply with laws and regulations related to export controls sanctions and embargoes including regulations established by the us office of foreign assets control government agencies and authorities have a broad range of civil and criminal penalties they may seek to impose against companies for violations of anticorruption laws or regulations export controls and other laws rules sanctions embargoes and regulations 

if we are unable to expand internationally and manage the complexity of our global operations successfully our financial results could be adversely affected 

we face design manufacturing and supply chain risks that if not properly managed could adversely impact our financial results 

we face a number of risks related to design manufacturing and supply chain management with respect to our consumer hardware products for example the consumer hardware products we sell from time to time have had and in the future may have quality issues resulting from the design or manufacture of the products or from the software used in the products sometimes these issues may be caused by components we purchase from other manufacturers or suppliers our brand and financial results could be adversely affected by any such quality issues other failures to meet our customers expectations or findings of our consumer hardware products to be defective 

we rely on third parties to manufacture and manage the logistics of transporting and distributing our consumer hardware products which subjects us to a number of risks that have been exacerbated as a result of the covid19 pandemic we may experience supply or labor shortages or other disruptions in logistics or the supply chain that could result in shipping delays and negatively impact our operations product development and sales we could be negatively affected if we are not able to engage third parties with the necessary capabilities or capacity on reasonable terms or if those we engage with fail to meet their obligations whether due to financial difficulties manufacturing constraints or other reasons or make adverse changes in the pricing or other material terms of such arrangements with them the manufacturing distribution and sale of our consumer hardware products also may be negatively impacted by macroeconomic conditions geopolitical challenges trade disputes or other actions by governments that subject us to supply shortages increased costs or supply chain disruptions 

we also require the suppliers and business partners of our consumer hardware products to comply with laws and certain company policies regarding sourcing practices and standards on labor health and safety the environment and business ethics but we do not control them or their practices and standards if any of them violates laws fails to implement changes in accordance with newly enacted laws or implements practices or standards regarded as unethical corrupt or noncompliant we could experience supply chain disruptions government action or fines canceled orders or damage to our reputation 

we face inventory risk with respect to our consumer hardware products 

we are exposed to inventory risks with respect to our consumer hardware products as a result of rapid changes in 

product cycles and pricing unsafe or defective merchandise changes in consumer demand and consumer spending patterns changes in consumer tastes with respect to our consumer hardware products and other factors the demand for our products can also change significantly between the time inventory or components are ordered and the date of sale while we endeavor to accurately predict these trends and avoid overstocking or understocking consumer hardware products we may sell from time to time we have experienced difficulties in accurately predicting and meeting the consumer demand for our products in addition when we begin selling or manufacturing a new consumer hardware product or enter new international markets it may be difficult to establish vendor relationships determine appropriate product or component selection and accurately forecast demand the acquisition of certain types of inventory or components may require significant leadtime and prepayment and they may not be returnable any one of the foregoing factors may adversely affect our operating results 

we are involved in numerous class action lawsuits and other litigation matters that are expensive and time consuming and if resolved adversely could harm our business financial condition or results of operations 

we are involved in numerous lawsuits including stockholder derivative lawsuits and putative class action lawsuits many of which claim statutory damages andor seek significant changes to our business operations and we anticipate that we will continue to be a target for numerous lawsuits in the future because of the scale of our user advertiser and developer base the plaintiffs in class action cases filed against us typically claim enormous monetary damages even if the alleged peruser or entity harm is small or nonexistent in addition we have in the past and may in the future be subject to additional class action lawsuits based on claims related to advertising antitrust privacy content employment or product performance or other claims related to the use of consumer hardware and software as well as virtual reality technology and products which are new and unproven for example we are currently the subject of multiple putative class action suits in connection with our platform and user data practices and the misuse of certain data by a developer that shared such data with third parties in violation of our terms and policies the disclosure of our earnings results for the second quarter of 2018 and our acquisitions of instagram and whatsapp as well as other alleged anticompetitive conduct we also agreed to settle certain lawsuits in connection with the tag suggestions facial recognition feature on facebook and a thirdparty cyberattack that exploited a vulnerability in facebooks code to steal user access tokens and access certain profile information from user accounts on facebook the results of any such lawsuits and claims cannot be predicted with certainty and any negative outcome from any such lawsuits could result in payments of substantial monetary damages or fines or undesirable changes to our products or business practices and accordingly our business financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

there can be no assurances that a favorable final outcome will be obtained in all our cases and defending any lawsuit is costly and can impose a significant burden on management and employees any litigation to which we are a party may result in an onerous or unfavorable judgment that may not be reversed upon appeal or in payments of substantial monetary damages or fines or we may decide to settle lawsuits on similarly unfavorable terms which has occurred in the past and which could adversely affect our business financial conditions or results of operations 

we may have exposure to greater than anticipated tax liabilities 

our tax obligations including income and nonincome taxes are based in part on our corporate operating structure and intercompany arrangements including the manner in which we operate our business develop value manage protect and use our intellectual property and the valuations of our intercompany transactions the tax laws applicable to our business including the laws of the united states and other jurisdictions are subject to interpretation and certain jurisdictions are aggressively interpreting their laws in new ways in an effort to raise additional tax revenue from companies such as facebook we are subject to regular review and audit by us federal state and foreign tax authorities tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken including our methodologies for valuing developed technology or intercompany arrangements and any adverse outcome of such a review or audit could increase our worldwide effective tax rate increase the amount of nonincome taxes imposed on our business and harm our financial position results of operations and cash flows for example in 2016 and 2018 the irs issued formal assessments relating to transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries in conjunction with the examination of the 2010 through 2013 tax years although we disagree with the irss position and are litigating this issue the ultimate resolution is uncertain and if resolved in a manner unfavorable to us may adversely affect our financial results 

the determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires significant judgment by management and there are many transactions where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain our provision for income taxes is determined by the manner in which we operate our business and any changes to such operations or laws applicable to such operations may affect our effective tax rate although we believe that our provision for income taxes and estimates of 

our nonincome tax liabilities are reasonable the ultimate settlement may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements and may materially affect our financial results in the period or periods for which such determination is made 

our future income tax rates could be volatile and difficult to predict due to changes in jurisdictional profit split changes in the amount and recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities or by changes in tax laws regulations or accounting principles 

changes in tax laws or tax rulings could materially affect our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

the tax regimes we are subject to or operate under including income and nonincome taxes are unsettled and may be subject to significant change changes in tax laws or tax rulings or changes in interpretations of existing laws could materially affect our financial position results of operations and cash flows for example the 2017 tax cuts and jobs act tax act enacted in december 2017 had a significant impact on our tax obligations and effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2017 the issuance of additional regulatory or accounting guidance related to the tax act or other executive or congressional actions in the united states could materially affect our tax obligations and effective tax rate in the period such guidance is issued or such actions take effect in addition many countries in europe as well as a number of other countries and organizations have recently proposed or recommended changes to existing tax laws or have enacted new laws that could significantly increase our tax obligations in many countries where we do business or require us to change the manner in which we operate our business 

the organization for economic cooperation and development has been working on a base erosion and profit shifting project and issued a report in 2015 an interim report in 2018 and blueprints in 2020 that if implemented would change various aspects of the existing framework under which our tax obligations are determined in many of the countries in which we do business similarly the european commission and several countries have issued proposals that would apply to various aspects of the current tax framework under which we are taxed these proposals include changes to the existing framework to calculate income tax as well as proposals to change or impose new types of nonincome taxes including taxes based on a percentage of revenue for example several countries have proposed or enacted taxes applicable to digital services which includes business activities on social media platforms and online marketplaces and which apply to our business 

the european commission has conducted investigations in multiple countries focusing on whether local country tax rulings or tax legislation provides preferential tax treatment that violates european union state aid rules and concluded that certain countries including ireland have provided illegal state aid in certain cases these investigations may result in changes to the tax treatment of our foreign operations 

due to the large and expanding scale of our international business activities many of these types of changes to the taxation of our activities described above could increase our worldwide effective tax rate increase the amount of nonincome taxes imposed on our business and harm our financial position results of operations and cash flows such changes may also apply retroactively to our historical operations and result in taxes greater than the amounts estimated and recorded in our financial statements 

given our levels of sharebased compensation our tax rate may vary significantly depending on our stock price 

the tax effects of the accounting for sharebased compensation may significantly impact our effective tax rate from period to period in periods in which our stock price is higher than the grant price of the sharebased compensation vesting in that period we will recognize excess tax benefits that will decrease our effective tax rate for example in 2020 excess tax benefits recognized from sharebased compensation decreased our provision for income taxes by 656 million and our effective tax rate by two percentage points as compared to the tax rate without such benefits in future periods in which our stock price is lower than the grant price of the sharebased compensation vesting in that period our effective tax rate may increase the amount and value of sharebased compensation issued relative to our earnings in a particular period will also affect the magnitude of the impact of sharebased compensation on our effective tax rate these tax effects are dependent on our stock price which we do not control and a decline in our stock price could significantly increase our effective tax rate and adversely affect our financial results 

if our goodwill or finitelived intangible assets become impaired we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings 

we review our finitelived intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable such as a decline in stock price and market capitalization we test goodwill for impairment at least annually if such goodwill or finitelived intangible assets are deemed to be impaired an impairment loss equal to the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the assets would be recognized we may be required to record a significant charge in our financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill or finitelived intangible assets is determined which would negatively affect our results of operations 

the loss of one or more of our key personnel or our failure to attract and retain other highly qualified personnel in the future could harm our business 

we currently depend on the continued services and performance of our key personnel including mark zuckerberg and sheryl k sandberg although we have entered into employment agreements with mr zuckerberg and ms sandberg the agreements have no specific duration and constitute atwill employment in addition many of our key technologies and systems are custommade for our business by our personnel the loss of key personnel including members of management as well as key engineering product development marketing and sales personnel could disrupt our operations and have an adverse effect on our business 

as we continue to grow we cannot guarantee we will continue to attract and retain the personnel we need to maintain our competitive position in particular we intend to continue to hire a significant number of technical personnel in the foreseeable future and we expect to continue to face significant challenges in hiring such personnel particularly in the san francisco bay area where our headquarters are located whether as a result of competition with other companies challenges due to the high cost of living facilities and infrastructure constraints or other factors as we continue to mature the incentives to attract retain and motivate employees provided by our equity awards or by future arrangements may not be as effective as in the past and if we issue significant equity to attract additional employees or to retain our existing employees we would incur substantial additional sharebased compensation expense and the ownership of our existing stockholders would be further diluted our ability to attract retain and motivate employees may also be adversely affected by stock price volatility as a result of these factors it may be difficult for us to continue to retain and motivate our employees if we do not succeed in attracting hiring and integrating excellent personnel or retaining and motivating existing personnel we may be unable to grow effectively 

our ceo has control over key decision making as a result of his control of a majority of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock 

mark zuckerberg our founder chairman and ceo is able to exercise voting rights with respect to a majority of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock and therefore has the ability to control the outcome of matters submitted to our stockholders for approval including the election of directors and any merger consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets this concentrated control could delay defer or prevent a change of control merger consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets that our other stockholders support or conversely this concentrated control could result in the consummation of such a transaction that our other stockholders do not support this concentrated control could also discourage a potential investor from acquiring our class a common stock which has limited voting power relative to the class b common stock and might harm the trading price of our class a common stock in addition mr zuckerberg has the ability to control the management and major strategic investments of our company as a result of his position as our ceo and his ability to control the election or in some cases the replacement of our directors in the event of his death the shares of our capital stock that mr zuckerberg owns will be transferred to the persons or entities that he has designated as a board member and officer mr zuckerberg owes a fiduciary duty to our stockholders and must act in good faith in a manner he reasonably believes to be in the best interests of our stockholders as a stockholder even a controlling stockholder mr zuckerberg is entitled to vote his shares and shares over which he has voting control as governed by a voting agreement in his own interests which may not always be in the interests of our stockholders generally 

we cannot guarantee that our share repurchase program will be fully consummated or that it will enhance longterm stockholder value share repurchases could also increase the volatility of the trading price of our stock and will diminish our cash reserves 

although our board of directors has authorized a share repurchase program that does not have an expiration date the program does not obligate us to repurchase any specific dollar amount or to acquire any specific number of shares of our class a common stock we cannot guarantee that the program will be fully consummated or that it will enhance longterm stockholder value the program could affect the trading price of our stock and increase volatility and any announcement of a termination of this program may result in a decrease in the trading price of our stock in addition this program will diminish our cash reserves 

risks related to government regulation and enforcement 

actions by governments that restrict access to facebook or our other products in their countries or that otherwise impair our ability to sell advertising in their countries could substantially harm our business and financial results 

governments from time to time seek to censor content available on facebook or our other products in their country restrict access to our products from their country entirely or impose other restrictions that may affect the accessibility of our products in their country for an extended period of time or indefinitely for example user access to facebook and certain of our other products has been or is currently restricted in whole or in part in china iran and north korea in addition government authorities in other countries may seek to restrict user access to our products if they consider us to be in violation of their laws or a threat to public safety or for other reasons and certain of our products have been restricted by governments in other countries from time to time for example in june 2020 hong kong adopted a national security law that provides authorities with the ability to obtain information remove and block access to content and suspend user services and if we are found to be in violation of this law then the use of our products may be restricted in addition if we are required to or elect to make changes to our marketing and sales or other operations in hong kong as a result of the national security law our revenue and business in the region will be adversely affected it is also possible that government authorities could take action that impairs our ability to sell advertising including in countries where access to our consumerfacing products may be blocked or restricted for example we generate meaningful revenue from a limited number of resellers representing advertisers based in china and it is possible that the chinese government could take action that reduces or eliminates our chinabased advertising revenue whether as a result of the trade dispute with the united states in response to content issues or information requests in hong kong or elsewhere or for other reasons or take other action against us such as imposing taxes or other penalties which could adversely affect our financial results similarly if we are found to be out of compliance with certain legal requirements for social media companies in turkey the turkish government could take action to reduce or eliminate our turkeybased advertising revenue or otherwise adversely impact access to our products in the event that content shown on facebook or our other products is subject to censorship access to our products is restricted in whole or in part in one or more countries we are required to or elect to make changes to our operations or other restrictions are imposed on our products or our competitors are able to successfully penetrate new geographic markets or capture a greater share of existing geographic markets that we cannot access or where we face other restrictions our ability to retain or increase our user base user engagement or the level of advertising by marketers may be adversely affected we may not be able to maintain or grow our revenue as anticipated and our financial results could be adversely affected 

our business is subject to complex and evolving us and foreign laws and regulations regarding privacy data use and data protection content competition consumer protection and other matters many of these laws and regulations are subject to change and uncertain interpretation and could result in claims changes to our business practices monetary penalties increased cost of operations or declines in user growth or engagement or otherwise harm our business 

we are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the united states and abroad that involve matters central to our business including privacy data use data protection and personal information rights of publicity content intellectual property advertising marketing distribution data security data retention and deletion data localization and storage data disclosure artificial intelligence electronic contracts and other communications competition protection of minors consumer protection telecommunications product liability ecommerce taxation economic or other trade prohibitions or sanctions anticorruption and political law compliance securities law compliance and online payment services the introduction of new products expansion of our activities in certain jurisdictions or other actions that we may take may subject us to additional laws regulations or other government scrutiny in addition foreign data protection privacy content competition and other laws and regulations can impose different obligations or be more restrictive than those in the united states 

these us federal and state and foreign laws and regulations which in some cases can be enforced by private parties in addition to government entities are constantly evolving and can be subject to significant change as a result the application interpretation and enforcement of these laws and regulations are often uncertain particularly in the new and 

rapidly evolving industry in which we operate and may be interpreted and applied inconsistently from country to country and inconsistently with our current policies and practices for example regulatory or legislative actions affecting the manner in which we display content to our users or obtain consent to various practices could adversely affect user growth and engagement such actions could affect the manner in which we provide our services or adversely affect our financial results 

we are also subject to evolving laws and regulations that dictate whether how and under what circumstances we can transfer process andor receive certain data that is critical to our operations including data shared between countries or regions in which we operate and data shared among our products and services for example in 2016 the european union and united states agreed to a transfer framework for data transferred from the european union to the united states called the privacy shield but the privacy shield was invalidated in july 2020 by the court of justice of the european union cjeu in addition the other bases upon which facebook relies to transfer such data such as standard contractual clauses sccs have been subjected to regulatory and judicial scrutiny for example the cjeu considered the validity of sccs as a basis to transfer user data from the european union to the united states following a challenge brought by the irish data protection commission idpc although the cjeu upheld the validity of sccs in july 2020 our continued reliance on sccs is contingent on sccs being held to satisfy certain new conditions that are yet to be clearly defined and will be the subject of future regulatory guidance and the european commission has recently proposed new sccs which are currently subject to consultation in addition in august 2020 we received a preliminary draft decision from the idpc that preliminarily concluded that facebook irelands reliance on sccs in respect of european user data does not achieve compliance with the gdpr and preliminarily proposed that such transfers of user data from the european union to the united states should therefore be suspended facebook ireland challenged procedural aspects of this idpc inquiry in a judicial review commenced in the irish high court in september 2020 and the court ordered the idpc not to take further steps in respect of the inquiry until the judicial review proceedings conclude subject to the idpcs right to apply to vary or lift this order which we expect to occur in the coming months while we also rely upon alternative legal bases for data transfers if a new transatlantic data transfer framework is not adopted and we are unable to continue to rely on sccs or validly rely upon other alternative means of data transfers from europe to the united states we may be unable to operate material portions of our business in europe as a result of the cjeus invalidation of the privacy shield and any final decision of idpc which would materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations we have also been managing investigations and lawsuits in europe india and other jurisdictions regarding the august 2016 update to whatsapps terms of service and privacy policy and its sharing of certain data with other facebook products and services including a lawsuit currently pending before the supreme court of india if we are unable to transfer data between and among countries and regions in which we operate or if we are restricted from sharing data among our products and services it could affect our ability to provide our services the manner in which we provide our services or our ability to target ads which could adversely affect our financial results 

proposed or new legislation and regulations could also significantly affect our business for example the european general data protection regulation gdpr took effect in may 2018 and applies to all of our products and services used by people in europe the gdpr includes operational requirements for companies that receive or process personal data of residents of the european union that are different from those previously in place in the european union as a result we implemented measures to change our service for minors under the age of 16 for certain countries in europe that maintain the minimum age of 16 under the gdpr we also obtain consent andor offer new controls to existing and new users in europe before processing data for certain aspects of our service in addition the gdpr requires submission of personal data breach notifications to our designated european privacy regulator the idpc and includes significant penalties for noncompliance with the notification obligation as well as other requirements of the regulation similarly the brazilian general data protection law recently took effect and imposes data privacyrelated requirements on products and services offered to users in brazil the california consumer privacy act ccpa which took effect in january 2020 also establishes certain transparency rules and creates new data privacy rights for users including more ability to control how their data is shared with third parties these laws and regulations are evolving and subject to interpretation and resulting limitations on our advertising services or reductions of advertising by marketers have to some extent adversely affected and will continue to adversely affect our advertising business for example regulators have recently issued new guidance concerning the eprivacy directives requirements regarding the use of cookies and similar technologies in addition effective december 2020 the eprivacy directive includes additional limitations on the use of data across messaging products and includes significant penalties for noncompliance changes to our products or business practices as a result of these developments may adversely affect our advertising business similarly there are a number of legislative proposals in the european union the united states at both the federal and state level as well as other jurisdictions that could impose new obligations or limitations in areas affecting our business in addition some countries are considering or have passed legislation implementing data protection requirements or requiring local storage and processing of data or similar requirements that could increase the cost and complexity of delivering our services 

these laws and regulations as well as any associated claims inquiries or investigations or any other government actions have in the past led to and may in the future lead to unfavorable outcomes including increased compliance costs delays or impediments in the development of new products negative publicity and reputational harm increased operating costs diversion of management time and attention and remedies that harm our business including fines or demands or orders that we modify or cease existing business practices 

we have been subject to regulatory and other government investigations enforcement actions and settlements and we expect to continue to be subject to such proceedings and other inquiries in the future which could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner materially adverse to our business 

from time to time we receive formal and informal inquiries from government authorities and regulators regarding our compliance with laws and regulations many of which are evolving and subject to interpretation we are and expect to continue to be the subject of investigations inquiries data requests requests for information actions and audits in the united states europe and around the world particularly in the areas of privacy data protection law enforcement consumer protection and competition as we continue to grow and expand our operations in addition we are currently and may in the future be subject to regulatory orders or consent decrees for example data protection competition and consumer protection authorities in the european union and other jurisdictions have initiated actions investigations or administrative orders seeking to restrict the ways in which we collect and use information or impose sanctions and other authorities may do the same in addition beginning in march 2018 we became subject to ftc state attorneys general and other government inquiries in the united states europe and other jurisdictions in connection with our platform and user data practices as well as the misuse of certain data by a developer that shared such data with third parties in violation of our terms and policies in july 2019 we entered into a settlement and modified consent order to resolve the ftc inquiry which was approved by the federal court and took effect in april 2020 among other matters our settlement with the ftc required us to pay a penalty of 50 billion and to significantly enhance our practices and processes for privacy compliance and oversight beginning in september 2018 we also became subject to idpc and other government inquiries in connection with a thirdparty cyberattack that exploited a vulnerability in facebooks code to steal user access tokens and access certain profile information from user accounts on facebook from time to time we also notify the idpc our designated european privacy regulator under the gdpr of certain other personal data breaches and privacy issues and are subject to inquiries and investigations regarding various aspects of our regulatory compliance 

in addition from time to time we are subject to various litigation and formal and informal inquiries and investigations by competition authorities in the united states europe and other jurisdictions which relate to many aspects of our business including with respect to users and advertisers as well as our industry such inquiries investigations and lawsuits concern among other things our business practices in the areas of social networking or social media services digital advertising andor mobile or online applications as well as past acquisitions for example in june 2019 we were informed by the ftc that it had opened an antitrust investigation of our company in addition beginning in the third quarter of 2019 we became the subject of antitrust inquiries and investigations by the us department of justice the us house of representatives and state attorneys general in december 2020 the ftc and the attorneys general from 46 states the territory of guam and the district of columbia filed complaints against us in the us district court for the district of columbia alleging that we violated antitrust laws by acquiring instagram in 2012 and whatsapp in 2014 and by maintaining conditions on access to our platform among other things the lawsuits of the ftc and attorneys general both seek a permanent injunction against our companys alleged violations of the antitrust laws and other equitable relief including divestiture or reconstruction of instagram and whatsapp 

orders issued by or inquiries or enforcement actions initiated by government or regulatory authorities could cause us to incur substantial costs expose us to unanticipated civil and criminal liability or penalties including substantial monetary remedies interrupt or require us to change our business practices in a manner materially adverse to our business result in negative publicity and reputational harm divert resources and the time and attention of management from our business or subject us to other structural or behavioral remedies that adversely affect our business and we have experienced some of these adverse effects to varying degrees from time to time 

compliance with our ftc consent order the gdpr the ccpa the eprivacy directive and other regulatory and legislative privacy requirements require significant operational resources and modifications to our business practices and any compliance failures may have a material adverse effect on our business reputation and financial results 

we are engaged in ongoing privacy compliance and oversight efforts including in connection with our modified consent order with the ftc requirements of the gdpr and other regulatory and legislative requirements around the world such as the ccpa and the eprivacy directive in particular we are implementing a comprehensive expansion of our privacy program in connection with the ftc consent order including substantial management and board of directors oversight stringent operational requirements and reporting obligations prohibitions against making misrepresentations relating to user data a process to regularly certify our compliance with the privacy program to the ftc and regular assessments of our privacy program by an independent thirdparty assessor which has been and will continue to be challenging and costly to implement these compliance and oversight efforts are increasing demand on our systems and resources and require significant new and ongoing investments including investments in compliance processes personnel and technical infrastructure we are reallocating resources internally to assist with these efforts and this has had and will continue to have an adverse impact on our other business initiatives in addition these efforts require substantial modifications to our business practices and make some practices such as product and ads development more difficult timeconsuming and costly as a result we believe our ability to develop and launch new features products and services in a timely manner has been and will continue to be adversely affected we also expect that our privacy compliance and oversight efforts will require significant time and attention from our management and board of directors the requirements of the ftc consent order and other privacyrelated laws and regulations are complex and apply broadly to our business and from time to time we notify relevant authorities of instances where we are not in full compliance with these requirements or otherwise discover privacy issues and we expect to continue to do so as any such issues arise in the future in addition regulatory and legislative privacy requirements are constantly evolving and can be subject to significant change and uncertain interpretation if we are unable to successfully implement and comply with the mandates of the ftc consent order gdpr ccpa eprivacy directive or other regulatory or legislative requirements or if we are found to be in violation of the consent order or other applicable requirements we may be subject to regulatory or governmental investigations or lawsuits which may result in significant monetary fines judgments or other penalties and we may also be required to make additional changes to our business practices any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business reputation and financial results 

we may incur liability as a result of information retrieved from or transmitted over the internet or published using our products or as a result of claims related to our products and legislation regulating content on our platform may require us to change our products or business practices and may adversely affect our business and financial results 

we have faced currently face and will continue to face claims relating to information or content that is published or made available on our products including our policies and enforcement actions with respect to such information or content in particular the nature of our business exposes us to claims related to defamation dissemination of misinformation or news hoaxes discrimination harassment intellectual property rights rights of publicity and privacy personal injury torts laws regulating hate speech or other types of content and breach of contract among others this risk is enhanced in certain jurisdictions outside the united states where our protection from liability for thirdparty actions may be unclear or where we may be less protected under local laws than we are in the united states for example in april 2019 the european union passed a directive expanding online platform liability for copyright infringement and regulating certain uses of news content online which member states are required to implement by june 2021 in addition the european union revised the european audiovisual media service directive to apply to online videosharing platforms which member states are expected to implement by 2021 in the united states there have been and continue to be various congressional and executive efforts to remove or restrict the scope of the protections available to online platforms under section 230 of the communications decency act as well as to impose new obligations on online platforms with respect to commerce listings counterfeit goods and copyrightinfringing material and our current protections from liability for thirdparty content in the united states could decrease or change we could incur significant costs investigating and defending such claims and if we are found liable significant damages we could also face fines orders restricting or blocking our services in particular geographies or other governmentimposed remedies as a result of content hosted on our services for example legislation in germany has in the past and may in the future result in the imposition of fines for failure to comply with certain content removal law enforcement cooperation and disclosure obligations numerous other countries in europe asiapacific and latin america are considering or have implemented similar legislation imposing penalties including fines service throttling or advertising bans for failure to remove certain types of content or follow certain processes for example we have been subject to fines and may in the future be subject to other penalties in connection with social media legislation in turkey in addition australia recently announced proposed legislation that would among other matters require us to pay publishers for certain 

news content that is shared on facebook and instagram contentrelated legislation also has required us in the past and may require us in the future to change our products or business practices increase our compliance costs or otherwise impact our operations or our ability to provide services in certain geographies for example the european copyright directive requires certain online services to obtain authorizations for copyrighted content or to implement measures to prevent the availability of that content which may require us to make substantial investments in compliance processes in addition changes to section 230 of the communications decency act may increase our costs or require significant changes to our products business practices or operations which could adversely affect user growth and engagement any of the foregoing events could adversely affect our business and financial results 

payment transactions may subject us to additional regulatory requirements and other risks that could be costly and difficult to comply with or that could harm our business 

our users can purchase virtual and digital goods from developers that offer applications using our payments infrastructure on the facebook website in addition certain of our users can use our payments infrastructure including on messenger and whatsapp for other activities such as sending money to other users and making donations to certain charitable organizations we are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the united states europe and elsewhere including those governing antimoney laundering and counterterrorist financing money transmission gift cards and other prepaid access instruments electronic funds transfer charitable fundraising and import and export restrictions depending on how our payments product evolves we may also be subject to other laws and regulations including those governing gambling banking and lending in some jurisdictions the application or interpretation of these laws and regulations is not clear to increase flexibility in how our use of payments may evolve and to mitigate regulatory uncertainty we have received certain money transmitter licenses in the united states and an electronic money emoney license that allows us to conduct certain regulated payment activities in the participating member countries of the european economic area which will generally require us to demonstrate compliance with many domestic and foreign laws in these areas our efforts to comply with these laws and regulations could be costly and result in diversion of management time and effort and may still not guarantee compliance in the event that we are found to be in violation of any such legal or regulatory requirements we may be subject to monetary fines or other penalties such as a cease and desist order or we may be required to make product changes any of which could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results 

in addition we are subject to a variety of additional risks as a result of payments transactions including increased costs and diversion of management time and effort and other resources to deal with bad transactions or customer disputes potential fraudulent or otherwise illegal activity by users developers employees or third parties restrictions on the investment of consumer funds used to transact payments and additional disclosure and reporting requirements we have also launched certain payments functionality on whatsapp and have announced plans to develop digital payments products and services which may subject us to many of the foregoing risks and additional licensing requirements 

our participation in the diem association subjects us to significant regulatory scrutiny and other risks that could adversely affect our business reputation or financial results 

in june 2019 we announced our participation in the diem association which will oversee a proposed digital payments system powered by blockchain technology and our plans for novi a digital wallet for diem which we expect to launch as a standalone application and subsequently in messenger and whatsapp 

diem is based on relatively new and unproven technology and the laws and regulations surrounding blockchainbased payments are uncertain and evolving diem has drawn significant scrutiny from governments and regulators in multiple jurisdictions and we expect that scrutiny to continue as a sponsor of the initiative and a proposed digital wallet service provider we are participating in responses to inquiries from governments and regulators and adverse government or regulatory actions or negative publicity resulting from such participation may adversely affect our reputation and harm our business 

as this initiative evolves both diem and novi may be subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the united states and international jurisdictions including those governing payments financial services antimoney laundering counterterrorism financing economic sanctions data protection tax and competition in many jurisdictions the application or interpretation of these laws and regulations is not clear particularly with respect to evolving laws and regulations that are applied to blockchain and digital payments to mitigate regulatory uncertainty diem has applied for a payment system operator license with the swiss financial market supervisory authority finma and novi has applied for money 

transmitter licenses in the united states and certain other countries and other financial services licenses in certain other countries that would allow us to conduct digital wallet activities in these countries using the diem network these licenses laws and regulations as well as any associated inquiries or investigations may delay or impede the launch of the diem digital payments system as well as the development of our products and services increase our operating costs require significant management time and attention or otherwise harm our business 

in addition market acceptance of such a digital payments system is subject to significant uncertainty as such there can be no assurance that diem or our associated products and services will be made available in a timely manner or at all we do not have significant prior experience with blockchainbased payments technology which may adversely affect our ability to successfully develop and market these products and services we will also incur increased costs in connection with our participation in the diem association and the development and marketing of associated products and services and our investments may not be successful any of these events could adversely affect our business reputation or financial results 

risks related to data security and intellectual property 

security breaches improper access to or disclosure of our data or user data other hacking and phishing attacks on our systems or other cyber incidents could harm our reputation and adversely affect our business 

our industry is prone to cyberattacks by third parties seeking unauthorized access to our data or users data or to disrupt our ability to provide service our products and services involve the collection storage processing and transmission of a large amount of data any failure to prevent or mitigate security breaches and improper access to or disclosure of our data or user data including personal information content or payment information from users or information from marketers could result in the loss modification disclosure destruction or other misuse of such data which could harm our business and reputation and diminish our competitive position in addition computer malware viruses social engineering predominantly spear phishing attacks scraping and general hacking have become more prevalent in our industry have occurred on our systems in the past and will occur on our systems in the future we also regularly encounter attempts to create false or undesirable user accounts purchase ads or take other actions on our platform for purposes such as spamming spreading misinformation or other objectionable ends as a result of our prominence the size of our user base the types and volume of personal data and content on our systems and the evolving nature of our products and services including our efforts involving new and emerging technologies we believe that we are a particularly attractive target for such breaches and attacks including from nation states and highly sophisticated statesponsored or otherwise wellfunded actors our efforts to address undesirable activity on our platform also increase the risk of retaliatory attacks such breaches and attacks may cause interruptions to the services we provide degrade the user experience cause users or marketers to lose confidence and trust in our products impair our internal systems or result in financial harm to us our efforts to protect our company data or the information we receive and to disable undesirable activities on our platform may also be unsuccessful due to software bugs or other technical malfunctions employee contractor or vendor error or malfeasance including defects or vulnerabilities in our vendors information technology systems or offerings government surveillance breaches of physical security of our facilities or technical infrastructure or other threats that evolve in addition third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or users to disclose information in order to gain access to our data or our users data cyberattacks continue to evolve in sophistication and volume and inherently may be difficult to detect for long periods of time although we have developed systems and processes that are designed to protect our data and user data to prevent data loss to disable undesirable accounts and activities on our platform and to prevent or detect security breaches we cannot assure you that such measures will provide absolute security that we will be able to react in a timely manner or that our remediation efforts will be successful 

in addition some of our developers or other partners such as those that help us measure the effectiveness of ads may receive or store information provided by us or by our users through mobile or web applications integrated with facebook we provide limited information to such third parties based on the scope of services provided to us however if these third parties or developers fail to adopt or adhere to adequate data security practices or in the event of a breach of their networks our data or our users data may be improperly accessed used or disclosed 

we experience such cyberattacks and other security incidents of varying degrees from time to time and we incur significant costs in protecting against or remediating such incidents in addition we are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the united states and abroad relating to cybersecurity and data protection as well as obligations under our modified consent order with the ftc as a result affected users or government authorities could initiate legal or regulatory actions against us in connection with any actual or perceived security breaches or improper access to or disclosure of data 

which has occurred in the past and which could cause us to incur significant expense and liability or result in orders or consent decrees forcing us to modify our business practices such incidents or our efforts to remediate such incidents may also result in a decline in our active user base or engagement levels any of these events could have a material and adverse effect on our business reputation or financial results 

for example in september 2018 we announced our discovery of a thirdparty cyberattack that exploited a vulnerability in facebooks code to steal user access tokens which were then used to access certain profile information from approximately 29 million user accounts on facebook the events surrounding this cyberattack became the subject of irish data protection commission and other government inquiries any such inquiries could subject us to substantial fines and costs require us to change our business practices divert resources and the attention of management from our business or adversely affect our business 

in addition the changes in our work environment as a result of the covid19 pandemic could impact the security of our systems as well as our ability to protect against attacks and detect and respond to them quickly the rapid adoption of some thirdparty services designed to enable the transition to a remote workforce also may introduce security risk that is not fully mitigated prior to the use of these services we may also be subject to increased cyberattacks such as phishing attacks by threat actors using the attention placed on the pandemic as a method for targeting our personnel 

we anticipate that our ongoing efforts related to privacy safety security and content review will identify additional instances of misuse of user data or other undesirable activity by third parties on our platform 

in addition to our efforts to mitigate cybersecurity risks we are making significant investments in privacy safety security and content review efforts to combat misuse of our services and user data by third parties including investigations and audits of platform applications as a result of these efforts we have discovered and announced and anticipate that we will continue to discover and announce additional incidents of misuse of user data or other undesirable activity by third parties we may not discover all such incidents or activity whether as a result of our data or technical limitations including our lack of visibility over our encrypted services the scale of activity on our platform challenges related to our personnel working remotely during the covid19 pandemic the allocation of resources to other projects or other factors and we may be notified of such incidents or activity by the independent privacy assessor required under our modified consent order with the ftc the media or other third parties such incidents and activities have in the past and may in the future include the use of user data or our systems in a manner inconsistent with our terms contracts or policies the existence of false or undesirable user accounts election interference improper advertising practices activities that threaten peoples safety on or offline or instances of spamming scraping data harvesting unsecured datasets or spreading misinformation we may also be unsuccessful in our efforts to enforce our policies or otherwise remediate any such incidents any of the foregoing developments may negatively affect user trust and engagement harm our reputation and brands require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business and adversely affect our business and financial results any such developments may also subject us to additional litigation and regulatory inquiries which could subject us to monetary penalties and damages divert managements time and attention and lead to enhanced regulatory oversight 

our products and internal systems rely on software and hardware that is highly technical and any errors bugs or vulnerabilities in these systems or failures to address or mitigate technical limitations in our systems could adversely affect our business 

our products and internal systems rely on software and hardware including software and hardware developed or maintained internally andor by third parties that is highly technical and complex in addition our products and internal systems depend on the ability of such software and hardware to store retrieve process and manage immense amounts of data the software and hardware on which we rely has contained and will in the future contain errors bugs or vulnerabilities and our systems are subject to certain technical limitations that may compromise our ability to meet our objectives some errors bugs or vulnerabilities inherently may be difficult to detect and may only be discovered after the code has been released for external or internal use for example in september 2018 we announced our discovery of a thirdparty cyberattack that exploited a vulnerability in facebooks code to steal user access tokens and access certain profile information from user accounts on facebook errors bugs vulnerabilities design defects or technical limitations within the software and hardware on which we rely have in the past led to and may in the future lead to outcomes including a negative experience for users and marketers who use our products compromised ability of our products to perform in a manner consistent with our terms contracts or policies delayed product introductions or enhancements targeting measurement or billing errors compromised ability to protect the data of our users andor our intellectual property or other data or reductions in our ability to provide some or all of our services for example we make commitments to our users as to how their data will 

be used within and across our products and our systems are subject to errors bugs and technical limitations that may prevent us from fulfilling these commitments reliably in addition any errors bugs vulnerabilities or defects in our systems or the software and hardware on which we rely failures to properly address or mitigate the technical limitations in our systems or associated degradations or interruptions of service or failures to fulfill our commitments to our users have in the past led to and may in the future lead to outcomes including damage to our reputation loss of users loss of marketers loss of revenue regulatory inquiries litigation or liability for fines damages or other remedies any of which could adversely affect our business and financial results 

if we are unable to protect our intellectual property the value of our brands and other intangible assets may be diminished and our business may be adversely affected 

we rely and expect to continue to rely on a combination of confidentiality assignment and license agreements with our employees consultants and third parties with whom we have relationships as well as trademark copyright patent trade secret and domain name protection laws to protect our proprietary rights in the united states and internationally we have filed various applications for protection of certain aspects of our intellectual property and we currently hold a significant number of registered trademarks and issued patents in multiple jurisdictions and have acquired patents and patent applications from third parties third parties may knowingly or unknowingly infringe our proprietary rights third parties may challenge proprietary rights held by us and pending and future trademark and patent applications may not be approved in addition effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which we operate or intend to operate our business in any or all of these cases we may be required to expend significant time and expense in order to prevent infringement or to enforce our rights although we have generally taken measures to protect our proprietary rights there can be no assurance that others will not offer products or concepts that are substantially similar to ours and compete with our business in addition we regularly contribute software source code under open source licenses and have made other technology we developed available under other open licenses and we include open source software in our products as a result of our open source contributions and the use of open source in our products we may license or be required to license or disclose code andor innovations that turn out to be material to our business and may also be exposed to increased litigation risk if the protection of our proprietary rights is inadequate to prevent unauthorized use or appropriation by third parties the value of our brands and other intangible assets may be diminished and competitors may be able to more effectively mimic our products services and methods of operations any of these events could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results 

we are currently and expect to be in the future party to patent lawsuits and other intellectual property rights claims that are expensive and time consuming and if resolved adversely could have a significant impact on our business financial condition or results of operations 

companies in the internet technology and media industries own large numbers of patents copyrights trademarks and trade secrets and frequently enter into litigation based on allegations of infringement misappropriation or other violations of intellectual property or other rights in addition various nonpracticing entities that own patents and other intellectual property rights often attempt to aggressively assert their rights in order to extract value from technology companies furthermore from time to time we may introduce or acquire new products including in areas where we historically have not competed which could increase our exposure to patent and other intellectual property claims from competitors and nonpracticing entities 

from time to time we receive notice from patent holders and other parties alleging that certain of our products and services or user content infringe their intellectual property rights we presently are involved in a number of intellectual property lawsuits and as we face increasing competition and gain an increasingly high profile we expect the number of patent and other intellectual property claims against us to grow defending patent and other intellectual property litigation is costly and can impose a significant burden on management and employees and there can be no assurances that favorable final outcomes will be obtained in all cases in addition plaintiffs may seek and we may become subject to preliminary or provisional rulings in the course of any such litigation including potential preliminary injunctions requiring us to cease some or all of our operations we may decide to settle such lawsuits and disputes on terms that are unfavorable to us similarly if any litigation to which we are a party is resolved adversely we may be subject to an unfavorable judgment that may not be reversed upon appeal the terms of such a settlement or judgment may require us to cease some or all of our operations or pay substantial amounts to the other party in addition we may have to seek a license to continue practices found to be in violation of a third partys rights which may not be available on reasonable terms or at all and may significantly increase our operating costs and expenses as a result we may also be required to develop alternative noninfringing technology or 

practices or discontinue the practices the development of alternative noninfringing technology or practices could require significant effort and expense could result in less effective technology or practices or otherwise negatively affect the user experience or may not be feasible we have experienced unfavorable outcomes in such disputes and litigation in the past and our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected as a result of an unfavorable resolution of the disputes and litigation referred to above 

risks related to ownership of our class a common stock 

the trading price of our class a common stock has been and will likely continue to be volatile 

the trading price of our class a common stock has been and is likely to continue to be volatile since shares of our class a common stock were sold in our initial public offering in may 2012 at a price of 3800 per share our stock price has ranged from 1755 to 30467 through december 31 2020 in addition to the factors discussed in this annual report on form 10k the trading price of our class a common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to numerous factors many of which are beyond our control including 

• actual or anticipated fluctuations in our revenue and other operating results 

• the financial projections we may provide to the public any changes in these projections or our failure to meet these projections 

• actions of securities analysts who initiate or maintain coverage of us changes in financial estimates by any securities analysts who follow our company or our failure to meet these estimates or the expectations of investors 

• additional shares of our stock being sold into the market by us our existing stockholders or in connection with acquisitions or the anticipation of such sales 

• investor sentiment with respect to our competitors our business partners and our industry in general 

• announcements by us or our competitors of significant products or features technical innovations acquisitions strategic partnerships joint ventures or capital commitments 

• announcements by us or estimates by third parties of actual or anticipated changes in the size of our user base the level of user engagement or the effectiveness of our ad products 

• changes in operating performance and stock market valuations of technology companies in our industry including our developers and competitors 

• price and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market including as a result of trends in the economy as a whole 

• the inclusion exclusion or deletion of our stock from any trading indices such as the sp 500 index 

• media coverage of our business and financial performance 

• lawsuits threatened or filed against us or developments in pending lawsuits 

• adverse government actions or legislative or regulatory developments relating to advertising competition content privacy or other matters including interim or final rulings by tax judicial or regulatory bodies 

• trading activity in our share repurchase program and 

• other events or factors including those resulting from war incidents of terrorism pandemics and other disruptive external events or responses to these events 

in addition the stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many technology companies we are currently subject to securities litigation in connection with our platform and user data practices and the misuse of certain data by a developer that shared such data with third parties in violation of our terms and policies as well as the disclosure of our earnings results for the second quarter of 2018 we may experience more such litigation following future periods of volatility any securities litigation could subject us to substantial costs divert resources and the attention of management from our business and adversely affect our business 

we do not intend to pay cash dividends for the foreseeable future 

we have never declared or paid cash dividends on our capital stock we currently intend to retain any future earnings to finance the operation and expansion of our business and fund our share repurchase program and we do not expect to declare or pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future as a result you may only receive a return on your investment in our class a common stock if the trading price of your shares increases 

the dual class structure of our common stock and a voting agreement between certain stockholders have the effect of concentrating voting control with our ceo and certain other holders of our class b common stock this will limit or preclude your ability to influence corporate matters 

our class b common stock has ten votes per share and our class a common stock has one vote per share stockholders who hold shares of class b common stock including certain of our executive officers employees and directors and their affiliates together hold a substantial majority of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock because of the tentoone voting ratio between our class b and class a common stock the holders of our class b common stock collectively control a majority of the combined voting power of our common stock and therefore are able to control all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval so long as the shares of class b common stock represent at least 91 of all outstanding shares of our class a and class b common stock this concentrated control will limit or preclude your ability to influence corporate matters for the foreseeable future 

transfers by holders of class b common stock will generally result in those shares converting to class a common stock subject to limited exceptions such as certain transfers effected for estate planning or charitable purposes the conversion of class b common stock to class a common stock will have the effect over time of increasing the relative voting power of those holders of class b common stock who retain their shares in the long term if for example mr zuckerberg retains a significant portion of his holdings of class b common stock for an extended period of time he could in the future continue to control a majority of the combined voting power of our outstanding capital stock 

our status as a controlled company could make our class a common stock less attractive to some investors or otherwise harm our stock price 

because we qualify as a controlled company under the corporate governance rules for nasdaqlisted companies we are not required to have a majority of our board of directors be independent nor are we required to have a compensation committee or an independent nominating function in the future we could elect not to have a majority of our board of directors be independent or not to have a compensation committee or an independent nominating function accordingly should the interests of our controlling stockholder differ from those of other stockholders the other stockholders may not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the corporate governance rules for nasdaqlisted companies our status as a controlled company could make our class a common stock less attractive to some investors or otherwise harm our stock price 

delaware law and provisions in our restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws could make a merger tender offer or proxy contest difficult thereby depressing the trading price of our class a common stock 

our status as a delaware corporation and the antitakeover provisions of the delaware general corporation law may discourage delay or prevent a change in control by prohibiting us from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years after the person becomes an interested stockholder even if a change of control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders in addition our current restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that may make the acquisition of our company more difficult including the following 

• until the first date on which the outstanding shares of our class b common stock represent less than 35 of the 

combined voting power of our common stock any transaction that would result in a change in control of our company requires the approval of a majority of our outstanding class b common stock voting as a separate class 

• we currently have a dual class common stock structure which provides mr zuckerberg with the ability to control the outcome of matters requiring stockholder approval even if he owns significantly less than a majority of the shares of our outstanding class a and class b common stock 

• when the outstanding shares of our class b common stock represent less than a majority of the combined voting power of common stock certain amendments to our restated certificate of incorporation or bylaws will require the approval of twothirds of the combined vote of our thenoutstanding shares of class a and class b common stock 

• when the outstanding shares of our class b common stock represent less than a majority of the combined voting power of our common stock vacancies on our board of directors will be able to be filled only by our board of directors and not by stockholders 

• when the outstanding shares of our class b common stock represent less than a majority of the combined voting power of our common stock our board of directors will be classified into three classes of directors with staggered threeyear terms and directors will only be able to be removed from office for cause 

• when the outstanding shares of our class b common stock represent less than a majority of the combined voting power of our common stock our stockholders will only be able to take action at a meeting of stockholders and not by written consent 

• only our chairman our chief executive officer our president or a majority of our board of directors are authorized to call a special meeting of stockholders 

• advance notice procedures apply for stockholders to nominate candidates for election as directors or to bring matters before an annual meeting of stockholders 

• our restated certificate of incorporation authorizes undesignated preferred stock the terms of which may be established and shares of which may be issued without stockholder approval and

certain revenue information in the section entitled  — revenue — foreign exchange impact on revenue is presented on a constant currency basis this information is a nongaap financial measure to calculate revenue on a constant currency basis we translated revenue for the full year 2020 using 2019 monthly exchange rates for our settlement or billing currencies other than the us dollar this nongaap financial measure is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for or superior to financial information prepared and presented in accordance with gaap this measure may be different from non‑gaap financial measures used by other companies limiting its usefulness for comparison purposes moreover presentation of revenue on a constant currency basis is provided for yearoveryear comparison purposes and investors should be cautioned that the effect of changing foreign currency exchange rates has an actual effect on our operating results we believe this nongaap financial measure provides investors with useful supplemental information about the financial performance of our business enables comparison of financial results between periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance and allows for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in operating our business

our mission is to give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together 

in response to the covid19 pandemic we have focused on helping people stay connected assisting the public health response and working on the economic recovery we have also continued to invest based on the following company priorities i continue making progress on the major social issues facing the internet and our company including privacy safety and security ii build new experiences that meaningfully improve peoples lives today and set the stage for even bigger improvements in the future iii keep building our business by supporting the millions of businesses that rely on our 

services to grow and create jobs and iv communicate more transparently about what were doing and the role our services play in the world 

in 2020 we also continued to focus on our main revenue growth priorities i helping marketers use our products to connect with consumers where they are and ii making our ads more relevant and effective 

our business has been impacted by the covid19 pandemic which has resulted in authorities implementing numerous preventative measures to contain or mitigate the outbreak of the virus such as travel bans and restrictions limitations on business activity quarantines and shelterinplace orders these measures have caused and are continuing to cause business slowdowns or shutdowns in affected areas both regionally and worldwide which have significantly impacted our business and results of operations beginning in the first quarter of 2020 we experienced significant increases in the size and engagement of our active user base across a number of regions as a result of the covid19 pandemic more recently we have seen user growth and engagement returning to prepandemic trends particularly in the united states  canada region we are unable to predict the impact of the pandemic on user growth and engagement with any certainty and we expect these trends to continue to be subject to volatility 

the covid19 pandemic has also previously caused a reduction in the demand for advertising as well as a related decline in the pricing of our ads particularly in the second quarter of 2020 more recently we believe the pandemic has contributed to an acceleration in the shift of commerce from offline to online as well as increasing consumer demand for purchasing products as opposed to services and we experienced increasing demand for advertising as a result of these trends however it is possible that this increased demand may not continue in future periods and may even recede as the effects of the pandemic subside which could adversely affect our advertising revenue growth the impact of the pandemic on user growth and engagement the demand for and pricing of our advertising services as well as on our overall results of operations remains highly uncertain for the foreseeable future in addition we expect that future advertising revenue growth will continue to be adversely affected by limitations on our ad targeting and measurement tools arising from changes to the regulatory environment and thirdparty mobile operating systems and browsers 

we intend to continue to invest in our business based on our company priorities and we anticipate that additional investments in our data center capacity servers network infrastructure and office facilities as well as scaling our headcount to support our growth will continue to drive expense growth in 2021 we expect 2021 capital expenditures to be in the range of 2123 billion and total expenses to be in the range of 6873 billion 

trends in our facebook user metrics 

the numbers for our key facebook metrics our daus maus and average revenue per user arpu do not include users on instagram whatsapp or our other products unless they would otherwise qualify as daus or maus respectively based on their other activities on facebook 

trends in the number of users affect our revenue and financial results by influencing the number of ads we are able to show the value of our ads to marketers the volume of payments transactions as well as our expenses and capital expenditures substantially all of our daily and monthly active users as defined below access facebook on mobile devices 

• daily active users daus we define a daily active user as a registered and loggedin facebook user who visited facebook through our website or a mobile device or used our messenger application and is also a registered facebook user on a given day we view daus and daus as a percentage of maus as measures of user engagement on facebook 







note for purposes of reporting daus maus and arpu by geographic region europe includes all users in russia and turkey and rest of world includes all users in africa latin america and the middle east 

worldwide daus increased 11 to 184 billion on average during december 2020 from 166 billion during december 2019 users in india the philippines and indonesia represented key sources of growth in daus during december 2020 relative to the same period in 2019 

• monthly active users maus we define a monthly active user as a registered and loggedin facebook user who visited facebook through our website or a mobile device or used our messenger application and is also a registered facebook user in the last 30 days as of the date of measurement maus are a measure of the size of our global active user community on facebook 

as of december 31 2020 we had 280 billion maus an increase of 12 from december 31 2019 users in india indonesia and the philippines represented key sources of growth in 2020 relative to the same period in 2019 

trends in our monetization by facebook user geography 

we calculate our revenue by facebook user geography based on our estimate of the geography in which ad impressions are delivered virtual and digital goods are purchased or consumer hardware devices are shipped we define arpu as our total revenue in a given geography during a given quarter divided by the average of the number of maus in the geography at the beginning and end of the quarter while arpu includes all sources of revenue the number of maus used in this calculation only includes users of facebook and messenger as described in the definition of mau above the share of revenue from users who are not also facebook or messenger maus was not material the geography of our users affects our revenue and financial results because we currently monetize users in different geographies at different average rates our revenue and arpu in regions such as united states  canada and europe are relatively higher primarily due to the size and maturity of those online and mobile advertising markets for example arpu in 2020 in the united states  canada region was more than 11 times higher than in the asiapacific region 







note our revenue by facebook user geography in the charts above is geographically apportioned based on our estimation of the geographic location of our facebook users when they perform a revenuegenerating activity this allocation differs from our revenue disaggregated by geography disclosure in our consolidated financial statements where revenue is geographically apportioned based on the billing address of the customer 

our annual worldwide arpu in 2020 which represents the sum of quarterly arpu during such period was 3203 an increase of 10 from 2019 over this period arpu increased by 18 in the united states  canada 15 in europe and 9 in asia‑pacific and arpu was flat in rest of world in addition user growth was more rapid in geographies with relatively lower arpu such as asia‑pacific and rest of world we expect that user growth in the future will be primarily concentrated in those regions where arpu is relatively lower such that worldwide arpu may continue to increase at a slower rate relative to arpu in any geographic region or potentially decrease even if arpu increases in each geographic region 

trends in our family metrics 

the numbers for our key family metrics our dap map and average revenue per person arpp do not include users on our other products unless they would otherwise qualify as map or dap respectively based on their other activities on our family products 

trends in the number of people in our community affect our revenue and financial results by influencing the number of ads we are able to show the value of our ads to marketers the volume of payments transactions as well as our expenses and capital expenditures substantially all of our daily and monthly active people as defined below access our family products on mobile devices 

• daily active people dap we define a daily active person as a registered and loggedin user of facebook instagram messenger andor whatsapp collectively our family of products who visited at least one of these family products through a mobile device application or using a web or mobile browser on a given day we do not require people to use a common identifier or link their accounts to use multiple products in our family and therefore must seek to attribute multiple user accounts within and across products to individual people our calculations of dap rely upon complex techniques algorithms and machine learning models that seek to estimate the underlying number of unique people using one or more of these products including by matching user accounts within an individual product and across multiple products when we believe they are attributable to a single person and counting such group of accounts as one person as these techniques and models require significant judgment are developed based on internal reviews of limited samples of user accounts and are calibrated against user survey data there is necessarily some margin of error in our estimates we view dap and dap as a percentage of map as measures of engagement across our products for additional information see the section entitled limitations of key metrics and other data in this annual report on form 10k 



note we report the numbers of dap and map as specific amounts but these numbers are estimates of the numbers of unique people using our products and are subject to statistical variances and errors while we expect the error margin for these estimates to vary from period to period we estimate that such margin generally will be approximately 4 of our worldwide map at our scale it is very difficult to attribute multiple user accounts within and across products to individual people and it is possible that the actual numbers of unique people using our products may vary significantly from our estimates potentially beyond our estimated error margins for additional information see the section entitled limitations of key metrics and other data in this annual report on form 10k in the second quarter of 2020 we updated our family metrics calculations to reflect recent data from a periodic whatsapp user survey and to incorporate certain methodology improvements and we estimate such updates contributed an aggregate of approximately 40 million dap to our reported worldwide dap in june 2020 

worldwide dap increased 15 to 260 billion on average during december 2020 from 226 billion during december 2019 

• monthly active people map we define a monthly active person as a registered and loggedin user of one or more family products who visited at least one of these family products through a mobile device application or using a web or mobile browser in the last 30 days as of the date of measurement we do not require people to use a common identifier or link their accounts to use multiple products in our family and therefore must seek to attribute multiple user accounts within and across products to individual people our calculations of map rely upon complex techniques algorithms and machine learning models that seek to estimate the underlying number of unique people using one or more of these products including by matching user accounts within an individual product and across multiple products when we believe they are attributable to a single person and counting such group of accounts as one person as these techniques and models require significant judgment are developed based on internal reviews of limited samples of user accounts and are calibrated against user survey data there is necessarily some margin of error in our estimates we view map as a measure of the size of our global active community of people using our products for additional information see the section entitled limitations of key metrics and other data in this annual report on form 10k

as of december 31 2020 we had 330 billion map an increase of 14 from 289 billion as of december 31 2019 

• average revenue per person arpp we define arpp as our total revenue during a given quarter divided by the average of the number of map at the beginning and end of the quarter while arpp includes all sources of revenue the number of map used in this calculation only includes users of our family products as described in the definition of map above the share of revenue from users who are not also map was not material 



our annual worldwide arpp in 2020 which represents the sum of quarterly arpp during such period was 2751 an increase of 8 from 2019 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with us gaap the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue costs and expenses and related disclosures on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates and assumptions based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances our actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if the nature of the estimates or assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change and the impact of the estimates and assumptions on our consolidated financial statements is material  we believe that the assumptions and estimates associated with gross vs net in revenue recognition valuation of equity investments income taxes loss contingencies valuation of longlived assets including goodwill and intangible assets and their associated estimated useful lives have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements therefore we consider these to be our critical accounting policies and estimates for further information on all of our significant accounting policies see note 1—summary of significant accounting policies in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data of this annual report on form 10k 

in response to the economic slowdown caused by the covid19 pandemic we believe that the assumptions and estimates associated with collectibility assessment of revenue and credit losses of accounts receivable could have a material impact to our consolidated financial statements in future periods depending on the duration or degree of the impact of the covid19 pandemic on the global economy 

collectibility assessment of revenue 

under topic 606 we recognize revenue using a fivestep model in step one for a revenue contract to exist it must be probable that substantially all of the consideration to which we are entitled to will be collected in performing such collectibility assessment we consider various facts and circumstances including future expectations about our customers ability and intention to pay collectibility assessment uses a probable threshold which requires estimation based on several objective and subjective factors such as probability of default customer’s intention to pay payment history financial strength geography and industry subvertical risks the collectibility assessment has become uncertain during the current economic environment caused by the covid19 pandemic and our actual experience in the future may differ from our past experiences or current assessment 

credit losses of accounts receivable 

on january 1 2020 we adopted accounting standards update no 201613 financial instrumentscredit losses topic 326 measurement of credit losses on financial instruments  which requires the measurement and recognition of expected credit losses for financial assets held at amortized cost that an entity does not expect to collect over the assets contractual life considering past events current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions 

for accounts receivable measured at amortized cost we use aging analysis probability of default methods and incorporate macroeconomic variables that are most relevant to evaluating and estimating the expected credit losses these macroeconomic variables may vary by geography customertype or industry subvertical the contractual life of our trade accounts receivable is generally shortterm however we may experience increasing credit loss risks from accounts receivable in future periods depending on the duration or degree of economic slowdown caused by the covid19 pandemic and our actual experience in the future may differ from our past experiences or current assessment 

gross vs net in revenue recognition 

for revenue generated from arrangements that involve thirdparty publishers there is significant judgment in evaluating whether we are the principal and report revenue on a gross basis or the agent and report revenue on a net basis in this assessment we consider if we obtain control of the specified goods or services before they are transferred to the customer as well as other indicators such as the party primarily responsible for fulfillment inventory risk and discretion in 

establishing price the assessment of whether we are considered the principal or the agent in a transaction could impact our revenue and cost of revenue recognized on the consolidated statements of income 

valuation of equity investments 

for our equity securities without readily determinable fair values accounted for using the measurement alternative determining whether an equity security issued by the same issuer is similar to the equity security we hold may require judgment in a assessment of differences in rights and obligations associated with the instruments such as voting rights distribution rights and preferences and conversion features and b adjustments to the observable price for differences such as but not limited to rights and obligations control premium liquidity or principal or most advantageous markets in addition the identification of observable transactions will depend on the timely reporting of these transactions from our investee companies which may occur in a period subsequent to when the transactions take place therefore our fair value adjustment for these observable transactions may occur in a period subsequent to when the transaction actually occurred for equity investments we perform a qualitative assessment at each reporting date to determine whether there are triggering events for impairment the qualitative assessment considers factors such as but not limited to the investees financial condition and business outlook industry and sector performance regulatory economic or technological environment operational and financing cash flows and other relevant events and factors affecting the investee when indicators of impairment exist we estimate the fair value of our equity investments using the market approach andor the income approach and recognize impairment loss in the consolidated statements of income if the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value estimating fair value requires judgment and use of estimates such as discount rates forecast cash flows holding period and market data of comparable companies among others 

income taxes 

we are subject to income taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes and income tax assets and liabilities including evaluating uncertainties in the application of accounting principles and complex tax laws 

we recognize tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if we believe that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position these uncertain tax positions include our estimates for transfer pricing that have been developed based upon analyses of appropriate armslength prices similarly our estimates related to uncertain tax positions concerning research tax credits are based on an assessment of whether our available documentation corroborating the nature of our activities supporting the tax credits will be sufficient although we believe that we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions including net interest and penalties we can provide no assurance that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be materially different we make adjustments to these reserves in accordance with the income tax accounting guidance when facts and circumstances change such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts recorded such differences will affect the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made and could have a material impact on our financial condition and operating results 

loss contingencies 

we are involved in legal proceedings claims and regulatory tax or government inquiries and investigations that arise in the ordinary course of business certain of these matters include speculative claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts of damages additionally we are required to comply with various legal and regulatory obligations around the world the requirements for complying with these obligations may be uncertain and subject to interpretation and enforcement by regulatory and other authorities and any failure to comply with such obligations could eventually lead to asserted legal or regulatory action with respect to these matters asserted and unasserted we evaluate the associated developments on a regular basis and accrue a liability when we believe that it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated if we determine there is a reasonable possibility that we may incur a loss and the loss or range of loss can be estimated we disclose the possible loss in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements to the extent material 

we review the developments in our contingencies that could affect the amount of the provisions that have been previously recorded and the matters and related reasonably possible losses disclosed we make adjustments to our provisions and changes to our disclosures accordingly to reflect the impact of negotiations settlements rulings advice of legal counsel 

and updated information significant judgment is required to determine the probability of loss and the estimated amount of loss including when and if the probability and estimate has changed for asserted and unasserted matters 

the ultimate outcome of these matters such as whether the likelihood of loss is remote reasonably possible or probable or if and when the reasonably possible range of loss is estimable is inherently uncertain therefore if one or more of these matters were resolved against us for amounts in excess of managements estimates of losses our results of operations and financial condition including in a particular reporting period in which any such outcome becomes probable and estimable could be materially adversely affected see note 12—commitments and contingencies and note 15—income taxes of the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data and part i item 3 legal proceedings of this annual report on form 10k for additional information regarding these contingencies 

valuation of longlived assets including goodwill intangible assets and estimated useful lives 

we allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired liabilities assumed and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values the excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill such valuations require management to make significant estimates and assumptions especially with respect to intangible assets significant estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include but are not limited to estimated replacement costs and future expected cash flows from acquired users acquired technology acquired patents and trade names from a market participant perspective useful lives and discount rates managements estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and as a result actual results may differ from estimates allocation of purchase consideration to identifiable assets and liabilities affects our amortization expense as acquired finitelived intangible assets are amortized over the useful life whereas any indefinite lived intangible assets including goodwill are not amortized during the measurement period which is not to exceed one year from the acquisition date we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill upon the conclusion of the measurement period any subsequent adjustments are recorded to earnings 

we review goodwill for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances would more likely than not reduce the fair value of our single reporting unit below its carrying value as of december 31 2020 no impairment of goodwill has been identified 

longlived assets including property and equipment and intangible assets are reviewed for possible impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable the evaluation is performed at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities recoverability of these assets is measured by a comparison of the carrying amounts to the future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate from the use and eventual disposition if such review indicates that the carrying amount of property and equipment and intangible assets is not recoverable the carrying amount of such assets is reduced to fair value we have not recorded any significant impairment charges during the years presented 

the useful lives of our longlived assets including property and equipment and finitelived intangible assets are determined by management when those assets are initially recognized and are routinely reviewed for the remaining estimated useful lives the current estimate of useful lives represents our best estimate based on current facts and circumstances but may differ from the actual useful lives due to changes in future circumstances such as changes to our business operations changes in the planned use of assets and technological advancements when we change the estimated useful life assumption for any asset the remaining carrying amount of the asset is accounted for prospectively and depreciated or amortized over the revised estimated useful life historically changes in useful lives have not resulted in material changes to our depreciation and amortization expense 

components of results of operations 

revenue 

advertising we generate substantially all of our revenue from advertising our advertising revenue is generated by displaying ad products on facebook instagram messenger and thirdparty affiliated websites or mobile applications marketers pay for ad products either directly or through their relationships with advertising agencies or resellers based on the number of impressions delivered or the number of actions such as clicks taken by users 

we recognize revenue from the display of impressionbased ads in the contracted period in which the impressions are delivered impressions are considered delivered when an ad is displayed to a user we recognize revenue from the delivery of actionbased ads in the period in which a user takes the action the marketer contracted for the number of ads we show is subject to methodological changes as we continue to evolve our ads business and the structure of our ads products we calculate price per ad as total ad revenue divided by the number of ads delivered representing the effective price paid per impression by a marketer regardless of their desired objective such as impression or action for advertising revenue arrangements where we are not the principal we recognize revenue on a net basis 

other revenue other revenue consists of revenue from the delivery of consumer hardware devices net fees we receive from developers using our payments infrastructure and revenue from various other sources 

cost of revenue and operating expenses 

cost of revenue our cost of revenue consists primarily of expenses associated with the delivery and distribution of our products these include expenses related to the operation of our data centers and technical infrastructure such as facility and server equipment depreciation salaries benefits and sharebased compensation for employees on our operations teams and energy and bandwidth costs cost of revenue also includes costs associated with partner arrangements including traffic acquisition and content costs credit card and other transaction fees related to processing customer transactions and cost of consumer hardware devices sold 

research and development research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits sharebased compensation and facilitiesrelated costs for employees on our engineering and technical teams who are responsible for building new products as well as improving existing products 

marketing and sales marketing and sales expenses consist of salaries and benefits and sharebased compensation for our employees engaged in sales sales support marketing business development and customer service functions our marketing and sales expenses also include marketing and promotional expenditures and professional services such as content reviewers to support our community and product operations

revenue 

   

2020 compared to 2019 revenue in 2020 increased 1527 billion or 22 compared to 2019 the increase was mostly due to an increase in advertising revenue as a result of an increase in the number of ads delivered partially offset by a decrease in the average price per ad 

in 2020 the number of ads delivered increased by 34 as compared with approximately 33 in 2019 the increase in the ads delivered was driven by an increase in the number and frequency of ads displayed across our products and an increase in users in 2020 the average price per ad decreased by 10 as compared with a decrease of approximately 5 in 2019 the decrease in average price per ad during the year ended december 31 2020 was primarily driven by a decrease in advertising demand globally during the first two quarters of 2020 due to the covid19 pandemic and to a lesser extent by an increasing proportion of the number of ads delivered as stories ads and in geographies that monetize at lower rates 

in the nearterm we anticipate that future advertising revenue growth will be determined primarily by several factors the extent to which we continue to see increasing advertising demand in connection with the shift of commerce from offline to online as well as increased consumer demand for purchasing products as opposed to services as a result of the covid19 pandemic the status of the economic recovery from the slowdown caused by the covid19 pandemic and the magnitude of fiscal stimulus and the extent to which changes to the regulatory environment and thirdparty mobile operating systems and browsers result in limitations on our ad targeting and measurement tools 

advertising spending is traditionally seasonally strong in the fourth quarter of each year we believe that this seasonality in advertising spending affects our quarterly results which generally reflect significant growth in advertising revenue between the third and fourth quarters and a decline in advertising spending between the fourth and subsequent first quarters for instance our advertising revenue increased 28 19 and 23 between the third and fourth quarters of 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively while advertising revenue for both the first quarters of 2020 and 2019 declined 16 and 10 compared to the fourth quarters of 2019 and 2018 respectively 

no customer represented 10 or more of total revenue during the years ended december 31 2020 2019 and 2018 

foreign exchange impact on revenue 

the general strengthening of the us dollar relative to certain foreign currencies in the full year 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 had an unfavorable impact on revenue if we had translated revenue for the full year 2020 using the prior years monthly exchange rates for our settlement or billing currencies other than the us dollar our total revenue and 

advertising revenue would have been 8608 billion and 8430 billion respectively using these constant rates total revenue and advertising revenue would have been 120 million and 129 million respectively higher than actual total revenue and advertising revenue for the full year 2020 using the same constant rates full year 2020 total revenue and advertising revenue would have been 1539 billion and 1464 billion respectively higher than actual total revenue and advertising revenue for the full year 2019 

cost of revenue 



2020 compared to 2019 cost of revenue in 2020 increased 392 billion or 31 compared to 2019 the increase was mostly due to an increase in operational expenses related to our data centers and technical infrastructure higher cost associated with partner arrangements including traffic acquisition and content costs and to a lesser extent an increase in cost of consumer hardware devices sold 

in 2021 we anticipate that the cost of revenue will increase as we continue to expand our data center capacity and technical infrastructure to support user growth increased user engagement and the delivery of new products and services and to a lesser extent due to higher costs associated with partner arrangements and consumer hardware devices 

research and development 

   

2020 compared to 2019 research and development expenses in 2020 increased 485 billion or 36 compared to 2019 the increase was primarily due to increases in payroll and benefits expenses as a result of a 40 growth in employee headcount from december 31 2019 to december 31 2020 in engineering and other technical functions supporting our continued investment in our family of products and consumer hardware products 

in 2021 we plan to continue to hire software engineers and other technical employees and to increase our investment to support our research and development initiatives 

marketing and sales 



2020 compared to 2019 marketing and sales expenses in 2020 increased 172 billion or 17 compared to 2019 the increase was primarily driven by increases in marketing expenses and payroll and benefits expenses which were partially offset by a decrease in travelrelated expenses due to the covid19 pandemic our payroll and benefits expenses increased as a result of a 16 increase in employee headcount from december 31 2019 to december 31 2020 in our marketing and sales functions 

in 2021 we plan to continue the hiring of marketing and sales employees to support our marketing sales and partnership efforts and we anticipate marketing expenses will increase 

general and administrative 

   

2020 compared to 2019 excluding the 50 billion ftc settlement accrual recorded in 2019 general and administrative expenses in 2020 increased 110 billion or 20 compared to 2019 the increase was primarily due to higher professional services costs and an increase in payroll and benefits expenses as a result of a 23 increase in employee headcount from december 31 2019 to december 31 2020 in our general and administrative functions 

in 2021 we plan to continue to increase general and administrative expenses to support overall company growth 

interest and other income net 

   

2020 compared to 2019 interest and other income net in 2020 decreased 317 million compared to 2019 the majority of the decrease was due to a decrease in interest income related to lower interest rates compared to 2019 

provision for income taxes 



2020 compared to 2019 our provision for income taxes in 2020 decreased 229 billion or 36 compared to 2019 mostly due to the additional tax expense incurred in 2019 from the altera ninth circuit opinion and the effects of a tax election to capitalize and amortize certain research and development expenses for us income tax purposes both discussed below 

our effective tax rate in 2020 decreased compared to 2019 primarily due to the 2019 legal accrual related to the ftc settlement that was not taxdeductible the additional tax expense incurred in 2019 from the altera ninth circuit opinion and the effects of a tax election to capitalize and amortize certain research and development expenses for us income tax purposes 

in the third quarter of 2020 as part of finalizing our us income tax return we elected to capitalize and amortize certain research and development expenses for us income tax purposes as a result we recorded a total of 107 billion 

income tax benefit for the year ended december 31 2020 the income tax benefit resulted from recording a deferred income tax asset that was greater than the current income tax liability due to different tax rates applicable for the periods in which capitalized expenses will be amortized versus the period in which the increased current tax liability was accrued we do not believe this election will materially affect our effective tax rate trend in the future 

on july 27 2015 the united states tax court issued a decision tax court decision in altera corp v commissioner  which concluded that related parties in a cost sharing arrangement are not required to share expenses related to sharebased compensation the tax court decision was appealed by the commissioner to the ninth circuit court of appeals ninth circuit on june 7 2019 the ninth circuit issued an opinion  altera ninth circuit opinion that reversed the tax court decision based on the altera ninth circuit opinion we recorded a cumulative income tax expense of 111 billion in the second quarter of 2019 on july 22 2019 the taxpayer requested a rehearing before the full ninth circuit and the request was denied on november 12 2019 the taxpayer requested a hearing before the supreme court of the united states and the request was denied on june 22 2020 since we started to accrue income tax for sharebased compensation costsharing expense in the second quarter of 2019 the denial of the request by the supreme court did not have a material impact to our financial results in 2020 

effective tax rate items  our effective tax rate in the future will depend upon the proportion between the following items and income before provision for income taxes us tax benefits from foreign derived intangible income tax effects from sharebased compensation tax effects of integrating intellectual property from acquisitions settlement of tax contingency items tax effects of changes in our business and the effects of changes in tax law 

the accounting for sharebased compensation may increase or decrease our effective tax rate based upon the difference between our sharebased compensation expense and the deductions taken on our tax return which depends upon the stock price at the time of employee award vesting if our stock price remains constant to the january 22 2021 price we expect our effective tax rate for the full year of 2021 will be in the highteens 

integrating intellectual property from acquisitions into our business generally involves intercompany transactions that have the impact of increasing our provision for income taxes consequently our provision for income taxes and our effective tax rate may initially increase in the period of an acquisition and integration the magnitude of this impact will depend upon the specific type size and taxing jurisdictions of the intellectual property as well as the relative contribution to income in subsequent periods 

unrecognized tax benefits as of december 31 2020 we had net unrecognized tax benefits of 348 billion which were accrued as other liabilities these unrecognized tax benefits were predominantly accrued for uncertainties related to transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries which includes licensing of intellectual property providing services and other transactions as well as for uncertainties with our research tax credits the ultimate settlement of the liabilities will depend upon resolution of tax audits litigation or events that would otherwise change the assessment of such items based upon the status of litigation described below and the current status of tax audits in various jurisdictions we do not anticipate a material change to such amounts within the next 12 months 

in july 2016 we received a statutory notice of deficiency notice from the irs related to transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries in conjunction with the examination of the 2010 tax year while the notice applies only to the 2010 tax year the irs stated that it will also apply its position for tax years subsequent to 2010 we do not agree with the position of the irs and have filed a petition in the tax court challenging the notice on january 15 2020 the irs filed its pretrial memorandum in the case stating that it planned to assert at trial an adjustment that is higher than the adjustment stated in the notice the first sessions of the trial began in february 2020 and additional sessions are expected to continue in 2021 the irs did not provide any information about how it intends to apply the revised adjustment to future years based on the information provided we believe that if the irs prevails in its updated position this could result in an additional federal tax liability of an estimated aggregate amount of up to approximately 90 billion in excess of the amounts in our originally filed us return plus interest and any penalties asserted 

in march 2018 we received a second notice from the irs in conjunction with the examination of our 2011 through 2013 tax years the irs applied its position from the 2010 tax year to each of these years and also proposed new adjustments related to other transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries and certain tax credits that we claimed if the irs prevails in its position for these new adjustments this could result in an additional federal tax liability of up to approximately 680 million 

in excess of the amounts in our originally filed us returns plus interest and any penalties asserted we do not agree with the positions of the irs in the second notice and have filed a petition in the tax court challenging the second notice 

we have previously accrued an estimated unrecognized tax benefit consistent with the guidance in asc 740 income taxes  that is lower than the potential additional federal tax liability from the positions taken by the irs in the two notices and its pretrial memorandum in addition if the irs prevails in its positions related to transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries the additional tax that we would owe would be partially offset by a reduction in the tax that we owe under the mandatory transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings from the 2017 tax cuts and jobs act tax act as of december 31 2020 we have not resolved these matters and proceedings continue in the tax court 

we believe that adequate amounts have been reserved in accordance with asc 740 income taxes for any adjustments to the provision for income taxes or other tax items that may ultimately result from these examinations the timing of the resolution settlement and closure of any audits is highly uncertain and it is reasonably possible that the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits could significantly change in the next 12 months given the number of years remaining that are subject to examination in various jurisdictions we are unable to estimate the full range of possible adjustments to the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits if the taxing authorities prevail in the assessment of additional tax due the assessed tax interest and penalties if any could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

quarterly results of operations data 

the following tables set forth our unaudited quarterly consolidated statements of income data in dollars and as a percentage of total revenue for each of the eight quarters in the period ended december 31 2020 we have prepared the quarterly consolidated statements of income data on a basis consistent with the audited consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data in this annual report on form 10k in the opinion of management the financial information reflects all adjustments consisting only of normal recurring adjustments which we consider necessary for a fair presentation of this data this information should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included in part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data in this annual report on form 10k the results of historical periods are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations for any future period

liquidity and capital resources 



our principal sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents marketable securities and cash generated from operations cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities consist mostly of cash on deposit with banks investments in money market funds and investments in us government securities us government agency securities and corporate debt securities cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities were 6195 billion as of december 31 2020 an increase of 710 billion from december 31 2019 the increase was mostly due to 3875 billion of cash generated from operations offset by 1572 billion for capital expenditures including principal payments on finance leases 636 billion for purchases of equity investments 627 billion for repurchases of our class a common stock and 356 billion of taxes paid related to net share settlement of employee restricted stock units rsu awards 

cash paid for income taxes was 423 billion for the year ended december 31 2020 as of december 31 2020 our federal net operating loss carryforward was 1062 billion and our federal tax credit carryforward was 424 million we anticipate the utilization of a significant portion of these net operating losses and credits within the next three years 

our board of directors has authorized a share repurchase program of our class a common stock which commenced in january 2017 and does not have an expiration date as of december 31 2019 490 billion remained available and authorized for repurchases under this program in 2020 we repurchased and subsequently retired 27 million shares of our class a common stock for 630 billion as of december 31 2020 860 billion remained available and authorized for repurchases in january 2021 an additional 25 billion of repurchases was authorized under this program 

as of december 31 2020 718 billion of the 6195 billion in cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities was held by our foreign subsidiaries the tax act imposed a mandatory transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings and eliminated us taxes on foreign subsidiary distributions as a result earnings in foreign jurisdictions are available for distribution to the us without incremental us taxes 

in july 2019 we entered into a settlement and modified consent order to resolve the inquiry of the ftc into our platform and user data practices which was approved by the federal court and took effect in april 2020 we paid the penalty of 50 billion in april 2020 upon the effectiveness of the modified consent order on april 21 2020 we entered into a definitive agreement to invest in jio platforms limited a subsidiary of reliance industries limited the transaction closed on july 7 2020 and we paid approximately 58 billion at the thencurrent exchange rate 

we currently anticipate that our available funds and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our operational cash needs and fund our share repurchase program for the foreseeable future 

cash provided by operating activities 

cash flow from operating activities during 2020 mostly consisted of net income adjusted for certain noncash items including 686 billion of depreciation and amortization and 654 billion of sharebased compensation expense and offset by a cash payment of 50 billion for the ftc legal settlement the increase in cash flow from operating activities during 2020 compared to 2019 was mostly due to higher net income as adjusted for certain noncash items such as depreciation and 

amortization sharebased compensation expense and deferred income tax partially offset by the payment of 50 billion for the ftc legal settlement 

cash flow from operating activities during 2019 primarily consisted of net income adjusted for certain noncash items including 574 billion of depreciation and amortization and 484 billion of sharebased compensation expense the increase in cash flow from operating activities during 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily due to higher net income prior to the effect of the 50 billion ftc legal settlement accrual an increase in taxes payable as well as increases in the noncash items including depreciation and amortization and sharebased compensation expense 

cash used in investing activities 

cash used in investing activities during 2020 mostly resulted from 1511 billion of purchases of property and equipment as we continued to invest in data centers servers office facilities and network infrastructure 816 billion of net purchases of marketable securities and 636 billion of purchases of equity investments the increase in cash used in investing activities during 2020 compared to 2019 was due to increases in purchases of equity investments and in net purchases of marketable securities 

cash used in investing activities during 2019 mostly resulted from 1510 billion of net purchase of property and equipment as we continued to invest in data centers servers network infrastructure and 419 billion of net purchases of marketable securities the increase in cash used in investing activities during 2019 compared to 2018 was mostly due to increases in the net purchases of marketable securities and property and equipment 

we anticipate making capital expenditures of approximately 21 billion to 23 billion in 2021 

cash used in financing activities 

cash used in financing activities during 2020 mostly consisted of 627 billion for repurchases of our class a common stock and 356 billion of taxes paid related to net share settlement of rsus the increase in cash used in financing activities during 2020 compared to 2019 was due to increases in repurchases of our class a common stock and in taxes paid related to net share settlement of rsus 

cash used in financing activities during 2019 mostly consisted of 420 billion used to settle repurchases of our class a common stock and 234 billion of taxes paid related to net share settlement of equity awards and 552 million of principal payments on finance leases the decrease in cash used in financing activities during 2019 compared to 2018 was mostly due to a decrease in repurchases of our class a common stock 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

as of december 31 2020 we did not have any offbalance sheet arrangements that are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources 

contractual obligations 

our principal commitments consist mostly of obligations under operating leases and other contractual commitments our obligations under operating leases include among others certain of our offices data centers land colocations and equipment our other contractual commitments are mostly related to our investments in network infrastructure consumer hardware content costs and data center operations the following table summarizes our commitments to settle contractual obligations in cash as of december 31 2020 



 

1 includes variable lease payments that were fixed subsequent to lease commencement or modification 

additionally as part of the normal course of the business we may also enter into multiyear agreements to purchase renewable energy that do not specify a fixed or minimum volume commitment these agreements are generally entered into in order to secure either volume or price using projected market prices or expected volume consumption the total estimated spend is approximately 494 billion the ultimate spend under these agreements may vary and will be based on prevailing market prices or actual volume purchased 

our other liabilities also include 348 billion related to net uncertain tax positions as of december 31 2020 due to uncertainties in the timing of the completion of tax audits the timing of the resolution of these positions is uncertain and we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years beyond 12 months as a result this amount is not included in the above contractual obligations table 

contingencies 

we are involved in legal proceedings claims and regulatory tax or government inquiries and investigations we record a liability when we believe that it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and that the amount can be reasonably estimated if we determine there is a reasonable possibility that we may incur a loss and the loss or range of loss can be estimated we disclose the possible loss in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements to the extent material significant judgment is required to determine both probability and the estimated amount of loss such matters are inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties some of which are beyond our control should any of these estimates and assumptions change or prove to be incorrect it could have a material impact on our results of operations financial position and cash flows

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to market risks including changes to foreign currency exchange rates interest rates equity investment risk and inflation 

foreign currency exchange risk 

we have foreign currency risks related to our revenue and operating expenses denominated in currencies other than the us dollar primarily the euro accordingly changes in exchange rates and in particular a strengthening of the us dollar have in the past and may in the future negatively affect our revenue and other operating results as expressed in us dollars 

we have experienced and will continue to experience fluctuations in our net income as a result of transaction gains or losses related to revaluing monetary asset and liability balances that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the entities in which they are recorded at this time we have not entered into but in the future we may enter into derivatives or other financial instruments in an attempt to hedge our foreign currency exchange risk it is difficult to predict the effect hedging activities would have on our results of operations foreign currency losses of 129 million 105 million and 213 million were recognized in 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively as interest and other income expense net in our consolidated statements of income 

interest rate sensitivity 

our exposure to changes in interest rates relates primarily to interest earned and market value on our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities 

our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities consist of cash certificates of deposit time deposits money market funds us government securities us government agency securities and investment grade corporate debt securities our investment policy and strategy are focused on preservation of capital and supporting our liquidity requirements changes in us interest rates affect the interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities and the market value of those securities a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would have resulted in a decrease of 794 million and 525 million in the market value of our availableforsale debt securities as of december 31 2020 and december 31 2019 respectively any realized gains or losses resulting from such interest rate changes would only occur if we sold the investments prior to maturity 

equity investment risk 

our equity investments are subject to a wide variety of marketrelated risks that could have a material impact on the carrying value of our holdings we continually evaluate our equity investments in privatelyheld companies 

our equity investments are investments in equity securities of privatelyheld companies without readily determinable market values we elected to account for most of our equity investments using the measurement alternative which is cost less any impairment adjusted for changes in fair value resulting from observable transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer we perform a qualitative assessment at each reporting date to determine whether there are triggering events for impairment the qualitative assessment considers factors such as but not limited to the investees financial condition and business outlook industry and sector performance economic or technological environment and other relevant events and factors affecting the investee valuations of our equity investments are complex due to the lack of readily available market data and observable transactions volatility in the global economic climate and financial markets including recent and ongoing effects related to the impact of the covid19 pandemic which requires significant judgments could result in a material impairment charge on our equity investments equity investments accounted for under the equity method were immaterial as of december 31 2020 and december 31 2019 our equity investments had a carrying value of 623 billion as of december 31 2020

we are also investing heavily in other consumer hardware products and a number of longerterm initiatives such as augmented reality artificial intelligence ai and connectivity efforts to develop technologies that we believe will help us better serve our mission over the long run 

competition 

our business is characterized by innovation rapid change and disruptive technologies we compete with companies that sell advertising as well as with companies that provide social media and communication products and services that are designed to engage users on mobile devices and online we face significant competition in every aspect of our business including from companies that facilitate communication and the sharing of content and information companies that enable marketers to display advertising companies that distribute video and other forms of media content and companies that provide development platforms for applications developers we compete to attract engage and retain people who use our products to attract and retain marketers and to attract and retain developers to build compelling mobile and web applications that integrate with our products 

we also compete with the following 

 



particular countries 

 

 

as we introduce or acquire new products as our existing products evolve or as other companies introduce new products and services we may become subject to additional competition 

technology 

our product development philosophy is centered on continuous innovation in creating and improving products that are social by design which means that our products are designed to place people and their social interactions at the core of the product experience as our user base grows as engagement with products like video increases and as we deepen our investment in new technologies like ai our computing needs continue to expand we make significant investments in technology both to improve our existing products and services and to develop new ones as well as for our marketers and developers we are also investing in protecting the security privacy and integrity of our platform by investing in both people and technology to strengthen our systems against abuse 

sales and operations 

the majority of our marketers use our selfservice ad platform to launch and manage their advertising campaigns we also have a global sales force that is focused on attracting and retaining advertisers and providing support to them throughout the stages of the marketing cycle from prepurchase decisionmaking to realtime optimizations to postcampaign analytics we work directly with these advertisers as well as through advertising agencies and resellers we operate more than 70 offices around the globe the majority of which have a sales presence we also invest in and rely on selfservice tools to provide direct customer support to our users and partners 

marketing 

historically our communities have generally grown organically with people inviting their friends to connect with them supported by internal efforts to stimulate awareness and interest in addition we have invested and will continue to invest in marketing our products and services to grow our brand and help build community around the world 

intellectual property 

to establish and protect our proprietary rights we rely on a combination of patents trademarks copyrights trade secrets including knowhow license agreements confidentiality procedures nondisclosure agreements with third parties employee disclosure and invention assignment agreements and other contractual rights in addition to further protect our proprietary rights from time to time we have purchased patents and patent applications from third parties we do not believe that our proprietary technology is dependent on any single patent or copyright or groups of related patents or copyrights we believe the duration of our patents is adequate relative to the expected lives of our products 

government regulation 

we are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the united states and abroad that involve matters central to our business many of these laws and regulations are still evolving and being tested in courts and could be interpreted in ways that could harm our business these may involve privacy data protection and personal information rights of publicity content intellectual property advertising marketing distribution data security data retention and deletion electronic contracts and other communications competition protection of minors consumer protection telecommunications product liability taxation economic or other trade prohibitions or sanctions anticorruption law compliance securities law compliance and online payment services in particular we are subject to federal state and foreign laws regarding privacy and protection of peoples data foreign data protection privacy content competition and other laws and regulations can impose different obligations or be more restrictive than those in the united states us federal and state and foreign laws and regulations which in some cases can be enforced by private parties in addition to government entities are constantly evolving and can be subject to significant change as a result the application interpretation and enforcement of these laws and regulations are often uncertain particularly in the 

new and rapidly evolving industry in which we operate and may be interpreted and applied inconsistently from country to country and inconsistently with our current policies and practices 

proposed or new legislation and regulations could also significantly affect our business for example the european general data protection regulation gdpr took effect in may 2018 and applies to all of our products and services used by people in europe the gdpr includes operational requirements for companies that receive or process personal data of residents of the european union that are different from those previously in place in the european union and includes significant penalties for noncompliance the brazilian general data protection law will impose requirements similar to gdpr on products and services offered to users in brazil effective in august 2020 the california consumer privacy act which took effect in january 2020 also establishes certain transparency rules and creates new data privacy rights for users similarly there are a number of legislative proposals in the european union the united states at both the federal and state level as well as other jurisdictions that could impose new obligations or limitations in areas affecting our business such as liability for copyright infringement in addition some countries are considering or have passed legislation implementing data protection requirements or requiring local storage and processing of data or similar requirements that could increase the cost and complexity of delivering our services 

we are and expect to continue to be the subject of investigations inquiries data requests requests for information actions and audits by government authorities and regulators in the united states europe and around the world particularly in the areas of privacy data protection law enforcement consumer protection and competition as we continue to grow and expand our operations we are currently and may in the future be subject to regulatory orders or consent decrees including the modified consent order we entered into in july 2019 with the us federal trade commission ftc which is pending federal court approval and which among other matters will require us to implement a comprehensive expansion of our privacy program orders issued by or inquiries or enforcement actions initiated by government or regulatory authorities could cause us to incur substantial costs expose us to unanticipated civil and criminal liability or penalties including substantial monetary remedies interrupt or require us to change our business practices in a manner materially adverse to our business divert resources and the attention of management from our business or subject us to other remedies that adversely affect our business

risk factors 

tableend 

certain factors may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations you should consider carefully the risks and uncertainties described below in addition to other information contained in this annual report on form 10k including our consolidated financial statements and related notes the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of or that we currently believe are not material may also become important factors that adversely affect our business if any of the following risks actually occurs our business financial condition results of operations and future prospects could be materially and adversely affected in that event the trading price of our class a common stock could decline and you could lose part or all of your investment 

risks related to our business and industry 

if we fail to retain existing users or add new users or if our users decrease their level of engagement with our products our revenue financial results and business may be significantly harmed 

the size of our user base and our users level of engagement are critical to our success our financial performance has been and will continue to be significantly determined by our success in adding retaining and engaging active users of our products particularly for facebook and instagram we anticipate that our active user growth rate will generally decline over time as the size of our active user base increases and we expect that the size of our active user base will fluctuate or decline in one or more markets from time to time particularly in markets where we have achieved higher penetration rates for example in the fourth quarter of 2017 we experienced a slight decline on a quarteroverquarter basis in the number of daily active users on facebook in the united states  canada region if people do not perceive our products to be useful reliable and trustworthy we may not be able to attract or retain users or otherwise maintain or increase the frequency and duration of their engagement a number of other social networking companies that achieved early popularity have since seen their active user bases or levels of engagement decline in some cases precipitously there is no guarantee that we will not experience a similar erosion of our active user base or engagement levels our user engagement patterns have changed over time and user engagement can be difficult to measure particularly as we introduce new and different products and services any number of factors can negatively affect user retention growth and engagement including if 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

from time to time certain of these factors have negatively affected user retention growth and engagement to varying degrees if we are unable to maintain or increase our user base and user engagement our revenue and financial results may be adversely affected any decrease in user retention growth or engagement could render our products less attractive to users marketers and developers which is likely to have a material and adverse impact on our revenue business financial condition and results of operations if our active user growth rate continues to slow we will become increasingly dependent on our ability to maintain or increase levels of user engagement and monetization in order to drive revenue growth 

we generate substantially all of our revenue from advertising the loss of marketers or reduction in spending by marketers could seriously harm our business 

substantially all of our revenue is currently generated from third parties advertising on facebook and instagram as is common in the industry our marketers do not have longterm advertising commitments with us many of our marketers spend only a relatively small portion of their overall advertising budget with us marketers will not continue to do business with us 

or they will reduce the budgets they are willing to commit to us if we do not deliver ads in an effective manner or if they do not believe that their investment in advertising with us will generate a competitive return relative to other alternatives we have recently implemented and we will continue to implement changes to our user data practices some of these changes reduce our ability to effectively target ads which has to some extent adversely affected and will continue to adversely affect our advertising business if we are unable to provide marketers with a suitable return on investment the pricing of our ads may not increase or may decline in which case our revenue and financial results may be harmed 

our advertising revenue can also be adversely affected by a number of other factors including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 



 

 

from time to time certain of these factors have adversely affected our advertising revenue to varying degrees the occurrence of any of these or other factors in the future could result in a reduction in demand for our ads which may reduce the prices we receive for our ads or cause marketers to stop advertising with us altogether either of which would negatively affect our revenue and financial results 

our advertising revenue is dependent on targeting and measurement tools that incorporate data signals from user activity on websites and services that we do not control and changes to the regulatory environment thirdparty mobile operating systems and browsers and our own products have impacted and we expect will continue to impact the availability of such signals which will adversely affect our advertising revenue 

we rely on data signals from user activity on websites and services that we do not control in order to deliver relevant and effective ads to our users our advertising revenue is dependent on targeting and measurement tools that incorporate these signals and any changes in our ability to use such signals will adversely affect our business for example legislative and regulatory changes such as the gdpr and ccpa have impacted and we expect will continue to impact our ability to use such signals in our ad products in addition mobile operating system and browser providers such as apple and google have announced product changes as well as future plans to limit the ability of application developers to use these signals to target and measure advertising on their platforms similarly we have implemented and may continue to implement product changes that give users the ability to limit our use of such data signals to improve ads and other experiences on our products and services including our offfacebook activity tool and our worldwide offering of product changes we implemented in connection with the gdpr these developments have limited our ability to target and measure the effectiveness of ads on our platform and any additional loss of such signals in the future will adversely affect our targeting and measurement capabilities and negatively impact our advertising revenue 

our user growth engagement and monetization on mobile devices depend upon effective operation with mobile operating systems networks technologies products and standards that we do not control 

the substantial majority of our revenue is generated from advertising on mobile devices there is no guarantee that popular mobile devices will continue to feature facebook or our other products or that mobile device users will continue to use our products rather than competing products we are dependent on the interoperability of facebook and our other products with popular mobile operating systems networks technologies products and standards that we do not control such as the android and ios operating systems and mobile browsers any changes bugs or technical issues in such systems or changes in our relationships with mobile operating system partners handset manufacturers browser developers or mobile carriers or in their terms of service or policies that degrade our products functionality reduce or eliminate our ability to update or distribute our products give preferential treatment to competitive products limit our ability to deliver target or measure the effectiveness of ads or charge fees related to the distribution of our products or our delivery of ads could adversely affect the usage of facebook or our other products and monetization on mobile devices for example apple previously released an update to its safari browser that limits the use of thirdparty cookies which reduces our ability to provide the most relevant ads to our users and impacts monetization and we expect that any similar changes to its googles or other browser or mobile platforms will further limit our ability to target and measure the effectiveness of ads and impact monetization additionally in order to deliver high quality mobile products it is important that our products work well with a range of mobile technologies products systems networks and standards that we do not control and that we have good relationships with handset manufacturers mobile carriers and browser developers we may not be successful in maintaining or developing relationships with key participants in the mobile ecosystem or in developing products that operate effectively with these technologies products systems networks or standards in the event that it is more difficult for our users to access and use facebook or our other products on their mobile devices or if our users choose not to access or use facebook or our other products on their mobile devices or use mobile products that do not offer access to facebook or our other products our user growth and user engagement could be harmed from time to time we may also take actions regarding the distribution of our products or the operation of our business based on what we believe to be in our longterm best interests such actions may adversely affect our users and our relationships with the operators of mobile operating systems handset manufacturers mobile carriers browser developers or other business partners and there is no assurance that these actions will result in the anticipated longterm benefits in the event that our users are adversely affected 

by these actions or if our relationships with such third parties deteriorate our user growth engagement and monetization could be adversely affected and our business could be harmed 

our business is highly competitive competition presents an ongoing threat to the success of our business 

we compete with companies that sell advertising as well as with companies that provide social media and communication products and services that are designed to engage users on mobile devices and online we face significant competition in every aspect of our business including from companies that facilitate communication and the sharing of content and information companies that enable marketers to display advertising companies that distribute video and other forms of media content and companies that provide development platforms for applications developers we compete with companies that offer products across broad platforms that replicate capabilities we provide for example among other areas we compete with apple in messaging google and youtube in advertising and video tencent and snap in messaging and social media bytedance and twitter in social media and amazon in advertising we also compete with companies that provide regional social networks and messaging products many of which have strong positions in particular countries some of our competitors may be domiciled in different countries and subject to political legal and regulatory regimes that enable them to compete more effectively than us in addition we face competition from traditional online and mobile businesses that provide media for marketers to reach their audiences andor develop tools and systems for managing and optimizing advertising campaigns we also compete with companies that develop and deliver consumer hardware and virtual reality products and services 

some of our current and potential competitors may have greater resources or stronger competitive positions in certain product segments geographic regions or user demographics than we do these factors may allow our competitors to respond more effectively than us to new or emerging technologies and changes in market conditions we believe that some users particularly younger users are aware of and actively engaging with other products and services similar to or as a substitute for our products and services and we believe that some users have reduced their use of and engagement with our products and services in favor of these other products and services in the event that users increasingly engage with other products and services we may experience a decline in use and engagement in key user demographics or more broadly in which case our business would likely be harmed 

our competitors may develop products features or services that are similar to ours or that achieve greater acceptance may undertake more farreaching and successful product development efforts or marketing campaigns or may adopt more aggressive pricing policies in addition developers whose mobile and web applications are integrated with facebook or our other products may use information shared by our users through our products in order to develop products or features that compete with us some competitors may gain a competitive advantage against us in areas where we operate including by making acquisitions by limiting our ability to deliver target or measure the effectiveness of ads by imposing fees or other charges related to our delivery of ads by making access to our products more difficult or impossible by making it more difficult to communicate with our users or by integrating competing platforms applications or features into products they control such as mobile device operating systems search engines browsers or ecommerce platforms for example each of apple and google have integrated competitive products with ios and android respectively as a result our competitors may acquire and engage users or generate advertising or other revenue at the expense of our own efforts which may negatively affect our business and financial results in addition from time to time we may take actions in response to competitive threats but we cannot assure you that these actions will be successful or that they will not negatively affect our business and financial results 

we believe that our ability to compete effectively depends upon many factors both within and beyond our control including 

 

 

 

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if we are not able to compete effectively our user base and level of user engagement may decrease we may become less attractive to developers and marketers and our revenue and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected 

actions by governments that restrict access to facebook or our other products in their countries or that otherwise impair our ability to sell advertising in their countries could substantially harm our business and financial results 

governments from time to time seek to censor content available on facebook or our other products in their country restrict access to our products from their country entirely or impose other restrictions that may affect the accessibility of our products in their country for an extended period of time or indefinitely for example user access to facebook and certain of our other products has been or is currently restricted in whole or in part in china iran and north korea in addition government authorities in other countries may seek to restrict user access to our products if they consider us to be in violation of their laws or a threat to public safety or for other reasons and certain of our products have been restricted by governments in other countries from time to time it is possible that government authorities could take action that impairs our ability to sell advertising including in countries where access to our consumerfacing products may be blocked or restricted for example we generate meaningful revenue from a limited number of resellers representing advertisers based in china and it is possible that the chinese government could take action that reduces or eliminates our chinabased advertising revenue whether as a result of the trade dispute with the united states in response to content issues or otherwise or take other action against us such as imposing taxes or other penalties which could adversely affect our financial results in the event that content shown on facebook or our other products is subject to censorship access to our products is restricted in whole or in part in one or more countries or other restrictions are imposed on our products or our competitors are able to successfully penetrate new geographic markets or capture a greater share of existing geographic markets that we cannot access or where we face other restrictions our ability to retain or increase our user base user engagement or the level of advertising by marketers may be adversely affected we may not be able to maintain or grow our revenue as anticipated and our financial results could be adversely affected 

our new products and changes to existing products could fail to attract or retain users or generate revenue and profits 

our ability to retain increase and engage our user base and to increase our revenue depends heavily on our ability to continue to evolve our existing products and to create successful new products both independently and in conjunction with developers or other third parties we may introduce significant changes to our existing products or acquire or introduce new and unproven products including using technologies with which we have little or no prior development or operating experience for example we do not have significant experience with consumer hardware products or virtual or augmented reality technology which may adversely affect our ability to successfully develop and market these products and technologies we continue to incur substantial costs and we may not be successful in generating profits in connection with these efforts in addition the introduction of new products or changes to existing products may result in new or enhanced governmental or regulatory scrutiny or other complications that could adversely affect our business and financial results we have also invested and expect to continue to invest significant resources in growing our whatsapp and messenger products to support increasing usage of such products we have historically monetized messaging in only a limited fashion and we may not be successful in our efforts to generate meaningful revenue or profits from messaging over the long term in addition we have announced plans to implement endtoend encryption across our messaging services as well as facilitate interoperability between these platforms which plans have drawn governmental and regulatory scrutiny in multiple jurisdictions if our new or enhanced products fail to engage users marketers or developers or if our business plans are unsuccessful we may fail to attract or retain users or to generate sufficient revenue operating margin or other value to justify our investments and our business may be adversely affected 

we make product and investment decisions that may not prioritize shortterm financial results and may not produce the longterm benefits that we expect 

we frequently make product and investment decisions that may not prioritize shortterm financial results if we believe that the decisions are consistent with our mission and benefit the aggregate user experience and will thereby improve our financial performance over the long term for example we have recently implemented and we will continue to implement changes to our user data practices some of these changes reduce our ability to effectively target ads which has to some extent adversely affected and will continue to adversely affect our advertising business for example our offfacebook activity tool enables users to place limits on our storage and use of information about their interactions with advertisers apps and websites which will reduce our ability to deliver the most relevant and effective ads to our users similarly from time to time we update our news feed ranking algorithm to optimize the user experience and these changes have had and may in the future have the effect of reducing time spent and some measures of user engagement with facebook which could adversely affect our financial results from time to time we may also change the size frequency or relative prominence of ads in order to improve ad quality and overall user experience in addition we have made and we expect to continue to make other changes to our products which may adversely affect the distribution of content of publishers marketers and developers and could reduce their incentive to invest in their efforts on facebook we also may introduce new features or other changes to existing products or introduce new standalone products that attract users away from properties formats or use cases where we have more proven means of monetization for example we plan to continue to promote the stories format which is becoming increasingly popular for sharing content across our products but our advertising efforts with this format are still under development and we do not currently monetize stories at the same rate as news feed in addition as we focus on growing users and engagement across our family of products from time to time these efforts have reduced and may in the future reduce engagement with one or more products and services in favor of other products or services that we monetize less successfully or that are not growing as quickly these decisions may adversely affect our business and results of operations and may not produce the longterm benefits that we expect 

if we are not able to maintain and enhance our brands our ability to expand our base of users marketers and developers may be impaired and our business and financial results may be harmed 

we believe that our brands have significantly contributed to the success of our business we also believe that maintaining and enhancing our brands is critical to expanding our base of users marketers and developers many of our new users are referred by existing users maintaining and enhancing our brands will depend largely on our ability to continue to provide useful reliable trustworthy and innovative products which we may not do successfully we may introduce new products or terms of service or policies that users do not like which may negatively affect our brands additionally the actions of our developers or advertisers may affect our brands if users do not have a positive experience using thirdparty mobile and web applications integrated with our products or interacting with parties that advertise through our products we will also continue to experience media legislative or regulatory scrutiny of our actions or decisions regarding user privacy encryption content advertising and other issues including actions or decisions in connection with elections which may adversely affect our reputation and 

brands for example in march 2018 we announced developments regarding the misuse of certain data by a developer that shared such data with third parties in violation of our terms and policies we also may fail to respond expeditiously or appropriately to the sharing of objectionable content on our services or objectionable practices by advertisers or developers or to otherwise address user concerns which has occurred in the past and which could erode confidence in our brands our brands may also be negatively affected by the actions of users that are deemed to be hostile or inappropriate to other users by the actions of users acting under false or inauthentic identities by the use of our products or services to disseminate information that is deemed to be misleading or intended to manipulate opinions by perceived or actual efforts by governments to obtain access to user information for securityrelated purposes or to censor certain content on our platform or by the use of our products or services for illicit or objectionable ends including for example any such actions around the 2020 us presidential election or other elections around the world maintaining and enhancing our brands will require us to make substantial investments and these investments may not be successful certain of our past actions such as the foregoing matter regarding developer misuse of data have eroded confidence in our brands and if we fail to successfully promote and maintain our brands or if we incur excessive expenses in this effort our business and financial results may be adversely affected 

security breaches improper access to or disclosure of our data or user data other hacking and phishing attacks on our systems or other cyber incidents could harm our reputation and adversely affect our business 

our industry is prone to cyberattacks by third parties seeking unauthorized access to our data or users data or to disrupt our ability to provide service our products and services involve the collection storage processing and transmission of a large amount of data any failure to prevent or mitigate security breaches and improper access to or disclosure of our data or user data including personal information content or payment information from users or information from marketers could result in the loss modification disclosure destruction or other misuse of such data which could harm our business and reputation and diminish our competitive position in addition computer malware viruses social engineering predominantly spear phishing attacks and general hacking have become more prevalent in our industry have occurred on our systems in the past and will occur on our systems in the future we also regularly encounter attempts to create false or undesirable user accounts purchase ads or take other actions on our platform for purposes such as spamming spreading misinformation or other objectionable ends as a result of our prominence the size of our user base the types and volume of personal data on our systems and the evolving nature of our products and services including our efforts involving new and emerging technologies we believe that we are a particularly attractive target for such breaches and attacks including from highly sophisticated statesponsored or otherwise wellfunded actors our efforts to address undesirable activity on our platform also increase the risk of retaliatory attacks such breaches and attacks may cause interruptions to the services we provide degrade the user experience cause users or marketers to lose confidence and trust in our products impair our internal systems or result in financial harm to us our efforts to protect our company data or the information we receive and to disable undesirable activities on our platform may also be unsuccessful due to software bugs or other technical malfunctions employee contractor or vendor error or malfeasance including defects or vulnerabilities in our vendors information technology systems or offerings government surveillance breaches of physical security of our facilities or technical infrastructure or other threats that evolve in addition third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or users to disclose information in order to gain access to our data or our users data cyberattacks continue to evolve in sophistication and volume and inherently may be difficult to detect for long periods of time although we have developed systems and processes that are designed to protect our data and user data to prevent data loss to disable undesirable accounts and activities on our platform and to prevent or detect security breaches we cannot assure you that such measures will provide absolute security that we will be able to react in a timely manner or that our remediation efforts will be successful we experience cyberattacks and other security incidents of varying degrees from time to time and we may incur significant costs in protecting against or remediating such incidents 

in addition some of our developers or other partners such as those that help us measure the effectiveness of ads may receive or store information provided by us or by our users through mobile or web applications integrated with facebook we provide limited information to such third parties based on the scope of services provided to us however if these third parties or developers fail to adopt or adhere to adequate data security practices or in the event of a breach of their networks our data or our users data may be improperly accessed used or disclosed 

we are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the united states and abroad relating to cybersecurity and data protection as well as obligations under the modified consent order we entered into in july 2019 with the us federal trade commission ftc which is pending federal court approval as a result affected users or government authorities could initiate legal or regulatory actions against us in connection with any actual or perceived security breaches or improper access to or disclosure of data which has occurred in the past and which could cause us to incur significant expense and liability or result in orders or consent decrees forcing us to modify our business practices such incidents or our efforts to remediate such incidents 

may also result in a decline in our active user base or engagement levels any of these events could have a material and adverse effect on our business reputation or financial results 

for example in september 2018 we announced our discovery of a thirdparty cyberattack that exploited a vulnerability in facebooks code to steal user access tokens which were then used to access certain profile information from approximately 29 million user accounts on facebook while we took steps to remediate the attack including fixing the vulnerability resetting user access tokens and notifying affected users we may discover and announce additional developments which could further erode confidence in our brand in addition the events surrounding this cyberattack became the subject of irish data protection commission and other government inquiries any such inquiries could subject us to substantial fines and costs require us to change our business practices divert resources and the attention of management from our business or adversely affect our business 

we anticipate that our ongoing efforts related to privacy safety security and content review will identify additional instances of misuse of user data or other undesirable activity by third parties on our platform 

in addition to our efforts to mitigate cybersecurity risks we are making significant investments in privacy safety security and content review efforts to combat misuse of our services and user data by third parties including investigations and audits of platform applications that previously accessed information of a large number of users of our services as a result of these efforts we have discovered and announced and anticipate that we will continue to discover and announce additional incidents of misuse of user data or other undesirable activity by third parties we may not discover all such incidents or activity whether as a result of our data limitations including our lack of visibility over our encrypted services the scale of activity on our platform or other factors and we may be notified of such incidents or activity by the independent privacy assessor required under our consent order with the ftc the media or other third parties such incidents and activities have in the past and may in the future include the use of user data or our systems in a manner inconsistent with our terms contracts or policies the existence of false or undesirable user accounts election interference improper ad purchases activities that threaten peoples safety on or offline or instances of spamming scraping or spreading misinformation we may also be unsuccessful in our efforts to enforce our policies or otherwise remediate any such incidents any of the foregoing developments may negatively affect user trust and engagement harm our reputation and brands require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business and adversely affect our business and financial results any such developments may also subject us to additional litigation and regulatory inquiries which could subject us to monetary penalties and damages divert managements time and attention and lead to enhanced regulatory oversight 

unfavorable media coverage could negatively affect our business 

we receive a high degree of media coverage around the world unfavorable publicity regarding for example our privacy practices terms of service advertising policies product changes product quality litigation or regulatory activity government surveillance the actions of our advertisers the actions of our developers whose products are integrated with our products the use of our products or services for illicit or objectionable ends the substance or enforcement of our community standards the actions of our users the quality and integrity of content shared on our platform or the actions of other companies that provide similar services to ours has in the past and could in the future adversely affect our reputation for example beginning in march 2018 we were the subject of intense media coverage involving the misuse of certain data by a developer that shared such data with third parties in violation of our terms and policies and we have continued to receive negative publicity in addition we may be subject to negative publicity if we are not successful in our efforts to prevent the illicit or objectionable use of our products or services in connection with the 2020 us presidential election or other elections around the world any such negative publicity could have an adverse effect on the size engagement and loyalty of our user base and result in decreased revenue which could adversely affect our business and financial results 

our financial results will fluctuate from quarter to quarter and are difficult to predict 

our quarterly financial results have fluctuated in the past and will fluctuate in the future additionally we have a limited operating history with the current scale of our business which makes it difficult to forecast our future results as a result you should not rely upon our past quarterly financial results as indicators of future performance you should take into account the risks and uncertainties frequently encountered by companies in rapidly evolving markets our financial results in any given quarter can be influenced by numerous factors many of which we are unable to predict or are outside of our control including 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

we expect our rates of growth to decline in the future 

we expect that our user growth rate will generally decline over time as the size of our active user base increases and it is possible that the size of our active user base may fluctuate or decline in one or more markets particularly as we achieve greater market penetration we expect our revenue growth rate will continue to decline over time as our revenue increases to higher levels as our growth rates decline investors perceptions of our business may be adversely affected and the trading price of our class a common stock could decline 

our costs are continuing to grow and some of our investments have the effect of reducing our operating margin and profitability if our investments are not successful our business and financial performance could be harmed 

operating our business is costly and we expect our expenses to continue to increase in the future as we broaden our user base as users increase the amount and types of content they consume and the data they share with us for example with respect to video as we develop and implement new products as we market new and existing products and promote our brands as we continue to expand our technical infrastructure as we continue to invest in new and unproven technologies and as we continue to hire additional employees and contractors to support our expanding operations including our efforts to focus on privacy safety security and content review in addition from time to time we are subject to settlements judgments fines or other monetary penalties in connection with legal and regulatory developments that may be material to our business we are also continuing to increase our investments in new platforms and technologies some of these investments particularly our significant investments in virtual and augmented reality have generated only limited revenue and reduced our operating margin and profitability if our investments are not successful our ability to grow revenue will be harmed which could adversely affect our business and financial performance 

given our levels of sharebased compensation our tax rate may vary significantly depending on our stock price 

the tax effects of the accounting for sharebased compensation may significantly impact our effective tax rate from period to period in periods in which our stock price is higher than the grant price of the sharebased compensation vesting in that period we will recognize excess tax benefits that will decrease our effective tax rate for example in 2019  excess tax benefits recognized from sharebased compensation decreased our provision for income taxes by 313 million and our effective tax rate 

by one percentage point as compared to the tax rate without such benefits in future periods in which our stock price is lower than the grant price of the sharebased compensation vesting in that period our effective tax rate may increase the amount and value of sharebased compensation issued relative to our earnings in a particular period will also affect the magnitude of the impact of sharebased compensation on our effective tax rate these tax effects are dependent on our stock price which we do not control and a decline in our stock price could significantly increase our effective tax rate and adversely affect our financial results 

our business is subject to complex and evolving us and foreign laws and regulations regarding privacy data protection content competition consumer protection and other matters many of these laws and regulations are subject to change and uncertain interpretation and could result in claims changes to our business practices monetary penalties increased cost of operations or declines in user growth or engagement or otherwise harm our business 

we are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the united states and abroad that involve matters central to our business including privacy data protection and personal information rights of publicity content intellectual property advertising marketing distribution data security data retention and deletion electronic contracts and other communications competition protection of minors consumer protection telecommunications product liability taxation economic or other trade prohibitions or sanctions anticorruption law compliance securities law compliance and online payment services the introduction of new products expansion of our activities in certain jurisdictions or other actions that we may take may subject us to additional laws regulations or other government scrutiny in addition foreign data protection privacy content competition and other laws and regulations can impose different obligations or be more restrictive than those in the united states 

these us federal and state and foreign laws and regulations which in some cases can be enforced by private parties in addition to government entities are constantly evolving and can be subject to significant change as a result the application interpretation and enforcement of these laws and regulations are often uncertain particularly in the new and rapidly evolving industry in which we operate and may be interpreted and applied inconsistently from country to country and inconsistently with our current policies and practices for example regulatory or legislative actions affecting the manner in which we display content to our users or obtain consent to various practices could adversely affect user growth and engagement such actions could affect the manner in which we provide our services or adversely affect our financial results 

we are also subject to laws and regulations that dictate whether how and under what circumstances we can transfer process andor receive certain data that is critical to our operations including data shared between countries or regions in which we operate and data shared among our products and services for example in 2016 the european union and united states agreed to a transfer framework for data transferred from the european union to the united states called the privacy shield but this framework is subject to an annual review that could result in changes to our obligations and also is subject to challenge by regulators and private parties including a pending legal challenge by a private party in addition the other bases upon which facebook relies to legitimize the transfer of such data such as standard contractual clauses sccs have been subjected to regulatory and judicial scrutiny for example the irish data protection commissioner has challenged the legal grounds for transfers of user data to facebook inc and the irish high court has referred this challenge to the court of justice of the european union for decision we have also been managing investigations and lawsuits in europe india and other jurisdictions regarding the august 2016 update to whatsapps terms of service and privacy policy and its sharing of certain data with other facebook products and services including a lawsuit currently pending before the supreme court of india if one or more of the legal bases for transferring data from europe to the united states is invalidated or the transfer frameworks are amended if we are unable to transfer data between and among countries and regions in which we operate or if we are restricted from sharing data among our products and services it could affect the manner in which we provide our services or our ability to target ads which could adversely affect our financial results 

proposed or new legislation and regulations could also significantly affect our business for example the european general data protection regulation gdpr took effect in may 2018 and applies to all of our products and services used by people in europe the gdpr includes operational requirements for companies that receive or process personal data of residents of the european union that are different from those previously in place in the european union as a result we implemented measures to change our service for minors under the age of 16 for certain countries in europe that maintain the minimum age of 16 under the gdpr we also obtain consent andor offer new controls to existing and new users in europe before processing data for certain aspects of our service in addition the gdpr requires submission of personal data breach notifications to our designated european privacy regulator the irish data protection commission and includes significant penalties for noncompliance with the notification obligation as well as other requirements of the regulation the brazilian general data protection law will impose requirements similar to gdpr on products and services offered to users in brazil effective in august 2020 

the california consumer privacy act ccpa which took effect in january 2020 also establishes certain transparency rules and creates new data privacy rights for users including more ability to control how their data is shared with third parties these laws and regulations are evolving and subject to interpretation and resulting limitations on our advertising services or reductions of advertising by marketers have to some extent adversely affected and will continue to adversely affect our advertising business similarly there are a number of legislative proposals in the european union the united states at both the federal and state level as well as other jurisdictions that could impose new obligations or limitations in areas affecting our business in addition some countries are considering or have passed legislation implementing data protection requirements or requiring local storage and processing of data or similar requirements that could increase the cost and complexity of delivering our services 

these laws and regulations as well as any associated claims inquiries or investigations or any other government actions have in the past led to and may in the future lead to unfavorable outcomes including increased compliance costs delays or impediments in the development of new products negative publicity and reputational harm increased operating costs diversion of management time and attention and remedies that harm our business including fines or demands or orders that we modify or cease existing business practices 

we have been subject to regulatory and other government investigations enforcement actions and settlements and we expect to continue to be subject to such proceedings and other inquiries in the future which could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner materially adverse to our business 

from time to time we receive formal and informal inquiries from government authorities and regulators regarding our compliance with laws and regulations many of which are evolving and subject to interpretation we are and expect to continue to be the subject of investigations inquiries data requests requests for information actions and audits in the united states europe and around the world particularly in the areas of privacy data protection law enforcement consumer protection and competition as we continue to grow and expand our operations in addition we are currently and may in the future be subject to regulatory orders or consent decrees for example data protection competition and consumer protection authorities in the european union have initiated actions investigations or administrative orders seeking to restrict the ways in which we collect and use information or impose sanctions and other authorities may do the same in addition beginning in march 2018 we became subject to ftc state attorneys general and other government inquiries in the united states europe and other jurisdictions in connection with our platform and user data practices as well as the misuse of certain data by a developer that shared such data with third parties in violation of our terms and policies in july 2019 we entered into a settlement and modified consent order to resolve the ftc inquiry which is pending federal court approval among other matters our settlement with the ftc requires us to pay a penalty of 50 billion and to significantly enhance our practices and processes for privacy compliance and oversight beginning in september 2018 we also became subject to irish data protection commission idpc and other government inquiries in connection with a thirdparty cyberattack that exploited a vulnerability in facebooks code to steal user access tokens and access certain profile information from user accounts on facebook from time to time we also notify the idpc our designated european privacy regulator under the gdpr of certain other personal data breaches and privacy issues and are subject to inquiries and investigations regarding various aspects of our regulatory compliance 

in addition competition authorities in the united states europe and other jurisdictions have initiated formal and informal inquiries and investigations into many aspects of our business including with respect to users and advertisers as well as our industry for example in june 2019 we were informed by the ftc that it had opened an antitrust investigation of our company in addition beginning in the third quarter of 2019 we became the subject of antitrust inquiries and investigations by the us department of justice the us house of representatives and state attorneys general these inquiries and investigations concern among other things our business practices in the areas of social networking or social media services digital advertising andor mobile or online applications as well as past acquisitions 

orders issued by or inquiries or enforcement actions initiated by government or regulatory authorities could cause us to incur substantial costs expose us to unanticipated civil and criminal liability or penalties including substantial monetary remedies interrupt or require us to change our business practices in a manner materially adverse to our business result in negative publicity and reputational harm divert resources and the attention of management from our business or subject us to other remedies that adversely affect our business 

compliance with our ftc consent order the gdpr the ccpa and other regulatory and legislative privacy requirements will require significant operational resources and modifications to our business practices and any compliance failures may have a material adverse effect on our business reputation and financial results 

we are engaged in ongoing privacy compliance and oversight efforts including as a result of the modified consent order we entered into in july 2019 with the ftc as well as our efforts to comply with the gdpr and other regulatory and legislative requirements around the world including the ccpa in particular we have agreed with the ftc to implement a comprehensive expansion of our privacy program including substantial management and board of directors oversight stringent operational requirements and reporting obligations and a process to regularly certify our compliance with the privacy program to the ftc which will be challenging and costly to implement we expect that these enhancements will result in both improved privacy compliance and oversight and the discovery of additional privacy issues at least in the nearterm and we expect to continue to notify the ftc of such issues from time to time in accordance with our reporting obligations under the consent order these compliance and oversight efforts will increase demand on our systems and resources and will require significant investments including investments in compliance processes personnel and technical infrastructure in the nearterm we are reallocating resources internally to assist with these efforts and this has had and will continue to have an adverse impact on our other business initiatives in addition these efforts will require substantial modifications to our business practices and make some practices such as product and ads development more difficult timeconsuming and costly as a result we believe our ability to develop and launch new features products and services in a timely manner will be adversely affected we also expect that our privacy compliance and oversight efforts will require significant time and attention from our management and board of directors in addition regulatory and legislative privacy requirements are constantly evolving and can be subject to significant change and uncertain interpretation if we are unable to successfully implement and comply with the mandates of the ftc consent order gdpr ccpa or other regulatory or legislative requirements or if we are found to be in violation of the consent order or other requirements we may be subject to regulatory or governmental investigations or lawsuits which may result in significant monetary fines judgments or other penalties and we may also be required to make additional changes to our business practices any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business reputation and financial results 

if we are unable to protect our intellectual property the value of our brands and other intangible assets may be diminished and our business may be adversely affected 

we rely and expect to continue to rely on a combination of confidentiality assignment and license agreements with our employees consultants and third parties with whom we have relationships as well as trademark copyright patent trade secret and domain name protection laws to protect our proprietary rights in the united states and internationally we have filed various applications for protection of certain aspects of our intellectual property and we currently hold a significant number of registered trademarks and issued patents in multiple jurisdictions and have acquired patents and patent applications from third parties third parties may knowingly or unknowingly infringe our proprietary rights third parties may challenge proprietary rights held by us and pending and future trademark and patent applications may not be approved in addition effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which we operate or intend to operate our business in any or all of these cases we may be required to expend significant time and expense in order to prevent infringement or to enforce our rights although we have generally taken measures to protect our proprietary rights there can be no assurance that others will not offer products or concepts that are substantially similar to ours and compete with our business in addition we regularly contribute software source code under open source licenses and have made other technology we developed available under other open licenses and we include open source software in our products for example we have contributed certain specifications and designs related to our data center equipment to the open compute project foundation a nonprofit entity that shares and develops such information with the technology community under the open web foundation license as a result of our open source contributions and the use of open source in our products we may license or be required to license or disclose code andor innovations that turn out to be material to our business and may also be exposed to increased litigation risk if the protection of our proprietary rights is inadequate to prevent unauthorized use or appropriation by third parties the value of our brands and other intangible assets may be diminished and competitors may be able to more effectively mimic our products services and methods of operations any of these events could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results 

we are currently and expect to be in the future party to patent lawsuits and other intellectual property rights claims that are expensive and time consuming and if resolved adversely could have a significant impact on our business financial condition or results of operations 

companies in the internet technology and media industries own large numbers of patents copyrights trademarks and trade secrets and frequently enter into litigation based on allegations of infringement misappropriation or other violations of 

intellectual property or other rights in addition various nonpracticing entities that own patents and other intellectual property rights often attempt to aggressively assert their rights in order to extract value from technology companies furthermore from time to time we may introduce or acquire new products including in areas where we historically have not competed which could increase our exposure to patent and other intellectual property claims from competitors and nonpracticing entities 

from time to time we receive notice from patent holders and other parties alleging that certain of our products and services or user content infringe their intellectual property rights we presently are involved in a number of intellectual property lawsuits and as we face increasing competition and gain an increasingly high profile we expect the number of patent and other intellectual property claims against us to grow defending patent and other intellectual property litigation is costly and can impose a significant burden on management and employees and there can be no assurances that favorable final outcomes will be obtained in all cases in addition plaintiffs may seek and we may become subject to preliminary or provisional rulings in the course of any such litigation including potential preliminary injunctions requiring us to cease some or all of our operations we may decide to settle such lawsuits and disputes on terms that are unfavorable to us similarly if any litigation to which we are a party is resolved adversely we may be subject to an unfavorable judgment that may not be reversed upon appeal the terms of such a settlement or judgment may require us to cease some or all of our operations or pay substantial amounts to the other party in addition we may have to seek a license to continue practices found to be in violation of a third partys rights which may not be available on reasonable terms or at all and may significantly increase our operating costs and expenses as a result we may also be required to develop alternative noninfringing technology or practices or discontinue the practices the development of alternative noninfringing technology or practices could require significant effort and expense could result in less effective technology or practices or otherwise negatively affect the user experience or may not be feasible we have experienced unfavorable outcomes in such disputes and litigation in the past and our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected as a result of an unfavorable resolution of the disputes and litigation referred to above 

we are involved in numerous class action lawsuits and other litigation matters that are expensive and time consuming and if resolved adversely could harm our business financial condition or results of operations 

in addition to intellectual property claims we are also involved in numerous other lawsuits including putative class action lawsuits many of which claim statutory damages andor seek significant changes to our business operations and we anticipate that we will continue to be a target for numerous lawsuits in the future because of the scale of our user base the plaintiffs in class action cases filed against us typically claim enormous monetary damages even if the alleged peruser harm is small or nonexistent in addition we have in the past and may in the future be subject to additional class action lawsuits based on advertiser claims antitrust claims employment claims product performance or other claims related to the use of consumer hardware and software as well as virtual reality technology and products which are new and unproven for example we are currently the subject of multiple putative class action suits in connection with our platform and user data practices and the misuse of certain data by a developer that shared such data with third parties in violation of our terms and policies as well as the disclosure of our earnings results for the second quarter of 2018 we also recently agreed to settlements in principle to resolve certain lawsuits in connection with the tag suggestions facial recognition feature on facebook and a thirdparty cyberattack that exploited a vulnerability in facebooks code to steal user access tokens and access certain profile information from user accounts on facebook we believe the remaining lawsuits are without merit and are vigorously defending them however the results of such lawsuits and claims cannot be predicted with certainty and any negative outcome from any such lawsuits could result in payments of substantial monetary damages or fines or undesirable changes to our products or business practices and accordingly our business financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

there can be no assurances that a favorable final outcome will be obtained in all our cases and defending any lawsuit is costly and can impose a significant burden on management and employees any litigation to which we are a party may result in an onerous or unfavorable judgment that may not be reversed upon appeal or in payments of substantial monetary damages or fines or we may decide to settle lawsuits on similarly unfavorable terms which has occurred in the past and which could adversely affect our business financial conditions or results of operations 

we may incur liability as a result of information retrieved from or transmitted over the internet or published using our products or as a result of claims related to our products and legislation regulating content on our platform may require us to change our products or business practices 

we have faced currently face and will continue to face claims relating to information that is published or made available on our products in particular the nature of our business exposes us to claims related to defamation dissemination of misinformation or news hoaxes discrimination intellectual property rights rights of publicity and privacy personal injury torts 

or laws regulating hate speech or other types of content this risk is enhanced in certain jurisdictions outside the united states where our protection from liability for thirdparty actions may be unclear or where we may be less protected under local laws than we are in the united states for example in april 2019 the european union passed a directive expanding online platform liability for copyright infringement and regulating certain uses of news content online which member states must implement by june 2021 in addition there have been various congressional efforts to restrict the scope of the protections available to online platforms under section 230 of the communications decency act and our current protections from liability for thirdparty content in the united states could decrease or change we could incur significant costs investigating and defending such claims and if we are found liable significant damages we could also face fines or orders restricting or blocking our services in particular geographies as a result of content hosted on our services for example legislation in germany has in the past and may in the future result in the imposition of fines for failure to comply with certain content removal law enforcement cooperation and disclosure obligations other countries including australia france singapore and the united kingdom are considering or have implemented similar legislation imposing penalties for failure to remove content or follow certain processes such legislation also has in the past and may in the future require us to change our products or business practices increase our compliance costs or otherwise impact our operations or our ability to provide services in certain geographies for example the european copyright directive requires certain online services to obtain authorizations for copyrighted content or to implement measures to prevent the availability of that content which may require us to make substantial investments in compliance processes if any of the foregoing events occur our business and financial results could be adversely affected 

our ceo has control over key decision making as a result of his control of a majority of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock 

mark zuckerberg our founder chairman and ceo is able to exercise voting rights with respect to a majority of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock and therefore has the ability to control the outcome of matters submitted to our stockholders for approval including the election of directors and any merger consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets this concentrated control could delay defer or prevent a change of control merger consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets that our other stockholders support or conversely this concentrated control could result in the consummation of such a transaction that our other stockholders do not support this concentrated control could also discourage a potential investor from acquiring our class a common stock which has limited voting power relative to the class b common stock and might harm the trading price of our class a common stock in addition mr zuckerberg has the ability to control the management and major strategic investments of our company as a result of his position as our ceo and his ability to control the election or replacement of our directors in the event of his death the shares of our capital stock that mr zuckerberg owns will be transferred to the persons or entities that he has designated as a board member and officer mr zuckerberg owes a fiduciary duty to our stockholders and must act in good faith in a manner he reasonably believes to be in the best interests of our stockholders as a stockholder even a controlling stockholder mr zuckerberg is entitled to vote his shares and shares over which he has voting control as governed by a voting agreement in his own interests which may not always be in the interests of our stockholders generally 

we plan to continue to make acquisitions which could harm our financial condition or results of operations and may adversely affect the price of our common stock 

as part of our business strategy we have made and intend to continue to make acquisitions to add specialized employees and complementary companies products or technologies we may not be able to find suitable acquisition candidates and we may not be able to complete acquisitions on favorable terms if at all in some cases the costs of such acquisitions may be substantial and there is no assurance that we will receive a favorable return on investment for our acquisitions 

we may pay substantial amounts of cash or incur debt to pay for acquisitions which could adversely affect our liquidity the incurrence of indebtedness would also result in increased fixed obligations and increased interest expense and could also include covenants or other restrictions that would impede our ability to manage our operations we may also issue equity securities to pay for acquisitions and we regularly grant rsus to retain the employees of acquired companies which could increase our expenses adversely affect our financial results and result in dilution to our stockholders in addition any acquisitions we announce could be viewed negatively by users marketers developers or investors which may adversely affect our business or the price of our class a common stock 

we may also discover liabilities or deficiencies associated with the companies or assets we acquire that were not identified in advance which may result in significant unanticipated costs the effectiveness of our due diligence review and our ability to evaluate the results of such due diligence are dependent upon the accuracy and completeness of statements and disclosures made 

or actions taken by the companies we acquire or their representatives as well as the limited amount of time in which acquisitions are executed in addition we may fail to accurately forecast the financial impact of an acquisition transaction including tax and accounting charges acquisitions may also result in our recording of significant additional expenses to our results of operations and recording of substantial finitelived intangible assets on our balance sheet upon closing any of these factors may adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations 

we may not be able to successfully integrate our acquisitions and we may incur significant costs to integrate and support the companies we acquire 

the integration of acquisitions requires significant time and resources and we may not manage these processes successfully our ability to successfully integrate complex acquisitions is unproven particularly with respect to companies that have significant operations or that develop products where we do not have prior experience for example the technology and products we acquired from oculus were relatively new to facebook at the time of the acquisition and we did not have significant experience with or structure in place to support such technology and products prior to the acquisition we continue to make substantial investments of resources to support our acquisitions which will result in significant ongoing operating expenses and may divert resources and management attention from other areas of our business we cannot assure you that these investments will be successful if we fail to successfully integrate the companies we acquire we may not realize the benefits expected from the transaction and our business may be harmed 

if our goodwill or finitelived intangible assets become impaired we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings 

we review our finitelived intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable such as a decline in stock price and market capitalization we test goodwill for impairment at least annually if such goodwill or finitelived intangible assets are deemed to be impaired an impairment loss equal to the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the assets would be recognized we may be required to record a significant charge in our financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill or finitelived intangible assets is determined which would negatively affect our results of operations 

our business is dependent on our ability to maintain and scale our technical infrastructure and any significant disruption in our service could damage our reputation result in a potential loss of users and engagement and adversely affect our financial results 

our reputation and ability to attract retain and serve our users is dependent upon the reliable performance of our products and our underlying technical infrastructure we have in the past experienced and may in the future experience interruptions in the availability or performance of our products from time to time our systems may not be adequately designed or may not operate with the reliability and redundancy necessary to avoid performance delays or outages that could be harmful to our business if our products are unavailable when users attempt to access them or if they do not load as quickly as expected users may not use our products as often in the future or at all and our ability to serve ads may be disrupted any of which could adversely affect our business and financial performance as the amount and types of information shared on facebook and our other products continue to grow and evolve as the usage patterns of our global community continue to evolve and as our internal operational demands continue to grow we will need an increasing amount of technical infrastructure including network capacity and computing power to continue to satisfy our needs it is possible that we may fail to continue to effectively scale and grow our technical infrastructure to accommodate these increased demands which may adversely affect our user engagement and advertising revenue growth in addition our business may be subject to interruptions delays or failures resulting from earthquakes adverse weather conditions other natural disasters power loss terrorism geopolitical conflict other physical security threats cyberattacks or other catastrophic events if such an event were to occur users may be subject to service disruptions or outages and we may not be able to recover our technical infrastructure and user data in a timely manner to restart or provide our services which may adversely affect our financial results 

a substantial portion of our network infrastructure is provided by third parties any disruption or failure in the services we receive from these providers could harm our ability to handle existing or increased traffic and could significantly harm our business any financial or other difficulties these providers face may adversely affect our business and we exercise little control over these providers which increases our vulnerability to problems with the services they provide 

we could experience unforeseen difficulties in building and operating key portions of our technical infrastructure 

we have designed and built our own data centers and key portions of our technical infrastructure through which we serve our products and we plan to continue to significantly expand the size of our infrastructure primarily through data centers and other projects the infrastructure expansion we are undertaking is complex and involves projects in multiple locations unanticipated delays in the completion of these projects including due to any shortage of labor necessary in building portions of such projects or availability of components challenges in obtaining required government or regulatory approvals or other geopolitical challenges or actions by governments may lead to increased project costs operational inefficiencies or interruptions in the delivery or degradation of the quality of our products in addition there may be issues related to this infrastructure that are not identified during the testing phases of design and implementation which may only become evident after we have started to fully utilize the underlying equipment that could further degrade the user experience or increase our costs any of these events could adversely affect our business reputation or financial results 

our products and internal systems rely on software and hardware that is highly technical and if these systems contain errors bugs or vulnerabilities or if we are unsuccessful in addressing or mitigating technical limitations in our systems our business could be adversely affected 

our products and internal systems rely on software and hardware including software and hardware developed or maintained internally andor by third parties that is highly technical and complex in addition our products and internal systems depend on the ability of such software and hardware to store retrieve process and manage immense amounts of data the software and hardware on which we rely has contained and will in the future contain errors bugs or vulnerabilities and our systems are subject to certain technical limitations that may compromise our ability to meet our objectives some errors bugs or vulnerabilities inherently may be difficult to detect and may only be discovered after the code has been released for external or internal use for example in september 2018 we announced our discovery of a thirdparty cyberattack that exploited a vulnerability in facebooks code to steal user access tokens and access certain profile information from user accounts on facebook errors bugs vulnerabilities design defects or technical limitations within the software and hardware on which we rely have in the past led to and may in the future lead to outcomes including a negative experience for users and marketers who use our products compromised ability of our products to perform in a manner consistent with our terms contracts or policies delayed product introductions or enhancements targeting measurement or billing errors compromised ability to protect the data of our users andor our intellectual property or reductions in our ability to provide some or all of our services for example we make commitments to our users as to how their data will be used within and across our products and our systems are subject to errors bugs and technical limitations that may prevent us from fulfilling these commitments reliably if our systems contain bugs or errors or if we do not properly address or mitigate the technical limitations in our systems we may fail to fulfill our commitments to our users and be subject to regulatory scrutiny or litigation that could harm our business and result in fines damages or other remedies in addition errors bugs vulnerabilities or defects in the software and hardware on which we rely and any associated degradations or interruptions of service have in the past led to and may in the future lead to outcomes including damage to our reputation loss of users loss of marketers loss of revenue regulatory inquiries or liability for damages any of which could adversely affect our business and financial results 

technologies have been developed that can block the display of our ads which could adversely affect our financial results 

technologies have been developed and will likely continue to be developed that can block the display of our ads or block our ad measurement tools particularly for advertising displayed on personal computers we generate substantially all of our revenue from advertising including revenue resulting from the display of ads on personal computers revenue generated from the display of ads on personal computers has been impacted by these technologies from time to time as a result these technologies have had an adverse effect on our financial results and if such technologies continue to proliferate in particular with respect to mobile platforms our future financial results may be harmed 

real or perceived inaccuracies in our community and other metrics may harm our reputation and negatively affect our business 

the numbers for our key metrics which include our facebook metrics daus maus and average revenue per user arpu and family metrics dap map and average revenue per person arpp are calculated using internal company data based on the activity of user accounts while these numbers are based on what we believe to be reasonable estimates of our user base for the applicable period of measurement there are inherent challenges in measuring usage of our products across large online and mobile populations around the world the methodologies used to measure these metrics require significant judgment 

and are also susceptible to algorithm or other technical errors in addition we are continually seeking to improve our estimates of our user base and such estimates may change due to improvements or changes in our methodology we regularly review our processes for calculating these metrics and from time to time we discover inaccuracies in our metrics or make adjustments to improve their accuracy which can result in adjustments to our historical metrics our ability to recalculate our historical metrics may be impacted by data limitations or other factors that require us to apply different methodologies for such adjustments we generally do not intend to update previously disclosed family metrics for any such inaccuracies or adjustments that are within the error margins disclosed below 

in addition our facebook metrics and family metrics estimates will differ from estimates published by third parties due to differences in methodology 

we regularly evaluate our facebook metrics to estimate the number of duplicate and false accounts among our maus a duplicate account is one that a user maintains in addition to his or her principal account we divide false accounts into two categories 1 usermisclassified accounts where users have created personal profiles for a business organization or nonhuman entity such as a pet such entities are permitted on facebook using a page rather than a personal profile under our terms of service and 2 violating accounts which represent user profiles that we believe are intended to be used for purposes that violate our terms of service such as bots and spam the estimates of duplicate and false accounts are based on an internal review of a limited sample of accounts and we apply significant judgment in making this determination for example to identify duplicate accounts we use data signals such as identical ip addresses and similar user names and to identify false accounts we look for names that appear to be fake or other behavior that appears inauthentic to the reviewers any loss of access to data signals we use in this process whether as a result of our own product decisions actions by thirdparty browser or mobile platforms regulatory or legislative requirements or other factors also may impact the stability or accuracy of our estimates of duplicate and false accounts our estimates also may change as our methodologies evolve including through the application of new data signals or technologies or product changes that may allow us to identify previously undetected duplicate or false accounts and may improve our ability to evaluate a broader population of our users duplicate and false accounts are very difficult to measure at our scale and it is possible that the actual number of duplicate and false accounts may vary significantly from our estimates 

in the fourth quarter of 2019 we estimated that duplicate accounts may have represented approximately 11 of our worldwide maus we believe the percentage of duplicate accounts is meaningfully higher in developing markets such as the philippines and vietnam as compared to more developed markets in the fourth quarter of 2019 we estimated that false accounts may have represented approximately 5 of our worldwide maus our estimation of false accounts can vary as a result of episodic spikes in the creation of such accounts which we have seen originate more frequently in specific countries such as indonesia and vietnam from time to time we disable certain user accounts make product changes or take other actions to reduce the number of duplicate or false accounts among our users which may also reduce our dau and mau estimates in a particular period we intend to disclose our estimates of the number of duplicate and false accounts among our maus on an annual basis 

many people in our community have user accounts on more than one of our products and some people have multiple user accounts within an individual product accordingly for our family metrics we do not seek to count the total number of user accounts across our products because we believe that would not reflect the actual size of our community rather our family metrics represent our estimates of the number of unique people using at least one of facebook instagram messenger and whatsapp we do not require people to use a common identifier or link their accounts to use multiple products in our family and therefore must seek to attribute multiple user accounts within and across products to individual people to calculate these metrics we rely upon complex techniques algorithms and machine learning models that seek to count the individual people behind user accounts including by matching multiple user accounts within an individual product and across multiple products when we believe they are attributable to a single person and counting such group of accounts as one person these techniques and models require significant judgment are subject to data and other limitations discussed below and inherently are subject to statistical variances and uncertainties we estimate the potential error in our family metrics primarily based on user survey data which itself is subject to error as well while we expect the error margin for our family metrics to vary from period to period we estimate that such margin generally will be approximately 3 of our worldwide map at our scale it is very difficult to attribute multiple user accounts within and across products to individual people and it is possible that the actual numbers of unique people using our products may vary significantly from our estimates potentially beyond our estimated error margins as a result it is also possible that our family metrics may indicate changes or trends in user numbers that do not match actual changes or trends 

to calculate our estimates of family dap and map we currently use a series of machine learning models that are developed based on internal reviews of limited samples of user accounts and calibrated against user survey data we apply significant judgment in designing these models and calculating these estimates for example to match user accounts within individual products and across multiple products we use data signals such as similar device information ip addresses and user names we also calibrate our models against data from periodic user surveys of varying sizes and frequency across our products which are inherently subject to error in addition our data limitations may affect our understanding of certain details of our business and increase the risk of error for our family metrics estimates our techniques and models rely on a variety of data signals from different products and we rely on more limited data signals for some products compared to others for example as a result of limited visibility into encrypted products we have fewer data signals from whatsapp user accounts and primarily rely on phone numbers and device information to match whatsapp user accounts with accounts on our other products similarly although messenger kids users are included in our family metrics we do not seek to match their accounts with accounts on our other applications for purposes of calculating dap and map any loss of access to data signals we use in our process for calculating family metrics whether as a result of our own product decisions actions by thirdparty browser or mobile platforms regulatory or legislative requirements or other factors also may impact the stability or accuracy of our reported family metrics our estimates of family metrics also may change as our methodologies evolve including through the application of new data signals or technologies product changes or other improvements in our user surveys algorithms or machine learning that may improve our ability to match accounts within and across our products or otherwise evaluate the broad population of our users in addition such evolution may allow us to identify previously undetected violating accounts as defined below 

we regularly evaluate our family metrics to estimate the percentage of our map consisting solely of violating accounts we define violating accounts as accounts which we believe are intended to be used for purposes that violate our terms of service including bots and spam in the fourth quarter of 2019 we estimated that approximately 3 of our worldwide map consisted solely of violating accounts such estimation is based on an internal review of a limited sample of accounts and we apply significant judgment in making this determination for example we look for account information and behaviors associated with facebook and instagram accounts that appear to be inauthentic to the reviewers but we have limited visibility into whatsapp user activity due to encryption in addition if we believe an individual person has one or more violating accounts we do not include such person in our violating accounts estimation as long as we believe they have one account that does not constitute a violating account from time to time we disable certain user accounts make product changes or take other actions to reduce the number of violating accounts among our users which may also reduce our dap and map estimates in a particular period we intend to disclose our estimates of the percentage of our map consisting solely of violating accounts on an annual basis violating accounts are very difficult to measure at our scale and it is possible that the actual number of violating accounts may vary significantly from our estimates 

other data limitations also may affect our understanding of certain details of our business for example while userprovided data indicates a decline in usage among younger users this age data is unreliable because a disproportionate number of our younger users register with an inaccurate age accordingly our understanding of usage by age group may not be complete 

in addition our data regarding the geographic location of our users is estimated based on a number of factors such as the users ip address and selfdisclosed location these factors may not always accurately reflect the users actual location for example a user may appear to be accessing facebook from the location of the proxy server that the user connects to rather than from the users actual location the methodologies used to measure our metrics are also susceptible to algorithm or other technical errors and our estimates for revenue by user location and revenue by user device are also affected by these factors 

in addition from time to time we provide or rely on certain other metrics including those relating to the reach and effectiveness of our ads all of our metrics are subject to software bugs inconsistencies in our systems and human error if marketers developers or investors do not perceive our metrics to be accurate or if we discover material inaccuracies in our metrics we may be subject to liability our reputation may be harmed and marketers and developers may be less willing to allocate their budgets or resources to facebook or our other products which could negatively affect our business and financial results 

we cannot assure you that we will effectively manage our growth 

our employee headcount and the scope and complexity of our business have increased significantly with the number of employees increasing to 44942 as of december 31 2019 from 35587 as of december 31 2018  and we expect such headcount growth to continue for the foreseeable future in addition we plan to continue to hire a number of employees and contractors in order to address various privacy safety security and content review initiatives the growth and expansion of our business 

and products create significant challenges for our management operational and financial resources including managing multiple relationships with users marketers developers and other third parties as our operations and the number of our thirdparty relationships continue to grow our information technology systems or our internal controls and procedures may not be adequate to support such growth in addition some members of our management do not have significant experience managing a large global business operation so our management may not be able to manage such growth effectively to effectively manage our growth we must continue to improve our operational financial and management processes and systems and to effectively expand train and manage our personnel as our organization continues to grow and we are required to implement more complex organizational management structures we may find it increasingly difficult to maintain the benefits of our corporate culture including our ability to quickly develop and launch new and innovative products this could negatively affect our business performance 

the loss of one or more of our key personnel or our failure to attract and retain other highly qualified personnel in the future could harm our business 

we currently depend on the continued services and performance of our key personnel including mark zuckerberg and sheryl k sandberg although we have entered into employment agreements with mr zuckerberg and ms sandberg the agreements have no specific duration and constitute atwill employment in addition many of our key technologies and systems are custommade for our business by our personnel the loss of key personnel including members of management as well as key engineering product development marketing and sales personnel could disrupt our operations and have an adverse effect on our business 

as we continue to grow we cannot guarantee we will continue to attract and retain the personnel we need to maintain our competitive position in particular we intend to continue to hire a significant number of technical personnel in the foreseeable future and we expect to continue to face significant challenges in hiring such personnel particularly in the san francisco bay area where our headquarters are located whether as a result of competition with other companies challenges due to the high cost of living facilities and infrastructure constraints or other factors as we continue to mature the incentives to attract retain and motivate employees provided by our equity awards or by future arrangements may not be as effective as in the past and if we issue significant equity to attract additional employees or to retain our existing employees we would incur substantial additional sharebased compensation expense and the ownership of our existing stockholders would be further diluted our ability to attract retain and motivate employees may also be adversely affected by stock price volatility as a result of these factors it may be difficult for us to continue to retain and motivate our employees if we do not succeed in attracting hiring and integrating excellent personnel or retaining and motivating existing personnel we may be unable to grow effectively 

we may not be able to continue to successfully maintain or grow usage of and engagement with mobile and web applications that integrate with facebook and our other products 

we have made and are continuing to make investments to enable developers to build grow and monetize mobile and web applications that integrate with facebook and our other products such existing and prospective developers may not be successful in building growing or monetizing mobile andor web applications that create and maintain user engagement additionally developers may choose to build on other platforms including mobile platforms controlled by third parties rather than building products that integrate with facebook and our other products we are continuously seeking to balance the distribution objectives of our developers with our desire to provide an optimal user experience and we may not be successful in achieving a balance that continues to attract and retain such developers for example from time to time we have taken actions to reduce the volume of communications from these developers to users on facebook and our other products with the objective of enhancing the user experience and such actions have reduced distribution from user engagement with and our monetization opportunities from mobile and web applications integrated with our products in addition as part of our efforts related to privacy safety and security we are conducting investigations and audits of a large number of platform applications and we also have announced several product changes that restrict developer access to certain user data in some instances these actions as well as other actions to enforce our policies applicable to developers have adversely affected or will adversely affect our relationships with developers if we are not successful in our efforts to maintain or grow the number of developers that choose to build products that integrate with facebook and our other products or if we are unable to continue to build and maintain good relations with such developers our user growth and user engagement and our financial results may be adversely affected 

payment transactions may subject us to additional regulatory requirements and other risks that could be costly and difficult to comply with or that could harm our business 

our users can purchase virtual and digital goods from developers that offer applications using our payments infrastructure on the facebook website in addition certain of our users can use our payments infrastructure including on messenger for other activities such as sending money to other users and making donations to certain charitable organizations we are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the united states europe and elsewhere including those governing antimoney laundering and counterterrorist financing money transmission gift cards and other prepaid access instruments electronic funds transfer charitable fundraising and import and export restrictions depending on how our payments product evolves we may also be subject to other laws and regulations including those governing gambling banking and lending in some jurisdictions the application or interpretation of these laws and regulations is not clear to increase flexibility in how our use of payments may evolve and to mitigate regulatory uncertainty we have received certain money transmitter licenses in the united states and an electronic money emoney license that allows us to conduct certain regulated payment activities in the participating member countries of the european economic area which will generally require us to demonstrate compliance with many domestic and foreign laws in these areas our efforts to comply with these laws and regulations could be costly and result in diversion of management time and effort and may still not guarantee compliance in the event that we are found to be in violation of any such legal or regulatory requirements we may be subject to monetary fines or other penalties such as a cease and desist order or we may be required to make product changes any of which could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results 

in addition we may be subject to a variety of additional risks as a result of payments transactions including increased costs and diversion of management time and effort and other resources to deal with bad transactions or customer disputes potential fraudulent or otherwise illegal activity by users developers employees or third parties restrictions on the investment of consumer funds used to transact payments and additional disclosure and reporting requirements we also intend to launch certain payments functionality on whatsapp and have announced plans to develop digital payments products and services which may subject us to many of the foregoing risks and additional licensing requirements 

our participation in the libra association will subject us to significant regulatory scrutiny and other risks that could adversely affect our business reputation or financial results 

  

in june 2019 we announced our participation in the libra association which will oversee a proposed digital payments system powered by blockchain technology and our plans for calibra a digital wallet for libra which we expect to launch in messenger whatsapp and as a standalone application 

  

libra is based on relatively new and unproven technology and the laws and regulations surrounding blockchainbased payments are uncertain and evolving libra has drawn significant scrutiny from governments and regulators in multiple jurisdictions and we expect that scrutiny to continue as a primary sponsor of the initiative we are participating in responses to inquiries from governments and regulators and adverse government or regulatory actions or negative publicity resulting from such participation may adversely affect our reputation and harm our business 

as this initiative evolves we may be subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the united states and international jurisdictions including those governing payments financial services antimoney laundering counterterrorism financing economic sanctions data protection tax and competition in many jurisdictions the application or interpretation of these laws and regulations is not clear particularly with respect to evolving laws and regulations that are applied to blockchain and digital payments these laws and regulations as well as any associated inquiries or investigations may delay or impede the launch of the libra currency as well as the development of our products and services increase our operating costs require significant management time and attention or otherwise harm our business 

in addition market acceptance of such currency is subject to significant uncertainty as such there can be no assurance that libra or our associated products and services will be made available in a timely manner or at all we do not have significant prior experience with blockchainbased payments technology which may adversely affect our ability to successfully develop and market these products and services we will also incur increased costs in connection with our participation in the libra association and the development and marketing of associated products and services and our investments may not be successful any of these events could adversely affect our business reputation or financial results 

we have significant international operations and plan to continue expanding our operations abroad where we have more limited operating experience and this may subject us to increased business and economic risks that could affect our financial results 

we have significant international operations and plan to continue the international expansion of our business operations and the translation of our products we currently make facebook available in more than 100 different languages and we have offices or data centers in more than 30 different countries we may enter new international markets where we have limited or no experience in marketing selling and deploying our products our products are generally available globally but some or all of our products or functionality may not be available in certain markets due to legal and regulatory complexities for example facebook and certain of our other products are not generally available in china we also outsource certain operational functions to thirdparty vendors globally if we fail to deploy manage or oversee our international operations successfully our business may suffer in addition we are subject to a variety of risks inherent in doing business internationally including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

if we are unable to expand internationally and manage the complexity of our global operations successfully our financial results could be adversely affected 

we face design manufacturing and supply chain risks that if not properly managed could adversely impact our financial results 

we face a number of risks related to design manufacturing and supply chain management with respect to our consumer hardware products for example the consumer hardware products we sell may have quality issues resulting from the design or manufacture of the products or from the software used in the products sometimes these issues may be caused by components we purchase from other manufacturers or suppliers if the quality of our consumer hardware products does not meet our customers expectations or such products are found to be defective then our brand and financial results could be adversely affected 

we rely on third parties to manufacture and manage the logistics of transporting and distributing our consumer hardware products we may experience supply shortages or other disruptions in logistics or the supply chain in the future that could result in shipping delays and negatively impact our operations we could be negatively affected if we are not able to engage third parties with the necessary capabilities or capacity on reasonable terms or if those we engage with fail to meet their obligations whether due to financial difficulties or other reasons or make adverse changes in the pricing or other material terms of such arrangements with them the manufacturing and sale of our consumer hardware products also may be negatively impacted by geopolitical challenges trade disputes or other actions by governments that subject us to supply shortages increased costs or supply chain disruptions 

we also require the suppliers and business partners of our consumer hardware products to comply with laws and certain company policies regarding sourcing practices and standards on labor health and safety the environment and business ethics but we do not control them or their practices and standards if any of them violates laws fails to implement changes in accordance with newly enacted laws or implements practices or standards regarded as unethical corrupt or noncompliant we could experience supply chain disruptions government action or fines canceled orders or damage to our reputation 

we face inventory risk with respect to our consumer hardware products 

we are exposed to inventory risks with respect to our consumer hardware products as a result of rapid changes in product cycles and pricing unsafe or defective merchandise changes in consumer demand and consumer spending patterns changes in consumer tastes with respect to our consumer hardware products and other factors we endeavor to accurately predict these trends and avoid overstocking or understocking consumer hardware products we may sell demand for products however can change significantly between the time inventory or components are ordered and the date of sale in addition when we begin selling or manufacturing a new consumer hardware product it may be difficult to establish vendor relationships determine appropriate product or component selection and accurately forecast demand the acquisition of certain types of inventory or components may require significant leadtime and prepayment and they may not be returnable any one of these factors may adversely affect our operating results 

we may have exposure to greater than anticipated tax liabilities 

our tax obligations including income and nonincome taxes are based in part on our corporate operating structure and intercompany arrangements including the manner in which we operate our business develop value manage protect and use our intellectual property and the valuations of our intercompany transactions the tax laws applicable to our business including the laws of the united states and other jurisdictions are subject to interpretation and certain jurisdictions are aggressively interpreting their laws in new ways in an effort to raise additional tax revenue from companies such as facebook we are subject to regular review and audit by us federal state and foreign tax authorities tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken including our methodologies for valuing developed technology or intercompany arrangements and any adverse outcome of such a review or audit could increase our worldwide effective tax rate increase the amount of nonincome taxes imposed on our business and harm our financial position results of operations and cash flows for example in 2016 and 2018 the irs issued formal assessments relating to transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries in conjunction with the examination of the 2010 through 2013 tax years although we disagree with the irss position and are contesting this issue the ultimate resolution is uncertain and if resolved in a manner unfavorable to us may adversely affect our financial results 

the determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires significant judgment by management and there are many transactions where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain our provision for income taxes is determined by the manner in which we operate our business and any changes to such operations or laws applicable to such operations may affect our effective tax rate although we believe that our provision for income taxes and estimates of our nonincome tax liabilities are reasonable the ultimate settlement may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements 

and may materially affect our financial results in the period or periods for which such determination is made 

our future income tax rates could be volatile and difficult to predict due to changes in jurisdictional profit split changes in the amount and recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities or by changes in tax laws regulations or accounting principles 

changes in tax laws or tax rulings could materially affect our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

the tax regimes we are subject to or operate under including income and nonincome taxes are unsettled and may be subject to significant change changes in tax laws or tax rulings or changes in interpretations of existing laws could materially affect our financial position results of operations and cash flows for example the 2017 tax cuts and jobs act tax act enacted in december 2017 had a significant impact on our tax obligations and effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2017 and the issuance of additional regulatory or accounting guidance related to the tax act could materially affect our tax obligations and effective tax rate in the period issued in addition a threejudge panel from the ninth circuit court of appeals issued a decision in altera corp v commissioner regarding the treatment of sharebased compensation expense in a cost sharing arrangement which had a material effect on our tax obligations and effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2019 as the taxpayer may appeal the decision to the supreme court of the united states the final outcome of the case is uncertain and could have a material effect on our tax obligations and effective tax rate in future quarters in addition many countries in europe as well as a number of other countries and organizations have recently proposed or recommended changes to existing tax laws or have enacted new laws that could significantly increase our tax obligations in many countries where we do business or require us to change the manner in which we operate our business 

the organization for economic cooperation and development has been working on a base erosion and profit shifting project and issued a report in 2015 an interim report in 2018 and is expected to continue to issue guidelines and proposals that may change various aspects of the existing framework under which our tax obligations are determined in many of the countries in which we do business similarly the european commission and several countries have issued proposals that would change various aspects of the current tax framework under which we are taxed these proposals include changes to the existing framework to calculate income tax as well as proposals to change or impose new types of nonincome taxes including taxes based on a percentage of revenue for example several countries have proposed or enacted taxes applicable to digital services which includes business activities on social media platforms and online marketplaces and would likely apply to our business 

the european commission has conducted investigations in multiple countries focusing on whether local country tax rulings or tax legislation provides preferential tax treatment that violates european union state aid rules and concluded that certain countries including ireland have provided illegal state aid in certain cases these investigations may result in changes to the tax treatment of our foreign operations 

due to the large and expanding scale of our international business activities many of these types of changes to the taxation of our activities described above could increase our worldwide effective tax rate increase the amount of nonincome taxes imposed on our business and harm our financial position results of operations and cash flows such changes may also apply retroactively to our historical operations and result in taxes greater than the amounts estimated and recorded in our financial statements 

we cannot guarantee that our share repurchase program will be fully consummated or that it will enhance longterm stockholder value share repurchases could also increase the volatility of the trading price of our stock and will diminish our cash reserves 

although our board of directors has authorized a share repurchase program that commenced in 2017 and does not have an expiration date the program does not obligate us to repurchase any specific dollar amount or to acquire any specific number of shares of our class a common stock we cannot guarantee that the program will be fully consummated or that it will enhance longterm stockholder value the program could affect the trading price of our stock and increase volatility and any announcement of a termination of this program may result in a decrease in the trading price of our stock in addition this program will diminish our cash reserves 

risks related to ownership of our class a common stock 

the trading price of our class a common stock has been and will likely continue to be volatile 

the trading price of our class a common stock has been and is likely to continue to be volatile since shares of our class a common stock were sold in our initial public offering in may 2012 at a price of 3800 per share our stock price has ranged from 1755 to 21862 through december 31 2019  in addition to the factors discussed in this annual report on form 10k the trading price of our class a common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to numerous factors many of which are beyond our control including 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in addition the stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many technology companies stock prices of many technology companies have fluctuated in a manner unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies we are currently subject to securities litigation in connection with our platform and user data practices and the misuse of certain data by a developer that shared such data with third parties in violation of our terms and policies as well as the disclosure of our earnings results for the second quarter of 2018 we may experience more such litigation following future periods of volatility any securities litigation could subject us to substantial costs divert resources and the attention of management from our business and adversely affect our business 

we do not intend to pay cash dividends for the foreseeable future 

we have never declared or paid cash dividends on our capital stock we currently intend to retain any future earnings to finance the operation and expansion of our business and fund our share repurchase program and we do not expect to declare or pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future as a result you may only receive a return on your investment in our class a common stock if the trading price of your shares increases 

the dual class structure of our common stock and a voting agreement between certain stockholders have the effect of concentrating voting control with our ceo and certain other holders of our class b common stock this will limit or preclude your ability to influence corporate matters 

our class b common stock has ten votes per share and our class a common stock has one vote per share stockholders who hold shares of class b common stock including certain of our executive officers employees and directors and their affiliates together hold a substantial majority of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock because of the tentoone voting ratio between our class b and class a common stock the holders of our class b common stock collectively control a majority of the combined voting power of our common stock and therefore are able to control all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval so long as the shares of class b common stock represent at least 91 of all outstanding shares of our class a and class b common stock this concentrated control will limit or preclude your ability to influence corporate matters for the foreseeable future 

transfers by holders of class b common stock will generally result in those shares converting to class a common stock subject to limited exceptions such as certain transfers effected for estate planning or charitable purposes the conversion of class b common stock to class a common stock will have the effect over time of increasing the relative voting power of those holders of class b common stock who retain their shares in the long term if for example mr zuckerberg retains a significant portion of his holdings of class b common stock for an extended period of time he could in the future continue to control a majority of the combined voting power of our outstanding capital stock 

our status as a controlled company could make our class a common stock less attractive to some investors or otherwise harm our stock price 

because we qualify as a controlled company under the corporate governance rules for nasdaqlisted companies we are not required to have a majority of our board of directors be independent nor are we required to have a compensation committee or an independent nominating function in the future we could elect not to have a majority of our board of directors be independent or not to have a compensation committee or an independent nominating function accordingly should the interests of our controlling stockholder differ from those of other stockholders the other stockholders may not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the corporate governance rules for nasdaqlisted companies our status as a controlled company could make our class a common stock less attractive to some investors or otherwise harm our stock price 

delaware law and provisions in our restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws could make a merger tender offer or proxy contest difficult thereby depressing the trading price of our class a common stock 

our status as a delaware corporation and the antitakeover provisions of the delaware general corporation law may discourage delay or prevent a change in control by prohibiting us from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years after the person becomes an interested stockholder even if a change of control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders in addition our current restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that may make the acquisition of our company more difficult including the following

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

tableend 

you should read the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data of this annual report on form 10k in addition to our historical consolidated financial information the following discussion contains forwardlooking statements that reflect our plans estimates and beliefs our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forwardlooking statements factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k particularly in part i item 1a risk factors for a discussion of limitations in the measurement of certain of our community metrics see the section entitled limitations of key metrics and other data in this annual report on form 10k 

certain revenue information in the section entitled  — revenue — foreign exchange impact on revenue is presented on a constant currency basis this information is a nongaap financial measure to calculate revenue on a constant currency basis we translated revenue for the full year 2019 using 2018 monthly exchange rates for our settlement or billing currencies other than the us dollar this nongaap financial measure is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for or superior to financial information prepared and presented in accordance with gaap this measure may be different from non‑gaap financial measures used by other companies limiting its usefulness for comparison purposes moreover presentation of revenue on a constant currency basis is provided for yearoveryear comparison purposes and investors should be cautioned that the effect of changing foreign currency exchange rates has an actual effect on our operating results we believe this nongaap financial measure provides investors with useful supplemental information about the financial performance of our business enables comparison of financial results between periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance and allows for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in operating our business 

executive overview of full year 2019 results 

our key community metrics and financial results for 2019 are as follows 

community growth 

 

financial results 

 

in 2019  we continued to focus on our main revenue growth priorities i helping marketers use our products to connect with consumers where they are and ii making our ads more relevant and effective 

we invested based on the following company priorities that we believe will further our mission to give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together i continue making progress on the major social issues facing the internet and our company including privacy safety and security ii build new experiences that meaningfully improve peoples lives today and set the stage for even bigger improvements in the future iii keep building our business by supporting the millions of businesses that rely on our services to grow and create jobs and iv communicate more transparently about what were doing and the role our services play in the world we intend to continue to invest based on these priorities and we anticipate that additional investments in our data center capacity network infrastructure and office facilities as well as scaling our headcount to support our growth will continue to drive expense growth in 2020 

trends in our facebook user metrics 

the numbers for our key facebook metrics our daus maus and average revenue per user arpu do not include users on instagram whatsapp or our other products unless they would otherwise qualify as daus or maus respectively based on their other activities on facebook 

trends in the number of users affect our revenue and financial results by influencing the number of ads we are able to show the value of our ads to marketers the volume of payments transactions as well as our expenses and capital expenditures substantially all of our daily and monthly active users as defined below access facebook on mobile devices 

 

note for purposes of reporting daus maus and arpu by geographic region europe includes all users in russia and turkey and rest of world includes all users in africa latin america and the middle east 

worldwide daus increased 9 to 166 billion on average during december 2019 from 152 billion during december 2018  users in india indonesia and the philippines represented key sources of growth in daus during december 2019  relative to the same period in 2018  

 

as of december 31 2019  we had 250 billion maus an increase of 8 from december 31 2018  users in india indonesia and the philippines represented key sources of growth in 2019  relative to the same period in 2018  

trends in our monetization by facebook user geography 

we calculate our revenue by facebook user geography based on our estimate of the geography in which ad impressions are delivered virtual and digital goods are purchased or consumer hardware devices are shipped we define arpu as our total revenue in a given geography during a given quarter divided by the average of the number of maus in the geography at the beginning and end of the quarter while arpu includes all sources of revenue the number of maus used in this calculation only includes users of facebook and messenger as described in the definition of mau above the share of revenue from users who are not also facebook or messenger maus was not material the geography of our users affects our revenue and financial results because we currently monetize users in different geographies at different average rates our revenue and arpu in regions such as united states  canada and europe are relatively higher primarily due to the size and maturity of those online and mobile advertising markets for example arpu in 2019 in the united states  canada region was more than 11 times higher than in the asiapacific region 

note our revenue by facebook user geography in the charts above is geographically apportioned based on our estimation of the geographic location of our facebook users when they perform a revenuegenerating activity this allocation differs from our revenue disaggregated by geography disclosure in our consolidated financial statements where revenue is geographically apportioned based on the billing address of the customer 

our annual worldwide arpu in 2019 which represents the sum of quarterly arpu during such period was 2925  an increase of 17 from 2018  over this period arpu increased by 24 in the united states  canada 20 in europe 18 in asia‑pacific and 16 in rest of world in addition user growth was more rapid in geographies with relatively lower arpu such as asia‑pacific and rest of world we expect that user growth in the future will be primarily concentrated in those regions where arpu is relatively lower such that worldwide arpu may continue to increase at a slower rate relative to arpu in any geographic region or potentially decrease even if arpu increases in each geographic region 

trends in our family metrics 

  

the numbers for our key family metrics our dap map and average revenue per person arpp do not include users on our other products unless they would otherwise qualify as map or dap respectively based on their other activities on our family products 

  

trends in the number of people in our community affect our revenue and financial results by influencing the number of ads we are able to show the value of our ads to marketers the volume of payments transactions as well as our expenses and capital expenditures substantially all of our daily and monthly active people as defined below access our family products on mobile devices 

 

note we report the numbers of dap and map as specific amounts but these numbers are estimates of the numbers of unique people using our products and are subject to statistical variances and errors while we expect the error margin for these estimates to vary from period to period we estimate that such margin generally will be approximately 3 of our worldwide map at our scale it is very difficult to attribute multiple user accounts within and across products to individual people and it is possible that the actual numbers of unique people using our products may vary significantly from our estimates potentially beyond our estimated error margins for additional information see the section entitled limitations of key metrics and other data in this annual report on form 10k 

worldwide dap increased 11 to 226 billion on average during december 2019 from 203 billion during december 2018 

 

note we report the numbers of dap and map as specific amounts but these numbers are estimates of the numbers of unique people using our products and are subject to statistical variances and errors while we expect the error margin for these estimates to vary from period to period we estimate that such margin generally will be approximately 3 of our worldwide map at our scale it is very difficult to attribute multiple user accounts within and across products to individual people and it is possible that the actual numbers of unique people using our products may vary significantly from our estimates potentially beyond our estimated error margins for additional information see the section entitled limitations of key metrics and other data in this annual report on form 10k 

as of december 31 2019 we had 289 billion map an increase of 9 from 264 billion as of december 31 2018 

 

our annual worldwide arpp in 2019 which represents the sum of quarterly arpp during such period was  2557  an increase of 14 from 2018 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with us gaap the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue costs and expenses and related disclosures we evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis our estimates are based on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances our actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made if different estimates reasonably could have been used or if changes in the estimate that are reasonably possible could materially impact the financial statements we believe that the assumptions and estimates associated with income taxes loss contingencies and valuation of longlived assets including goodwill and intangible assets and their associated estimated useful lives have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements therefore we consider these to be our critical accounting policies and estimates for further information on all of our significant accounting policies see note 1—summary of significant accounting policies in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data of this annual report on form 10k 

income taxes 

we are subject to income taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes and income tax assets and liabilities including evaluating uncertainties in the application of accounting principles and complex tax laws 

we record a provision for income taxes for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations using the asset and liability method under this method we recognize deferred income tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities as well as for loss and tax credit carryforwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the tax rates that are expected to apply to taxable income for the years in which those tax assets and liabilities are expected to be realized or settled we recognize the deferred income tax effects of a change in tax rates in the period of the enactment 

we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the net amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized we consider all available evidence both positive and negative including historical levels of income expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance 

we recognize tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if we believe that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position these uncertain tax positions include our estimates for transfer pricing that have been developed based upon analyses of appropriate armslength prices similarly our estimates related to uncertain tax positions concerning research tax credits are based on an assessment of whether our available documentation corroborating the nature of our activities supporting the tax credits will be sufficient although we believe that we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions including net interest and penalties we can provide no assurance that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be materially different we make adjustments to these reserves in accordance with the income tax accounting guidance when facts and circumstances change such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts recorded such differences will affect the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made and could have a material impact on our financial condition and operating results 

loss contingencies 

we are involved in legal proceedings claims and regulatory tax or government inquiries and investigations that arise in the ordinary course of business certain of these matters include speculative claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts of damages we evaluate the associated developments on a regular basis and accrue a liability when we believe that it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated if we determine there is a reasonable possibility that we may incur a loss and the loss or range of loss can be estimated we disclose the possible loss in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements to the extent material 

we review the developments in our contingencies that could affect the amount of the provisions that have been previously recorded and the matters and related reasonably possible losses disclosed we make adjustments to our provisions and changes to our disclosures accordingly to reflect the impact of negotiations settlements rulings advice of legal counsel and updated information significant judgment is required to determine both the probability of loss and the estimated amount of loss 

the outcome of these matters is inherently uncertain therefore if one or more of these matters were resolved against us for amounts in excess of managements expectations our results of operations and financial condition including in a particular reporting period in which any such outcome becomes probable and estimable could be materially adversely affected see note 11—commitments and contingencies and note 14—income taxes of the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data and part i item 3 legal proceedings of this annual report on form 10k for additional information regarding these contingencies 

valuation of longlived assets including goodwill intangible assets and estimated useful lives 

we allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired liabilities assumed and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values the excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill such valuations require management to make significant estimates and assumptions especially with respect to intangible assets significant estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from acquired users acquired technology and trade names from a market participant perspective useful lives and discount rates managements estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and as a result actual results may differ from estimates allocation of purchase consideration to identifiable assets and liabilities affects our amortization expense as acquired finitelived intangible assets are amortized over the useful life whereas any indefinite lived intangible assets including goodwill are not amortized during the measurement period which is not to exceed one year from the acquisition date we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill upon the conclusion of the measurement period any subsequent adjustments are recorded to earnings 

we review goodwill for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances would more likely than not reduce the fair value of our single reporting unit below its carrying value as of december 31 2019  no impairment of goodwill has been identified 

longlived assets including property and equipment and intangible assets are reviewed for possible impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable the evaluation is performed at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities recoverability of these assets is measured by a comparison of the carrying amounts to the future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate from the use and eventual disposition if such review indicates that the carrying amount of property and equipment and intangible assets is not recoverable the carrying amount of such assets is reduced to fair value we have not recorded any significant impairment charges during the years presented 

the useful lives of our longlived assets including property and equipment and finitelived intangible assets are determined by management when those assets are initially recognized and are routinely reviewed for the remaining estimated useful lives the current estimate of useful lives represents our best estimate based on current facts and circumstances but may differ from the actual useful lives due to changes in future circumstances such as changes to our business operations changes in the planned use of assets and technological advancements when we change the estimated useful life assumption for any asset the remaining carrying amount of the asset is accounted for prospectively and depreciated or amortized over the revised estimated useful life historically changes in useful lives have not resulted in material changes to our depreciation and amortization expense 

components of results of operations 

revenue 

advertising we generate substantially all of our revenue from advertising our advertising revenue is generated by displaying ad products on facebook instagram messenger and thirdparty affiliated websites or mobile applications marketers pay for ad products either directly or through their relationships with advertising agencies or resellers based on the number of impressions delivered or the number of actions such as clicks taken by users 

we recognize revenue from the display of impressionbased ads in the contracted period in which the impressions are delivered impressions are considered delivered when an ad is displayed to a user we recognize revenue from the delivery of actionbased ads in the period in which a user takes the action the marketer contracted for the number of ads we show is subject to methodological changes as we continue to evolve our ads business and the structure of our ads products we calculate price per ad as total ad revenue divided by the number of ads delivered representing the effective price paid per impression by a marketer regardless of their desired objective such as impression or action for advertising revenue arrangements where we are not the principal we recognize revenue on a net basis 

other revenue other revenue consists of revenue from the delivery of consumer hardware devices and net fees we receive from developers using our payments infrastructure as well as revenue from various other sources 

cost of revenue and operating expenses 

cost of revenue our cost of revenue consists primarily of expenses associated with the delivery and distribution of our products these include expenses related to the operation of our data centers and technical infrastructure such as facility and server equipment depreciation salaries benefits and sharebased compensation for employees on our operations teams and energy and bandwidth costs cost of revenue also includes costs associated with partner arrangements including traffic acquisition and content acquisition costs credit card and other transaction fees related to processing customer transactions and cost of consumer hardware devices sold 

research and development research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits sharebased compensation and facilitiesrelated costs for employees on our engineering and technical teams who are responsible for building new products as well as improving existing products we currently expense all of our research and development costs as they are incurred 

marketing and sales marketing and sales expenses consist of salaries and benefits and sharebased compensation for our employees engaged in sales sales support marketing business development and customer service functions our marketing and sales expenses also include marketing and promotional expenditures and professional services such as content reviewers to support our community and product operations 

general and administrative general and administrative expenses consist of legalrelated costs salaries and benefits and sharebased compensation for certain of our executives as well as our legal finance human resources corporate communications and policy and other administrative employees and professional services 

results of operations 

in this section we discuss the results of our operations for the year ended december 31 2019 compared to the year ended december 31 2018 for a discussion of the year ended december 31 2018 compared to the year ended december 31 2017 please refer to part ii item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in our annual report on form 10k for the year ended december 31 2018

revenue 



  

2019 compared to 2018  revenue in 2019 increased 1486 billion  or 27  compared to 2018  the increase was almost entirely due to an increase in advertising revenue as a result of an increase in the number of ads delivered partially offset by a slight decrease in the average price per ad 

in 2019  the number of ads delivered increased by 33  as compared with approximately 22 in 2018  the increase in the ads delivered was driven by an increase in the number and frequency of ads displayed across our products and an increase in users and their engagement in 2019  the average price per ad decreased by 5  as compared with an increase of approximately 13 in 2018  the decrease in average price per ad was primarily driven by an increasing proportion of the number of ads delivered as stories ads and in geographies that monetize at lower rates we anticipate that future advertising revenue growth will be determined by a combination of the number of ads delivered and price 

advertising spending is traditionally seasonally strong in the fourth quarter of each year we believe that this seasonality in advertising spending affects our quarterly results which generally reflect significant growth in advertising revenue between the third and fourth quarters and a decline in advertising spending between the fourth and subsequent first quarters for instance our advertising revenue increased 19 23 and 26 between the third and fourth quarters of 2019  2018  and 2017  respectively while advertising revenue for both the first quarters of 2019 and 2018 declined 10 and 8 compared to the fourth quarters of 2018 and 2017  respectively 

no customer represented 10 or more of total revenue during the years ended december 31 2019  2018  and 2017  

foreign exchange impact on revenue 

the general strengthening of the us dollar relative to certain foreign currencies in the full year 2019 compared to the same period in 2018  had an unfavorable impact on revenue if we had translated revenue for the full year 2019 using the prior years monthly exchange rates for our settlement or billing currencies other than the us dollar our total revenue and advertising revenue would have been 7237 billion and 7132 billion  respectively using these constant rates total revenue and advertising revenue would have been 167 billion and 166 billion  respectively higher than actual total revenue and advertising revenue for the full year 2019  and 1653 billion and 1631 billion higher than actual total revenue and advertising revenue respectively for the full year 2018  

cost of revenue 



  

2019 compared to 2018  cost of revenue in 2019 increased 342 billion  or 37  compared to 2018  the increase was mostly due to an increase in operational expenses related to our data centers and technical infrastructure as well as higher cost of consumer hardware devices sold and traffic acquisition costs 

in 2020  we anticipate that the cost of revenue will increase as we continue to expand our data center capacity and technical infrastructure to support user growth increased user engagement and the delivery of new products and services and to a lesser extent due to higher costs associated with various partner arrangements 

research and development 



  

2019 compared to 2018  research and development expenses in 2019 increased 333 billion  or 32  compared to 2018  the increase was primarily due to increases in payroll and benefits expenses and facilitiesrelated costs as a result of a 31 growth in employee headcount from december 31 2018 to december 31 2019 in engineering and other technical functions 

in 2020  we plan to continue to hire software engineers and other technical employees and to increase our investment to support our research and development initiatives 

marketing and sales 



  

2019 compared to 2018  marketing and sales expenses in 2019 increased 203 billion  or 26  compared to 2018  the increase was primarily driven by increases in marketing expenses payroll and benefits expenses and community and product operations expenses our payroll and benefits expenses increased as a result of a 23 increase in employee headcount from december 31 2018 to december 31 2019 in our marketing and sales functions 

in 2020  we anticipate that marketing expense will increase and plan to continue the hiring of marketing and sales employees to support our marketing sales and partnership efforts and to increase our investment in community and product operations to support our security efforts 

general and administrative 



  

2019 compared to 2018  general and administrative expenses in 2019 increased 701 billion  or 203  compared to 2018  the majority of the increase was due to the 50 billion ftc settlement expense recorded in the first six months of 2019 in addition other general and administrative expense increased in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily due to an increase in other legalrelated costs and higher payroll and benefits expenses as a result of a 31 increase in employee headcount from december 31 2018 to december 31 2019 in our general and administrative functions 

in 2020  we plan to continue to increase general and administrative expenses to support overall company growth 

interest and other income net 



  

2019 compared to 2018  interest and other income net in 2019 increased 378 million compared to 2018  the increase was due to an increase in interest income driven by higher investment balances and interest rates and a decrease in other expense as a result of lower foreign exchange losses as compared to 2018 due to foreign currency transactions and remeasurement 

provision for income taxes 



  

2019 compared to 2018  our provision for income taxes in 2019 increased 308 billion  or 95  compared to 2018  a majority of which is due to an increase in income taxes from the altera ninth circuit opinion discussed below an increase in income from operations prior to the effect of the legal accrual related to the ftc settlement that is not expected to be taxdeductible and a decrease in excess tax benefits recognized from sharebased compensation 

our effective tax rate in 2019 increased compared to 2018 primarily due to an increase in income taxes from the altera ninth circuit opinion the legal accrual related to the ftc settlement that is not expected to be taxdeductible and a decrease in excess tax benefits recognized from sharebased compensation 

on july 27 2015 the united states tax court issued a decision tax court decision in altera corp v commissioner  which concluded that related parties in a cost sharing arrangement are not required to share expenses related to sharebased compensation the tax court decision was appealed by the commissioner to the ninth circuit court of appeals ninth circuit 

on june 7 2019 the ninth circuit issued an opinion  altera ninth circuit opinion that reversed the tax court decision based on the altera ninth circuit opinion we recorded a cumulative income tax expense of 111 billion in the second quarter of 2019 on july 22 2019 the taxpayer requested a rehearing before the full ninth circuit and the request was denied on november 12 2019 the taxpayer has until february 10 2020 to request a hearing before the supreme court of the united states as a result the final outcome of the case is uncertain in november 2019 we made a 164 billion payment related to this matter and recorded the payment to net against the tax liability included within other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets if the altera ninth circuit opinion is reversed we would anticipate recording an income tax benefit at that time 

effective tax rate items  our effective tax rate in the future will depend upon the proportion of our income before provision for income taxes earned in the united states and in jurisdictions with a tax rate lower than the us statutory rate as well as a number of other factors including excess tax benefits from sharebased compensation tax effects of integrating intellectual property from acquisitions settlement of tax contingency items tax effects of changes in our business and the impact of changes in tax law 

the proportion of our income before provision for income taxes earned in jurisdictions with a tax rate lower than the us statutory rate will depend upon the proportion of revenue and costs associated with the respective jurisdictions 

the accounting for sharebased compensation may increase or decrease our effective tax rate based upon the difference between our sharebased compensation expense and the deductions taken on our tax return which depends upon the stock price at the time of employee award vesting if our stock price remains constant to the january 23 2020 price we expect our effective tax rate for 2020 will be in the highteens the range reflects expected effects from a transfer of intellectual property rights between facebook entities that we anticipate implementing in 2020 

integrating intellectual property from acquisitions into our business generally involves intercompany transactions that have the impact of increasing our provision for income taxes consequently our provision for income taxes and our effective tax rate may initially increase in the period of an acquisition and integration the magnitude of this impact will depend upon the specific type size and taxing jurisdictions of the intellectual property as well as the relative contribution to income in subsequent periods 

unrecognized tax benefits as of december 31 2019  we had net unrecognized tax benefits of 374 billion which were accrued as other liabilities these unrecognized tax benefits were predominantly accrued for uncertainties related to transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries which includes licensing of intellectual property providing services and other transactions as well as for uncertainties with our research tax credits the ultimate settlement of the liabilities will depend upon resolution of tax audits litigation or events that would otherwise change the assessment of such items based upon the status of litigation described below and the current status of tax audits in various jurisdictions we do not anticipate a material change to such amounts within the next 12 months 

in july 2016 we received a statutory notice of deficiency notice from the irs related to transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries in conjunction with the examination of the 2010 tax year while the notice applies only to the 2010 tax year the irs stated that it will also apply its position for tax years subsequent to 2010 we do not agree with the position of the irs and have filed a petition in the tax court challenging the notice the case is scheduled for trial beginning in february 2020 on january 15 2020 the irs filed its pretrial memorandum in the case stating that it planned to assert at trial an adjustment that is higher than the adjustment stated in the notice the irs did not provide any information about how it intends to apply the revised adjustment to future years based on the information provided we believe that if the irs prevails in its updated position this could result in an additional federal tax liability of an estimated aggregate amount of up to approximately 90 billion in excess of the amounts in our originally filed us return plus interest and any penalties asserted 

in march 2018 we received a second notice from the irs in conjunction with the examination of our 2011 through 2013 tax years the irs applied its position from the 2010 tax year to each of these years and also proposed new adjustments related to other transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries and certain tax credits that we claimed if the irs prevails in its position for these new adjustments this could result in an additional federal tax liability of up to approximately 680 million in excess of the amounts in our originally filed us returns plus interest and any penalties asserted we do not agree with the positions of the irs in the second notice and have filed a petition in the tax court challenging the second notice 

we have previously accrued an estimated unrecognized tax benefit consistent with the guidance in asc 740 income taxes  that is lower than the potential additional federal tax liability from the positions taken by the irs in the two notices and its pretrial memorandum in addition if the irs prevails in its positions related to transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries the additional tax that we would owe would be partially offset by a reduction in the tax that we owe under the mandatory transition 

tax on accumulated foreign earnings from the 2017 tax cuts and jobs act tax act as of december 31 2019  we have not resolved these matters and proceedings continue in the tax court 

we believe that adequate amounts have been reserved in accordance with asc 740 income taxes for any adjustments to the provision for income taxes or other tax items that may ultimately result from these examinations the timing of the resolution settlement and closure of any audits is highly uncertain and it is reasonably possible that the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits could significantly change in the next 12 months given the number of years remaining that are subject to examination in various jurisdictions we are unable to estimate the full range of possible adjustments to the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits if the taxing authorities prevail in the assessment of additional tax due the assessed tax interest and penalties if any could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

quarterly results of operations data 

the following tables set forth our unaudited quarterly consolidated statements of income data in dollars and as a percentage of total revenue for each of the eight quarters in the period ended december 31 2019  we have prepared the quarterly consolidated statements of income data on a basis consistent with the audited consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data in this annual report on form 10k in the opinion of management the financial information reflects all adjustments consisting only of normal recurring adjustments which we consider necessary for a fair presentation of this data this information should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included in part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data in this annual report on form 10k the results of historical periods are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations for any future period

liquidity and capital resources 



our principal sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents marketable securities and cash generated from operations cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities consist mostly of cash on deposit with banks investments in money market funds and investments in us government securities us government agency securities and corporate debt securities cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities were 5486 billion as of december 31 2019  an increase of 1374 billion from december 31 2018  the majority of the increase was due to 3631 billion of cash generated from operations offset by 1565 billion for capital expenditures including principal payments on finance leases 420 billion for repurchases of our class a common stock 419 billion for net purchases of marketable securities and 234 billion of taxes paid related to net share settlement of equity awards 

cash paid for income taxes was 518 billion for the year ended december 31 2019  of which 164 billion was related to the altera ninth circuit opinion as of december 31 2019  our federal net operating loss carryforward was 906 billion  and we anticipate that none of this amount will be utilized to offset our federal taxable income in 2019 as of december 31 2019  we had 357 million of federal tax credit carryforward of which none will be available to offset our federal tax liabilities in 2019  

in may 2016 we entered into a 20 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility and any amounts outstanding under the facility will be due and payable on may 20 2021 as of december 31 2019  no amounts had been drawn down and we were in compliance with the covenants under this credit facility 

our board of directors has authorized a share repurchase program of our class a common stock which commenced in january 2017 and does not have an expiration date as of december 31 2018 90 billion remained available and authorized for repurchases under this program in 2019 we repurchased and subsequently retired 22 million shares of our class a common stock for 410 billion  as of december 31 2019  490 billion remained available and authorized for repurchases in january 2020 an additional 100 billion of repurchases was authorized under this program 

  

as of december 31 2019  1901 billion of the 5486 billion in cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities was held by our foreign subsidiaries the tax act imposed a mandatory transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings and eliminated us taxes on foreign subsidiary distributions as a result earnings in foreign jurisdictions are available for distribution to the us without incremental us taxes 

in july 2019 we entered into a settlement and modified consent order to resolve the inquiry of the ftc into our platform and user data practices which is pending federal court approval the settlement requires us to pay a penalty of 50 billion which is included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet as of december 31 2019  

we currently anticipate that our available funds credit facility and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our operational cash needs for the foreseeable future 

cash provided by operating activities 

cash flow from operating activities during 2019 primarily consisted of net income adjusted for certain noncash items such as 574 billion of depreciation and amortization and 484 billion of sharebased compensation expense the increase in cash flow from operating activities during 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily due to higher net income prior to the effect of the 50 billion ftc legal settlement accrual an increase in taxes payable as well as increases in the noncash items discussed above 

cash flow from operating activities during 2018 mostly consisted of net income adjusted for certain noncash items such as total depreciation and amortization of 432 billion and sharebased compensation expense of 415 billion the increase in cash flow from operating activities during 2018 compared to 2017 was mostly due to an increase in net income adjusted for certain noncash items such as depreciation and amortization deferred income tax and sharebased compensation expense due to the enactment of the tax act in 2017 we recorded a higher tax liability in 2017 which partially offset the increase in cash flow from operating activities in 2018 

cash used in investing activities 

cash used in investing activities during 2019 mostly resulted from 1510 billion of net purchases of property and equipment as we continued to invest in data centers servers office buildings and network infrastructure and 419 billion of net purchases of marketable securities the increase in cash used in investing activities during 2019 compared to 2018 was mostly due to increases in net purchases of marketable securities and property and equipment 

cash used in investing activities during 2018 mostly resulted from 1392 billion of capital expenditures as we continued to invest in data centers servers network infrastructure and office buildings offset by 247 billion of net sales and maturities of marketable securities the decrease in cash used in investing activities during 2018 compared to 2017 was mostly due to a decrease in the net purchases of marketable securities partially offset by an increase in capital expenditures 

we anticipate making capital expenditures of approximately 17 billion to 19 billion in 2020  

cash used in financing activities 

cash used in financing activities during 2019 mostly consisted of 420 billion cash used to settle repurchases of our class a common stock 234 billion of taxes paid related to net share settlement of equity awards and 552 million of principal payments on finance leases the decrease in cash used in financing activities during 2019 compared to 2018 was mostly due to a decrease in repurchases of our class a common stock 

cash used in financing activities during 2018 consisted of 1288 billion paid for repurchases of our class a common stock and 321 billion of taxes paid related to net share settlement of equity awards offset by 500 million in overdraft balances in cash pooling entities the increase in cash used in financing activities during 2018 compared to 2017 was mostly due to an increase in repurchases of our class a common stock partially offset by an increase in overdraft balances in cash pooling entities 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we did not have any offbalance sheet arrangements as of december 31 2019  

contractual obligations 

our principal commitments consist primarily of obligations under operating leases which include among others certain of our offices data centers land and colocation leases as well as contractual commitments related to network infrastructure and data center operations the following table summarizes our commitments to settle contractual obligations in cash as of december 31 2019  



 

 

as part of the normal course of the business we may enter into multiyear agreements to purchase certain network components that do not specify a fixed or minimum price commitment or to purchase renewable energy that do not specify a fixed or minimum volume commitment these agreements are generally entered into in order to secure either volume or price using projected market prices or expected volume consumption the total estimated spend is approximately 499 billion  the ultimate spend under these agreements may vary and will be based on prevailing market prices or actual volume purchased 

in addition our other liabilities also include 374 billion related to net uncertain tax positions as of december 31 2019  due to uncertainties in the timing of the completion of tax audits the timing of the resolution of these positions is uncertain and we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years beyond 12 months as a result this amount is not included in the above contractual obligations table 

contingencies 

we are involved in legal proceedings claims and regulatory tax or government inquiries and investigations we record a provision for a liability when we believe that it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and that the amount can be reasonably estimated if we determine there is a reasonable possibility that we may incur a loss and the loss or range of loss can be estimated we disclose the possible loss in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements to the extent material significant judgment is required to determine both probability and the estimated amount of loss such matters are inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties some of which are beyond our control should any of these estimates and assumptions change or prove to be incorrect it could have a material impact on our results of operations financial position and cash flows

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend 

we are exposed to market risks including changes to foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and inflation 

foreign currency exchange risk 

we have foreign currency risks related to our revenue and operating expenses denominated in currencies other than the us dollar primarily the euro accordingly changes in exchange rates and in particular a strengthening of the us dollar have negatively affected and may continue to negatively affect our revenue and other operating results as expressed in us dollars 

we have experienced and will continue to experience fluctuations in our net income as a result of transaction gains or losses related to revaluing monetary asset and liability balances that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the entities in which they are recorded at this time we have not entered into but in the future we may enter into derivatives or other financial instruments in an attempt to hedge our foreign currency exchange risk it is difficult to predict the effect hedging activities would have on our results of operations foreign currency losses of 105 million  213 million  and 6 million were recognized in 2019  2018  and 2017  respectively as interest and other income net in our consolidated statements of income 

interest rate sensitivity 

our exposure to changes in interest rates relates primarily to interest earned and market value on our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities 

our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities consist of cash certificates of deposit time deposits money market funds us government securities us government agency securities and investment grade corporate debt securities  our investment policy and strategy are focused on preservation of capital and supporting our liquidity requirements changes in us interest rates affect the interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities and the market value of those securities a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would have resulted in a decrease of 525 million and 468 million in the market value of our availableforsale debt securities as of december 31 2019 and december 31 2018  respectively any realized gains or losses resulting from such interest rate changes would only occur if we sold the investments prior to maturity

competition 

our business is characterized by innovation rapid change and disruptive technologies we compete with companies that sell advertising as well as with companies that provide social media and communication products and services that are designed to engage users on the web mobile devices and online generally we face significant competition in every aspect of our business including from companies that facilitate communication and the sharing of content and information companies that enable marketers to display advertising companies that distribute video and other forms of media content and companies that provide development platforms for applications developers we compete to attract engage and retain people who use our products to attract and retain marketers and to attract and retain developers to build compelling mobile and web applications that integrate with our products 

we also compete with the following 

 as we introduce or acquire new products as our existing products evolve or as other companies introduce new products and services we may become subject to additional competition 

technology 

our product development philosophy is centered on continuous innovation in creating and improving products that are social by design which means that our products are designed to place people and their social interactions at the core of the product experience as our user base grows as engagement with products like video increases and as we deepen our investment in new technologies like ai our computing needs continue to expand we make significant investments in technology both to improve our existing products and services and to develop new ones as well as for our marketers and developers we are also investing in protecting the security and integrity of our platform by investing in both people and technology to strengthen our systems against abuse 

sales and operations 

the majority of our marketers use our selfservice ad platform to launch and manage their advertising campaigns we also have a global sales force that is focused on attracting and retaining advertisers and providing support to them throughout the stages of the marketing cycle from prepurchase decisionmaking to realtime optimizations to postcampaign analytics we work directly with these advertisers as well as through advertising agencies and resellers we operate more than 60 offices around the globe the majority of which have a sales presence we also invest in and rely on selfservice tools to provide direct customer support to our users and partners 

marketing 

to date our communities have grown organically with people inviting their friends to connect with them supported by internal efforts to stimulate awareness and interest in addition we have invested and will continue to invest in marketing our products and services to grow our brand and help build community around the world 

intellectual property 

to establish and protect our proprietary rights we rely on a combination of patents trademarks copyrights trade secrets including knowhow license agreements confidentiality procedures nondisclosure agreements with third parties employee disclosure and invention assignment agreements and other contractual rights in addition to further protect our proprietary rights from time to time we have purchased patents and patent applications from third parties we do not believe that our proprietary technology is dependent on any single patent or copyright or groups of related patents or copyrights we believe the duration of our patents is adequate relative to the expected lives of our products 

government regulation 

we are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the united states and abroad that involve matters central to our business many of these laws and regulations are still evolving and being tested in courts and could be interpreted in ways that could harm our business these may involve privacy data protection and personal information rights of publicity content intellectual property advertising marketing distribution data security data retention and deletion electronic contracts and other communications competition protection of minors consumer protection telecommunications product liability taxation economic or other trade prohibitions or sanctions securities law compliance and online payment services in particular we are subject to federal state and foreign laws regarding privacy and protection of peoples data foreign data protection privacy content competition and other laws and regulations can impose different obligations or be more restrictive than those in the united states us federal and state and foreign laws and regulations which in some cases can be enforced by private parties in addition to government entities are constantly evolving and can be subject to significant change as a result the application interpretation and enforcement of these laws and regulations are often uncertain particularly in the new and rapidly evolving industry in which we operate and may be interpreted and applied inconsistently from country to country and inconsistently with our current policies and practices 

proposed or new legislation and regulations could also significantly affect our business for example the european general data protection regulation gdpr took effect in may 2018 and applies to all of our products and services used by people in europe the gdpr includes operational requirements for companies that receive or process personal data of residents of the european union that are different from those previously in place in the european union and includes significant penalties for noncompliance similarly there are a number of legislative proposals in the european union the united states at both the federal and state level as well as other jurisdictions that could impose new obligations in areas affecting our business such as liability for copyright infringement in addition some countries are considering or have passed legislation implementing data protection requirements or requiring local storage and processing of data or similar requirements that could increase the cost and complexity of delivering our services 

we are and expect to continue to be the subject of investigations inquiries data requests actions and audits by government authorities and regulators in the united states europe and around the world particularly in the areas of privacy data protection law enforcement consumer protection and competition as we continue to grow and expand our operations we are currently and may in the future be subject to regulatory orders or consent decrees orders issued by or inquiries or enforcement actions initiated by 

government or regulatory authorities could cause us to incur substantial costs expose us to unanticipated civil and criminal liability or penalties including substantial monetary fines or require us to change our business practices in a manner materially adverse to our business

risk factors 

tableend certain factors may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations you should consider carefully the risks and uncertainties described below in addition to other information contained in this annual report on form 10k including our consolidated financial statements and related notes the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of or that we currently believe are not material may also become important factors that adversely affect our business if any of the following risks actually occurs our business financial condition results of operations and future prospects could be materially and adversely affected in that event the trading price of our class a common stock could decline and you could lose part or all of your investment 

risks related to our business and industry 

if we fail to retain existing users or add new users or if our users decrease their level of engagement with our products our revenue financial results and business may be significantly harmed 

the size of our user base and our users level of engagement are critical to our success our financial performance has been and will continue to be significantly determined by our success in adding retaining and engaging active users of our products particularly for facebook and instagram we anticipate that our active user growth rate will generally decline over time as the size of our active user base increases and it is possible that the size of our active user base may fluctuate or decline in one or more markets particularly in markets where we have achieved higher penetration rates for example in the fourth quarter of 2017 we experienced a slight decline on a quarteroverquarter basis in the number of daily active users on facebook in the united states  canada region if people do not perceive our products to be useful reliable and trustworthy we may not be able to attract or retain users or otherwise maintain or increase the frequency and duration of their engagement a number of other social networking companies that achieved early popularity have since seen their active user bases or levels of engagement decline in some cases precipitously there is no guarantee that we will not experience a similar erosion of our active user base or engagement levels our user engagement patterns have changed over time and user engagement can be difficult to measure particularly as we introduce new and different products and services any number of factors could potentially negatively affect user retention growth and engagement including if 



we implemented in the united states and around the world or other changes we may implement in the future in connection with other regulations regulatory actions or otherwise 

 if we are unable to maintain or increase our user base and user engagement our revenue and financial results may be adversely affected any decrease in user retention growth or engagement could render our products less attractive to users marketers and developers which is likely to have a material and adverse impact on our revenue business financial condition and results of operations if our active user growth rate continues to slow we will become increasingly dependent on our ability to maintain or increase levels of user engagement and monetization in order to drive revenue growth 

we generate substantially all of our revenue from advertising the loss of marketers or reduction in spending by marketers could seriously harm our business 

substantially all of our revenue is currently generated from third parties advertising on facebook and instagram as is common in the industry our marketers do not have longterm advertising commitments with us many of our marketers spend only a relatively small portion of their overall advertising budget with us marketers will not continue to do business with us or they will reduce the budgets they are willing to commit to us if we do not deliver ads in an effective manner or if they do not believe that their investment in advertising with us will generate a competitive return relative to other alternatives we have recently implemented and we may continue to implement changes to our user data practices some of these changes will reduce marketers’ ability to effectively target their ads which has to some extent adversely affected and will continue to adversely affect our advertising business if we are unable to provide marketers with a suitable return on investment the pricing of our ads may not increase or may decline in which case our revenue and financial results may be harmed 

our advertising revenue could also be adversely affected by a number of other factors including 



 the occurrence of any of these or other factors could result in a reduction in demand for our ads which may reduce the prices we receive for our ads or cause marketers to stop advertising with us altogether either of which would negatively affect our revenue and financial results 

our user growth engagement and monetization on mobile devices depend upon effective operation with mobile operating systems networks technologies products and standards that we do not control 

the substantial majority of our revenue is generated from advertising on mobile devices there is no guarantee that popular mobile devices will continue to feature facebook or our other products or that mobile device users will continue to use our products rather than competing products we are dependent on the interoperability of facebook and our other products with popular mobile operating systems networks technologies products and standards that we do not control such as the android and ios operating systems and mobile browsers any changes bugs or technical issues in such systems or changes in our relationships with mobile operating system partners handset manufacturers browser developers or mobile carriers or in their terms of service or policies that degrade our products functionality reduce or eliminate our ability to distribute our products give preferential treatment to competitive products limit our ability to deliver target or measure the effectiveness of ads or charge fees related to the distribution of our products or our delivery of ads could adversely affect the usage of facebook or our other products and monetization on mobile devices for example apple recently released an update to its safari browser that limits the use of thirdparty cookies which reduces our ability to provide the most relevant ads to our users and impacts monetization additionally in order to deliver high quality mobile products it is important that our products work well with a range of mobile technologies products systems networks and standards that we do not control and that we have good relationships with handset manufacturers mobile carriers and browser developers we may not be successful in maintaining or developing relationships with key participants in the mobile ecosystem or in developing products that operate effectively with these technologies products systems networks or standards in the event that it is more difficult for our users to access and use facebook or our other products on their mobile devices or if our users choose not to access or use facebook or our other products on their mobile devices or use mobile products that do not offer access to facebook or our other products our user growth and user engagement could be harmed from time to time we may also take actions regarding the distribution of our products or the operation of our business based on what we believe to be in our longterm best interests such actions may adversely affect our users and our relationships with the operators of mobile operating systems handset manufacturers mobile carriers browser developers or other business partners and there is no assurance that these actions will result in the anticipated longterm benefits in the event that our users are adversely affected by these actions or if our relationships with such third parties deteriorate our user growth engagement and monetization could be adversely affected and our business could be harmed 

our business is highly competitive competition presents an ongoing threat to the success of our business 

we compete with companies that sell advertising as well as with companies that provide social media and communication products and services that are designed to engage users on the web mobile devices and online generally we face significant competition in every aspect of our business including from companies that facilitate communication and the sharing of content and information companies that enable marketers to display advertising companies that distribute video and other forms of media content and companies that provide development platforms for applications developers we compete with companies that offer products across broad platforms that replicate capabilities we provide for example among other areas we compete with apple in messaging google and youtube in advertising and video tencent in messaging and social media and amazon in advertising we also compete with companies that provide regional social networks many of which have strong positions in particular countries some of our competitors may be domiciled in different countries and subject to political legal and regulatory regimes that enable them to compete more effectively than us in addition we face competition from traditional online and mobile businesses that provide media for marketers to reach their audiences andor   develop tools and systems for managing and optimizing advertising campaigns we also compete with companies that develop and deliver consumer hardware and virtual reality products and services 

some of our current and potential competitors may have greater resources or stronger competitive positions in certain product segments geographic regions or user demographics than we do these factors may allow our competitors to respond more effectively than us to new or emerging technologies and changes in market conditions we believe that some users particularly younger users are aware of and actively engaging with other products and services similar to or as a substitute for facebook products and services and we believe that some users have reduced their use of and engagement with our products and services in favor of these other products and services in the event that users increasingly engage with other products and services we may experience a decline in use and engagement in key user demographics or more broadly in which case our business would likely be harmed 

our competitors may develop products features or services that are similar to ours or that achieve greater acceptance may undertake more farreaching and successful product development efforts or marketing campaigns or may adopt more aggressive pricing policies in addition developers whose mobile and web applications are integrated with facebook or our other products may use information shared by our users through our products in order to develop products or features that compete with us some competitors may gain a competitive advantage against us in areas where we operate including by making acquisitions by limiting our ability to deliver target or measure the effectiveness of ads by imposing fees or other charges related to our delivery of ads by making access to our products more difficult or impossible by making it more difficult to communicate with our users or by integrating competing platforms applications or features into products they control such as mobile device operating systems search engines browsers or ecommerce platforms for example each of apple and google have integrated competitive products with ios and android respectively as a result our competitors may acquire and engage users or generate advertising or other revenue at the 

expense of our own efforts which may negatively affect our business and financial results in addition from time to time we may take actions in response to competitive threats but we cannot assure you that these actions will be successful or that they will not negatively affect our business and financial results 

we believe that our ability to compete effectively depends upon many factors both within and beyond our control including 

 if we are not able to compete effectively our user base and level of user engagement may decrease we may become less attractive to developers and marketers and our revenue and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected 

actions by governments that restrict access to facebook or our other products in their countries or that otherwise impair our ability to sell advertising in their countries could substantially harm our business and financial results 

governments of one or more countries in which we operate from time to time seek to censor content available on facebook or our other products in their country restrict access to our products from their country entirely or impose other restrictions that may affect the accessibility of our products in their country for an extended period of time or indefinitely for example user access to facebook and certain of our other products has been or is currently restricted in whole or in part in china iran and north korea in addition government authorities in other countries may seek to restrict user access to our products if they consider us to be in violation of their laws or a threat to public safety or for other reasons and certain of our products have been restricted by governments in other countries from time to time it is possible that government authorities could take action that impairs our ability to sell advertising including in countries where access to our consumerfacing products may be blocked or restricted for example we generate meaningful revenue from a limited number of resellers representing advertisers based in china in the event that content shown on facebook or our other products is subject to censorship access to our products is restricted in whole or in part in one or more countries or other restrictions are imposed on our products or our competitors are able to successfully penetrate new geographic markets or capture a greater share of existing geographic markets that we cannot access or where we face other restrictions our ability to retain or increase our user base user engagement or the level of advertising by marketers may be adversely affected we may not be able to maintain or grow our revenue as anticipated and our financial results could be adversely affected 

our new products and changes to existing products could fail to attract or retain users or generate revenue and profits 

our ability to retain increase and engage our user base and to increase our revenue depends heavily on our ability to continue to evolve our existing products and to create successful new products both independently and in conjunction with developers or other third parties we may introduce significant changes to our existing products or acquire or introduce new and unproven products including using technologies with which we have little or no prior development or operating experience for example we do not have significant experience with consumer hardware products or virtual or augmented reality technology which may adversely affect our ability to successfully develop and market these products and technologies and we will incur increased costs in connection with the development and marketing of such products and technologies in addition the introduction of new products or changes to existing products may result in new or enhanced governmental or regulatory scrutiny or other complications that could adversely affect our business and financial results we have also invested and expect to continue to invest significant resources in growing our whatsapp and messenger products we have historically monetized messaging in only a very limited fashion and we may not be successful in our efforts to generate meaningful revenue from messaging over the long term if these or other new or enhanced products fail to engage users marketers or developers or if our business plans are unsuccessful we may fail to attract or retain users or to generate sufficient revenue operating margin or other value to justify our investments and our business may be adversely affected 

we make product and investment decisions that may not prioritize shortterm financial results and may not produce the longterm benefits that we expect 

we frequently make product and investment decisions that may not prioritize shortterm financial results if we believe that the decisions are consistent with our mission and benefit the aggregate user experience and will thereby improve our financial performance over the long term for example we have recently implemented and we may continue to implement changes to our user data practices some of these changes will reduce marketers’ ability to effectively target their ads which has to some extent adversely affected and will continue to adversely affect our advertising business similarly we previously announced changes to our news feed ranking algorithm to help our users have more meaningful interactions and these changes have had and we expect will continue to have the effect of reducing time spent and some measures of user engagement with facebook which could adversely affect our financial results from time to time we may also change the size frequency or relative prominence of ads in order to improve ad quality and overall user experience in addition we have made and we expect to continue to make other changes to our products which may adversely affect the distribution of content of publishers marketers and developers and could reduce their incentive to invest in their efforts on facebook we also may introduce new features or other changes to existing products or introduce new standalone products that attract users away from properties formats or use cases where we have more proven means of monetization for example we plan to continue to promote the stories format which is becoming increasingly popular for sharing content across our products but our advertising efforts with this format are still under development and we do not currently monetize stories at the same rate as news feed in addition as we focus on growing users and engagement across our family of apps it is possible that these efforts may from time to time reduce engagement with one or more products and services in favor of other products or services that we monetize less successfully or that are not growing as quickly these decisions may adversely affect our business and results of operations and may not produce the longterm benefits that we expect 

if we are not able to maintain and enhance our brands our ability to expand our base of users marketers and developers may be impaired and our business and financial results may be harmed 

we believe that our brands have significantly contributed to the success of our business we also believe that maintaining and enhancing our brands is critical to expanding our base of users marketers and developers many of our new users are referred by existing users maintaining and enhancing our brands will depend largely on our ability to continue to provide useful reliable trustworthy and innovative products which we may not do successfully we may introduce new products or terms of service or policies that users do not like which may negatively affect our brands additionally the actions of our developers or advertisers may affect our brands if users do not have a positive experience using thirdparty mobile and web applications integrated with our products or interacting with parties that advertise through our products we will also continue to experience media legislative or regulatory scrutiny of our actions or decisions regarding user privacy content advertising and other issues including actions or decisions in connection with elections which may adversely affect our reputation and brands for example we previously announced our discovery of certain ads and other content previously displayed on our products that may be relevant to government investigations relating to russian interference in the 2016 us presidential election in addition in march 2018 we announced developments regarding the misuse of certain data by a developer that shared such data with third parties in violation of our terms and policies we also may fail to respond expeditiously or appropriately to the sharing of objectionable content on our services or objectionable practices by advertisers or developers or to otherwise address user concerns which could erode confidence in our brands our brands may also be negatively affected by the actions of users that are deemed to be hostile or inappropriate to other users by the actions of users acting under false or inauthentic identities by the use of our products or services to disseminate information that is deemed to be misleading or intended to manipulate opinions by perceived or actual efforts by governments to obtain access to user information for securityrelated purposes or to censor certain content on our platform or by the use of our products or services for illicit objectionable or illegal ends maintaining and enhancing our brands may require us to make substantial investments and these investments may not be successful certain of our past actions such as the foregoing matter regarding developer misuse of data have eroded confidence in our brands and if we fail to successfully promote and maintain our brands or if we incur excessive expenses in this effort our business and financial results may be adversely affected 

security breaches and improper access to or disclosure of our data or user data or other hacking and phishing attacks on our systems could harm our reputation and adversely affect our business 

our industry is prone to cyberattacks by third parties seeking unauthorized access to our data or users’ data or to disrupt our ability to provide service any failure to prevent or mitigate security breaches and improper access to or disclosure of our data or user data including personal information content or payment information from users or information from marketers could result in the loss or misuse of such data which could harm our business and reputation and diminish our competitive position in addition computer malware viruses social engineering predominantly spear phishing attacks and general hacking have become more prevalent in our industry have occurred on our systems in the past and will occur on our systems in the future we also regularly encounter attempts to create false or undesirable user accounts purchase ads or take other actions on our platform for purposes such as spamming spreading misinformation or other objectionable ends as a result of our prominence the size of our user base and the types and volume of personal data on our systems we believe that we are a particularly attractive target for such breaches and attacks our efforts to address undesirable activity on our platform may also increase the risk of retaliatory attacks such attacks may cause interruptions to the services we provide degrade the user experience cause users or marketers to lose confidence and trust in our products impair our internal systems or result in financial harm to us our efforts to protect our company data or the information we receive may also be unsuccessful due to software bugs or other technical malfunctions employee contractor or vendor error or malfeasance government surveillance or other threats that evolve in addition third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or users to disclose information in order to gain access to our data or our users data cyberattacks continue to evolve in sophistication and volume and inherently may be difficult to detect for long periods of time although we have developed systems and processes that are designed to protect our data and user data to prevent data loss to disable undesirable accounts and activities on our platform and to prevent or detect security breaches we cannot assure you that such measures will provide absolute security and we may incur significant costs in protecting against or remediating cyberattacks 

in addition some of our developers or other partners such as those that help us measure the effectiveness of ads may receive or store information provided by us or by our users through mobile or web applications integrated with facebook we provide limited information to such third parties based on the scope of services provided to us however if these third parties or developers fail to adopt or adhere to adequate data security practices or in the event of a breach of their networks our data or our users data may be improperly accessed used or disclosed 

affected users or government authorities could initiate legal or regulatory actions against us in connection with any actual or perceived security breaches or improper disclosure of data which could cause us to incur significant expense and liability or result in orders or consent decrees forcing us to modify our business practices such incidents or our efforts to remediate such incidents may also result in a decline in our active user base or engagement levels any of these events could have a material and adverse effect on our business reputation or financial results 

for example in september 2018 we announced our discovery of a thirdparty cyberattack that exploited a vulnerability in facebook’s code to steal user access tokens which were then used to access certain profile information from approximately 29 million user accounts on facebook while we took steps to remediate the attack including fixing the vulnerability resetting user access tokens and notifying affected users we may discover and announce additional developments which could further erode confidence in our brand in addition the events surrounding this cyberattack became the subject of irish data protection commission us federal trade commission and other government inquiries in the united states europe and other jurisdictions any such inquiries could subject us to substantial fines and costs require us to change our business practices divert resources and the attention of management from our business or adversely affect our business 

we anticipate that our ongoing investments in safety security and content review will identify additional instances of misuse of user data or other undesirable activity by third parties on our platform 

in addition to our efforts to mitigate cybersecurity risks we are making significant investments in safety security and content review efforts to combat misuse of our services and user data by third parties including investigations and audits of platform applications that previously accessed information of a large number of users of our services as a result of these efforts we have discovered and announced and anticipate that we will continue to discover and announce additional incidents of misuse of user data or other undesirable activity by third parties we may not discover all such incidents or activity including as a result of our data limitations or the scale of activity on our platform and we may be notified of such incidents or activity via the media or other third parties such incidents and activities may include the use of user data in a manner inconsistent with our terms contracts or policies the existence of false or undesirable user accounts election interference improper ad purchases activities that threaten people’s safety on or offline or instances of spamming scraping or spreading misinformation the discovery of the foregoing may negatively affect user trust and engagement harm our reputation and brands require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business and adversely affect our business and financial results any such discoveries may also subject us to additional litigation and regulatory inquiries which could subject us to monetary penalties and damages divert management’s time and attention and lead to enhanced regulatory oversight 

unfavorable media coverage could negatively affect our business 

we receive a high degree of media coverage around the world unfavorable publicity regarding for example our privacy practices terms of service product changes product quality litigation or regulatory activity government surveillance the actions of our advertisers the actions of our developers whose products are integrated with our products the use of our products or services for illicit objectionable or illegal ends the substance or enforcement of our community standards the actions of our users the quality and integrity of content shared on our platform or the actions of other companies that provide similar services to ours has in the past and could in the future adversely affect our reputation for example beginning in march 2018 we were the subject of intense media coverage involving the misuse of certain data by a developer that shared such data with third parties in violation of our terms and policies and we have continued to receive negative publicity such negative publicity could have an adverse effect on the size engagement and loyalty of our user base and result in decreased revenue which could adversely affect our business and financial results 

our financial results will fluctuate from quarter to quarter and are difficult to predict 

our quarterly financial results have fluctuated in the past and will fluctuate in the future additionally we have a limited operating history with the current scale of our business which makes it difficult to forecast our future results as a result you should not rely upon our past quarterly financial results as indicators of future performance you should take into account the risks and uncertainties frequently encountered by companies in rapidly evolving markets our financial results in any given quarter can be influenced by numerous factors many of which we are unable to predict or are outside of our control including 





we expect our rates of growth to decline in the future 

we expect that our user growth rate will generally decline over time as the size of our active user base increases and it is possible that the size of our active user base may fluctuate or decline in one or more markets particularly as we achieve greater market penetration we expect our revenue growth rate will continue to decline over time as our revenue increases to higher levels as our growth rates decline investors perceptions of our business may be adversely affected and the trading price of our class a common stock could decline 

our costs are continuing to grow which could reduce our operating margin and profitability if our investments are not successful our business and financial performance could be harmed 

operating our business is costly and we expect our expenses to continue to increase in the future as we broaden our user base as users increase the amount and types of content they consume and the data they share with us for example with respect to video as we develop and implement new products as we market new and existing products and promote our brands as we continue to expand our technical infrastructure as we continue to invest in new and unproven technologies and as we continue to hire additional employees and contractors to support our expanding operations including our efforts to focus on safety security and content review we will continue to invest in our messaging video content and global connectivity efforts as well as other initiatives that may not have clear paths to monetization in addition we will incur increased costs in connection with the development and marketing of our consumer hardware and virtual and augmented reality products and technologies any such investments may not be successful and any such increases in our costs may reduce our operating margin and profitability in addition if our investments are not successful our ability to grow revenue will be harmed which could adversely affect our business and financial performance 

given our levels of sharebased compensation our tax rate may vary significantly depending on our stock price 

the tax effects of the accounting for sharebased compensation may significantly impact our effective tax rate from period to period in periods in which our stock price is higher than the grant price of the sharebased compensation vesting in that period we will recognize excess tax benefits that will decrease our effective tax rate for example in 2018 excess tax benefits recognized from sharebased compensation decreased our provision for income taxes by 717 million and our effective tax rate by approximately three percentage points as compared to the tax rate without such benefits in future periods in which our stock price is lower than the grant price of the sharebased compensation vesting in that period our effective tax rate may increase the amount and value of sharebased compensation issued relative to our earnings in a particular period will also affect the magnitude of the impact of sharebased compensation on our effective tax rate these tax effects are dependent on our stock price which we do not control and a decline in our stock price could significantly increase our effective tax rate and adversely affect our financial results 

our business is subject to complex and evolving us and foreign laws and regulations regarding privacy data protection content competition consumer protection and other matters many of these laws and regulations are subject to change and uncertain interpretation and could result in claims changes to our business practices monetary penalties increased cost of operations or declines in user growth or engagement or otherwise harm our business 

we are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the united states and abroad that involve matters central to our business including privacy data protection and personal information rights of publicity content intellectual property advertising marketing distribution data security data retention and deletion electronic contracts and other communications competition protection of minors consumer protection telecommunications product liability taxation economic or other trade prohibitions or sanctions securities law compliance and online payment services the introduction of new products expansion of our activities in certain jurisdictions or other actions that we may take may subject us to additional laws regulations or other government scrutiny in addition foreign data protection privacy content competition and other laws and regulations can impose different obligations or be more restrictive than those in the united states 

these us federal and state and foreign laws and regulations which in some cases can be enforced by private parties in addition to government entities are constantly evolving and can be subject to significant change as a result the application interpretation and enforcement of these laws and regulations are often uncertain particularly in the new and rapidly evolving industry in which we operate and may be interpreted and applied inconsistently from country to country and inconsistently with our current policies and practices for example regulatory or legislative actions affecting the manner in which we display content to our users or obtain consent to various practices could adversely affect user growth and engagement such actions could affect the manner in which we provide our services or adversely affect our financial results 

we are also subject to laws and regulations that dictate whether how and under what circumstances we can transfer process andor receive certain data that is critical to our operations including data shared between countries or regions in which we operate and data shared among our products and services for example in 2016 the european union and united states agreed to an alternative transfer framework for data transferred from the european union to the united states called the privacy shield but this new framework is subject to an annual review that could result in changes to our obligations and also is subject to challenge by regulators and private parties in addition the other bases upon which facebook relies to legitimize the transfer of such data such as standard contractual clauses sccs have been subjected to regulatory and judicial scrutiny for example the irish data protection commissioner has challenged the legal grounds for transfers of user data to facebook inc and the irish high court has referred this challenge to the court of justice of the european union for decision we have also been managing investigations and lawsuits in europe india and other jurisdictions regarding the august 2016 update to whatsapp’s terms of service and privacy policy and its sharing of certain data with other facebook products and services including a lawsuit currently pending before the supreme court of india if one or more of the legal bases for transferring data from europe to the united states is invalidated if we are unable to transfer data between and among countries and regions in which we operate or if we are restricted from sharing data among our products and services it could affect the manner in which we provide our services or our ability to target ads which could adversely affect our financial results 

proposed or new legislation and regulations could also significantly affect our business for example the european general data protection regulation gdpr took effect in may 2018 and applies to all of our products and services used by people in europe the gdpr includes operational requirements for companies that receive or process personal data of residents of the european union that are different from those previously in place in the european union as a result we implemented measures to change our service for minors under the age of 16 for certain countries in europe that maintain the minimum age of 16 under the gdpr we also obtain consent andor offer new controls to existing and new users in europe before processing data for certain aspects of our service in addition the gdpr requires submission of breach notifications to our designated european privacy regulator the irish data protection commissioner and includes significant penalties for noncompliance with the notification obligation as well as other requirements of the regulation the california consumer privacy act or ab 375 was also recently passed and creates new data privacy rights for users effective in 2020 similarly there are a number of legislative proposals in the european union the united states at both the federal and state level as well as other jurisdictions that could impose new obligations in areas affecting our business in addition some countries are considering or have passed legislation implementing data protection requirements or requiring local storage and processing of data or similar requirements that could increase the cost and complexity of delivering our services 

these laws and regulations as well as any associated inquiries or investigations or any other government actions may be costly to comply with and may delay or impede the development of new products result in negative publicity increase our operating costs require significant management time and attention and subject us to remedies that may harm our business including fines or demands or orders that we modify or cease existing business practices 

we have been subject to regulatory and other government investigations enforcement actions and settlements and we expect to continue to be subject to such proceedings and other inquiries in the future which could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner materially adverse to our business 

from time to time we receive formal and informal inquiries from government authorities and regulators regarding our compliance with laws and regulations many of which are evolving and subject to interpretation we are and expect to continue to be the subject of investigations inquiries data requests actions and audits in the united states europe and around the world particularly in the areas of privacy data protection law enforcement consumer protection and competition as we continue to grow and expand our operations in addition we are currently and may in the future be subject to regulatory orders or consent decrees for example data protection and consumer protection authorities in the european union have initiated actions investigations or administrative orders seeking to restrict the ways in which we collect and use information or impose sanctions and other authorities may do the same in addition beginning in march 2018 we became subject to us federal trade commission securities and exchange commission state attorneys general and other government inquiries in the united states europe and other jurisdictions in connection with our platform and user data practices as well as the misuse of certain data by a developer that shared such data with third parties in violation of our terms and policies beginning in september 2018 we also became subject to irish data protection commission us federal trade commission and other government inquiries in the united states europe and other jurisdictions in connection with a thirdparty cyberattack that exploited a vulnerability in facebook’s code to steal user access tokens and access certain profile information from user accounts on facebook orders issued by or inquiries or enforcement actions initiated by government or regulatory authorities could cause us to incur substantial costs expose us to unanticipated civil and criminal liability or penalties including substantial monetary fines or require us to change our business practices in a manner materially adverse to our business 

if we are unable to protect our intellectual property the value of our brands and other intangible assets may be diminished and our business may be adversely affected 

we rely and expect to continue to rely on a combination of confidentiality assignment and license agreements with our employees consultants and third parties with whom we have relationships as well as trademark copyright patent trade secret and domain name protection laws to protect our proprietary rights in the united states and internationally we have filed various applications for protection of certain aspects of our intellectual property and we currently hold a significant number of registered trademarks and issued patents in multiple jurisdictions and have acquired patents and patent applications from third parties third parties may knowingly or unknowingly infringe our proprietary rights third parties may challenge proprietary rights held by us and pending and future trademark and patent applications may not be approved in addition effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which we operate or intend to operate our business in any or all of these cases we may be required to expend significant time and expense in order to prevent infringement or to enforce our rights although we have generally taken measures to protect our proprietary rights there can be no assurance that others will not offer products or concepts that are substantially similar to ours and compete with our business in addition we regularly contribute software source code under open source licenses and have made other technology we developed available under other open licenses and we include open source software in our products for example we have contributed certain specifications and designs related to our data center equipment to the open compute project foundation a nonprofit entity that shares and develops such information with the technology community under the open web foundation license as a result of our open source contributions and the use of open source in our products we may license or be required to license or disclose code andor innovations that turn out to be material to our business and may also be exposed to increased litigation risk if the protection of our proprietary rights is inadequate to prevent unauthorized use or appropriation by third parties the value of our brands and other intangible assets may be diminished and competitors may be able to more effectively mimic our products services and methods of operations any of these events could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results 

we are currently and expect to be in the future party to patent lawsuits and other intellectual property rights claims that are expensive and time consuming and if resolved adversely could have a significant impact on our business financial condition or results of operations 

companies in the internet technology and media industries own large numbers of patents copyrights trademarks and trade secrets and frequently enter into litigation based on allegations of infringement misappropriation or other violations of intellectual property or other rights in addition various nonpracticing entities that own patents and other intellectual property rights often attempt to aggressively assert their rights in order to extract value from technology companies furthermore from time to time we may introduce or acquire new products including in areas where we historically have not competed which could increase our exposure to patent and other intellectual property claims from competitors and nonpracticing entities 

from time to time we receive notice from patent holders and other parties alleging that certain of our products and services or user content infringe their intellectual property rights we presently are involved in a number of intellectual property lawsuits and as we face increasing competition and gain an increasingly high profile we expect the number of patent and other intellectual property claims against us to grow defending patent and other intellectual property litigation is costly and can impose a significant burden on management and employees and there can be no assurances that favorable final outcomes will be obtained in all cases in addition plaintiffs may seek and we may become subject to preliminary or provisional rulings in the course of any such litigation including potential preliminary injunctions requiring us to cease some or all of our operations we may decide to settle such lawsuits and disputes on terms that are unfavorable to us similarly if any litigation to which we are a party is resolved adversely we may be subject to an unfavorable judgment that may not be reversed upon appeal the terms of such a settlement or judgment may require us to cease some or all of our operations or pay substantial amounts to the other party in addition we may have to seek a license to continue practices found to be in violation of a third partys rights which may not be available on reasonable terms or at all and may significantly increase our operating costs and expenses as a result we may also be required to develop alternative noninfringing technology or practices or discontinue the practices the development of alternative noninfringing technology or practices could require significant effort and expense or may not be feasible our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected as a result of an unfavorable resolution of the disputes and litigation referred to above 

we are involved in numerous class action lawsuits and other litigation matters that are expensive and time consuming and if resolved adversely could harm our business financial condition or results of operations 

in addition to intellectual property claims we are also involved in numerous other lawsuits including putative class action lawsuits many of which claim statutory damages andor seek significant changes to our business operations and we anticipate that we will continue to be a target for numerous lawsuits in the future because of the scale of our user base the plaintiffs in class action cases filed against us typically claim enormous monetary damages even if the alleged peruser harm is small or nonexistent in addition we may be subject to additional class action lawsuits based on employment claims product performance or other claims related to the use of consumer hardware and software as well as virtual reality technology and products which are new and unproven 

for example we are currently the subject of multiple putative class action suits in connection with our platform and user data practices and the misuse of certain data by a developer that shared such data with third parties in violation of our terms and policies the disclosure of our earnings results for the second quarter of 2018 and a thirdparty cyberattack that exploited a vulnerability in facebook’s code to steal user access tokens and access certain profile information from user accounts on facebook we believe these lawsuits are without merit and are vigorously defending them any negative outcome from any such lawsuits could result in payments of substantial monetary damages or fines or undesirable changes to our products or business practices and accordingly our business financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected although the results of such lawsuits and claims cannot be predicted with certainty we do not believe that the final outcome of those matters relating to our products that we currently face will have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

there can be no assurances that a favorable final outcome will be obtained in all our cases and defending any lawsuit is costly and can impose a significant burden on management and employees any litigation to which we are a party may result in an onerous or unfavorable judgment that may not be reversed upon appeal or in payments of substantial monetary damages or fines or we may decide to settle lawsuits on similarly unfavorable terms which could adversely affect our business financial conditions or results of operations 

we may incur liability as a result of information retrieved from or transmitted over the internet or published using our products or as a result of claims related to our products 

we have faced currently face and will continue to face claims relating to information that is published or made available on our products in particular the nature of our business exposes us to claims related to defamation dissemination of misinformation or news hoaxes discrimination intellectual property rights rights of publicity and privacy personal injury torts or laws regulating hate speech or other types of content this risk is enhanced in certain jurisdictions outside the united states where our protection from liability for thirdparty actions may be unclear or where we may be less protected under local laws than we are in the united states for example there have been recent legislative proposals in the european union that could expose online platforms to liability for copyright infringement in addition there have been various congressional efforts to restrict the scope of the protections available to online platforms under section 230 of the communications decency act and our current protections from liability for thirdparty content in the united states could decrease or change we could incur significant costs investigating and defending such claims and if we are found liable significant damages we could also face fines or orders restricting or blocking our services in particular geographies as a result of content hosted on our services for example recently enacted legislation in germany may result in the imposition of significant fines for failure to comply with certain content removal and disclosure obligations and other countries are considering or have implemented similar legislation imposing penalties for failure to remove content if any of these events occur our business and financial results could be adversely affected 

our ceo has control over key decision making as a result of his control of a majority of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock 

mark zuckerberg our founder chairman and ceo is able to exercise voting rights with respect to a majority of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock and therefore has the ability to control the outcome of matters submitted to our stockholders for approval including the election of directors and any merger consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets this concentrated control could delay defer or prevent a change of control merger consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets that our other stockholders support or conversely this concentrated control could result in the consummation of such a transaction that our other stockholders do not support this concentrated control could also discourage a potential investor from acquiring our class a common stock which has limited voting power relative to the class b common stock and might harm the trading price of our class a common stock in addition mr zuckerberg has the ability to control the management and major strategic investments of our company as a result of his position as our ceo and his ability to control the election or replacement of our directors in the event of his death the shares of our capital stock that mr zuckerberg owns will be transferred to the persons or entities that he has designated as a board member and officer mr zuckerberg owes a fiduciary duty to our stockholders and must act in good faith in a manner he reasonably believes to be in the best interests of our stockholders as a stockholder even a controlling stockholder mr zuckerberg is entitled to vote his shares and shares over which he has voting control as governed by a voting agreement in his own interests which may not always be in the interests of our stockholders generally 

we plan to continue to make acquisitions which could harm our financial condition or results of operations and may adversely affect the price of our common stock 

as part of our business strategy we have made and intend to continue to make acquisitions to add specialized employees and complementary companies products or technologies we may not be able to find suitable acquisition candidates and we may not be able to complete acquisitions on favorable terms if at all in some cases the costs of such acquisitions may be substantial and there is no assurance that we will receive a favorable return on investment for our acquisitions 

we may pay substantial amounts of cash or incur debt to pay for acquisitions which could adversely affect our liquidity the incurrence of indebtedness would also result in increased fixed obligations and increased interest expense and could also include covenants or other restrictions that would impede our ability to manage our operations we may also issue equity securities to pay for acquisitions and we regularly grant rsus to retain the employees of acquired companies which could increase our expenses adversely affect our financial results and result in dilution to our stockholders in addition any acquisitions we announce could be viewed negatively by users marketers developers or investors which may adversely affect our business or the price of our class a common stock 

we may also discover liabilities or deficiencies associated with the companies or assets we acquire that were not identified in advance which may result in significant unanticipated costs the effectiveness of our due diligence review and our ability to evaluate the results of such due diligence are dependent upon the accuracy and completeness of statements and disclosures made or actions taken by the companies we acquire or their representatives as well as the limited amount of time in which acquisitions are executed in addition we may fail to accurately forecast the financial impact of an acquisition transaction including tax and accounting charges acquisitions may also result in our recording of significant additional expenses to our results of operations and recording of substantial finitelived intangible assets on our balance sheet upon closing any of these factors may adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations 

we may not be able to successfully integrate our acquisitions and we may incur significant costs to integrate and support the companies we acquire 

the integration of acquisitions requires significant time and resources and we may not manage these processes successfully our ability to successfully integrate complex acquisitions is unproven particularly with respect to companies that have significant operations or that develop products where we do not have prior experience for example the technology and products we acquired from oculus were relatively new to facebook at the time of the acquisition and we did not have significant experience with or structure in place to support such technology and products prior to the acquisition we continue to make substantial investments of resources to support our acquisitions which will result in significant ongoing operating expenses and may divert resources and management attention from other areas of our business we cannot assure you that these investments will be successful if we fail to successfully integrate the companies we acquire we may not realize the benefits expected from the transaction and our business may be harmed 

if our goodwill or finitelived intangible assets become impaired we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings   

we review our finitelived intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable such as a decline in stock price and market capitalization we test goodwill for impairment at least annually if such goodwill or finitelived intangible assets are deemed to be impaired an impairment loss equal to the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the assets would be recognized we may be required to record a significant charge in our financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill or finitelived intangible assets is determined which would negatively affect our results of operations 

our business is dependent on our ability to maintain and scale our technical infrastructure and any significant disruption in our service could damage our reputation result in a potential loss of users and engagement and adversely affect our financial results 

our reputation and ability to attract retain and serve our users is dependent upon the reliable performance of our products and our underlying technical infrastructure we have in the past experienced and may in the future experience interruptions in the availability or performance of our products from time to time our systems may not be adequately designed with the necessary reliability and redundancy to avoid performance delays or outages that could be harmful to our business if our products are unavailable when users attempt to access them or if they do not load as quickly as expected users may not use our products as often in the future or at all and our ability to serve ads may be disrupted as the amount and types of information shared on facebook and our other products continue to grow and evolve as the usage patterns of our global community continue to evolve and as our internal operational demands continue to grow we will need an increasing amount of technical infrastructure including network capacity and computing power to continue to satisfy our needs it is possible that we may fail to continue to effectively scale and grow our technical infrastructure to accommodate these increased demands which may adversely affect our user engagement and advertising revenue growth in addition our business may be subject to interruptions delays or failures resulting from earthquakes adverse weather conditions other natural disasters power loss terrorism geopolitical conflict cyberattacks or other catastrophic events if such an event were to occur users may be subject to service disruptions or outages and we may not be able to recover our technical infrastructure and user data in a timely manner to restart or provide our services which may adversely affect our financial results 

a substantial portion of our network infrastructure is provided by third parties any disruption or failure in the services we receive from these providers could harm our ability to handle existing or increased traffic and could significantly harm our business any financial or other difficulties these providers face may adversely affect our business and we exercise little control over these providers which increases our vulnerability to problems with the services they provide 

we could experience unforeseen difficulties in building and operating key portions of our technical infrastructure 

we have designed and built our own data centers and key portions of our technical infrastructure through which we serve our products and we plan to continue to significantly expand the size of our infrastructure primarily through data centers and other projects the infrastructure expansion we are undertaking is complex and involves projects in multiple locations and unanticipated delays in the completion of these projects including due to any shortage of labor necessary in building portions of such projects or availability of components may lead to increased project costs operational inefficiencies or interruptions in the delivery or degradation of the quality of our products in addition there may be issues related to this infrastructure that are not identified during the testing phases of design and implementation which may only become evident after we have started to fully utilize the underlying equipment that could further degrade the user experience or increase our costs 

our products and internal systems rely on software that is highly technical and if it contains undetected errors or vulnerabilities our business could be adversely affected 

our products and internal systems rely on software including software developed or maintained internally andor by third parties that is highly technical and complex in addition our products and internal systems depend on the ability of such software to store retrieve process and manage immense amounts of data the software on which we rely has contained and will in the future contain undetected errors bugs or vulnerabilities some errors may only be discovered after the code has been released for external or internal use for example in september 2018 we announced our discovery of a thirdparty cyberattack that exploited a vulnerability in facebook’s code to steal user access tokens and access certain profile information from user accounts on facebook errors vulnerabilities or other design defects within the software on which we rely have in the past and may in the future result in a negative experience for users and marketers who use our products delay product introductions or enhancements result in targeting measurement or billing errors compromise our ability to protect the data of our users andor our intellectual property or lead to reductions in our ability to provide some or all of our services in addition any errors bugs vulnerabilities or defects discovered in the software on which we rely and any associated degradations or interruptions of service could result in damage to our reputation loss of users loss of revenue or liability for damages any of which could adversely affect our business and financial results 

technologies have been developed that can block the display of our ads which could adversely affect our financial results 

technologies have been developed and will likely continue to be developed that can block the display of our ads or block our ad measurement tools particularly for advertising displayed on personal computers we generate substantially all of our revenue from advertising including revenue resulting from the display of ads on personal computers revenue generated from the display of ads on personal computers has been impacted by these technologies from time to time as a result these technologies have had an adverse effect on our financial results and if such technologies continue to proliferate in particular with respect to mobile platforms our future financial results may be harmed 

real or perceived inaccuracies in our user and other metrics may harm our reputation and negatively affect our business 

the numbers for our key metrics which include our daus maus and average revenue per user arpu are calculated using internal company data based on the activity of user accounts while these numbers are based on what we believe to be reasonable estimates of our user base for the applicable period of measurement there are inherent challenges in measuring usage of our products across large online and mobile populations around the world in addition we are continually seeking to improve our estimates of our user base and such estimates may change due to improvements or changes in our methodology 

we regularly evaluate these metrics to estimate the number of duplicate and false accounts among our maus a duplicate account is one that a user maintains in addition to his or her principal account we divide false accounts into two categories 1 usermisclassified accounts where users have created personal profiles for a business organization or nonhuman entity such as a pet such entities are permitted on facebook using a page rather than a personal profile under our terms of service and 2 undesirable accounts which represent user profiles that we determine are intended to be used for purposes that violate our terms of service such as spamming the estimates of duplicate and false accounts are based on an internal review of a limited sample of accounts and we apply significant judgment in making this determination for example to identify duplicate accounts we use data signals such as similar ip addresses or user names and to identify false accounts we look for names that appear to be fake or other behavior that appears inauthentic to the reviewers our estimates may change as our methodologies evolve including through the application of new data signals or technologies which may allow us to identify previously undetected duplicate or false accounts and may improve our ability to evaluate a broader population of our users duplicate and false accounts are very difficult to measure at our scale and it is possible that the actual number of duplicate and false accounts may vary significantly from our estimates 

in the fourth quarter of 2018 we estimate that duplicate accounts may have represented approximately 11 of our worldwide maus we believe the percentage of duplicate accounts is meaningfully higher in developing markets such as the philippines and vietnam as compared to more developed markets in the fourth quarter of 2018 we estimate that false accounts may have represented approximately 5 of our worldwide maus our estimation of false accounts can vary as a result of episodic spikes in the creation 

of such accounts which we have seen originate more frequently in specific countries such as indonesia and vietnam from time to time we may make product changes or take other actions to reduce the number of duplicate or false accounts among our users which may also reduce our dau and mau estimates in a particular period 

our data limitations may affect our understanding of certain details of our business for example while userprovided data indicates a decline in usage among younger users this age data is unreliable because a disproportionate number of our younger users register with an inaccurate age accordingly our understanding of usage by age group may not be complete 

in addition our data regarding the geographic location of our users is estimated based on a number of factors such as the users ip address and selfdisclosed location these factors may not always accurately reflect the users actual location for example a user may appear to be accessing facebook from the location of the proxy server that the user connects to rather than from the users actual location the methodologies used to measure user metrics may also be susceptible to algorithm or other technical errors our estimates for revenue by user location and revenue by user device are also affected by these factors we regularly review our processes for calculating these metrics and from time to time we may discover inaccuracies in our metrics or make adjustments to improve their accuracy including adjustments that may result in the recalculation of our historical metrics we believe that any such inaccuracies or adjustments are immaterial unless otherwise stated we intend to disclose our estimates of the number of duplicate and false accounts among our maus on an annual basis in addition our dau and mau estimates will differ from estimates published by third parties due to differences in methodology 

in addition from time to time we provide or rely on certain other metrics including those relating to the reach and effectiveness of our ads all of our metrics are subject to software bugs inconsistencies in our systems and human error if marketers developers or investors do not perceive our metrics to be accurate or if we discover material inaccuracies in our metrics we may be subject to liability our reputation may be harmed and marketers and developers may be less willing to allocate their budgets or resources to facebook which could negatively affect our business and financial results 

we cannot assure you that we will effectively manage our growth 

our employee headcount and the scope and complexity of our business have increased significantly with the number of employees increasing to 35587  as of december 31 2018 from 25105  as of december 31 2017 and we expect such headcount growth to continue for the foreseeable future in addition we plan to continue to hire a number of employees and contractors in order to address various safety security and content review initiatives the growth and expansion of our business and products create significant challenges for our management operational and financial resources including managing multiple relationships with users marketers developers and other third parties as our operations and the number of our thirdparty relationships continue to grow our information technology systems or our internal controls and procedures may not be adequate to support such growth in addition some members of our management do not have significant experience managing a large global business operation so our management may not be able to manage such growth effectively to effectively manage our growth we must continue to improve our operational financial and management processes and systems and to effectively expand train and manage our personnel as our organization continues to grow and we are required to implement more complex organizational management structures we may find it increasingly difficult to maintain the benefits of our corporate culture including our ability to quickly develop and launch new and innovative products this could negatively affect our business performance 

the loss of one or more of our key personnel or our failure to attract and retain other highly qualified personnel in the future could harm our business 

we currently depend on the continued services and performance of our key personnel including mark zuckerberg and sheryl k sandberg although we have entered into employment agreements with mr zuckerberg and ms sandberg the agreements have no specific duration and constitute atwill employment in addition many of our key technologies and systems are custommade for our business by our personnel the loss of key personnel including members of management as well as key engineering product development marketing and sales personnel could disrupt our operations and have an adverse effect on our business 

as we continue to grow we cannot guarantee we will continue to attract and retain the personnel we need to maintain our competitive position in particular we intend to continue to hire a significant number of technical personnel in the foreseeable future and we expect to continue to face significant competition from other companies in hiring such personnel particularly in the san francisco bay area where our headquarters are located and where the cost of living is high as we continue to mature the incentives to attract retain and motivate employees provided by our equity awards or by future arrangements may not be as effective as in the past and if we issue significant equity to attract additional employees or to retain our existing employees we would incur substantial additional sharebased compensation expense and the ownership of our existing stockholders would be further diluted our ability to attract retain and motivate employees may also be adversely affected by stock price volatility as a result of these factors it may be difficult for us to continue to retain and motivate our employees if we do not succeed in attracting hiring and integrating excellent personnel or retaining and motivating existing personnel we may be unable to grow effectively 

we may not be able to continue to successfully maintain or grow usage of and engagement with mobile and web applications that integrate with facebook and our other products 

we have made and are continuing to make investments to enable developers to build grow and monetize mobile and web applications that integrate with facebook and our other products such existing and prospective developers may not be successful in building growing or monetizing mobile andor web applications that create and maintain user engagement additionally developers may choose to build on other platforms including mobile platforms controlled by third parties rather than building products that integrate with facebook and our other products we are continuously seeking to balance the distribution objectives of our developers with our desire to provide an optimal user experience and we may not be successful in achieving a balance that continues to attract and retain such developers for example from time to time we have taken actions to reduce the volume of communications from these developers to users on facebook and our other products with the objective of enhancing the user experience and such actions have reduced distribution from user engagement with and our monetization opportunities from mobile and web applications integrated with our products in addition as part of our investment in safety and security we are conducting investigations and audits of a large number of platform applications and we also recently announced several product changes that restrict developer access to certain user data in some instances these actions as well as other actions to enforce our policies applicable to developers have adversely affected or will adversely affect our relationships with developers if we are not successful in our efforts to maintain or grow the number of developers that choose to build products that integrate with facebook and our other products or if we are unable to continue to build and maintain good relations with such developers our user growth and user engagement and our financial results may be adversely affected 

payment transactions may subject us to additional regulatory requirements and other risks that could be costly and difficult to comply with or that could harm our business 

our users can purchase virtual and digital goods from developers that offer applications using our payments infrastructure on the facebook website in addition certain of our users can use our payments infrastructure including on messenger for other activities such as sending money to other users and making donations to certain charitable organizations we are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the united states europe and elsewhere including those governing antimoney laundering and counterterrorist financing money transmission gift cards and other prepaid access instruments electronic funds transfer charitable fundraising and import and export restrictions depending on how our payments product evolves we may also be subject to other laws and regulations including those governing gambling banking and lending in some jurisdictions the application or interpretation of these laws and regulations is not clear to increase flexibility in how our use of payments may evolve and to mitigate regulatory uncertainty we have received certain money transmitter licenses in the united states and an electronic money emoney license that allows us to conduct certain regulated payment activities in the participating member countries of the european economic area which will generally require us to demonstrate compliance with many domestic and foreign laws in these areas our efforts to comply with these laws and regulations could be costly and result in diversion of management time and effort and may still not guarantee compliance in the event that we are found to be in violation of any such legal or regulatory requirements we may be subject to monetary fines or other penalties such as a cease and desist order or we may be required to make product changes any of which could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results 

in addition we may be subject to a variety of additional risks as a result of payments transactions including increased costs and diversion of management time and effort and other resources to deal with bad transactions or customer disputes potential fraudulent or otherwise illegal activity by users developers employees or third parties restrictions on the investment of consumer funds used to transact payments and additional disclosure and reporting requirements we also intend to launch certain payments functionality on whatsapp which may subject us to many of the foregoing risks 

we have significant international operations and plan to continue expanding our operations abroad where we have more limited operating experience and this may subject us to increased business and economic risks that could affect our financial results 

we have significant international operations and plan to continue the international expansion of our business operations and the translation of our products we currently make facebook available in more than 100 different languages and we have offices or data centers in more than 30 different countries we may enter new international markets where we have limited or no experience in marketing selling and deploying our products our products are generally available globally but some or all of our products or functionality may not be available in certain markets due to legal and regulatory complexities for example facebook and certain of our other products are not generally available in china we also outsource certain operational functions to thirdparty vendors globally if we fail to deploy manage or oversee our international operations successfully our business may suffer in addition we are subject to a variety of risks inherent in doing business internationally including 



property and terrestrial infrastructure matters 

 if we are unable to expand internationally and manage the complexity of our global operations successfully our financial results could be adversely affected 

we face design manufacturing and supply chain risks that if not properly managed could adversely impact our financial results 

we face a number of risks related to design manufacturing and supply chain management with respect to our consumer hardware products for example the consumer hardware products we sell may have quality issues resulting from the design or manufacture of the products or from the software used in the products sometimes these issues may be caused by components we purchase from other manufacturers or suppliers if the quality of our consumer hardware products does not meet our customers expectations or such products are found to be defective then our brand and financial results could be adversely affected 

we rely on third parties to manufacture and manage the logistics of transporting and distributing our consumer hardware products we may experience supply shortages or other disruptions in logistics or the supply chain in the future that could result in shipping delays and negatively impact our operations we could be negatively affected if we are not able to engage third parties with the necessary capabilities or capacity on reasonable terms or if those we engage with fail to meet their obligations whether due to financial difficulties or other reasons or make adverse changes in the pricing or other material terms of such arrangements with them 

we also require the suppliers and business partners of our consumer hardware products to comply with laws and certain company policies regarding sourcing practices and standards on labor health and safety the environment and business ethics but we do not control them or their practices and standards if any of them violates laws fails to implement changes in accordance with newly enacted laws or implements practices or standards regarded as unethical corrupt or noncompliant we could experience supply chain disruptions government action or fines canceled orders or damage to our reputation 

we may face inventory risk with respect to our consumer hardware products 

we may be exposed to inventory risks with respect to our consumer hardware products as a result of rapid changes in product cycles and pricing unsafe or defective merchandise changes in consumer demand and consumer spending patterns changes in consumer tastes with respect to our consumer hardware products and other factors we endeavor to accurately predict these trends and avoid overstocking or understocking consumer hardware products we may sell demand for products however can change significantly between the time inventory or components are ordered and the date of sale in addition when we begin selling or manufacturing a new consumer hardware product it may be difficult to establish vendor relationships determine appropriate product 

or component selection and accurately forecast demand the acquisition of certain types of inventory or components may require significant leadtime and prepayment and they may not be returnable any one of these factors may adversely affect our operating results 

we may have exposure to greater than anticipated tax liabilities 

our tax obligations including income and nonincome taxes are based in part on our corporate operating structure and intercompany arrangements including the manner in which we operate our business develop value manage protect and use our intellectual property and the valuations of our intercompany transactions the tax laws applicable to our business including the laws of the united states and other jurisdictions are subject to interpretation and certain jurisdictions are aggressively interpreting their laws in new ways in an effort to raise additional tax revenue from companies such as facebook we are subject to regular review and audit by us federal state and foreign tax authorities tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken including our methodologies for valuing developed technology or intercompany arrangements and any adverse outcome of such a review or audit could increase our worldwide effective tax rate increase the amount of nonincome taxes imposed on our business and harm our financial position results of operations and cash flows for example in 2016 and 2018 the irs issued formal assessments relating to transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries in conjunction with the examination of the 2010 through 2013 tax years although we disagree with the irss position and are contesting this issue the ultimate resolution is uncertain and if resolved in a manner unfavorable to us may adversely affect our financial results 

the determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires significant judgment by management and there are many transactions where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain our provision for income taxes is determined by the manner in which we operate our business and any changes to such operations or laws applicable to such operations may affect our effective tax rate although we believe that our provision for income taxes and estimates of our nonincome tax liabilities are reasonable the ultimate settlement may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements and may materially affect our financial results in the period or periods for which such determination is made   

our future income tax rates could be volatile and difficult to predict due to changes in jurisdictional profit split changes in the amount and recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities or by changes in tax laws regulations or accounting principles 

changes in tax laws or tax rulings could materially affect our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

the tax regimes we are subject to or operate under including income and nonincome taxes are unsettled and may be subject to significant change changes in tax laws or tax rulings or changes in interpretations of existing laws could materially affect our financial position results of operations and cash flows for example the 2017 tax cuts and jobs act tax act enacted in december 2017 had a significant impact on our tax obligations and effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2017 and the issuance of additional regulatory or accounting guidance related to the tax act could materially affect our tax obligations and effective tax rate in the period issued in addition the ninth circuit court of appeals is expected to issue a decision in altera corp v commissioner  regarding the treatment of sharebased compensation expense in a cost sharing arrangement which could have a material effect on our tax obligations and effective tax rate for the quarter in which the decision is issued in addition many countries in europe as well as a number of other countries and organizations have recently proposed or recommended changes to existing tax laws or have enacted new laws that could significantly increase our tax obligations in many countries where we do business or require us to change the manner in which we operate our business 

the organization for economic cooperation and development has been working on a base erosion and profit shifting project and issued a report in 2015 an interim report in 2018 and is expected to continue to issue guidelines and proposals that may change various aspects of the existing framework under which our tax obligations are determined in many of the countries in which we do business similarly the european commission and several countries have issued proposals that would change various aspects of the current tax framework under which we are taxed these proposals include changes to the existing framework to calculate income tax as well as proposals to change or impose new types of nonincome taxes including taxes based on a percentage of revenue for example the united kingdom spain italy and france have each proposed taxes applicable to digital services which includes business activities on social media platforms and online marketplaces and would likely apply to our business 

the european commission has conducted investigations in multiple countries focusing on whether local country tax rulings or tax legislation provides preferential tax treatment that violates european union state aid rules and concluded that certain countries including ireland have provided illegal state aid in certain cases these investigations may result in changes to the tax treatment of our foreign operations 

due to the large and expanding scale of our international business activities many of these types of changes to the taxation of our activities described above could increase our worldwide effective tax rate increase the amount of nonincome taxes imposed on our business and harm our financial position results of operations and cash flows such changes may also apply retroactively to our historical operations and result in taxes greater than the amounts estimated and recorded in our financial statements 

we cannot guarantee that our share repurchase program will be fully consummated or that it will enhance longterm stockholder value share repurchases could also increase the volatility of the trading price of our stock and will diminish our cash reserves 

although our board of directors has authorized a share repurchase program that commenced in 2017 and does not have an expiration date the program does not obligate us to repurchase any specific dollar amount or to acquire any specific number of shares of our class a common stock we cannot guarantee that the program will be fully consummated or that it will enhance longterm stockholder value the program could affect the trading price of our stock and increase volatility and any announcement of a termination of this program may result in a decrease in the trading price of our stock in addition this program will diminish our cash reserves 

risks related to ownership of our class a common stock 

the trading price of our class a common stock has been and will likely continue to be volatile 

the trading price of our class a common stock has been and is likely to continue to be volatile since shares of our class a common stock were sold in our initial public offering in may 2012 at a price of 3800 per share our stock price has ranged from 1755  to 21862  through december 31 2018 in addition to the factors discussed in this annual report on form 10k the trading price of our class a common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to numerous factors many of which are beyond our control including 

 in addition the stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many technology companies stock prices of many technology companies have fluctuated in a manner unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies we are currently subject to securities litigation in connection with our platform and user data practices and the misuse of certain data by a developer that shared such data with third parties in violation of our terms and policies as well as the disclosure of our earnings results for the second quarter of 2018 we may experience more such litigation following future periods of volatility any securities litigation could subject us to substantial costs divert resources and the attention of management from our business and adversely affect our business 

we do not intend to pay cash dividends for the foreseeable future 

we have never declared or paid cash dividends on our capital stock we currently intend to retain any future earnings to finance the operation and expansion of our business and fund our share repurchase program and we do not expect to declare or pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future as a result you may only receive a return on your investment in our class a common stock if the trading price of your shares increases 

the dual class structure of our common stock and a voting agreement between certain stockholders have the effect of concentrating voting control with our ceo and certain other holders of our class b common stock this will limit or preclude your ability to influence corporate matters 

our class b common stock has ten votes per share and our class a common stock has one vote per share stockholders who hold shares of class b common stock including certain of our executive officers employees and directors and their affiliates together hold a substantial majority of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock because of the tentoone voting ratio between our class b and class a common stock the holders of our class b common stock collectively control a majority of the combined voting power of our common stock and therefore are able to control all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval so long as the shares of class b common stock represent at least 91 of all outstanding shares of our class a and class b common stock this concentrated control will limit or preclude your ability to influence corporate matters for the foreseeable future 

transfers by holders of class b common stock will generally result in those shares converting to class a common stock subject to limited exceptions such as certain transfers effected for estate planning or charitable purposes the conversion of class b common stock to class a common stock will have the effect over time of increasing the relative voting power of those holders of class b common stock who retain their shares in the long term if for example mr zuckerberg retains a significant portion of his holdings of class b common stock for an extended period of time he could in the future continue to control a majority of the combined voting power of our outstanding capital stock 

our status as a controlled company could make our class a common stock less attractive to some investors or otherwise harm our stock price 

because we qualify as a controlled company under the corporate governance rules for nasdaqlisted companies we are not required to have a majority of our board of directors be independent nor are we required to have a compensation committee or an independent nominating function in light of our status as a controlled company our board of directors determined not to have a separate and independent nominating function and chose to have the full board of directors be directly responsible for nominating members of our board and in the future we could elect not to have a majority of our board of directors be independent or not to have a compensation committee accordingly should the interests of our controlling stockholder differ from those of other stockholders the other stockholders may not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the corporate governance rules for nasdaqlisted companies our status as a controlled company could make our class a common stock less attractive to some investors or otherwise harm our stock price 

delaware law and provisions in our restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws could make a merger tender offer or proxy contest difficult thereby depressing the trading price of our class a common stock 

our status as a delaware corporation and the antitakeover provisions of the delaware general corporation law may discourage delay or prevent a change in control by prohibiting us from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years after the person becomes an interested stockholder even if a change of control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders in addition our current restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that may make the acquisition of our company more difficult including the following

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

tableend you should read the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data of this annual report on form 10k in addition to our historical consolidated financial information the following discussion contains forwardlooking statements that reflect our plans estimates and beliefs our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forwardlooking statements factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k particularly in part i item 1a risk factors for a discussion of limitations in the measurement of certain of our user metrics see the section entitled limitations of key metrics and other data in this annual report on form 10k 

certain revenue information in the section entitled  — revenue — foreign exchange impact on revenue is presented on a constant currency basis this information is a nongaap financial measure to calculate revenue on a constant currency basis we translated revenue for the full year 2018  using 2017  monthly exchange rates for our settlement currencies other than the us dollar this nongaap financial measure is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for or superior to financial information prepared and presented in accordance with gaap this measure may be different from nongaap financial measures used by other companies limiting its usefulness for comparison purposes moreover presentation of revenue on a constant currency basis is provided for yearoveryear comparison purposes and investors should be cautioned that the effect of changing foreign currency exchange rates has an actual effect on our operating results we believe this nongaap financial measure provides investors with useful supplemental information about the financial performance of our business enables comparison of financial results between periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance and allows for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in operating our business 

executive overview of full year 2018  results 

our key user metrics and financial results for 2018  are as follows 

user growth 

 financial results 

 in 2018  we continued to focus on our main revenue growth priorities i helping marketers use our products to connect with consumers where they are and ii making our ads more relevant and effective 

we continued to invest based on our roadmap in i our most developed ecosystems facebook and instagram ii driving growth and building ecosystems around our products that already have significant user bases such as messenger and whatsapp as well as continuing to grow features like stories and iii longterm technology initiatives such as connectivity artificial intelligence and augmented and virtual reality that we believe will further our mission to give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together we intend to continue to invest based on this roadmap and we anticipate that additional investments in the following areas will continue to drive significant yearoveryear expense growth in 2019 i expanding our data center capacity network infrastructure and office facilities as well as scaling our headcount to support our growth and ii investments in safety and security marketing video content and our longterm technology initiatives expense growth exceeded revenue growth in 2018 which we anticipate will continue in 2019 

trends in our user metrics 

the numbers for our key metrics our daus maus and average revenue per user arpu do not include instagram whatsapp or oculus users unless they would otherwise qualify as such users respectively based on their other activities on facebook in addition other user engagement metrics do not include instagram whatsapp or oculus unless otherwise specifically stated 

trends in the number of users affect our revenue and financial results by influencing the number of ads we are able to show the value of our ads to marketers the volume of payments transactions as well as our expenses and capital expenditures substantially all of our daily and monthly active users as defined below access facebook on mobile devices 

 

note for purposes of reporting daus maus and arpu by geographic region europe includes all users in russia and turkey and rest of world includes all users in africa latin america and the middle east 

worldwide daus increased 9  to 152 billion on average during december 2018  from 140 billion  during december 2017  users in india indonesia and the philippines represented key sources of growth in daus during december 2018  relative to the same period in 2017 

 

as of december 31 2018  we had 232 billion  maus an increase of 9  from december 31 2017  users in india indonesia and the philippines represented key sources of growth in 2018  relative to the same period in 2017 

trends in our monetization by user geography 

we calculate our revenue by user geography based on our estimate of the geography in which ad impressions are delivered virtual and digital goods are purchased or consumer hardware devices are shipped we define arpu as our total revenue in a given geography during a given quarter divided by the average of the number of maus in the geography at the beginning and end of the quarter while arpu includes all sources of revenue the number of maus used in this calculation only includes users of facebook and messenger as described in the definition of mau above revenue from users who are not also facebook or messenger maus was not material the geography of our users affects our revenue and financial results because we currently monetize users in different geographies at different average rates our revenue and arpu in regions such as united states  canada and europe are relatively higher primarily due to the size and maturity of those online and mobile advertising markets for example arpu in 2018  in the united states  canada region was more than ten times higher than in the asiapacific region 

note our revenue by user geography in the charts above is geographically apportioned based on our estimation of the geographic location of our users when they perform a revenuegenerating activity this allocation differs from our revenue disaggregated by geography disclosure in our consolidated financial statements where revenue is geographically apportioned based on the location of the customer 

for 2018  worldwide arpu was 2496  an increase of 24  from 2017  over this period arpu increased by 34 in europe 33 in united states  canada 21 in rest of world and 20 in asiapacific  in addition user growth was more rapid in geographies with relatively lower arpu such as asiapacific and rest of world we expect that user growth in the future will be primarily concentrated in those regions where arpu is relatively lower such that worldwide arpu may continue to increase at a slower rate relative to arpu in any geographic region or potentially decrease even if arpu increases in each geographic region 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue costs and expenses and related disclosures we evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis our estimates are based on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances our actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made if different estimates reasonably could have been used or if changes in the estimate that are reasonably possible could materially impact the financial statements we believe that the assumptions and estimates associated with income taxes loss contingencies and business combinations and valuation of goodwill and other acquired intangible assets have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements therefore we consider these to be our critical accounting policies and estimates for further information on all of our significant accounting policies see note 1—summary of significant accounting policies in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data of this annual report on form 10k 

income taxes 

we are subject to income taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes and income tax assets and liabilities including evaluating uncertainties in the application of accounting principles and complex tax laws 

we record a provision for income taxes for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations using the asset and liability method under this method we recognize deferred income tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities as well as for loss and tax credit carryforwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the tax rates that are expected to apply to taxable income for the years in which those tax assets and liabilities are expected to be realized or settled we recognize the deferred income tax effects of a change in tax rates in the period of the enactment we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the net amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized 

we recognize tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if we believe that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position these uncertain tax positions include our estimates for transfer pricing that have been developed based upon analyses of appropriate armslength prices similarly our estimates related to uncertain tax positions concerning research tax credits are based on an assessment of whether our available documentation corroborating the nature of our activities supporting the tax credits will be sufficient although we believe that we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions including net interest and penalties we can provide no assurance that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be materially different we make adjustments to these reserves in accordance with the income tax accounting guidance when facts and circumstances change such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts recorded such differences will affect the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made and could have a material impact on our financial condition and operating results 

on december 22 2017 the 2017 tax cuts and jobs act tax act was enacted into law and the new legislation contains several key tax provisions that affected us including a onetime mandatory transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings and a reduction of the corporate income tax rate to 21 effective january 1 2018 among others we are required to recognize the effect of the tax law changes in the period of enactment such as determining the transition tax remeasuring our us deferred tax assets and liabilities as well as reassessing the net realizability of our deferred tax assets and liabilities in december 2017 the sec staff issued staff accounting bulletin no 118 income tax accounting implications of the tax cuts and jobs act sab 118 which allowed us to record provisional amounts during a measurement period not to extend beyond one year of the enactment date as a result we previously provided a provisional estimate of the effect of the tax act in our financial statements in the fourth quarter of 2018 we completed our analysis to determine the effect of the tax act and recorded immaterial adjustments as of december 31 2018 

loss contingencies 

we are involved in legal proceedings claims and regulatory tax or government inquiries and investigations that arise in the ordinary course of business certain of these matters include speculative claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts of damages we record a liability when we believe that it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated if we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of loss can be estimated we disclose the possible loss in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements 

we review the developments in our contingencies that could affect the amount of the provisions that have been previously recorded and the matters and related reasonably possible losses disclosed we make adjustments to our provisions and changes to our disclosures 

accordingly to reflect the impact of negotiations settlements rulings advice of legal counsel and updated information significant judgment is required to determine both the probability and the estimated amount of loss 

the outcome of these matters is inherently uncertain therefore if one or more of these matters were resolved against us for amounts in excess of managements expectations our results of operations and financial condition including in a particular reporting period in which any such outcome becomes probable and estimable could be materially adversely affected see note 9—commitments and contingencies and note 12—income taxes of the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data and part i item 3 legal proceedings of this annual report on form 10k for additional information regarding these contingencies 

business combinations and valuation of goodwill and other acquired intangible assets 

we allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired liabilities assumed and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values the excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill such valuations require management to make significant estimates and assumptions especially with respect to intangible assets significant estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from acquired users acquired technology and trade names from a market participant perspective useful lives and discount rates management’s estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and as a result actual results may differ from estimates during the measurement period which is not to exceed one year from the acquisition date we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill upon the conclusion of the measurement period any subsequent adjustments are recorded to earnings 

we review goodwill for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances would more likely than not reduce the fair value of our single reporting unit below its carrying value as of december 31 2018  no impairment of goodwill has been identified 

acquired finitelived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives we evaluate the recoverability of our intangible assets for possible impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable the evaluation is performed at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities recoverability of these assets is measured by a comparison of the carrying amounts to the future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate if such review indicates that the carrying amount of property and equipment and intangible assets is not recoverable the carrying amount of such assets is reduced to fair value we have not recorded any significant impairment charges during the years presented 

in addition to the recoverability assessment we routinely review the remaining estimated useful lives of our finitelived intangible assets if we reduce the estimated useful life assumption for any asset the remaining unamortized balance would be amortized over the revised estimated useful life 

components of results of operations 

revenue 

advertising  we generate substantially all of our revenue from advertising our advertising revenue is generated by displaying ad products on facebook instagram messenger and thirdparty affiliated websites or mobile applications marketers pay for ad products either directly or through their relationships with advertising agencies or resellers based on the number of impressions delivered or the number of actions such as clicks taken by users 

we recognize revenue from the display of impressionbased ads in the contracted period in which the impressions are delivered impressions are considered delivered when an ad is displayed to a user we recognize revenue from the delivery of actionbased ads in the period in which a user takes the action the marketer contracted for the number of ads we show is subject to methodological changes as we continue to evolve our ads business and the structure of our ads products we calculate price per ad as total ad revenue divided by the number of ads delivered representing the effective price paid per impression by a marketer regardless of their desired objective such as impression or action for advertising revenue arrangements where we are not the principal we recognize revenue on a net basis 

payments and other fees  payments revenue is comprised of the net fee we receive from developers using our payments infrastructure our other fees revenue consists primarily of revenue from the delivery of consumer hardware devices as well as revenue from various other sources 

cost of revenue and operating expenses 

cost of revenue our cost of revenue consists primarily of expenses associated with the delivery and distribution of our products these include expenses related to the operation of our data centers such as facility and server equipment depreciation salaries benefits and sharebased compensation for employees on our operations teams and energy and bandwidth costs cost of revenue also includes costs associated with partner arrangements including traffic acquisition and content acquisition costs credit card and other transaction fees related to processing customer transactions and cost of consumer hardware device inventory sold   

research and development  research and development expenses consist primarily of sharebased compensation salaries and benefits for employees on our engineering and technical teams who are responsible for building new products as well as improving existing products we expense all of our research and development costs as they are incurred

revenue 



  

2018  compared to 2017  revenue in 2018  increased 1519 billion  or 37  compared to 2017  the increase was mostly due to an increase in advertising revenue 

the most important factor driving advertising revenue growth was an increase in revenue from ads on mobile devices for 2018  we estimate that mobile advertising revenue represented approximately 92  of total advertising revenue as compared with approximately 88  in 2017  the increase in advertising revenue for 2018 was due to increases in the number of ads delivered and the average price per ad in 2018  compared to 2017  the number of ads delivered increased by 22 as compared with approximately 15 in 2017  and the average price per ad increased by 13 as compared with approximately 29 in 2017  

the increase in the ads delivered was driven by an increase in users and their engagement and an increase in the number and frequency of ads displayed across our products the increase in average price per ad was driven by an increase in demand for our ad inventory factors contributing to the increase in demand for our ad inventory include an increase in spend from existing marketers and an increase in the number of marketers actively advertising on our platform as well as the quality relevance and performance of those ads we anticipate that future advertising revenue growth will be driven by a combination of price and the number of ads displayed 

advertising spending is traditionally seasonally strong in the fourth quarter of each year we believe that this seasonality in advertising spending affects our quarterly results which generally reflect significant growth in advertising revenue between the third and fourth quarters and a decline in advertising spending between the fourth and subsequent first quarters for instance our advertising revenue increased 23 26 and 27 between the third and fourth quarters of 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively while advertising revenue for both the first quarters of 2018  and 2017  declined 8 and 9 compared to the fourth quarters of 2017  and 2016  respectively 

2017  compared to 2016  revenue in 2017 increased 1302 billion or 47 compared to 2016 the increase was mostly due to an increase in advertising revenue 

the most important factor driving advertising revenue growth was an increase in revenue from ads on mobile devices for 2017 we estimate that mobile advertising revenue represented approximately 88 of total advertising revenue as compared with approximately 83 in 2016 factors that influenced our advertising revenue growth in 2017 included i an increase in average price per ad ii an increase in users and their engagement and iii an increase in the number and frequency of ads displayed on mobile devices 

in 2017 compared to 2016 the average price per ad increased by 29 as compared with approximately 5 in 2016 and the number of ads delivered increased by 15 as compared with approximately 50 in 2016 the increase in average price per ad was driven by an increase in demand for our ad inventory factors contributing to this include an increase in spend from existing marketers and an increase in the number of marketers actively advertising on our platform as well as the quality relevance and performance of those ads the increase in the ads delivered was driven by an increase in users and their engagement and an increase in the number and frequency of ads displayed on news feed partially offset by increasing user engagement with video content and other product 

changes 

no customer represented 10 or more of total revenue during the years ended december 31 2018  2017  and 2016  

foreign exchange impact on revenue 

the general weakening of the us dollar relative to certain foreign currencies in the full year 2018 compared to the same period in 2017  and in the full year 2017 compared to the same period in 2016 had a favorable impact on our revenue if we had translated revenue for the full year 2018 using the prior years monthly exchange rates for our settlement currencies other than the us dollar our total revenue and advertising revenue would have been 5544 billion  and 5461 billion  respectively if we had translated revenue for the full year 2017 using 2016 monthly exchange rates for our settlement currencies other than the us dollar our total revenue and advertising revenue would have been 4036 billion and 3965 billion respectively using these constant rates both total revenue and advertising revenue would have been 401 million  lower than actual revenue and advertising revenue for the full year 2018  and 293 million and 292 million lower than actual revenue and advertising revenue respectively for the full year 2017 

cost of revenue 



  

2018  compared to 2017  cost of revenue in 2018  increased 390 billion  or 72  compared to 2017  the increase was mostly due to an increase in operational expenses related to our data centers and technical infrastructure and higher costs associated with partnership agreements including traffic acquisition and content acquisition costs 

2017  compared to 2016  cost of revenue in 2017 increased 167 billion or 44 compared to 2016 the majority of the increase was due to an increase in operational expenses related to our data centers and technical infrastructure and to a lesser extent higher costs associated with partnership agreements including content acquisition costs and ads payment processing 

in 2019  we anticipate that the cost of revenue will increase as we continue to expand our data center capacity and technical infrastructure to support user growth increased user engagement and the delivery of new products and services and to a lesser extent due to higher costs associated with ads payment processing and various partnership agreements 

research and development 



  

2018  compared to 2017  research and development expenses in 2018  increased 252 billion  or 32  compared to 2017  the majority of the increase was due to an increase in payroll and benefits expense as a result of a 43  growth in employee headcount from december 31 2017  to december 31 2018  in engineering and other technical functions and to a lesser extent an increase in professional service expenses payroll and benefits expense growth was less than headcount growth partially due to a 473 million decrease in sharebased compensation related to the acquisitions completed in 2014 

2017  compared to 2016   research and development expenses in 2017 increased 184 billion or 31 compared to 2016 the majority of the increase was due to an increase in payroll and benefits as a result of a 49 growth in employee headcount from december 31 2016 to december 31 2017 in engineering and other technical functions partially offset by a 262 million decrease in sharebased compensation related to the acquisitions completed in 2014 

in 2019  we plan to continue to hire software engineers and other technical employees and to increase our investment to support our research and development initiatives we expect payroll and related expenses growth to be more consistent with headcount growth as sharebased compensation related to the acquisitions completed in 2014 are now substantially recognized 

marketing and sales 



  

2018  compared to 2017   marketing and sales expenses in 2018  increased 312 billion  or 66  compared to 2017  the increase was mostly driven by marketing community operations and payroll and benefits expenses our payroll and benefits expenses increased as a result of a 33  increase in employee headcount from december 31 2017  to december 31 2018  in our marketing and sales functions 

2017  compared to 2016  marketing and sales expenses in 2017 increased 953 million or 25 compared to 2016 the majority of the increase was due to increases in payroll and benefits expenses as a result of a 35 increase in employee headcount from december 31 2016 to december 31 2017 in our marketing and sales functions and increases in our consulting and other professional service fees 

in 2019  we plan to continue the hiring of marketing and sales employees to support our marketing sales and partnership efforts and to increase our investment in community operations to support our security efforts 

general and administrative 



  

2018  compared to 2017  general and administrative expenses in 2018  increased 934 million  or 37  compared to 2017  the increase was primarily due to increases in payroll and benefits expenses as a result of a 32  increase in employee headcount from december 31 2017  to december 31 2018  in general and administrative functions 

2017  compared to 2016  general and administrative expenses in 2017 increased 786 million or 45 compared to 2016 the majority of the increase was due to an increase in payroll and benefits expenses as a result of a 58 increase in employee headcount from december 31 2016 to december 31 2017 in general and administrative functions and to a lesser extent higher legalrelated costs 

in 2019  we plan to continue to increase general and administrative expenses to support overall company growth 

interest and other income expense net 



  

2018  compared to 2017  interest and other income net in 2018  increased 57 million  compared to 2017  the increase in 2018 was due to an increase in interest income driven by higher interest rates partially offset by an increase in other expense as a result of foreign exchange impact occurring from the periodic remeasurement of our foreign currency balances 

2017  compared to 2016  interest and other income net in 2017 increased 300 million compared to 2016 the majority of the increase in 2017 was due to an increase in interest income driven by higher invested cash balances and interest rates in addition foreign exchange impact resulting from the periodic remeasurement of our foreign currency assets and liabilities also contributed to the increase in 2017 

provision for income taxes 



  

2018  compared to 2017  our provision for income taxes in 2018  decreased 141 billion  or 30  compared to 2017  primarily due to a onetime expense of approximately 227 billion  in 2017 resulting from the tax act partially offset by an increase in income before provision for income taxes 

our effective tax rate in 2018 decreased compared to 2017 primarily due to a onetime tax expense of approximately 227 billion  related to the tax act in 2017 

2017  compared to 2016  our provision for income taxes in 2017 increased 236 billion  or 103  compared to 2016  mostly due to the effects of the tax act that was enacted on december 22 2017 and an increase in income before provision for income taxes partially offset by an increase in excess tax benefits recognized from sharebased compensation as a result of the tax act we recognized a onetime mandatory transition tax on accumulated foreign subsidiary earnings remeasured our us deferred tax assets and liabilities and reassessed the net realizability of our deferred tax assets and liabilities which increased our provision for income taxes in 2017 by 227 billion 

effective tax rate items our effective tax rate in the future will depend upon the proportion of our income before provision for income taxes earned in the united states and in jurisdictions with a tax rate lower than the us statutory rate as well as a number of other factors including excess tax benefits from sharebased compensation tax effects of integrating intellectual property from acquisitions settlement of tax contingency items tax effects of changes in our business and the impact of changes in tax law 

the proportion of our income before provision for income taxes earned in jurisdictions with a tax rate lower than the us statutory rate will depend upon the proportion of revenue and costs associated with the respective jurisdictions 

the accounting for sharebased compensation will increase or decrease our effective tax rate based upon the difference between our sharebased compensation expense and the deductions taken on our tax return which depends upon the stock price at the time of employee award vesting if our stock price remains constant to the january 28 2019 price we expect our effective tax rate for 2019 will be a few percentage points higher than our 2018 rate 

integrating intellectual property from acquisitions into our business generally involves intercompany transactions that have the impact of increasing our provision for income taxes consequently our provision for income taxes and our effective tax rate may initially increase in the period of an acquisition and integration the magnitude of this impact will depend upon the specific type size and taxing jurisdictions of the intellectual property as well as the relative contribution to income in subsequent periods 

on july 27 2015 the united states tax court tax court issued an opinion in altera corp v commissioner  tax court opinion which concluded that related parties in a cost sharing arrangement are not required to share expenses related to sharebased compensation the tax court opinion was appealed by the commissioner to the ninth circuit court of appeals ninth circuit on july 24 2018 the ninth circuit issued an opinion ninth circuit opinion that reversed the tax court opinion the ninth circuit opinion was subsequently withdrawn and the case is being reheard since the ninth circuit opinion was withdrawn we continue to treat our sharebased compensation expense in accordance with the tax court opinion we also continue to monitor developments in this case and any impact the final opinion could have on our consolidated financial statements had the ninth circuit not withdrawn its opinion our effective tax rate for 2018 would have been higher 

unrecognized tax benefits as of december 31 2018 we had net unrecognized tax benefits of 307 billion which were accrued as other liabilities these unrecognized tax benefits were predominantly accrued for uncertainties related to transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries which includes licensing of intellectual property providing services and other transactions as well as for uncertainties with our research tax credits the ultimate settlement of the liabilities will depend upon resolution of tax audits litigation or events that would otherwise change the assessment of such items based upon the status of litigation described below the current status of tax audits in various jurisdictions and excluding the effects of the altera corp v commissioner  case that we are monitoring we do not anticipate a significant impact to such amounts within the next 12 months 

in july 2016 we received a statutory notice of deficiency notice from the irs related to transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries in conjunction with the examination of the 2010 tax year while the notice applies only to the 2010 tax year the irs states that it will also apply its position for tax years subsequent to 2010 which if the irs prevails in its position could result in an additional federal tax liability of an estimated aggregate amount of up to approximately 50 billion in excess of the amounts in our originally filed us return plus interest and any penalties asserted we do not agree with the position of the irs and have filed a petition in the tax court challenging the notice in march 2018 we received a second notice from the irs in conjunction with the examination of our 2011 through 2013 tax years the irs applied its position from the 2010 tax year to each of these years and also proposed new adjustments related to other transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries and certain tax credits that we claimed if the irs prevails in its position for these new adjustments this could result in an additional federal tax liability of up to approximately 680 million in excess of the amounts in our originally filed us return plus interest and any penalties asserted we do not agree with the positions of the irs in the second notice and have filed a petition in the tax court challenging the second notice we have previously accrued an estimated unrecognized tax benefit consistent with the guidance in asc 740 that is lower than the potential additional federal tax liability from the positions taken by the irs in the two notices in addition if the irs prevails in its positions related to transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries the additional tax that we would owe would be partially offset by a reduction in the tax that we owe under the mandatory transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings from the tax act as of december 31 2018 we have not resolved these matters and proceedings continue in tax court 

we believe that adequate amounts have been reserved in accordance with asc 740 for any adjustments to the provision for income taxes or other tax items that may ultimately result from these examinations the timing of the resolution settlement and closure of any audits is highly uncertain and it is reasonably possible that the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits could significantly change in the next 12 months given the number of years remaining that are subject to examination in various jurisdictions we are unable to estimate the full range of possible adjustments to the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits if the taxing authorities prevail in the assessment of additional tax due the assessed tax interest and penalties if any could have a material adverse effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows

the following tables set forth our unaudited quarterly consolidated statements of income data in dollars and as a percentage of total revenue for each of the eight quarters in the period ended december 31 2018  we have prepared the quarterly consolidated statements of income data on a basis consistent with the audited consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data in this annual report on form 10k in the opinion of management the financial information reflects all adjustments consisting only of normal recurring adjustments which we consider necessary for a fair presentation of this data this information should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included in part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data in this annual report on form 10k the results of historical periods are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations for any future period 



sharebased compensation expense included in costs and expenses 





sharebased compensation expense included in costs and expenses 



liquidity and capital resources 



our principal sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents marketable securities and cash generated from operations cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities consist mostly of cash on deposit with banks investments in money market funds and investments in us government securities us government agency securities and corporate debt securities cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities were 4111 billion  as of december 31 2018  a decrease of 597 million  from december 31 2017  mostly due to 1392 billion  for purchases of property and equipment 1288 billion  for repurchases of our class a common stock and 321 billion  of taxes paid related to net share settlement of equity awards offset by 2927 billion  of cash generated from operations and a 500 million  increase in overdraft in cash pooling entities 

cash paid for income taxes was 376 billion  for the year ended december 31 2018  as of december 31 2018  our federal net operating loss carryforward was 788 billion  and we anticipate that none of this amount will be utilized to offset our federal taxable income in 2018 as of december 31 2018  we had 290 million  of federal tax credit carryforward of which none will be available to offset our federal tax liabilities in 2018 in addition we are monitoring the altera corp v commissioner  case as it applies to our facts and circumstances as it could increase our cash paid for income taxes 

 in may 2016 we entered into a 20 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility and any amounts outstanding under the facility will be due and payable on may 20 2021 as of december 31 2018  no amounts had been drawn down and we were in compliance with the covenants under this credit facility 

our board of directors has authorized a share repurchase program that commenced in 2017 and does not have an expiration date during the second quarter of 2018 we completed repurchases under the original authorization to purchase up to 60 billion  of our class a common stock in april 2018 the authorization for the repurchase of our class a common stock was increased by an additional 90 billion  and we completed repurchases under this authorization during the fourth quarter of 2018 in december 2018 our board of directors authorized an additional 90 billion  of repurchases under this program during the year ended december 31 2018  we repurchased and subsequently retired 79 million  shares of our class a common stock for 1293 billion  as of december 31 2018  90 billion  remained available and authorized for repurchases 

in 2018 we paid 321 billion  of taxes related to the net share settlement of equity awards 

in 2018 we established a multicurrency notional cash pool for certain of our entities with a thirdparty bank provider actual cash balances are not physically converted and are not commingled between participating legal entities as part of the notional cash pool agreement the bank extends overdraft credit to our participating entities as needed provided that the overall notionally pooled balance of all accounts in the pool at the end of each day is at least zero in the unlikely event of a default by our collective entities participating in the pool any overdraft balances incurred would be guaranteed by facebook inc see note 9—commitments and contingencies of the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data of this annual report on form 10k for additional information regarding our notional cash pooling arrangement 

as of december 31 2018  1628 billion  of the 4111 billion  in cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities was held by our foreign subsidiaries the tax act imposed a mandatory transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings and eliminated us taxes on foreign subsidiary distributions as a result earnings in foreign jurisdictions are available for distribution to the us without incremental us taxes 

we currently anticipate that our available funds credit facility and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our operational cash needs for the foreseeable future 

cash provided by operating activities 

cash flow from operating activities during 2018  mostly consisted of net income adjusted for certain noncash items such as total depreciation and amortization of 432 billion  and sharebased compensation expense of 415 billion  the increase in cash flow from operating activities during 2018  compared to 2017  was mostly due to an increase in net income adjusted for certain noncash items such as depreciation and amortization deferred income tax and sharebased compensation expense due to the enactment of the tax act in 2017 we recorded a higher tax liability in 2017 which partially offset the increase in cash flow from operating activities in 2018 

cash flow from operating activities during 2017 mostly consisted of net income adjusted for certain noncash items such as sharebased compensation expense of 372 billion and total depreciation and amortization of 303 billion the increase in cash flow from operating activities during 2017 compared to 2016 was mostly due to an increase in net income adjusted for certain noncash items such as depreciation and amortization and sharebased compensation expense due to the enactment of the tax act in 2017 we recorded a provisional tax liability of 29 billion relating to the onetime mandatory transition tax on our accumulated foreign earnings which also contributed to the increase in 2017 compared to 2016 

cash flow from operating activities during 2016 mostly consisted of net income adjusted for certain noncash items such as sharebased compensation expense of 322 billion and total depreciation and amortization of 234 billion the increase in cash flow from operating activities during 2016 compared to 2015 was mostly due to an increase in net income including the impact of asu 201609 adoption as adjusted for depreciation and amortization deferred income taxes and sharebased compensation expense 

cash used in investing activities 

cash used in investing activities during 2018  mostly resulted from 1392 billion  of capital expenditures as we continued to invest in data centers servers network infrastructure and office buildings offset by 247 billion  of net sales and maturities of marketable securities the decrease in cash used in investing activities during 2018  compared to 2017  was mostly due to a decrease in the net purchases of marketable securities partially offset by an increase in capital expenditures 

cash used in investing activities during 2017 mostly resulted from 1325 billion for net purchases of marketable securities and 673 billion for capital expenditures as we continued to invest in servers data centers office buildings and network infrastructure the increase in cash used in investing activities during 2017 compared to 2016 was due to increases in net purchases of marketable securities and capital expenditures 

cash used in investing activities during 2016 mostly resulted from 719 billion for net purchases of marketable securities and 449 billion for capital expenditures as we continued to invest in data centers servers office buildings and network infrastructure the increase in cash used in investing activities during 2016 compared to 2015 was mostly due to increases in capital expenditures and net purchases of marketable securities 

we anticipate making capital expenditures in 2019  of approximately 18 billion to 20 billion 

cash used in financing activities 

cash used in financing activities during 2018  consisted of 1288 billion paid for repurchases of our class a common stock and 321 billion of taxes paid related to net share settlement of equity awards offset by a 500 million  overdraft in cash pooling entities the increase in cash used in financing activities during 2018 compared to 2017 was mostly due to an increase in repurchases of our class a common stock partially offset by an increase in overdraft balances in cash pooling entities 

cash used in financing activities during 2017 mostly consisted of 325 billion of taxes paid related to net share settlement of equity awards and 198 billion paid for repurchases of our class a common stock the increase in cash used in financing activities during 2017 compared to 2016 was mostly due to taxes paid related to net share settlement of equity awards and repurchases of our class a common stock that commenced in 2017 

cash used in financing activities during 2016 mostly consisted of principal payments on capital lease and other financing obligations the increase in cash used in financing activities was due to full repayment of our capital lease and other financing obligations in 2016 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we did not have any offbalance sheet arrangements as of december 31 2018  

contractual obligations 

our principal commitments consist of obligations under operating leases which include among others certain of our offices data centers land and colocation leases as well as contractual commitments related to network infrastructure and data center operations the following table summarizes our commitments to settle contractual obligations in cash as of december 31 2018  in millions 



 

as part of the normal course of the business we may enter into multiyear agreements to purchase certain network components that do not specify a fixed or minimum price commitment or to purchase renewable energy that do not specify a fixed or minimum volume commitment these agreements are generally entered into in order to secure either volume or price using projected market prices or expected volume consumption the total estimated spend is approximately 60 billion the ultimate spend under these agreements may vary and will be based on prevailing market prices or actual volume purchased 

in addition our other liabilities include 307 billion  related to net uncertain tax positions as of december 31 2018  due to uncertainties in the timing of the completion of tax audits the timing of the resolution of these positions is uncertain and we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years beyond 12 months as a result this amount is not included in the above contractual obligations table 

contingencies 

we are involved in legal proceedings claims and regulatory tax or government inquiries and investigations we record a provision for a liability when we believe that it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and that the amount can be reasonably estimated if we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of loss can be estimated we disclose the possible loss in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements significant judgment is required to determine both probability and the estimated amount of loss such matters are inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties some of which are beyond our control should any of these estimates and assumptions change or prove to be incorrect it could have a material impact on our results of operations financial position and cash flows

recently issued accounting pronouncements 

in february 2016 the fasb issued accounting standards update no 201602 leases topic 842  asu 201602 as amended which generally requires lessees to recognize operating and financing lease liabilities and corresponding rightofuse assets on the balance sheet and to provide enhanced disclosures surrounding the amount timing and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leasing arrangements we will adopt the new standard effective january 1 2019 on a modified retrospective basis and will not restate comparative periods we will elect the package of practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance which allows us to carryforward our historical lease classification our assessment on whether a contract is or contains a lease and our initial direct costs for any leases that exist prior to adoption of the new standard we will also elect to combine lease and nonlease components and to keep leases with an initial term of 12 months or less off the balance sheet and recognize the associated lease payments in the consolidated statements of income on a straightline basis over the lease term we estimate approximately 6 billion  would be recognized as total rightofuse assets and total lease liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet as of january 1 2019 other than disclosed we do not expect the new standard to have a material impact on our remaining consolidated financial statements 

in january 2017 the fasb issued accounting standards update no 201704 intangibles — goodwill and other topic 350 simplifying the test for goodwill impairment asu 201704 which eliminates step two from the goodwill impairment test under asu 201704 an entity should recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value up to the amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit this guidance will be effective for us in the first quarter of 2020 on a prospective basis and early adoption is permitted we do not expect the standard to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend we are exposed to market risks including changes to foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and inflation 

foreign currency exchange risk 

we have foreign currency risks related to our revenue and operating expenses denominated in currencies other than the us dollar primarily the euro in general we are a net receiver of currencies other than the us dollar accordingly changes in exchange rates and in particular a strengthening of the us dollar have in the past and may in the future negatively affect our revenue and other operating results as expressed in us dollars 

we have experienced and will continue to experience fluctuations in our net income as a result of transaction gains or losses related to revaluing certain current asset and current liability balances that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the entities in which they are recorded at this time we have not entered into but in the future we may enter into derivatives or other financial instruments in an attempt to hedge our foreign currency exchange risk it is difficult to predict the effect hedging activities would have on our results of operations we recognized foreign currency losses of 213 million  6 million  and 76 million  in 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively 

interest rate sensitivity 

our exposure to changes in interest rates relates primarily to interest earned and market value on our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities 

our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities consist of cash certificates of deposit time deposits money market funds us government securities us government agency securities and corporate debt securities  our investment policy and strategy are focused on preservation of capital and supporting our liquidity requirements changes in us interest rates affect the interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities and the market value of those securities a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would have resulted in a decrease of 468 million  and 611 million  in the market value of our availableforsale debt securities as of december 31 2018  and december 31 2017  respectively any realized gains or losses resulting from such interest rate changes would only occur if we sold the investments prior to maturity

government regulation 

we are subject to a number of us federal and state and foreign laws and regulations that affect companies conducting business on the internet many of these laws and regulations are still evolving and being tested in courts and could be interpreted in ways that could harm our business these may involve user privacy data protection and personal information rights of publicity content intellectual property advertising marketing distribution data security data retention and deletion electronic contracts and other communications competition protection of minors consumer protection telecommunications product liability taxation economic or other trade prohibitions or sanctions securities law compliance and online payment services in particular we are subject to federal state and foreign laws regarding privacy and protection of peoples data foreign data protection privacy content competition and other laws and regulations can be more restrictive than those in the united states us federal and state and foreign laws and regulations which in some cases can be enforced by private parties in addition to government entities are constantly evolving and can be subject to significant change as a result the application interpretation and enforcement of these laws and regulations are often uncertain particularly in the new and rapidly evolving industry in which we operate and may be interpreted and applied inconsistently from country to country and inconsistently with our current policies and practices 

proposed or new legislation and regulations could also significantly affect our business there currently are a number of proposals pending before federal state and foreign legislative and regulatory bodies in addition the new european general data protection regulation gdpr will take effect in may 2018 and will apply to all of our products and services that provide service in europe the gdpr will include operational requirements for companies that receive or process personal data of residents of the european union that are different than those currently in place in the european union and will include significant penalties for non 

compliance similarly there are a number of legislative proposals in the united states at both the federal and state level that could impose new obligations in areas affecting our business such as liability for copyright infringement by third parties in addition some countries are considering or have passed legislation implementing data protection requirements or requiring local storage and processing of data or similar requirements that could increase the cost and complexity of delivering our services 

we are currently and may in the future be subject to regulatory orders or consent decrees violation of existing or future regulatory orders or consent decrees could subject us to substantial monetary fines and other penalties that could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations 

various laws and regulations in the united states and abroad such as the us bank secrecy act the doddfrank act the usa patriot act and the credit card act impose certain antimoney laundering requirements on companies that are financial institutions or that provide financial products and services under these laws and regulations financial institutions are broadly defined to include money services businesses such as money transmitters check cashers and sellers or issuers of stored value or prepaid access products requirements imposed on financial institutions under these laws include customer identification and verification programs record retention policies and procedures and transaction reporting to increase flexibility in how our online payments infrastructure payments may evolve and to mitigate regulatory uncertainty we have received certain money transmitter licenses in the united states and an electronic money emoney license that allows us to conduct certain regulated payment activities in the participating member countries of the european economic area which will generally require us to demonstrate compliance with many domestic and foreign laws relating to money transmission gift cards and other prepaid access instruments electronic funds transfers antimoney laundering charitable fundraising counterterrorist financing gambling banking and lending financial privacy and data security and import and export restrictions

 item 1a 

risk factors 

tableend certain factors may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations you should consider carefully the risks and uncertainties described below in addition to other information contained in this annual report on form 10k including our consolidated financial statements and related notes the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of or that we currently believe are not material may also become important factors that adversely affect our business if any of the following risks actually occurs our business financial condition results of operations and future prospects could be materially and adversely affected in that event the trading price of our class a common stock could decline and you could lose part or all of your investment 

risks related to our business and industry 

if we fail to retain existing users or add new users or if our users decrease their level of engagement with our products our revenue financial results and business may be significantly harmed 

the size of our user base and our users level of engagement are critical to our success our financial performance has been and will continue to be significantly determined by our success in adding retaining and engaging active users of our products particularly for facebook and instagram we anticipate that our active user growth rate will continue to decline over time as the size of our active user base increases and it is possible that the size of our active user base may fluctuate or decline in one or more markets particularly in markets where we have achieved higher penetration rates for example in the fourth quarter of 2017 we experienced a slight decline on a quarteroverquarter basis in the number of daily active users on facebook in the united states  canada region if people do not perceive our products to be useful reliable and trustworthy we may not be able to attract or retain users or otherwise maintain or increase the frequency and duration of their engagement a number of other social networking companies that achieved early popularity have since seen their active user bases or levels of engagement decline in some cases precipitously there is no guarantee that we will not experience a similar erosion of our active user base or engagement levels our user engagement patterns have changed over time and user engagement can be difficult to measure particularly as we introduce new and different products and services any number of factors could potentially negatively affect user retention growth and engagement including if 



the user experience such as security breaches or failure to prevent or limit spam or similar content 

 if we are unable to maintain or increase our user base and user engagement our revenue and financial results may be adversely affected any decrease in user retention growth or engagement could render our products less attractive to users marketers and developers which is likely to have a material and adverse impact on our revenue business financial condition and results of operations if our active user growth rate continues to slow we will become increasingly dependent on our ability to maintain or increase levels of user engagement and monetization in order to drive revenue growth 

we generate substantially all of our revenue from advertising the loss of marketers or reduction in spending by marketers could seriously harm our business 

substantially all of our revenue is currently generated from third parties advertising on facebook and instagram for 2017 2016 and 2015 advertising accounted for 98  97  and 95  respectively of our revenue as is common in the industry our marketers do not have longterm advertising commitments with us many of our marketers spend only a relatively small portion of their overall advertising budget with us marketers will not continue to do business with us or they will reduce the budgets they are willing to commit to us if we do not deliver ads in an effective manner or if they do not believe that their investment in advertising with us will generate a competitive return relative to other alternatives in addition our advertising revenue growth has become increasingly dependent upon increased pricing of our ads if we are unable to provide marketers with a suitable return on investment the pricing of our ads may not increase or may decline in which case our revenue and financial results may be harmed 

our advertising revenue could also be adversely affected by a number of other factors including 



 the occurrence of any of these or other factors could result in a reduction in demand for our ads which may reduce the prices we receive for our ads or cause marketers to stop advertising with us altogether either of which would negatively affect our revenue and financial results 

our user growth engagement and monetization on mobile devices depend upon effective operation with mobile operating systems networks and standards that we do not control 

the substantial majority of our revenue is generated from advertising on mobile devices there is no guarantee that popular mobile devices will continue to feature facebook or our other products or that mobile device users will continue to use our products rather than competing products we are dependent on the interoperability of facebook and our other products with popular mobile operating systems networks and standards that we do not control such as the android and ios operating systems any changes bugs or technical issues in such systems or changes in our relationships with mobile operating system partners handset manufacturers or mobile carriers or in their terms of service or policies that degrade our products functionality reduce or eliminate our ability to distribute our products give preferential treatment to competitive products limit our ability to deliver target or measure the effectiveness of ads or charge fees related to the distribution of our products or our delivery of ads could adversely affect the usage of facebook or our other products and monetization on mobile devices additionally in order to deliver high quality mobile products it is important that our products work well with a range of mobile technologies systems networks and standards that we do not control and that we have good relationships with handset manufacturers and mobile carriers we may not be successful in maintaining or developing relationships with key participants in the mobile ecosystem or in developing products that operate effectively with these technologies systems networks or standards in the event that it is more difficult for our users to access and use facebook or our other products on their mobile devices or if our users choose not to access or use facebook or our other products on their mobile devices or use mobile products that do not offer access to facebook or our other products our user growth and user engagement could be harmed from time to time we may also take actions regarding the distribution of our products or the operation of our business based on what we believe to be in our longterm best interests such actions may adversely affect our users and our relationships with the operators of mobile operating systems handset manufacturers mobile carriers or other business partners and there is no assurance that these actions will result in the anticipated longterm benefits in the event that our users are adversely affected by these actions or if our relationships with such third parties deteriorate our user growth engagement and monetization could be adversely affected and our business could be harmed 

our business is highly competitive competition presents an ongoing threat to the success of our business 

we compete with companies that sell advertising as well as with companies that provide social media and communication products and services that are designed to engage users on mobile devices and online we face significant competition in every aspect of our business including from companies that facilitate communication and the sharing of content and information companies that enable marketers to display advertising companies that distribute video and other forms of media content and companies that provide development platforms for applications developers we compete with companies that offer products across broad platforms that replicate capabilities we provide for example google has integrated social functionality into a number of its products including search video and android we also compete with companies that develop applications particularly mobile applications that provide social or other communications functionality such as messaging photo and videosharing and microblogging as well as companies that provide regional social networks that have strong positions in particular countries in addition we face competition from traditional online and mobile businesses that provide media for marketers to reach their audiences andor   develop tools and systems for managing and optimizing advertising campaigns we also compete with companies that develop and deliver virtual reality products and services 

some of our current and potential competitors may have significantly greater resources or stronger competitive positions in 

certain product segments geographic regions or user demographics than we do these factors may allow our competitors to respond more effectively than us to new or emerging technologies and changes in market conditions we believe that some users particularly younger users are aware of and actively engaging with other products and services similar to or as a substitute for facebook products and services and we believe that some users have reduced their use of and engagement with our products and services in favor of these other products and services in the event that users increasingly engage with other products and services we may experience a decline in use and engagement in key user demographics or more broadly in which case our business would likely be harmed 

our competitors may develop products features or services that are similar to ours or that achieve greater acceptance may undertake more farreaching and successful product development efforts or marketing campaigns or may adopt more aggressive pricing policies in addition developers whose mobile and web applications are integrated with facebook or our other products may use information shared by our users through our products in order to develop products or features that compete with us some competitors may gain a competitive advantage against us in areas where we operate including by integrating competing platforms applications or features into products they control such as mobile device operating systems search engines or web browsers by making acquisitions by limiting our ability to deliver target or measure the effectiveness of ads by imposing fees or other charges related to our delivery of ads by making access to our products more difficult or by making it more difficult to communicate with our users as a result our competitors may acquire and engage users or generate advertising or other revenue at the expense of our own efforts which may negatively affect our business and financial results in addition from time to time we may take actions in response to competitive threats but we cannot assure you that these actions will be successful or that they will not negatively affect our business and financial results 

we believe that our ability to compete effectively depends upon many factors both within and beyond our control including 

 if we are not able to compete effectively our user base and level of user engagement may decrease we may become less attractive to developers and marketers and our revenue and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected 

action by governments to restrict access to facebook or our other products in their countries could substantially harm our business and financial results 

it is possible that governments of one or more countries may seek to censor content available on facebook or our other products in their country restrict access to our products from their country entirely or impose other restrictions that may affect the accessibility of our products in their country for an extended period of time or indefinitely for example user access to facebook and certain of our other products has been or is currently restricted in whole or in part in china iran and north korea in addition government authorities in other countries may seek to restrict user access to our products if they consider us to be in violation of their laws or a threat to public safety or for other reasons and certain of our products have been restricted by governments in other countries from time to time it is also possible that government authorities could take action to restrict our ability to sell advertising in the event that content shown on facebook or our other products is subject to censorship access to our products is restricted in whole or in part in one or more countries or other restrictions are imposed on our products or our competitors are able to successfully penetrate new geographic markets or capture a greater share of existing geographic markets that we cannot access or where we face other restrictions our ability to retain or increase our user base user engagement or the level of advertising by marketers may be adversely affected we may not be able to maintain or grow our revenue as anticipated and our financial results could be adversely affected 

our new products and changes to existing products could fail to attract or retain users or generate revenue and profits 

our ability to retain increase and engage our user base and to increase our revenue depends heavily on our ability to continue to evolve our existing products and to create successful new products both independently and in conjunction with developers or other third parties we may introduce significant changes to our existing products or acquire or introduce new and unproven products including using technologies with which we have little or no prior development or operating experience for example in march 2016 we shipped our first virtual reality hardware product the oculus rift in addition we have announced plans to develop augmented reality technology and products we do not have significant experience with consumer hardware products or virtual or augmented reality technology which may adversely affect our ability to successfully develop and market these products and technologies and we will incur increased costs in connection with the development and marketing of such products and technologies we have also invested and expect to continue to invest significant resources in growing our whatsapp and messenger products we have historically monetized messaging in only a very limited fashion and we may not be successful in our efforts to generate meaningful revenue from messaging over the long term if these or other new or enhanced products fail to engage users marketers or developers or if we are unsuccessful in our monetization efforts we may fail to attract or retain users or to generate sufficient revenue operating margin or other value to justify our investments and our business may be adversely affected 

we make product and investment decisions that may not prioritize shortterm financial results and may not produce the longterm benefits that we expect 

we frequently make product and investment decisions that may not prioritize shortterm financial results if we believe that the decisions are consistent with our mission and benefit the aggregate user experience and will thereby improve our financial performance over the long term for example from time to time we may change the size frequency or relative prominence of ads in order to improve ad quality and overall user experience similarly we recently announced changes to our news feed ranking algorithm to help our users have more meaningful social interactions and we expect that these changes will have the effect of reducing time spent and some measures of user engagement with facebook which could adversely affect our financial results from time to time we have also made and expect to continue to make other changes to our products which may adversely affect the distribution of content of publishers marketers and developers and could reduce their incentive to invest in their efforts on facebook we also may introduce new features or other changes to existing products or introduce new standalone products that attract users away from properties formats or use cases where we have more proven means of monetization for example the stories format is becoming increasingly popular for sharing content across our products and we do not currently monetize stories at the same rate as news feed in addition we plan to continue focusing on growing users and engagement on instagram messenger and whatsapp and we may also introduce other standalone applications in the future these efforts may reduce engagement with the core facebook application where we have the most proven means of monetization and which serves as the platform for many of our new user experiences these decisions may adversely affect our business and results of operations and may not produce the longterm benefits that we expect 

if we are not able to maintain and enhance our brands or if events occur that damage our reputation and brands our ability to expand our base of users marketers and developers may be impaired and our business and financial results may be harmed 

we believe that our brands have significantly contributed to the success of our business we also believe that maintaining and enhancing our brands is critical to expanding our base of users marketers and developers many of our new users are referred by existing users maintaining and enhancing our brands will depend largely on our ability to continue to provide useful reliable trustworthy and innovative products which we may not do successfully we may introduce new products or terms of service or policies that users do not like which may negatively affect our brands additionally the actions of our developers or advertisers may affect our brands if users do not have a positive experience using thirdparty mobile and web applications integrated with our products or interacting with parties that advertise through our products we will also continue to experience media legislative or regulatory scrutiny of our decisions regarding user privacy content advertising and other issues which may adversely affect our reputation and brands for example we previously announced our discovery of certain ads and other content previously displayed on our products that may be relevant to government investigations relating to russian interference in the 2016 us presidential election we also may fail to respond expeditiously to the sharing of objectionable content on our services or objectionable practices by advertisers or to otherwise address user concerns which could erode confidence in our brands our brands may also be negatively affected by the actions of users that are deemed to be hostile or inappropriate to other users by the actions of users acting under false or inauthentic identities by the use of our products or services to disseminate information that is deemed to be misleading or intended to manipulate opinions by perceived or actual efforts by governments to obtain access to user information for securityrelated purposes or to censor certain content on our platform or by the use of our products or services for illicit objectionable or illegal ends maintaining and enhancing our brands may require us to make substantial investments and these investments may not be successful certain of our past actions have eroded confidence in our brands and if we fail to successfully promote and maintain our brands or if we incur excessive expenses in this effort our business and financial results may be adversely affected 

security breaches and improper access to or disclosure of our data or user data or other hacking and phishing attacks on our systems could harm our reputation and adversely affect our business 

our industry is prone to cyberattacks by third parties seeking unauthorized access to our data or users’ data or to disrupt our ability to provide service any failure to prevent or mitigate security breaches and improper access to or disclosure of our data or user data including personal information content or payment information from users could result in the loss or misuse of such data which could harm our business and reputation and diminish our competitive position in addition computer malware viruses social engineering predominantly spear phishing attacks and general hacking have become more prevalent in our industry have occurred on our systems in the past and will occur on our systems in the future we also regularly encounter attempts to create false or undesirable user accounts purchase ads or take other actions on our platform for purposes such as spamming spreading misinformation or other objectionable ends as a result of our prominence the size of our user base and the types and volume of personal data on our systems we believe that we are a particularly attractive target for such breaches and attacks such attacks may cause interruptions to the services we provide degrade the user experience cause users to lose confidence and trust in our products impair our internal systems or result in financial harm to us our efforts to protect our company data or the information we receive may also be unsuccessful due to software bugs or other technical malfunctions employee contractor or vendor error or malfeasance government surveillance or other threats that evolve in addition third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or users to disclose information in order to gain access to our data or our users data cyberattacks continue to evolve in sophistication and volume and inherently may be difficult to detect for long periods of time although we have developed systems and processes that are designed to protect our data and user data to prevent data loss to disable undesirable accounts and activities on our platform and to prevent or detect security breaches we cannot assure you that such measures will provide absolute security and we may incur significant costs in protecting against or remediating cyberattacks 

in addition some of our developers or other partners such as those that help us measure the effectiveness of ads may receive or store information provided by us or by our users through mobile or web applications integrated with facebook we provide limited information to such third parties based on the scope of services provided to us however if these third parties or developers fail to adopt or adhere to adequate data security practices or in the event of a breach of their networks our data or our users data may be improperly accessed used or disclosed 

affected users or government authorities could initiate legal or regulatory actions against us in connection with any security breaches or improper disclosure of data which could cause us to incur significant expense and liability or result in orders or consent decrees forcing us to modify our business practices such incidents may also result in a decline in our active user base or engagement levels any of these events could have a material and adverse effect on our business reputation or financial results 

unfavorable media coverage could negatively affect our business 

we receive a high degree of media coverage around the world unfavorable publicity regarding for example our privacy practices terms of service product changes product quality litigation or regulatory activity government surveillance the actions of our advertisers the actions of our developers whose products are integrated with our products the use of our products or services for illicit objectionable or illegal ends the actions of our users the quality and integrity of content shared on our platform or the actions of other companies that provide similar services to us has in the past and could in the future adversely affect our reputation such negative publicity also could have an adverse effect on the size engagement and loyalty of our user base and result in decreased revenue which could adversely affect our business and financial results 

our financial results will fluctuate from quarter to quarter and are difficult to predict 

our quarterly financial results have fluctuated in the past and will fluctuate in the future additionally we have a limited operating history with the current scale of our business which makes it difficult to forecast our future results as a result you should not rely upon our past quarterly financial results as indicators of future performance you should take into account the risks and uncertainties frequently encountered by companies in rapidly evolving markets our financial results in any given quarter can be influenced by numerous factors many of which we are unable to predict or are outside of our control including 



 we expect our rates of growth to decline in the future 

we expect that our user growth and revenue growth rates will decline over time as the size of our active user base increases and it is possible that the size of our active user base may fluctuate or decline in one or more markets particularly as we achieve greater market penetration we expect our revenue growth rate will generally decline over time as our revenue increases to higher levels as our growth rates decline investors perceptions of our business may be adversely affected and the trading price of our class a common stock could decline 

our costs are continuing to grow which could reduce our operating margin and profitability if our investments are not successful our business and financial performance could be harmed 

operating our business is costly and we expect our expenses to continue to increase in the future as we broaden our user base as users increase the amount and types of content they consume and the data they share with us for example with respect to video as we develop and implement new products as we continue to expand our technical infrastructure as we continue to invest in new and unproven technologies and as we continue to hire additional employees to support our expanding operations we will continue to invest in our messaging security video content and global connectivity efforts as well as other initiatives that may not have clear paths to monetization in addition we will incur increased costs in connection with the development and marketing of our oculus products and services any such investments may not be successful and any such increases in our costs may reduce our operating margin and profitability in addition if our investments are not successful our ability to grow revenue will be harmed which could adversely affect our business and financial performance 

given our levels of sharebased compensation our tax rate may vary significantly depending on our stock price 

the tax effects of the accounting for sharebased compensation may significantly impact our effective tax rate from period to period in periods in which our stock price is higher than the grant price of the sharebased compensation vesting in that period we will recognize excess tax benefits that will decrease our effective tax rate for example in 2017 excess tax benefits recognized from sharebased compensation decreased our provision for income taxes by 125 billion  and our effective tax rate by six percentage points  as compared to the tax rate without such benefits in future periods in which our stock price is lower than the grant price of the sharebased compensation vesting in that period our effective tax rate may increase the amount and value of sharebased compensation issued relative to our earnings in a particular period will also affect the magnitude of the impact of sharebased compensation on our effective tax rate these tax effects are dependent on our stock price which we do not control and a decline in our stock price could significantly increase our effective tax rate and adversely affect our financial results 

our business is subject to complex and evolving us and foreign laws and regulations regarding privacy data protection content competition consumer protection and other matters many of these laws and regulations are subject to change and uncertain interpretation and could result in claims changes to our business practices monetary penalties increased cost of operations or declines in user growth or engagement or otherwise harm our business 

we are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the united states and abroad that involve matters central to our business including privacy data protection and personal information rights of publicity content intellectual property advertising marketing distribution data security data retention and deletion electronic contracts and other communications competition protection of minors consumer protection telecommunications product liability taxation economic or other trade prohibitions or sanctions securities law compliance and online payment services the introduction of new products expansion of our activities in certain jurisdictions or other actions that we may take may subject us to additional laws regulations or other government scrutiny in addition foreign data protection privacy content competition and other laws and regulations can impose different obligations or be more restrictive than those in the united states 

these us federal and state and foreign laws and regulations which in some cases can be enforced by private parties in addition to government entities are constantly evolving and can be subject to significant change as a result the application interpretation and enforcement of these laws and regulations are often uncertain particularly in the new and rapidly evolving industry in which we operate and may be interpreted and applied inconsistently from country to country and inconsistently with our current policies and practices for example regulatory or legislative actions affecting the manner in which we display content to our users or obtain consent to various practices could adversely affect user growth and engagement such actions could affect the manner in which we provide our services or adversely affect our financial results 

we are also subject to laws and regulations that dictate whether how and under what circumstances we can transfer process andor receive certain data that is critical to our operations including data shared between countries or regions in which we operate and data shared among our products and services for example in 2016 the european union and united states agreed to an alternative transfer framework for data transferred from the european union to the united states called the privacy shield but this new framework is subject to an annual review that could result in changes to our obligations and also may be challenged by national regulators or private parties in addition the other bases upon which facebook relies to legitimize the transfer of such data such as standard model contractual clauses mccs have been subjected to regulatory and judicial scrutiny for example the irish data protection commissioner has challenged the legal grounds for transfers of user data to facebook inc and the irish high court has agreed to refer this challenge to the court of justice of the european union for decision we also face multiple inquiries investigations and lawsuits in europe india and other jurisdictions regarding the august 2016 update to whatsapp’s terms of service and privacy policy and its sharing of certain data with other facebook products and services including a lawsuit currently pending before the supreme court of india if one or more of the legal bases for transferring data from europe to the united states is invalidated if we are unable to transfer data between and among countries and regions in which we operate or if we are prohibited from sharing data among our products and services it could affect the manner in which we provide our services or adversely affect our financial results 

proposed or new legislation and regulations could also significantly affect our business there currently are a number of proposals pending before federal state and foreign legislative and regulatory bodies in addition the new european general data protection regulation gdpr will take effect in may 2018 and will apply to all of our products and services that provide service in europe the gdpr will include operational requirements for companies that receive or process personal data of residents of the european union that are different than those currently in place in the european union for example we may be required to implement measures to change our service or limit access to our service for minors under the age of 16 for certain countries in europe that maintain the minimum age of 16 under the gdpr we may also be required to obtain consent andor offer new controls to existing and new users in europe before processing data for certain aspects of our service in addition the gdpr will include significant penalties for noncompliance similarly there are a number of legislative proposals in the united states at both the federal and state level that could impose new obligations in areas affecting our business such as liability for copyright infringement by third parties in addition some countries are considering or have passed legislation implementing data protection requirements or requiring local storage and processing of data or similar requirements that could increase the cost and complexity of delivering our services 

these laws and regulations as well as any associated inquiries or investigations or any other government actions may be costly to comply with and may delay or impede the development of new products result in negative publicity increase our operating costs require significant management time and attention and subject us to remedies that may harm our business including fines or demands or orders that we modify or cease existing business practices 

we have been subject to regulatory and other government investigations enforcement actions and settlements and we expect to continue to be subject to such proceedings and other inquires in the future which could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner materially adverse to our business 

from time to time we receive formal and informal inquiries from government authorities and regulators regarding our compliance with laws and regulations many of which are evolving and subject to interpretation we are and expect to continue to be the subject of investigations inquiries data requests actions and audits in the united states europe and around the world particularly in the areas of privacy data protection law enforcement consumer protection and competition as we continue to grow and expand our operations for example several data protection authorities in the european union have initiated actions investigations or administrative orders seeking to assert jurisdiction over facebook inc and our subsidiaries and to restrict the ways in which we collect and use information and other data protection authorities may do the same orders issued by or inquiries or enforcement actions initiated by government or regulatory authorities could cause us to incur substantial costs expose us to unanticipated civil and criminal liability or penalties including substantial monetary fines or require us to change our business practices in a manner materially adverse to our business 

if we are unable to protect our intellectual property the value of our brands and other intangible assets may be diminished and our business may be adversely affected 

we rely and expect to continue to rely on a combination of confidentiality assignment and license agreements with our employees consultants and third parties with whom we have relationships as well as trademark copyright patent trade secret and domain name protection laws to protect our proprietary rights in the united states and internationally we have filed various applications for protection of certain aspects of our intellectual property and we currently hold a significant number of registered trademarks and issued patents in multiple jurisdictions and have acquired patents and patent applications from third parties third parties may knowingly or unknowingly infringe our proprietary rights third parties may challenge proprietary rights held by us and pending and future trademark and patent applications may not be approved in addition effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which we operate or intend to operate our business in any or all of these cases we may be required to expend significant time and expense in order to prevent infringement or to enforce our rights although we have generally taken measures to protect our proprietary rights there can be no assurance that others will not offer products or concepts that are substantially similar to ours and compete with our business in addition we regularly contribute software source code under open source licenses and have made other technology we developed available under other open licenses and we include open source software in our products for example we have contributed certain specifications and designs related to our data center equipment to the open compute project foundation a nonprofit entity that shares and develops such information with the technology community under the open web foundation license as a result of our open source contributions and the use of open source in our products we may license or be required to license or disclose code andor innovations that turn out to be material to our business and may also be exposed to increased litigation risk if the protection of our proprietary rights is inadequate to prevent unauthorized use or appropriation by third parties the value of our brands and other intangible assets may be diminished and competitors may be able to more effectively mimic our products services and methods of operations any of these events could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results 

we are currently and expect to be in the future party to patent lawsuits and other intellectual property rights claims that are expensive and time consuming and if resolved adversely could have a significant impact on our business financial condition or results of operations 

companies in the internet technology and media industries own large numbers of patents copyrights trademarks and trade secrets and frequently enter into litigation based on allegations of infringement misappropriation or other violations of intellectual property or other rights in addition various nonpracticing entities that own patents and other intellectual property rights often attempt to aggressively assert their rights in order to extract value from technology companies furthermore from time to time we may introduce or acquire new products including in areas where we historically have not competed which could increase our exposure to patent and other intellectual property claims from competitors and nonpracticing entities 

from time to time we receive notice from patent holders and other parties alleging that certain of our products and services or user content infringe their intellectual property rights we presently are involved in a number of intellectual property lawsuits and as we face increasing competition and gain an increasingly high profile we expect the number of patent and other intellectual property claims against us to grow defending patent and other intellectual property litigation is costly and can impose a significant burden on management and employees and there can be no assurances that favorable final outcomes will be obtained in all cases in addition plaintiffs may seek and we may become subject to preliminary or provisional rulings in the course of any such litigation including potential preliminary injunctions requiring us to cease some or all of our operations we may decide to settle such lawsuits and disputes on terms that are unfavorable to us similarly if any litigation to which we are a party is resolved adversely we may be subject to an unfavorable judgment that may not be reversed upon appeal the terms of such a settlement or judgment may require us to cease some or all of our operations or pay substantial amounts to the other party in addition we may have to seek a license to continue practices 

found to be in violation of a third partys rights which may not be available on reasonable terms or at all and may significantly increase our operating costs and expenses as a result we may also be required to develop alternative noninfringing technology or practices or discontinue the practices the development of alternative noninfringing technology or practices could require significant effort and expense or may not be feasible our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected as a result of an unfavorable resolution of the disputes and litigation referred to above 

we are involved in numerous class action lawsuits and other litigation matters that are expensive and time consuming and if resolved adversely could harm our business financial condition or results of operations 

in addition to intellectual property claims we are also involved in numerous other lawsuits including putative class action lawsuits many of which claim statutory damages andor seek significant changes to our business operations and we anticipate that we will continue to be a target for numerous lawsuits in the future because of the scale of our user base the plaintiffs in class action cases filed against us typically claim enormous monetary damages even if the alleged peruser harm is small or nonexistent in addition we may be subject to additional class action lawsuits based on employment claims product performance or other claims related to the use of consumer hardware and software as well as virtual reality technology and products which are new and unproven any negative outcome from any such lawsuits could result in payments of substantial monetary damages or fines or undesirable changes to our products or business practices and accordingly our business financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected although the results of such lawsuits and claims cannot be predicted with certainty we do not believe that the final outcome of those matters relating to our products that we currently face will have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations in addition we are currently the subject of stockholder class action suits in connection with our initial public offering ipo we believe these lawsuits are without merit and are vigorously defending these lawsuits 

there can be no assurances that a favorable final outcome will be obtained in all our cases and defending any lawsuit is costly and can impose a significant burden on management and employees any litigation to which we are a party may result in an onerous or unfavorable judgment that may not be reversed upon appeal or in payments of substantial monetary damages or fines or we may decide to settle lawsuits on similarly unfavorable terms which could adversely affect our business financial conditions or results of operations 

we may incur liability as a result of information retrieved from or transmitted over the internet or published using our products or as a result of claims related to our products 

we have faced currently face and will continue to face claims relating to information that is published or made available on our products in particular the nature of our business exposes us to claims related to defamation dissemination of misinformation or news hoaxes discrimination intellectual property rights rights of publicity and privacy personal injury torts or laws regulating hate speech or other types of content this risk is enhanced in certain jurisdictions outside the united states where our protection from liability for thirdparty actions may be unclear or where we may be less protected under local laws than we are in the united states in addition there have been various congressional efforts to restrict the scope of the protections available to online platforms under section 230 of the communications decency act and our current protections from liability for thirdparty content in the united states could decrease or change we could incur significant costs investigating and defending such claims and if we are found liable significant damages we could also face fines or orders restricting or blocking our services in particular geographies as a result of content hosted on our services for example recently enacted legislation in germany may impose significant fines for failure to comply with certain content removal and disclosure obligations if any of these events occur our business and financial results could be adversely affected 

our ceo has control over key decision making as a result of his control of a majority of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock 

mark zuckerberg our founder chairman and ceo is able to exercise voting rights with respect to a majority of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock and therefore has the ability to control the outcome of matters submitted to our stockholders for approval including the election of directors and any merger consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets this concentrated control could delay defer or prevent a change of control merger consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets that our other stockholders support or conversely this concentrated control could result in the consummation of such a transaction that our other stockholders do not support this concentrated control could also discourage a potential investor from acquiring our class a common stock which has limited voting power relative to the class b common stock and might harm the trading price of our class a common stock in addition mr zuckerberg has the ability to control the management and major strategic investments of our company as a result of his position as our ceo and his ability to control the election or replacement of our directors in the event of his death the shares of our capital stock that mr zuckerberg owns will be transferred to the persons or entities that he has designated as a board member and officer mr zuckerberg owes a fiduciary duty to our stockholders and must act in good faith in a manner he reasonably believes to be in the best interests of our stockholders as a stockholder even a controlling stockholder mr zuckerberg 

is entitled to vote his shares and shares over which he has voting control as governed by a voting agreement in his own interests which may not always be in the interests of our stockholders generally 

we plan to continue to make acquisitions which could harm our financial condition or results of operations and may adversely affect the price of our common stock 

as part of our business strategy we have made and intend to continue to make acquisitions to add specialized employees and complementary companies products or technologies we may not be able to find suitable acquisition candidates and we may not be able to complete acquisitions on favorable terms if at all in some cases the costs of such acquisitions may be substantial for example in 2014 we paid approximately 46 billion in cash and issued 178 million shares of our class a common stock in connection with our acquisition of whatsapp and we paid approximately 400 million in cash and issued 23 million shares of our class b common stock in connection with our acquisition of oculus we also issued a substantial number of rsus to help retain the employees of these companies there is no assurance that we will receive a favorable return on investment for these or other acquisitions 

we may pay substantial amounts of cash or incur debt to pay for acquisitions which could adversely affect our liquidity the incurrence of indebtedness would also result in increased fixed obligations and increased interest expense and could also include covenants or other restrictions that would impede our ability to manage our operations we may also issue equity securities to pay for acquisitions and we regularly grant rsus to retain the employees of acquired companies which could increase our expenses adversely affect our financial results and result in dilution to our stockholders in addition any acquisitions we announce could be viewed negatively by users marketers developers or investors which may adversely affect our business or the price of our class a common stock 

we may also discover liabilities or deficiencies associated with the companies or assets we acquire that were not identified in advance which may result in significant unanticipated costs the effectiveness of our due diligence review and our ability to evaluate the results of such due diligence are dependent upon the accuracy and completeness of statements and disclosures made or actions taken by the companies we acquire or their representatives as well as the limited amount of time in which acquisitions are executed in addition we may fail to accurately forecast the financial impact of an acquisition transaction including tax and accounting charges acquisitions may also result in our recording of significant additional expenses to our results of operations and recording of substantial finitelived intangible assets on our balance sheet upon closing any of these factors may adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations 

we may not be able to successfully integrate our acquisitions and we may incur significant costs to integrate and support the companies we acquire 

the integration of acquisitions requires significant time and resources and we may not manage these processes successfully our ability to successfully integrate complex acquisitions is unproven particularly with respect to companies that have significant operations or that develop products where we do not have prior experience for example oculus and whatsapp are larger and more complex than companies we have historically acquired in particular oculus builds technology and products that are relatively new to facebook and with which we did not have significant experience or structure in place to support prior to the acquisition we continue to make substantial investments of resources to support these acquisitions which will result in significant ongoing operating expenses and may divert resources and management attention from other areas of our business we cannot assure you that these investments will be successful if we fail to successfully integrate the companies we acquire we may not realize the benefits expected from the transaction and our business may be harmed 

if our goodwill or finitelived intangible assets become impaired we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings   

we review our finitelived intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable such as a decline in stock price and market capitalization we test goodwill for impairment at least annually if such goodwill or finitelived intangible assets are deemed to be impaired an impairment loss equal to the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the assets would be recognized we may be required to record a significant charge in our financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill or finitelived intangible assets is determined which would negatively affect our results of operations 

our business is dependent on our ability to maintain and scale our technical infrastructure and any significant disruption in our service could damage our reputation result in a potential loss of users and engagement and adversely affect our financial results 

our reputation and ability to attract retain and serve our users is dependent upon the reliable performance of our products and our underlying technical infrastructure we have in the past experienced and may in the future experience interruptions in the availability or performance of our products from time to time our systems may not be adequately designed with the necessary reliability and redundancy to avoid performance delays or outages that could be harmful to our business if our products are unavailable when users attempt to access them or if they do not load as quickly as expected users may not use our products as often in the future or at all and our ability to serve ads may be disrupted as our user base and engagement continue to grow and the amount and types of information shared on facebook and our other products continue to grow and evolve such as increased engagement with video we will need an increasing amount of technical infrastructure including network capacity and computing power to continue to satisfy the needs of our users and advertisers it is possible that we may fail to continue to effectively scale and grow our technical infrastructure to accommodate these increased demands which may adversely affect our user engagement and advertising revenue growth in addition our business may be subject to interruptions delays or failures resulting from earthquakes adverse weather conditions other natural disasters power loss terrorism geopolitical conflict cyberattacks or other catastrophic events if such an event were to occur users may be subject to service disruptions or outages and we may not be able to recover our technical infrastructure and user data in a timely manner to restart or provide our services which may adversely affect our financial results 

a substantial portion of our network infrastructure is provided by third parties any disruption or failure in the services we receive from these providers could harm our ability to handle existing or increased traffic and could significantly harm our business any financial or other difficulties these providers face may adversely affect our business and we exercise little control over these providers which increases our vulnerability to problems with the services they provide 

we could experience unforeseen difficulties in building and operating key portions of our technical infrastructure 

we have designed and built our own data centers and key portions of our technical infrastructure through which we serve our products and we plan to continue to significantly expand the size of our infrastructure primarily through data centers and other projects the infrastructure expansion we are undertaking is complex and involves projects in multiple locations and unanticipated delays in the completion of these projects including due to any shortage of labor necessary in building portions of such projects or availability of components may lead to increased project costs operational inefficiencies or interruptions in the delivery or degradation of the quality of our products in addition there may be issues related to this infrastructure that are not identified during the testing phases of design and implementation which may only become evident after we have started to fully utilize the underlying equipment that could further degrade the user experience or increase our costs 

our products and internal systems rely on software that is highly technical and if it contains undetected errors or vulnerabilities our business could be adversely affected 

our products and internal systems rely on software including software developed or maintained internally andor by third parties that is highly technical and complex in addition our products and internal systems depend on the ability of such software to store retrieve process and manage immense amounts of data the software on which we rely has contained and will in the future contain undetected errors bugs or vulnerabilities some errors may only be discovered after the code has been released for external or internal use errors vulnerabilities or other design defects within the software on which we rely have in the past and may in the future result in a negative experience for users and marketers who use our products delay product introductions or enhancements result in targeting measurement or billing errors compromise our ability to protect the data of our users andor our intellectual property or lead to reductions in our ability to provide some or all of our services in addition any errors bugs vulnerabilities or defects discovered in the software on which we rely and any associated degradations or interruptions of service could result in damage to our reputation loss of users loss of revenue or liability for damages any of which could adversely affect our business and financial results 

technologies have been developed that can block the display of our ads which could adversely affect our financial results 

technologies have been developed and will likely continue to be developed that can block the display of our ads or block our ad measurement tools particularly for advertising displayed on personal computers we generate substantially all of our revenue from advertising including revenue resulting from the display of ads on personal computers revenue generated from the display of ads on personal computers has been impacted by these technologies from time to time as a result these technologies have had an adverse effect on our financial results and if such technologies continue to proliferate in particular with respect to mobile platforms our future financial results may be harmed 

real or perceived inaccuracies in our user and other metrics may harm our reputation and negatively affect our business 

the numbers for our key metrics which include our daus maus and average revenue per user arpu are calculated using 

internal company data based on the activity of user accounts while these numbers are based on what we believe to be reasonable estimates of our user base for the applicable period of measurement there are inherent challenges in measuring usage of our products across large online and mobile populations around the world in addition we are continually seeking to improve our estimates of our user base and such estimates may change due to improvements or changes in our methodology 

we regularly evaluate these metrics to estimate the number of duplicate and false accounts among our maus a duplicate account is one that a user maintains in addition to his or her principal account we divide false accounts into two categories 1 usermisclassified accounts where users have created personal profiles for a business organization or nonhuman entity such as a pet such entities are permitted on facebook using a page rather than a personal profile under our terms of service and 2 undesirable accounts which represent user profiles that we determine are intended to be used for purposes that violate our terms of service such as spamming the estimates of duplicate and false accounts are based on an internal review of a limited sample of accounts and we apply significant judgment in making this determination for example to identify duplicate accounts we use data signals such as similar ip addresses or user names and to identify false accounts we look for names that appear to be fake or other behavior that appears inauthentic to the reviewers our estimates may change as our methodologies evolve including through the application of new data signals or technologies which may allow us to identify previously undetected duplicate or false accounts and may improve our ability to evaluate a broader population of our users as such our estimation of duplicate or false accounts may not accurately represent the actual number of such accounts in particular duplicate accounts are very difficult to measure at our scale and it is possible that the actual number of duplicate accounts may vary significantly from our estimates 

in the fourth quarter of 2017 we estimate that duplicate accounts may have represented approximately 10 of our worldwide maus we believe the percentage of duplicate accounts is meaningfully higher in developing markets such as india indonesia and the philippines as compared to more developed markets in the fourth quarter of 2017 we estimate that false accounts may have represented approximately 34 of our worldwide maus our estimation of false accounts can vary as a result of episodic spikes in the creation of such accounts which we have seen originate more frequently in specific countries such as indonesia turkey and vietnam from time to time we may make product changes or take other actions to reduce the number of duplicate or false accounts among our users which may also reduce our dau and mau estimates in a particular period 

our data limitations may affect our understanding of certain details of our business for example while userprovided data indicates a decline in usage among younger users this age data is unreliable because a disproportionate number of our younger users register with an inaccurate age accordingly our understanding of usage by age group may not be complete 

in addition our data regarding the geographic location of our users is estimated based on a number of factors such as the users ip address and selfdisclosed location these factors may not always accurately reflect the users actual location for example a user may appear to be accessing facebook from the location of the proxy server that the user connects to rather than from the users actual location the methodologies used to measure user metrics may also be susceptible to algorithm or other technical errors our estimates for revenue by user location and revenue by user device are also affected by these factors we regularly review our processes for calculating these metrics and from time to time we may discover inaccuracies in our metrics or make adjustments to improve their accuracy including adjustments that may result in the recalculation of our historical metrics we believe that any such inaccuracies or adjustments are immaterial unless otherwise stated we intend to disclose our estimates of the number of duplicate and false accounts among our maus on an annual basis in addition our dau and mau estimates will differ from estimates published by third parties due to differences in methodology 

in addition from time to time we provide or rely on certain other metrics including those relating to the reach and effectiveness of our ads all of our metrics are subject to software bugs inconsistencies in our systems and human error if marketers developers or investors do not perceive our metrics to be accurate or if we discover material inaccuracies in our metrics we may be subject to liability our reputation may be harmed and marketers and developers may be less willing to allocate their budgets or resources to facebook which could negatively affect our business and financial results 

we cannot assure you that we will effectively manage our growth 

our employee headcount and the scope and complexity of our business have increased significantly with the number of employees increasing to 25105  as of december 31 2017 from 17048  as of december 31 2016 and we expect such headcount growth to continue for the foreseeable future the growth and expansion of our business and products create significant challenges for our management operational and financial resources including managing multiple relationships with users marketers developers and other third parties as our operations and the number of our thirdparty relationships continue to grow our information technology systems or our internal controls and procedures may not be adequate to support such growth in addition some members of our management do not have significant experience managing a large global business operation so our management may not be able to manage such growth effectively to effectively manage our growth we must continue to improve our operational financial and management processes and systems and to effectively expand train and manage our employee base as our organization continues to grow and we are required to implement more complex organizational management structures we may find it increasingly difficult to maintain the benefits of our corporate culture including our ability to quickly develop and launch new and innovative products this could negatively affect our business performance 

the loss of one or more of our key personnel or our failure to attract and retain other highly qualified personnel in the future could harm our business 

we currently depend on the continued services and performance of our key personnel including mark zuckerberg and sheryl k sandberg although we have entered into employment agreements with mr zuckerberg and ms sandberg the agreements have no specific duration and constitute atwill employment in addition many of our key technologies and systems are custommade for our business by our personnel the loss of key personnel including members of management as well as key engineering product development marketing and sales personnel could disrupt our operations and have an adverse effect on our business 

as we continue to grow we cannot guarantee we will continue to attract and retain the personnel we need to maintain our competitive position in particular we intend to continue to hire a significant number of technical personnel in the foreseeable future and we expect to continue to face significant competition from other companies in hiring such personnel particularly in the san francisco bay area where our headquarters are located and where the cost of living is high as we continue to mature the incentives to attract retain and motivate employees provided by our equity awards or by future arrangements may not be as effective as in the past and if we issue significant equity to attract additional employees or to retain our existing employees we would incur substantial additional sharebased compensation expense and the ownership of our existing stockholders would be further diluted our ability to attract retain and motivate employees may also be adversely affected by stock price volatility additionally we have a number of current employees whose equity ownership in our company has provided them a substantial amount of personal wealth which could affect their decisions about whether or not to continue to work for us as a result of these factors it may be difficult for us to continue to retain and motivate our employees if we do not succeed in attracting hiring and integrating excellent personnel or retaining and motivating existing personnel we may be unable to grow effectively 

we may not be able to continue to successfully grow usage of and engagement with mobile and web applications that integrate with facebook and our other products 

we have made and are continuing to make investments to enable developers to build grow and monetize mobile and web applications that integrate with facebook and our other products such existing and prospective developers may not be successful in building growing or monetizing mobile andor web applications that create and maintain user engagement additionally developers may choose to build on other platforms including mobile platforms controlled by third parties rather than building products that integrate with facebook and our other products we are continuously seeking to balance the distribution objectives of our developers with our desire to provide an optimal user experience and we may not be successful in achieving a balance that continues to attract and retain such developers for example from time to time we have taken actions to reduce the volume of communications from these developers to users on facebook and our other products with the objective of enhancing the user experience and such actions have reduced distribution from user engagement with and our monetization opportunities from mobile and web applications integrated with our products in some instances these actions as well as other actions to enforce our policies applicable to developers have adversely affected our relationships with such developers if we are not successful in our efforts to continue to grow the number of developers that choose to build products that integrate with facebook and our other products or if we are unable to continue to build and maintain good relations with such developers our user growth and user engagement and our financial results may be adversely affected 

we currently generate substantially all of our payments revenue from developers that use facebook on personal computers and we expect that our payments revenue will continue to decline as usage of facebook on personal computers continues to decline 

we currently generate substantially all of our payments revenue from developers that use facebook on personal computers specifically applications built by developers of social games are currently responsible for substantially all of our revenue derived from payments and the majority of the revenue from these applications has historically been generated by a limited number of the most popular games we have experienced and expect to see the continued decline in usage of facebook on personal computers which we expect will result in a continuing decline in payments revenue in addition only a relatively small percentage of our users have transacted with facebook payments if the facebookintegrated applications fail to grow or maintain their users and engagement whether as a result of the continued decline in the usage of facebook on personal computers or otherwise if developers do not continue to introduce new applications that attract users and create engagement on facebook or if facebookintegrated applications outside of social games do not gain popularity and generate significant revenue for us our financial performance could be adversely affected 

payment transactions may subject us to additional regulatory requirements and other risks that could be costly and difficult to comply with or that could harm our business 

our users can purchase virtual and digital goods from developers that offer applications using our payments infrastructure on the facebook website in addition certain of our users can use our payments infrastructure including on messenger for other activities such as sending money to other users and making donations to certain charitable organizations we are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the united states europe and elsewhere including those governing antimoney laundering and counterterrorist financing money transmission gift cards and other prepaid access instruments electronic funds transfer charitable fundraising and import and export restrictions depending on how our payments product evolves we may also be subject to other laws and regulations including those governing gambling banking and lending in some jurisdictions the application or interpretation of these laws and regulations is not clear to increase flexibility in how our use of payments may evolve and to mitigate regulatory uncertainty we have received certain money transmitter licenses in the united states and an electronic money emoney license that allows us to conduct certain regulated payment activities in the participating member countries of the european economic area which will generally require us to demonstrate compliance with many domestic and foreign laws in these areas our efforts to comply with these laws and regulations could be costly and result in diversion of management time and effort and may still not guarantee compliance in the event that we are found to be in violation of any such legal or regulatory requirements we may be subject to monetary fines or other penalties such as a cease and desist order or we may be required to make product changes any of which could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results 

in addition we may be subject to a variety of additional risks as a result of payments transactions including 

 we have significant international operations and plan to continue expanding our operations abroad where we have more limited operating experience and this may subject us to increased business and economic risks that could affect our financial results 

we have significant international operations and plan to continue the international expansion of our business operations and the translation of our products we currently make facebook available in more than 100 different languages and we have offices or data centers in more than 30 different countries we may enter new international markets where we have limited or no experience in marketing selling and deploying our products our products are generally available globally through the web and on mobile but some or all of our products or functionality may not be available in certain markets due to legal and regulatory complexities for example facebook and certain of our other products are not generally available in china we also outsource certain operational functions to thirdparty vendors globally if we fail to deploy manage or oversee our international operations successfully our business may suffer in addition we are subject to a variety of risks inherent in doing business internationally including 



requirements to provide user information to local authorities 

 if we are unable to expand internationally and manage the complexity of our global operations successfully our financial results could be adversely affected 

we face design manufacturing and supply chain risks that if not properly managed could adversely impact our financial results 

we face a number of risks related to design manufacturing and supply chain management with respect to our oculus products for example the oculus products we sell may have quality issues resulting from the design or manufacture of the products or from the software used in the products sometimes these issues may be caused by components we purchase from other manufacturers or suppliers if the quality of our oculus products does not meet our customers expectations or such products are found to be defective then our brand and financial results could be adversely affected 

we rely on third parties to manufacture our oculus products we may experience supply shortages or other supply chain disruptions in the future that could result in shipping delays and negatively impact our operations we could be negatively affected if we are not able to engage third parties with the necessary capabilities or capacity on reasonable terms or if those we engage with fail to meet their obligations whether due to financial difficulties or other reasons or make adverse changes in the pricing or other material terms of such arrangements with them 

we also require the suppliers and business partners of our oculus products to comply with laws and certain company policies regarding sourcing practices and standards on labor health and safety the environment and business ethics but we do not control them or their practices and standards if any of them violates laws or implements practices or standards regarded as unethical corrupt or noncompliant we could experience supply chain disruptions canceled orders or damage to our reputation 

in addition the sec’s conflict minerals rule requires disclosure by public companies of information relating to the origin source and chain of custody of specified minerals known as conflict minerals that are necessary to the functionality or production of products manufactured or contracted to be manufactured we may incur significant costs associated with complying with the rule such as costs related to the determination of the origin source and chain of custody of the minerals used in oculus products the adoption of conflict mineralsrelated governance policies processes and controls and possible changes to products or sources of supply as a result of such activities 

we may face inventory risk with respect to our oculus products 

we may be exposed to inventory risks with respect to our oculus products as a result of rapid changes in product cycles and pricing unsafe or defective merchandise changes in consumer demand and consumer spending patterns changes in consumer tastes with respect to oculus products and other factors we endeavor to accurately predict these trends and avoid overstocking or understocking products oculus may sell demand for products however can change significantly between the time inventory or components are ordered and the date of sale in addition when we begin selling or manufacturing a new oculus product it may be difficult to establish vendor relationships determine appropriate product or component selection and accurately forecast demand the acquisition of certain types of inventory or components may require significant leadtime and prepayment and they may not be returnable any one of these factors may adversely affect our operating results 

we may have exposure to greater than anticipated tax liabilities 

our income tax obligations are based in part on our corporate operating structure and intercompany arrangements including the manner in which we operate our business develop value manage protect and use our intellectual property and the valuations of our intercompany transactions we may also be subject to additional indirect or nonincome taxes the tax laws applicable to our business including the laws of the united states and other jurisdictions are subject to interpretation and certain jurisdictions are aggressively interpreting their laws in new ways in an effort to raise additional tax revenue from companies such as facebook the taxing authorities of the jurisdictions in which we operate may challenge our methodologies for valuing developed technology or intercompany arrangements which could increase our worldwide effective tax rate and harm our financial position results of operations and cash flows for example in 2016 the irs issued us a formal assessment relating to transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries in conjunction with the examination of the 2010 tax year and although we disagree with the irss position and are contesting this issue the ultimate resolution is uncertain and if resolved in a manner unfavorable to us may adversely affect our financial results we are subject to regular review and audit by us federal and state and foreign tax authorities tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken and any adverse outcome of such a review or audit could have a negative effect on our financial position results of operations and cash flows in addition the determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires significant judgment by management and there are many transactions where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain our provision for income taxes is also determined by the manner in which we operate our business and any changes to such operations or laws applicable to such operations may affect our effective tax rate changes in accounting for intercompany transactions may also affect our effective tax rate for example with the adoption of accounting standards update no 201616 effective january 1 2018 the income tax effects of an intercompany transfer will be recognized in the period in which the transfer occurs rather than amortized over time which may increase the impact of such transfers on our effective tax rate in a particular period although we believe that our provision for income taxes is reasonable the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements and may materially affect our financial results in the period or periods for which such determination is made   in addition our future income tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions that have lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions that have higher statutory tax rates by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities or by changes in tax laws regulations or accounting principles for example we have previously incurred losses in certain international subsidiaries that resulted in an effective tax rate that is significantly higher than the statutory tax rate in the united states and this could continue to happen in the future 

changes in tax laws or tax rulings could materially affect our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

the income and nonincome tax regimes we are subject to or operate under are unsettled and may be subject to significant change changes in tax laws or tax rulings or changes in interpretations of existing laws could materially affect our financial position results of operations and cash flows for example changes to us tax laws enacted in december 2017 had a significant impact on our tax obligations and effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2017 in addition many countries in europe as well as a number of other countries and organizations have recently proposed or recommended changes to existing tax laws or have enacted new laws that could significantly increase our tax obligations in many countries where we do business or require us to change the manner in which we operate our business the organization for economic cooperation and development has been working on a base erosion and profit shifting project and issued in 2015 and is expected to continue to issue guidelines and proposals that may change various aspects of the existing framework under which our tax obligations are determined in many of the countries in which we do business the european commission has conducted investigations in multiple countries focusing on whether local country tax rulings or tax legislation provides preferential tax treatment that violates european union state aid rules and concluded that certain countries including ireland have provided illegal state aid in certain cases these investigations may result in changes to the tax treatment of our foreign operations due to the large and expanding scale of our international business activities many of these types of changes to the taxation of our activities could increase our worldwide effective tax rate and harm our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

uncertainties in the interpretation and application of the 2017 tax cuts and jobs act could materially affect our tax obligations and effective tax rate   

the 2017 tax cuts and jobs act the tax act was enacted on december 22 2017 and significantly affected us tax law by changing how the us imposes income tax on multinational corporations the us department of treasury has broad authority to issue regulations and interpretative guidance that may significantly impact how we will apply the law and impact our results of operations in the period issued 

the tax act requires complex computations not previously provided in us tax law as such the application of accounting guidance for such items is currently uncertain further compliance with the tax act and the accounting for such provisions require accumulation of information not previously required or regularly produced as a result we have provided a provisional estimate on the effect of the tax act in our financial statements as additional regulatory guidance is issued by the applicable taxing authorities as accounting treatment is clarified as we perform additional analysis on the application of the law and as we refine estimates in calculating the effect our final analysis which will be recorded in the period completed may be different from our current provisional amounts which could materially affect our tax obligations and effective tax rate 

we cannot guarantee that our share repurchase program will be fully consummated or that it will enhance longterm stockholder value share repurchases could also increase the volatility of the trading price of our stock and could diminish our cash reserves 

in november 2016 our board of directors authorized a share repurchase program of up to 60 billion  of our class a common stock that commenced in 2017 and does not have an expiration date although our board of directors has authorized this share repurchase program the program does not obligate us to repurchase any specific dollar amount or to acquire any specific number of shares we cannot guarantee that the program will be fully consummated or that it will enhance longterm stockholder value the program could affect the trading price of our stock and increase volatility and any announcement of a termination of this program may result in a decrease in the trading price of our stock in addition this program could diminish our cash reserves 

risks related to ownership of our class a common stock 

the trading price of our class a common stock has been and will likely continue to be volatile 

the trading price of our class a common stock has been and is likely to continue to be volatile since shares of our class a common stock were sold in our ipo in may 2012 at a price of 3800 per share our stock price has ranged from 1755  to 18425  through december 31 2017 in addition to the factors discussed in this annual report on form 10k the trading price of our class a common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to numerous factors many of which are beyond our control including 



in addition the stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many technology companies stock prices of many technology companies have fluctuated in a manner unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies we are currently subject to securities litigation in connection with our ipo we may experience more such litigation following future periods of volatility any securities litigation could subject us to substantial costs divert resources and the attention of management from our business and adversely affect our business 

we do not intend to pay cash dividends for the foreseeable future 

we have never declared or paid cash dividends on our capital stock we currently intend to retain any future earnings to finance the operation and expansion of our business and we do not expect to declare or pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future as a result you may only receive a return on your investment in our class a common stock if the trading price of your shares increases 

the dual class structure of our common stock and a voting agreement between certain stockholders have the effect of concentrating voting control with our ceo and certain other holders of our class b common stock this will limit or preclude your ability to influence corporate matters 

our class b common stock has ten votes per share and our class a common stock has one vote per share stockholders who hold shares of class b common stock including certain of our executive officers employees and directors and their affiliates together hold a substantial majority of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock because of the tentoone voting ratio between our class b and class a common stock the holders of our class b common stock collectively control a majority of the combined voting power of our common stock and therefore are able to control all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval so long as the shares of class b common stock represent at least 91 of all outstanding shares of our class a and class b common stock this concentrated control will limit or preclude your ability to influence corporate matters for the foreseeable future 

transfers by holders of class b common stock will generally result in those shares converting to class a common stock subject to limited exceptions such as certain transfers effected for estate planning or charitable purposes the conversion of class b common stock to class a common stock will have the effect over time of increasing the relative voting power of those holders of class b common stock who retain their shares in the long term if for example mr zuckerberg retains a significant portion of his holdings of class b common stock for an extended period of time he could in the future continue to control a majority of the combined voting power of our outstanding capital stock 

our status as a controlled company could make our class a common stock less attractive to some investors or otherwise harm our stock price 

because we qualify as a controlled company under the corporate governance rules for nasdaqlisted companies we are not required to have a majority of our board of directors be independent nor are we required to have a compensation committee or an independent nominating function in light of our status as a controlled company our board of directors determined not to have a separate and independent nominating function and chose to have the full board of directors be directly responsible for nominating members of our board and in the future we could elect not to have a majority of our board of directors be independent or not to have a compensation committee accordingly should the interests of our controlling stockholder differ from those of other stockholders the other stockholders may not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the corporate governance rules for nasdaqlisted companies our status as a controlled company could make our class a common stock less attractive to some investors or otherwise harm our stock price 

delaware law and provisions in our restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws could make a merger tender offer or proxy contest difficult thereby depressing the trading price of our class a common stock 

our status as a delaware corporation and the antitakeover provisions of the delaware general corporation law may discourage delay or prevent a change in control by prohibiting us from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years after the person becomes an interested stockholder even if a change of control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders in addition our current restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that may make the acquisition of our company more difficult including the following

tableend you should read the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data of this annual report on form 10k in addition to our historical consolidated financial information the following discussion contains forwardlooking statements that reflect our plans estimates and beliefs our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forwardlooking statements factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k particularly in part i item 1a risk factors for a discussion of limitations in the measurement of certain of our user metrics see the section entitled limitations of key metrics and other data in this annual report on form 10k 

certain revenue information in the section entitled  — revenue — foreign exchange impact on revenue is presented on a constant currency basis this information is a nongaap financial measure to calculate revenue on a constant currency basis we translated revenue for the full year 2017  using 2016 monthly exchange rates for our settlement currencies other than the us dollar this nongaap financial measure is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for or superior to financial information prepared and presented in accordance with gaap this measure may be different from nongaap financial measures used by other companies limiting its usefulness for comparison purposes moreover presentation of revenue on a constant currency basis is provided for yearoveryear comparison purposes and investors should be cautioned that the effect of changing foreign currency exchange rates has an actual effect on our operating results we believe this nongaap financial measure provides investors with useful supplemental information about the financial performance of our business enables comparison of financial results between periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance and allows for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in operating our business 

executive overview of full year 2017  results 

our key user metrics and financial results for 2017  are as follows 

user growth 

 financial results 

 in 2017  we continued to focus on our three main revenue growth priorities i helping businesses expand their use of our mobile products ii developing innovative ad products that help businesses get the most of their ad campaigns and iii making our ads more relevant and effective through our targeting capabilities and outcomebased measurement 

we continued to invest based on our roadmap in i our most developed ecosystem the facebook app and platform as well as video ii driving growth and building ecosystems around our products and features that already have significant user bases such as instagram messenger and whatsapp and iii longterm technology initiatives such as connectivity artificial intelligence and augmented and virtual reality that we believe will further our mission to give people the power to build community and bring the world closer together we intend to continue to invest based on this roadmap and we anticipate that additional investments in the following areas will drive significant yearoveryear expense growth in 2018 i increased investments in security video content and our longterm technology initiatives and ii scaling our headcount and expanding our data center capacity and office facilities to support our growth 

trends in our user metrics 

the numbers for our key metrics our daus maus and average revenue per user arpu do not include instagram whatsapp or oculus users unless they would otherwise qualify as such users respectively based on their other activities on facebook in addition other user engagement metrics do not include instagram whatsapp or oculus unless otherwise specifically stated 

trends in the number of users affect our revenue and financial results by influencing the number of ads we are able to show the value of our ads to marketers the volume of payments transactions as well as our expenses and capital expenditures substantially all of our daily and monthly active users as defined below access facebook on mobile devices 

 

note for purposes of reporting daus maus and arpu by geographic region europe includes all users in russia and turkey and rest of world includes all users in africa latin america and the middle east 

worldwide daus increased 14  to 140 billion on average during december 2017  from 123 billion  during december 2016  users in india indonesia and brazil represented key sources of growth in daus during december 2017 relative to the same period in 2016 

 

as of december 31 2017  we had 213 billion  maus an increase of 14  from december 31 2016  users in india indonesia and vietnam represented key sources of growth in 2017  relative to the same period in 2016 

trends in our monetization by user geography 

we calculate our revenue by user geography based on our estimate of the geography in which ad impressions are delivered virtual and digital goods are purchased or virtual reality platform devices are shipped we define arpu as our total revenue in a given geography during a given quarter divided by the average of the number of maus in the geography at the beginning and end of the quarter while arpu includes all sources of revenue the number of maus used in this calculation only includes users of facebook and messenger as described in the definition of mau above revenue from users who are not also facebook or messenger maus was not material the geography of our users affects our revenue and financial results because we currently monetize users in different geographies at different average rates our revenue and arpu in regions such as united states  canada and europe are relatively higher primarily due to the size and maturity of those online and mobile advertising markets for example arpu in 2017  in the united states  canada region was more than nine times higher than in the asiapacific region 

note our revenue by user geography in the charts above is geographically apportioned based on our estimation of the geographic location of our users when they perform a revenuegenerating activity this allocation differs from our revenue by geography disclosure in our consolidated financial statements where revenue is geographically apportioned based on the location of the marketer or developer 

for 2017  worldwide arpu was 2021  an increase of 26  from 2016  over this period arpu increased by 41 in europe 36 in united states  canada 33 in rest of world and 22 in asiapacific in addition user growth was more rapid in geographies with relatively lower arpu such as asiapacific and rest of world we expect that user growth in the future will be primarily concentrated in those regions where arpu is relatively lower such that worldwide arpu may continue to increase at a slower rate relative to arpu in any geographic region or potentially decrease even if arpu increases in each geographic region 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue costs and expenses and related disclosures we evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis our estimates are based on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances our actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made if different estimates reasonably could have been used or if changes in the estimate that are reasonably possible could materially impact the financial statements we believe that the assumptions and estimates associated with income taxes loss contingencies and business combinations and valuation of goodwill and other acquired intangible assets have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements therefore we consider these to be our critical accounting policies and estimates for further information on all of our significant accounting policies see note 1 — summary of significant accounting policies in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data of this annual report on form 10k 

income taxes 

we are subject to income taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes and income tax assets and liabilities including evaluating uncertainties in the application of accounting principles and complex tax laws 

we record a provision for income taxes for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations using the asset and liability method under this method we recognize deferred income tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities as well as for loss and tax credit carryforwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the tax rates that are expected to apply to taxable income for the years in which those tax assets and liabilities are expected to be realized or settled we recognize the deferred income tax effects of a change in tax rates in the period of the enactment we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the net amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized 

we recognize tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if we believe that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position these uncertain tax positions include our estimates for transfer pricing that have been developed based upon analyses of appropriate armslength prices similarly our estimates related to uncertain tax positions concerning research tax credits are based on an assessment of whether our available documentation corroborating the nature of our activities supporting the tax credits will be sufficient although we believe that we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions including net interest and penalties we can provide no assurance that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be materially different we make adjustments to these reserves in accordance with the income tax accounting guidance when facts and circumstances change such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts recorded such differences will affect the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made and could have a material impact on our financial condition and operating results 

on december 22 2017 the 2017 tax cuts and jobs act the tax act was enacted into law and the new legislation contains several key tax provisions that affected us including a onetime mandatory transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings and a reduction of the corporate income tax rate to 21 effective january 1 2018 among others we are required to recognize the effect of the tax law changes in the period of enactment such as determining the transition tax remeasuring our us deferred tax assets and liabilities as well as reassessing the net realizability of our deferred tax assets and liabilities in december 2017 the sec staff issued staff accounting bulletin no 118 income tax accounting implications of the tax cuts and jobs act sab 118 which allows us to record provisional amounts during a measurement period not to extend beyond one year of the enactment date since the tax act was passed late in the fourth quarter of 2017 and ongoing guidance and accounting interpretation are expected over the next 12 months we consider the accounting of the transition tax deferred tax remeasurements and other items to be incomplete due to the forthcoming guidance and our ongoing analysis of final yearend data and tax positions we expect to complete our analysis within the measurement period in accordance with sab 118 

loss contingencies 

we are involved in legal proceedings claims and regulatory tax or government inquiries and investigations that arise in the ordinary course of business certain of these matters include speculative claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts of damages we record a liability when we believe that it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated if we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of loss can be estimated we disclose the possible loss in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements 

we review the developments in our contingencies that could affect the amount of the provisions that have been previously recorded and the matters and related reasonably possible losses disclosed we make adjustments to our provisions and changes to our disclosures accordingly to reflect the impact of negotiations settlements rulings advice of legal counsel and updated information significant judgment is required to determine both the probability and the estimated amount of loss 

the outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain therefore if one or more of these matters were resolved against us for amounts in excess of managements expectations our results of operations and financial condition including in a particular reporting period in which any such outcome becomes probable and estimable could be materially adversely affected see note 9 — commitments and contingencies and note 12 — income taxes of the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data and part i item 3 legal proceedings of this annual report on form 10k for additional information regarding these contingencies 

business combinations and valuation of goodwill and other acquired intangible assets 

we allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired liabilities assumed and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values the excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill such valuations require management to make significant estimates and assumptions especially with respect to intangible assets significant estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from acquired users acquired technology and trade names from a market participant perspective useful lives and discount rates management’s estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and as a result actual results may differ from estimates during the measurement period which is not to exceed one year from the acquisition date we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill upon the conclusion of the measurement period any subsequent adjustments are recorded to earnings 

we review goodwill for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances would more likely than not reduce the fair value of our single reporting unit below its carrying value as of december 31 2017  no impairment of goodwill has been identified 

acquired finitelived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives we evaluate the recoverability of our intangible assets for possible impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable the evaluation is performed at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities recoverability of these assets is measured by a comparison of the carrying amounts to the future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate if such review indicates that the carrying amount of property and equipment and intangible assets is not recoverable the carrying amount of such assets is reduced to fair value we have not recorded any significant impairment charges during the years presented 

in addition to the recoverability assessment we routinely review the remaining estimated useful lives of our finitelived intangible assets if we reduce the estimated useful life assumption for any asset the remaining unamortized balance would be amortized over the revised estimated useful life 

components of results of operations 

revenue 

advertising  we generate substantially all of our revenue from advertising our advertising revenue is generated by displaying ad products on facebook instagram messenger and thirdparty affiliated websites or mobile applications marketers pay for ad products either directly or through their relationships with advertising agencies based on the number of impressions delivered or the number of actions such as clicks taken by users we recognize revenue from the display of impressionbased ads in the contracted period in which the impressions are delivered impressions are considered delivered when an ad is displayed to a user we recognize revenue from the delivery of actionbased ads in the period in which a user takes the action the marketer contracted for the number of ads we show is subject to methodological changes as we continue to evolve our ads business and the structure of our ads products we calculate price per ad as total ad revenue divided by the number of ads delivered representing the effective price paid per impression by a marketer regardless of their desired objective such as impression or action for advertising revenue arrangements where we are not the primary obligor we recognize revenue on a net basis 

payments and other fees  payments revenue is comprised of the net fee we receive from developers using our payments infrastructure our other fees revenue which has not been significant in recent periods consists primarily of revenue from the delivery of virtual reality platform devices and various other sources 

cost of revenue and operating expenses 

cost of revenue  our cost of revenue consists primarily of expenses associated with the delivery and distribution of our products these include expenses related to the operation of our data centers such as facility and server equipment depreciation salaries benefits and sharebased compensation for employees on our operations teams and energy and bandwidth costs cost of revenue also includes costs associated with partner arrangements including content acquisition costs credit card and other transaction fees related to processing customer transactions cost of virtual reality platform device inventory sold and amortization of intangible assets 

research and development  research and development expenses consist primarily of sharebased compensation salaries and benefits for employees on our engineering and technical teams who are responsible for building new products as well as improving existing products we expense all of our research and development costs as they are incurred

revenue 



  

2017  compared to 2016  revenue in 2017  increased 1302 billion  or 47  compared to 2016  the increase was mostly due to an increase in advertising revenue partially offset by the continuing decline in payments revenue 

the most important factor driving advertising revenue growth was an increase in revenue from ads on mobile devices for 2017  we estimate that mobile advertising revenue represented approximately 88  of total advertising revenue as compared with approximately 83  in 2016  factors that influenced our advertising revenue growth in 2017  included i an increase in average price per ad ii an increase in users and their engagement and iii an increase in the number and frequency of ads displayed on mobile devices we anticipate that advertising revenue growth will continue to be driven primarily by price rather than increases in the number and frequency of ads displayed 

in 2017  compared to 2016  the average price per ad increased by 29 as compared with approximately 5 in 2016 and the number of ads delivered increased by 15 as compared with approximately 50 in 2016 the increase in average price per ad was driven by an increase in demand for our ad inventory factors contributing to this include an increase in spend from existing marketers and an increase in the number of marketers actively advertising on our platform as well as the quality relevance and performance of those ads the increase in the ads delivered was driven by an increase in users and their engagement and an increase in the number and frequency of ads displayed on news feed partially offset by increasing user engagement with video content and other product changes 

advertising spending is traditionally seasonally strong in the fourth quarter of each year we believe that this seasonality in advertising spending affects our quarterly results which generally reflect significant growth in advertising revenue between the third and fourth quarters and a decline in advertising spending between the fourth and subsequent first quarters for instance our advertising revenue increased 26 27 and 31 between the third and fourth quarters of 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively while advertising revenue for both the first quarters of 2017  and 2016  declined 9 and 8 compared to the fourth quarters of 2016  and 2015  respectively 

payments and other fees revenue in 2017  decreased 42 million  or 6  compared to 2016  the decline in payments and other fees revenue was primarily due to decreased payments revenue from games played on personal computers partially offset by the revenue from the delivery of virtual reality platform devices we anticipate payments revenue will continue to decline and such decline will be offset by increases in revenue from various other sources 

2016  compared to 2015  revenue in 2016 increased 971 billion or 54 compared to 2015 the increase was mostly due to an increase in advertising revenue 

the most important factor driving advertising revenue growth was an increase in revenue from ads in news feed for 2016 we estimate that mobile advertising revenue represented approximately 83 of total advertising revenue as compared with approximately 77 in 2015 factors that influenced our advertising revenue growth in 2016 included i an increase in demand for our ad inventory in part driven by an increase in the number of marketers actively advertising on facebook ii an increase in user growth and engagement and iii an increase in the number and frequency of ads displayed in news feed as well as the quality 

relevance and performance of those ads 

in 2016 compared to 2015 the average price per ad increased by 5 and the number of ads delivered increased by 50 the increase in average price per ad was driven by a continued mix shift towards a greater percentage of our ads being shown in news feed while the increase in the ads delivered was driven by the same factors that influenced our advertising growth 

payments and other fees revenue in 2016 decreased 96 million or 11 compared to 2015 the majority of the decrease in payments and other fees revenue was due to decreased payments revenue from games played on personal computers 

no customer represented 10 or more of total revenue during the years ended december 31 2017  2016  and 2015  

foreign exchange impact on revenue 

the general weakening of the us dollar relative to certain foreign currencies in the full year 2017 compared to the same period in 2016 had a favorable impact on our revenue if we had translated revenue for the full year 2017 using the prior years monthly exchange rates for our settlement currencies other than the us dollar our total revenue and advertising revenue would have been 4036 billion  and 3965 billion  respectively using these constant rates revenue and advertising revenue would have been 293 million  and 292 million  lower than actual revenue and advertising revenue respectively for the full year 2017  

the general strengthening of the us dollar relative to certain foreign currencies in the full year 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 had an unfavorable impact on our revenue if we had translated revenue for the full year 2016 using 2015 monthly exchange rates for our settlement currencies other than the us dollar our total revenue and advertising revenue would have been 2791 billion and 2715 billion respectively using these constant rates revenue and advertising revenue would have been 270 million and 269 million higher than actual revenue and advertising revenue respectively for the full year 2016 

cost of revenue 

  

  

2017  compared to 2016  cost of revenue in 2017  increased 167 billion  or 44  compared to 2016  the majority of the increase was due to an increase in operational expenses related to our data centers and technical infrastructure and to a lesser extent higher costs associated with partnership agreements including content acquisition costs and ads payment processing 

2016  compared to 2015  cost of revenue in 2016 increased 922 million or 32 compared to 2015 the majority of the increase was due to an increase in operational expenses related to our data centers and technical infrastructure and to a lesser extent higher costs associated with ads payment processing and various partnership agreements 

 in 2018  we anticipate that the cost of revenue will increase as we continue to expand our data center capacity and technical infrastructure to support user growth increased user engagement and the delivery of new products and services and to a lesser extent due to higher costs associated with ads payment processing and various partnership agreements 

research and development 



  

2017  compared to 2016  research and development expenses in 2017  increased 184 billion  or 31  compared to 2016  the majority of the increase was due to an increase in payroll and benefits as a result of a 49  growth in employee headcount from december 31 2016  to december 31 2017  in engineering and other technical functions partially offset by a 262 million decrease in sharebased compensation related to the acquisitions completed in 2014 

2016  compared to 2015   research and development expenses in 2016 increased 110 billion or 23 compared to 2015 the majority of the increase was due to an increase in payroll and benefits as a result of a 34 growth in employee headcount from december 31 2015 to december 31 2016 in engineering and other technical functions additionally our equipment and related expenses in 2016 to support our research and development efforts increased 170 million compared to 2015 

in 2018  we plan to continue to hire software engineers and other technical employees and to increase our investment to support our research and development initiatives 

marketing and sales 



  

2017  compared to 2016   marketing and sales expenses in 2017  increased 953 million  or 25  compared to 2016  the majority of the increase was due to increases in payroll and benefits expenses as a result of a 35  increase in employee headcount from december 31 2016  to december 31 2017  in our marketing and sales functions and increases in our consulting and other professional service fees additionally our marketing expenses increased 196 million in 2017 compared to 2016 

2016  compared to 2015  marketing and sales expenses in 2016 increased 105 billion or 38 compared to 2015 the majority of the increase was due to payroll and benefits expenses as a result of a 28 increase in employee headcount from december 31 2015 to december 31 2016 in our marketing and sales functions and increases in our consulting and other professional service fees additionally our marketing expenses increased 344 million in 2016 compared to 2015 

in 2018  we plan to continue the hiring of marketing and sales employees to support our marketing sales and partnership efforts and to increase our investment in security efforts through the hiring of employees and content reviewers 

general and administrative 



  

2017  compared to 2016  general and administrative expenses in 2017  increased 786 million  or 45  compared to 2016  the majority of the increase was due to an increase in payroll and benefits expenses as a result of a 58  increase in employee headcount from december 31 2016  to december 31 2017  in general and administrative functions and to a lesser extent higher legalrelated costs 

2016  compared to 2015  general and administrative expenses in 2016 increased 436 million or 34 compared to 2015 the majority of the increase was due to an increase in payroll and benefits expenses as a result of a 43 increase in employee headcount from december 31 2015 to december 31 2016 in general and administrative functions and to a lesser extent higher professional services and legal fees 

in 2018  we plan to continue to increase general and administrative expenses to support overall company growth 

interest and other income expense net 



  

2017  compared to 2016  interest and other income net in 2017  increased 300 million  compared to 2016  the majority of the increase in 2017 was due to an increase in interest income driven by higher invested cash balances and interest rates in addition foreign exchange impact resulting from the periodic remeasurement of our foreign currency assets and liabilities also contributed to the increase in 2017 

2016  compared to 2015  interest and other income expense net in 2016 increased 122 million compared to 2015 interest income net increased mostly due to increases in interest income driven by higher invested cash balances and interest rates in addition the majority of the increase in other expense net was due to foreign exchange impact resulting from the periodic remeasurement of our foreign currency assets and liabilities 

provision for income taxes 



  

2017  compared to 2016  our provision for income taxes in 2017  increased 236 billion  or 103  compared to 2016  mostly due to the effects of the tax act that was enacted on december 22 2017 and an increase in income before provision for income taxes partially offset by an increase in excess tax benefits recognized from sharebased compensation as a result of the tax act we recognized a onetime mandatory transition tax on accumulated foreign subsidiary earnings remeasured our us deferred tax assets and liabilities and reassessed the net realizability of our deferred tax assets and liabilities which increased our provision for income taxes in 2017 by 227 billion 

our effective tax rate in 2017 increased compared to 2016 mostly due to the tax act and a decrease in the tax rate benefit from sharebased compensation compared to 2016 these effects were partially offset by an increase in income before provision for income taxes being earned in jurisdictions with tax rates lower than the us statutory tax rate in 2017 excess tax benefits recognized from sharebased compensation decreased our provision for income taxes by 125 billion  and our effective tax rate by six percentage points  as compared to the tax rate without such benefits for comparison in 2016 excess tax benefits recognized from sharebased compensation decreased our provision for income taxes by 934 million and our effective tax rate by seven percentage points as compared to the tax rate without such benefits 

2016  compared to 2015  our provision for income taxes in 2016 decreased 205 million  or 8  compared to 2015  primarily due to recognition of excess tax benefits from sharebased compensation in our provision for income taxes resulting from the adoption of asu 201609 partially offset by an increase in income before provision for income taxes our effective tax rate in 2016 decreased compared to 2015 due to more of our income before provision for income taxes being earned in jurisdictions with a tax rate lower than the us statutory rate where we had asserted our intention to indefinitely reinvest certain of those earnings as well as due to a lower increase in our unrecognized tax benefit in 2016 compared to 2015 and the adoption of asu 201609 in 2016 

effective tax rate items our effective tax rate in the future will depend upon the proportion of our income before provision for income taxes earned in the united states and in jurisdictions with a tax rate lower than the us statutory rate as well as a number of other factors including excess tax benefits from sharebased compensation changes to our provisional accounting for the effects of the tax act during the measurement period tax effects of integrating intellectual property from acquisitions settlement of tax contingency items tax effects of changes in our business and the impact of new legislation 

the portion of our income before provision for income taxes earned in jurisdictions with a tax rate lower than the us statutory rate will depend upon the proportion of revenue and costs associated with the respective jurisdictions 

integrating intellectual property from acquisitions into our business generally involves intercompany transactions that have the impact of increasing our provision for income taxes consequently our provision for income taxes and our effective tax rate may initially increase in the period of an acquisition and integration the magnitude of this impact will depend upon the specific type size and taxing jurisdictions of the intellectual property as well as the relative contribution to income in subsequent periods 

the accounting for sharebased compensation will increase or decrease our effective tax rate based upon the difference between our sharebased compensation expense and the deductions taken on our tax return which depends upon the stock price at the time of employee award vesting 

absent unanticipated events and unexpected effects of the tax act we anticipate our effective tax rate in 2018 will be lower than it was in 2017 our 2017 effective tax rate was significantly affected by the tax act in addition since we recognize excess tax benefits on a discrete basis we anticipate that our effective tax rate will vary from quarter to quarter depending on our stock price in each period if our stock price remains constant to the january 31 2018 price we anticipate that our effective tax rate will be lower in the first quarter of 2018 and increase in the remaining quarters throughout the year 

unrecognized tax benefits as of december 31 2017 we had net unrecognized tax benefits of 275 billion  which were accrued as other liabilities these unrecognized tax benefits were predominantly accrued for uncertainties related to transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries which includes licensing of intellectual property providing services and other transactions as well as for uncertainties with our research tax credits the ultimate settlement of the liabilities will depend upon resolution of tax audits litigation or events that would otherwise change the assessment of such items based upon the status of litigation described below and the current status of tax audits in various jurisdictions we do not anticipate a significant impact to such amounts within the next 12 months 

in july 2016 we received a statutory notice of deficiency notice from the irs related to transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries in conjunction with the examination of the 2010 tax year while the notice applies only to the 2010 tax year the irs states that it will also apply its position for tax years subsequent to 2010 which if the irs prevails in its position could result in an additional federal tax liability of an estimated aggregate amount of approximately 30 billion to 50 billion in excess of the amounts in our originally filed us return plus interest and any penalties asserted we do not agree with the position of the irs and have filed a petition in the united states tax court challenging the notice we have previously accrued an estimated unrecognized tax benefit consistent with the guidance in asc 740 that is lower than the potential additional federal tax liability of 30 billion to 50 billion in excess of the amounts in our originally filed us return plus interest and penalties if the irs prevails in the assessment of additional tax due based on its position the assessed tax interest and penalties if any could have a material adverse impact on our financial position results of operations and cash flows as of december 31 2017 we have not resolved this matter and proceedings continue in the united states tax court we believe that adequate amounts have been reserved for any adjustments that may ultimately result from these examinations 

we expect to continue to accrue unrecognized tax benefits for certain recurring tax positions and anticipate that the amount for future quarters accrued will be similar to amounts accrued in 2017 absent unanticipated events we do not expect our unrecognized tax benefits will have a significant impact on our effective tax rate in 2018 

quarterly results of operations data 

the following tables set forth our unaudited quarterly consolidated statements of income data in dollars and as a percentage of total revenue for each of the eight quarters in the period ended december 31 2017  we have prepared the quarterly consolidated statements of income data on a basis consistent with the audited consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data in this annual report on form 10k in the opinion of management the financial information reflects all adjustments consisting only of normal recurring adjustments which we consider necessary for a fair presentation of this data this information should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included in part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data in this annual report on form 10k the results of historical periods are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations for any future period

liquidity and capital resources 



our principal sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents marketable securities and cash generated from operations cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities consist primarily of cash on deposit with banks investments in money market funds and investments in us government securities us government agency securities and corporate debt securities cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities were 4171 billion  as of december 31 2017  an increase of 1226 billion  from december 31 2016  mostly due to 2422 billion  of cash generated from operations partially offset by 673 billion  for purchases of property and equipment 325 billion  of taxes paid related to net share settlement of equity awards and 198 billion  for repurchases of our class a common stock 

cash paid for income taxes net of refunds was 212 billion  for the year ended december 31 2017  we recorded a provisional tax liability of 29 billion  relating to the onetime mandatory transition tax on our accumulated foreign earnings which we intend to pay over an eightyear payment schedule as prescribed by the tax act 

 in may 2016 we entered into a 20 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility and any amounts outstanding under the facility will be due and payable on may 20 2021 as of december 31 2017  no amounts had been drawn down and we were in compliance with the covenants under this credit facility 

in november 2016 our board of directors authorized a 60 billion  share repurchase program of our class a common stock that commenced in 2017 and does not have an expiration date the timing and actual number of shares repurchased depend on a variety of factors including price general business and market conditions and other investment opportunities and shares may be repurchased through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions including through the use of trading plans intended to qualify under rule 10b51 under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended during 2017 we repurchased and subsequently retired approximately 13 million  shares of our class a common stock for an aggregate amount of approximately 207 billion  

in january 2017 we began funding withholding taxes due on employee equity awards by net share settlement rather than our previous approach of requiring employees to sell shares of our common stock to cover taxes upon vesting of such awards in 2017 we paid 325 billion  of taxes related to the net share settlement of equity awards 

as of december 31 2017  1589 billion  of the 4171 billion  in cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities was held by our foreign subsidiaries the tax act imposes a mandatory transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings and eliminates us taxes on foreign subsidiary distributions as a result earnings in foreign jurisdictions are available for distribution to the us without incremental us taxes 

we currently anticipate that our available funds credit facility and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our operational cash needs for the foreseeable future 

cash provided by operating activities 

cash flow from operating activities during 2017  mostly consisted of net income adjusted for certain noncash items such as sharebased compensation expense of 372 billion  and total depreciation and amortization of 303 billion  the increase in cash flow from operating activities during 2017  compared to 2016  was mostly due to an increase in net income adjusted for certain noncash items such as depreciation and amortization and sharebased compensation expense due to the enactment of the tax act in 2017 we recorded a provisional tax liability of 29 billion  relating to the onetime mandatory transition tax on our accumulated foreign earningswhich also contributed to the increase in 2017 compared to 2016

cash used in investing activities 

cash used in investing activities during 2017  mostly resulted from 1325 billion  for net purchases of marketable securities and 673 billion  for capital expenditures as we continued to invest in servers data centers office buildings and network infrastructure the increase in cash used in investing activities during 2017  compared to 2016  was due to increases in net purchases of marketable securities and capital expenditures

cash used in investing activities during 2015 primarily resulted from 670 billion for net purchases of marketable securities and 252 billion for capital expenditures as we continued to invest in servers data centers network infrastructure and office buildings the increase in cash used in investing activities during 2015 compared to 2014 was mainly due to increases in net purchases of marketable securities partially offset by a decrease in acquisitions of businesses and purchases of intangible assets 

we anticipate making capital expenditures in 2018  of approximately 140 billion to 150 billion 

cash used in financing activities 

cash used in financing activities during 2017  mostly consisted of 325 billion of taxes paid related to net share settlement of equity awards and 198 billion paid for repurchases of our class a common stock the increase in cash used in financing activities during 2017 compared to 2016 was mostly due to taxes paid related to net share settlement of equity awards and repurchases of our class a common stock that commenced in 2017

cash used in financing activities during 2015 primarily consisted of principal payments on capital lease obligations the decrease in cash used in financing activities was primarily due to lower principal payments related to our capital lease transactions 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we did not have any offbalance sheet arrangements as of december 31 2017  

contractual obligations 

our principal commitments consist of obligations under operating leases for offices land facilities colocations and data centers as well as contractual commitments related to network infrastructure and data center operations the following table summarizes our commitments to settle contractual obligations in cash as of december 31 2017  in millions 



 

as part of the normal course of the business we may enter into multiyear agreements to purchase certain network components that do not specify a fixed or minimum price commitment or to purchase renewable energy that do not specify a fixed or minimum volume commitment these agreements are generally entered into in order to secure either volume or price using projected market prices or expected volume consumption the total estimated spend is approximately 40 billion the ultimate spend under these agreements may vary and will be based on prevailing market prices or actual volume purchased 

in addition our other liabilities include 275 billion  related to uncertain tax positions as of december 31 2017  due to uncertainties in the timing of the completion of tax audits the timing of the resolution of these positions is uncertain and we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years beyond 12 months as a result this amount is not included in the above contractual obligations table 

contingencies 

we are involved in legal proceedings claims and regulatory tax or government inquiries and investigations we record a provision for a liability when we believe that it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and that the amount can be reasonably estimated if we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of loss can be estimated we disclose the possible loss in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements significant judgment is required to determine both probability and the estimated amount of loss such matters are inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties some of which are beyond our control should any of these estimates and assumptions change or prove to be incorrect it could have a material impact on our results of operations financial position and cash flows

foreign currency exchange risk 

we have foreign currency risks related to our revenue and operating expenses denominated in currencies other than the us dollar primarily the euro in general we are a net receiver of currencies other than the us dollar accordingly changes in exchange rates and in particular a strengthening of the us dollar have in the past and may in the future negatively affect our revenue and other operating results as expressed in us dollars 

we have experienced and will continue to experience fluctuations in our net income as a result of transaction gains or losses related to revaluing certain current asset and current liability balances that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the entities in which they are recorded at this time we have not entered into but in the future we may enter into derivatives or other financial instruments in an attempt to hedge our foreign currency exchange risk it is difficult to predict the effect hedging activities would have on our results of operations we recognized foreign currency losses of 6 million  76 million  and 66 million  in 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively 

interest rate sensitivity 

our exposure to changes in interest rates relates primarily to interest earned and market value on our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities 

our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities consist of cash certificates of deposit time deposits money market funds us government securities us government agency securities and corporate debt securities  our investment policy and strategy are focused on preservation of capital and supporting our liquidity requirements changes in us interest rates affect the interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities and the market value of those securities a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would have resulted in a decrease of 611 million  and 403 million  in the market value of our availableforsale debt securities as of december 31 2017  and december 31 2016  respectively any realized gains or losses resulting from such interest rate changes would only occur if we sold the investments prior to maturity

government regulation 

we are subject to a number of us federal and state and foreign laws and regulations that affect companies conducting business on the internet many of these laws and regulations are still evolving and being tested in courts and could be interpreted in ways that could harm our business these may involve user privacy data protection and personal information rights of publicity content intellectual property advertising marketing distribution data security data retention and deletion personal information electronic contracts and other communications competition protection of minors consumer protection telecommunications product liability taxation economic or other trade prohibitions or sanctions securities law compliance and online payment services in particular we are subject to federal state and foreign laws regarding privacy and protection of peoples data foreign data protection privacy competition and other laws and regulations can be more restrictive than those in the united states us federal and state and foreign laws and regulations which in some cases can be enforced by private parties in addition to government entities are constantly evolving and can be subject to significant change as a result the application interpretation and enforcement of these laws and regulations are often uncertain particularly in the new and rapidlyevolving industry in which we operate and may be interpreted and applied inconsistently from country to country and inconsistently with our current policies and practices 

proposed or new legislation and regulations could also significantly affect our business there currently are a number of proposals pending before federal state and foreign legislative and regulatory bodies including a data protection regulation known as the general data protection regulation gdpr which has been finalized and is due to come into force in or around may 2018 the gdpr will include operational requirements for companies that receive or process personal data of residents of the european union that are different than those currently in place in the european union and that will include significant penalties for non 

compliance similarly there are a number of legislative proposals in the united states at both the federal and state level that could impose new obligations in areas affecting our business such as liability for copyright infringement by third parties in addition some countries are considering or have passed legislation implementing data protection requirements or requiring local storage and processing of data or similar requirements that could increase the cost and complexity of delivering our services 

we are currently and may in the future be subject to regulatory orders or consent decrees violation of existing or future regulatory orders or consent decrees could subject us to substantial monetary fines and other penalties that could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations 

various laws and regulations in the united states and abroad such as the us bank secrecy act the doddfrank act the usa patriot act and the credit card act impose certain antimoney laundering requirements on companies that are financial institutions or that provide financial products and services under these laws and regulations financial institutions are broadly defined to include money services businesses such as money transmitters check cashers and sellers or issuers of stored value or prepaid access products requirements imposed on financial institutions under these laws include customer identification and verification programs record retention policies and procedures and transaction reporting to increase flexibility in how our online payments infrastructure payments may evolve and to mitigate regulatory uncertainty we have received certain money transmitter licenses in the united states and an electronic money emoney license that allows us to conduct certain regulated payment activities in the participating member countries of the european economic area which will generally require us to demonstrate compliance with many domestic and foreign laws relating to money transmission gift cards and other prepaid access instruments electronic funds transfers antimoney laundering charitable fundraising counterterrorist financing gambling banking and lending financial privacy and data security and import and export restrictions

 item 1a 

risk factors 

tableend certain factors may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations you should consider carefully the risks and uncertainties described below in addition to other information contained in this annual report on form 10k including our consolidated financial statements and related notes the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of or that we currently believe are not material may also become important factors that adversely affect our business if any of the following risks actually occurs our business financial condition results of operations and future prospects could be materially and adversely affected in that event the trading price of our class a common stock could decline and you could lose part or all of your investment 

risks related to our business and industry 

if we fail to retain existing users or add new users or if our users decrease their level of engagement with our products our revenue financial results and business may be significantly harmed 

the size of our user base and our users level of engagement are critical to our success our financial performance has been and will continue to be significantly determined by our success in adding retaining and engaging active users of our products particularly for facebook and instagram we anticipate that our active user growth rate will continue to decline over time as the size of our active user base increases and as we achieve higher market penetration rates if people do not perceive our products to be useful reliable and trustworthy we may not be able to attract or retain users or otherwise maintain or increase the frequency and duration of their engagement a number of other social networking companies that achieved early popularity have since seen their active user bases or levels of engagement decline in some cases precipitously there is no guarantee that we will not experience a similar erosion of our active user base or engagement levels our user engagement patterns have changed over time and user engagement can be difficult to measure particularly as we introduce new and different products and services any number of factors could potentially negatively affect user retention growth and engagement including if 



 if we are unable to maintain or increase our user base and user engagement our revenue and financial results may be adversely affected any decrease in user retention growth or engagement could render our products less attractive to users marketers and developers which is likely to have a material and adverse impact on our revenue business financial condition and results of operations if our active user growth rate continues to slow we will become increasingly dependent on our ability to maintain or increase levels of user engagement and monetization in order to drive revenue growth 

we generate substantially all of our revenue from advertising the loss of marketers or reduction in spending by marketers could seriously harm our business 

substantially all of our revenue is currently generated from third parties advertising on facebook and instagram for 2016 2015 and 2014 advertising accounted for 97  95  and 92  respectively of our revenue as is common in the industry our marketers do not have longterm advertising commitments with us many of our marketers spend only a relatively small portion of their overall advertising budget with us in addition marketers may view some of our products as experimental and unproven marketers will not continue to do business with us or they will reduce the prices they are willing to pay to advertise with us or the budgets they are willing to commit to us if we do not deliver ads in an effective manner or if they do not believe that their investment in advertising with us will generate a competitive return relative to other alternatives 

our advertising revenue could also be adversely affected by a number of other factors including 



 the occurrence of any of these or other factors could result in a reduction in demand for our ads which may reduce the prices we receive for our ads or cause marketers to stop advertising with us altogether either of which would negatively affect our revenue and financial results 

our user growth engagement and monetization on mobile devices depend upon effective operation with mobile operating systems networks and standards that we do not control 

the substantial majority of our revenue is generated from advertising on mobile devices there is no guarantee that popular mobile devices will continue to feature facebook or our other products or that mobile device users will continue to use our products rather than competing products we are dependent on the interoperability of facebook and our other products with popular mobile operating systems networks and standards that we do not control such as the android and ios operating systems any changes bugs or technical issues in such systems or changes in our relationships with mobile operating system partners handset manufacturers or mobile carriers or in their terms of service or policies that degrade our products functionality reduce or eliminate our ability to distribute our products give preferential treatment to competitive products limit our ability to deliver target or measure the effectiveness of ads or charge fees related to the distribution of our products or our delivery of ads could adversely affect the usage of facebook or our other products and monetization on mobile devices additionally in order to deliver high quality mobile products it is important that our products work well with a range of mobile technologies systems networks and standards that we do not control and that we have good relationships with handset manufacturers and mobile carriers we may not be successful in maintaining or developing relationships with key participants in the mobile ecosystem or in developing products that operate effectively with these technologies systems networks or standards in the event that it is more difficult for our users to access and use facebook or our other products on their mobile devices or if our users choose not to access or use facebook or our other products on their mobile devices or use mobile products that do not offer access to facebook or our other products our user growth and user engagement could be harmed from time to time we may also take actions regarding the distribution of our products or the operation of our business based on what we believe to be in our longterm best interests such actions may adversely affect our users and our relationships with the operators of mobile operating systems handset manufacturers mobile carriers or other business partners and there is no assurance that these actions will result in the anticipated longterm benefits in the event that our users are adversely affected by these actions or if our relationships with such third parties deteriorate our user growth engagement and monetization could be adversely affected and our business could be harmed 

our business is highly competitive competition presents an ongoing threat to the success of our business 

we compete with companies that sell advertising as well as with companies that provide social and communication products and services that are designed to engage users and capture time spent on mobile devices and online we face significant competition in every aspect of our business including from companies that facilitate communication and the sharing of content and information companies that enable marketers to display advertising and companies that provide development platforms for applications developers we compete with companies that offer products across broad platforms that replicate capabilities we provide for example google has integrated social functionality into a number of its products including search video and android we also compete with companies that develop applications particularly mobile applications that provide social or other communications functionality such as messaging photo and videosharing and microblogging as well as companies that provide regional social networks that have strong positions in particular countries in addition we face competition from traditional online and mobile businesses that provide media for marketers to reach their audiences andor   develop tools and systems for managing and optimizing advertising campaigns we also compete with companies that develop and deliver virtual reality products and services 

some of our current and potential competitors may have significantly greater resources or better competitive positions in certain product segments geographic regions or user demographics than we do these factors may allow our competitors to respond more effectively than us to new or emerging technologies and changes in market conditions we believe that some of our users particularly our younger users are aware of and actively engaging with other products and services similar to or as a substitute for facebook products and services and we believe that some of our users have reduced their use of and engagement with facebook in favor of these other products and services in the event that our users increasingly engage with other products and services we may experience a decline in use and engagement in key user demographics or more broadly in which case our business would likely be harmed 

our competitors may develop products features or services that are similar to ours or that achieve greater acceptance may undertake more farreaching and successful product development efforts or marketing campaigns or may adopt more aggressive pricing policies in addition developers whose mobile and web applications are integrated with facebook or our other products may use information shared by our users through our products in order to develop products or features that compete with us some competitors may gain a competitive advantage against us in areas where we operate including by integrating competing platforms applications or features into products they control such as mobile device operating systems search engines or web browsers by 

making acquisitions by limiting or denying our access to advertising measurement or delivery systems by limiting our ability to deliver target or measure the effectiveness of ads by imposing fees or other charges related to our delivery of ads by making access to our products more difficult or by making it more difficult to communicate with our users as a result our competitors may acquire and engage users or generate advertising or other revenue at the expense of our own efforts which may negatively affect our business and financial results in addition from time to time we may take actions in response to competitive threats but we cannot assure you that these actions will be successful or that they will not negatively affect our business and financial results 

we believe that our ability to compete effectively depends upon many factors both within and beyond our control including 

 if we are not able to compete effectively our user base and level of user engagement may decrease we may become less attractive to developers and marketers and our revenue and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected 

action by governments to restrict access to facebook or our other products in their countries could substantially harm our business and financial results 

it is possible that governments of one or more countries may seek to censor content available on facebook or our other products in their country restrict access to our products from their country entirely or impose other restrictions that may affect the accessibility of our products in their country for an extended period of time or indefinitely for example access to facebook has been or is currently restricted in whole or in part in china iran and north korea in addition government authorities in other countries may seek to restrict access to our products if they consider us to be in violation of their laws and certain of our products have been restricted by governments in other countries from time to time in the event that content shown on facebook or our other products is subject to censorship access to our products is restricted in whole or in part in one or more countries or other restrictions are imposed on our products or our competitors are able to successfully penetrate new geographic markets or capture a greater share of existing geographic markets that we cannot access or where we face other restrictions our ability to retain or increase our user base and user engagement may be adversely affected we may not be able to maintain or grow our revenue as anticipated and our financial results could be adversely affected 

our new products and changes to existing products could fail to attract or retain users or generate revenue and profits 

our ability to retain increase and engage our user base and to increase our revenue depends heavily on our ability to continue to evolve our existing products and to create successful new products both independently and in conjunction with developers or other third parties we may introduce significant changes to our existing products or acquire or introduce new and unproven products including using technologies with which we have little or no prior development or operating experience for example in march 2016 we shipped our first virtual reality hardware product the oculus rift we do not have prior experience with consumer hardware products or virtual reality technology which may adversely affect our ability to successfully develop and market the oculus rift and related products or technology and we will incur increased costs in connection with the development and marketing of such products and technology in addition we have invested significant resources in growing our whatsapp and messenger products we have historically monetized messaging in only a very limited fashion and we may not be successful in our efforts to generate meaningful revenue from messaging over the long term if these or other new or enhanced products fail to engage users marketers or developers or if we are unsuccessful in our monetization efforts we may fail to attract or retain users or to generate sufficient revenue operating margin or other value to justify our investments and our business may be adversely affected 

we make product and investment decisions that may not prioritize shortterm financial results 

we frequently make product and investment decisions that may not prioritize shortterm financial results if we believe that the decisions are consistent with our mission and benefit the aggregate user experience and will thereby improve our financial performance over the long term for example from time to time we may change the size frequency or relative prominence of ads in order to improve ad quality and overall user experience similarly from time to time we update our news feed ranking algorithm to deliver the most relevant content to our users which may adversely affect the distribution of content of marketers and developers and could reduce their incentive to invest in their development and marketing efforts on facebook we also may introduce changes to existing products or introduce new standalone products that direct users away from properties formats or use cases where we have a proven means of monetization for example we have taken action to redirect users who send messages from within the facebook application to our standalone messenger application although we do not monetize the standalone messenger application in any significant manner in addition we plan to continue focusing on growing the user base for whatsapp and potentially other standalone applications that may have limited or no nearterm monetization and it is possible that these efforts may reduce engagement with the core facebook application we are also investing in new experiences using video including facebook live and we may not successfully monetize such experiences we also may take steps that result in limiting distribution of mobile products and services in the short term in order to attempt to ensure the availability of our products and services to users over the long term these decisions may not produce the longterm benefits that we expect in which case our user growth and engagement our relationships with marketers and developers and our business and results of operations could be harmed 

if we are not able to maintain and enhance our brands or if events occur that damage our reputation and brands our ability to expand our base of users marketers and developers may be impaired and our business and financial results may be harmed 

we believe that our brands have significantly contributed to the success of our business we also believe that maintaining and enhancing our brands is critical to expanding our base of users marketers and developers many of our new users are referred by existing users maintaining and enhancing our brands will depend largely on our ability to continue to provide useful reliable trustworthy and innovative products which we may not do successfully we may introduce new products or terms of service or policies that users do not like which may negatively affect our brands additionally the actions of our developers or advertisers may affect our brands if users do not have a positive experience using thirdparty mobile and web applications integrated with our products or interacting with parties that advertise through our products we will also continue to experience media legislative or regulatory scrutiny of our decisions regarding user privacy and other issues which may adversely affect our reputation and brands we also may fail to provide adequate customer service which could erode confidence in our brands our brands may also be negatively affected by the actions of users that are deemed to be hostile or inappropriate to other users by the actions of users acting under false or inauthentic identities by the use of our products or services to disseminate information that is deemed to be misleading or intended to manipulate opinions by perceived or actual efforts by governments to obtain access to user information for securityrelated purposes or by the use of our products or services for illicit objectionable or illegal ends maintaining and enhancing our brands may require us to make substantial investments and these investments may not be successful certain of our past actions have eroded confidence in our brands and if we fail to successfully promote and maintain our brands or if we incur excessive expenses in this effort our business and financial results may be adversely affected 

security breaches and improper access to or disclosure of our data or user data or other hacking and phishing attacks on our systems could harm our reputation and adversely affect our business 

our industry is prone to cyberattacks by third parties seeking unauthorized access to our data or users’ data   any failure to prevent or mitigate security breaches and improper access to or disclosure of our data or user data could result in the loss or misuse of such data which could harm our business and reputation and diminish our competitive position in addition computer malware 

viruses social engineering predominantly spear phishing attacks and general hacking have become more prevalent in our industry have occurred on our systems in the past and will occur on our systems in the future as a result of our prominence we believe that we are a particularly attractive target for such breaches and attacks such attacks may cause interruptions to the services we provide degrade the user experience cause users to lose confidence and trust in our products or result in financial harm to us our efforts to protect our company data or the information we receive may also be unsuccessful due to software bugs or other technical malfunctions employee contractor or vendor error or malfeasance government surveillance or other threats that evolve in addition third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or users to disclose information in order to gain access to our data or our users data although we have developed systems and processes that are designed to protect our data and user data to prevent data loss and to prevent or detect security breaches we cannot assure you that such measures will provide absolute security 

in addition some of our developers or other partners such as those that help us measure the effectiveness of ads may receive or store information provided by us or by our users through mobile or web applications integrated with facebook we provide limited information to such third parties based on the scope of services provided to us however if these third parties or developers fail to adopt or adhere to adequate data security practices or in the event of a breach of their networks our data or our users data may be improperly accessed used or disclosed 

affected users or government authorities could initiate legal or regulatory actions against us in connection with any security breaches or improper disclosure of data which could cause us to incur significant expense and liability or result in orders or consent decrees forcing us to modify our business practices any of these events could have a material and adverse effect on our business reputation or financial results 

unfavorable media coverage could negatively affect our business 

we receive a high degree of media coverage around the world unfavorable publicity regarding for example our privacy practices terms of service product changes product quality litigation or regulatory activity government surveillance the actions of our advertisers the actions of our developers whose products are integrated with our products the use of our products or services for illicit objectionable or illegal ends the actions of our users the quality and integrity of content shared on our platform or the actions of other companies that provide similar services to us could adversely affect our reputation such negative publicity also could have an adverse effect on the size engagement and loyalty of our user base and result in decreased revenue which could adversely affect our business and financial results 

our financial results will fluctuate from quarter to quarter and are difficult to predict 

our quarterly financial results have fluctuated in the past and will fluctuate in the future additionally we have a limited operating history with the current scale of our business which makes it difficult to forecast our future results as a result you should not rely upon our past quarterly financial results as indicators of future performance you should take into account the risks and uncertainties frequently encountered by companies in rapidly evolving markets our financial results in any given quarter can be influenced by numerous factors many of which we are unable to predict or are outside of our control including 



 we expect our rates of growth to decline in the future 

we expect that our user growth and revenue growth rates will decline over time as the size of our active user base increases and as we achieve greater market penetration we expect our revenue growth rate will generally decline over time as our revenue increases to higher levels as our growth rates decline investors perceptions of our business may be adversely affected and the trading price of our class a common stock could decline 

our costs are continuing to grow which could harm our business and profitability 

operating our business is costly and we expect our expenses to continue to increase in the future as we broaden our user base as users increase the amount of content they consume and the data they share with us for example with respect to video as we develop and implement new products as we continue to expand our technical infrastructure and as we continue to hire additional employees to support our expanding operations we expect to continue to invest in our global connectivity efforts and other initiatives which may not have clear paths to monetization we may also be subject to increased costs in order to obtain and attract thirdparty content or to facilitate the distribution of our products in addition we will incur increased costs in connection with the development and marketing of our oculus products and services any such investments may not be successful and any such increases in our costs may adversely affect our business and profitability 

our business is subject to complex and evolving us and foreign laws and regulations regarding privacy data protection competition consumer protection and other matters many of these laws and regulations are subject to change and uncertain interpretation and could result in claims changes to our business practices monetary penalties increased cost of operations or declines in user growth or engagement or otherwise harm our business 

we are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the united states and abroad that involve matters central to our business including privacy data protection and personal information rights of publicity content intellectual property advertising marketing distribution data security data retention and deletion personal information electronic contracts and other communications competition protection of minors consumer protection telecommunications product liability taxation economic or other trade prohibitions or sanctions securities law compliance and online payment services the introduction of new products expansion of our activities in certain jurisdictions or other actions that we may take may subject us to additional laws regulations or other government scrutiny in addition foreign data protection privacy competition and other laws and regulations can impose different obligations or be more restrictive than those in the united states 

these us federal and state and foreign laws and regulations which in some cases can be enforced by private parties in addition to government entities are constantly evolving and can be subject to significant change as a result the application interpretation and enforcement of these laws and regulations are often uncertain particularly in the new and rapidly evolving industry in which we operate and may be interpreted and applied inconsistently from country to country and inconsistently with our current policies and practices for example regulatory or legislative actions affecting the manner in which we display content to our users or obtain consent to various practices could adversely affect user growth and engagement such actions could affect the manner in which we provide our services or adversely affect our financial results 

we are also subject to laws and regulations that dictate whether how and under what circumstances we can transfer process andor receive transnational data that is critical to our operations including data relating to users customers or partners outside the united states and those laws and regulations are uncertain and subject to change for example in october 2015 the european court of justice invalidated the european commissions 2000 safe harbour decision as a legitimate basis on which facebook could rely for the transfer of data from the european union to the united states the european union and united states recently agreed to an alternative transfer framework for data transferred from the european union to the united states called the privacy shield but this new framework is subject to an annual review that could result in changes to our obligations and also may be challenged by national regulators or private parties in addition the other bases on which facebook relies to legitimize the transfer of data such as standard model contractual clauses mccs have been subjected to regulatory or judicial scrutiny for example the irish data protection commissioner is investigating and has challenged the legal grounds for transfers of user data to facebook inc if one or more of the legal bases for transferring data from europe to the united states is invalidated or if facebook is unable to transfer personal data between and among countries and regions in which it operates it could affect the manner in which we provide our services or adversely affect our financial results 

proposed or new legislation and regulations could also significantly affect our business there currently are a number of proposals pending before federal state and foreign legislative and regulatory bodies in addition the european commission has approved a data protection regulation known as the general data protection regulation gdpr which has been finalized and is due to come into force in or around may 2018 the gdpr will include operational requirements for companies that receive or process personal data of residents of the european union that are different than those currently in place in the european union and that will include significant penalties for noncompliance similarly there are a number of legislative proposals in the united states at both the federal and state level that could impose new obligations in areas affecting our business such as liability for copyright infringement by third parties in addition some countries are considering or have passed legislation implementing data protection requirements or requiring local storage and processing of data or similar requirements that could increase the cost and complexity of delivering our services 

these laws and regulations as well as any associated inquiries or investigations or any other government actions may be costly to comply with and may delay or impede the development of new products result in negative publicity increase our operating costs require significant management time and attention and subject us to remedies that may harm our business including fines or demands or orders that we modify or cease existing business practices 

we have been subject to regulatory investigations and settlements and we expect to continue to be subject to such proceedings and other inquires in the future which could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner materially adverse to our business 

from time to time we receive formal and informal inquiries from government authorities and regulators regarding our compliance with laws and regulations many of which are evolving and subject to interpretation we are and expect to continue to be the subject of investigations inquiries actions and audits in the united states europe and around the world particularly in the areas of privacy data protection consumer protection and competition as we continue to grow and expand our operations for example several data protection authorities in the european union have initiated actions investigations or administrative orders seeking to assert jurisdiction over facebook inc and our subsidiaries and to restrict the ways in which we collect and use information and other data protection authorities may do the same further the european commission’s directorate general for competition has issued a statement of objections in connection with our 2014 acquisition of whatsapp and is investigating whether facebook provided incorrect or misleading information during the merger review process though the investigation will not have an impact on the merger approval orders issued by or inquiries or enforcement actions initiated by government or regulatory authorities could cause us to incur substantial costs expose us to unanticipated civil and criminal liability or penalties including substantial monetary fines or require us to change our business practices in a manner materially adverse to our business 

if we are unable to protect our intellectual property the value of our brands and other intangible assets may be diminished and our business may be adversely affected 

we rely and expect to continue to rely on a combination of confidentiality assignment and license agreements with our employees consultants and third parties with whom we have relationships as well as trademark copyright patent trade secret and domain name protection laws to protect our proprietary rights in the united states and internationally we have filed various applications for protection of certain aspects of our intellectual property and we currently hold a number of issued patents in multiple jurisdictions and have acquired patents and patent applications from third parties in addition in the future we may acquire additional patents or patent portfolios which could require significant cash expenditures third parties may knowingly or unknowingly infringe our proprietary rights third parties may challenge proprietary rights held by us and pending and future trademark and patent applications may not be approved in addition effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which we operate or intend to operate our business in any or all of these cases we may be required to expend significant time and expense in order to prevent infringement or to enforce our rights although we have generally taken measures to protect our proprietary rights there can be no assurance that others will not offer products or concepts that are substantially similar to ours and compete with our business in addition we regularly contribute software source code under open source licenses and have made other technology we developed available under other open licenses and we include open source software in our products for example we have contributed certain specifications and designs related to our data center equipment to the open compute project foundation a nonprofit entity that shares and develops such information with the technology community under the open web foundation license as a result of our open source contributions and the use of open source in our products we may license or be required to license or disclose code andor innovations that turn out to be material to our business and may also be exposed to increased litigation risk if the protection of our proprietary rights is inadequate to prevent unauthorized use or appropriation by third parties the value of our brands and other intangible assets may be diminished and competitors may be able to more effectively mimic our products services and methods of operations any of these events could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results 

we are currently and expect to be in the future party to patent lawsuits and other intellectual property rights claims that are expensive and time consuming and if resolved adversely could have a significant impact on our business financial condition or results of operations 

companies in the internet technology and media industries own large numbers of patents copyrights trademarks and trade secrets and frequently enter into litigation based on allegations of infringement misappropriation or other violations of intellectual property or other rights in addition various nonpracticing entities that own patents and other intellectual property rights often attempt to aggressively assert their rights in order to extract value from technology companies furthermore from time to time we may introduce or acquire new products including in areas where we historically have not competed which could increase our exposure to patent and other intellectual property claims from competitors and nonpracticing entities 

from time to time we receive notice letters from patent holders alleging that certain of our products and services infringe their patent rights we presently are involved in a number of intellectual property lawsuits and as we face increasing competition and gain an increasingly high profile we expect the number of patent and other intellectual property claims against us to grow defending patent and other intellectual property litigation is costly and can impose a significant burden on management and employees and there can be no assurances that favorable final outcomes will be obtained in all cases in addition plaintiffs may seek and we may become subject to preliminary or provisional rulings in the course of any such litigation including potential preliminary injunctions requiring us to cease some or all of our operations we may decide to settle such lawsuits and disputes on terms that are unfavorable to us similarly if any litigation to which we are a party is resolved adversely we may be subject to an unfavorable judgment that 

may not be reversed upon appeal the terms of such a settlement or judgment may require us to cease some or all of our operations or pay substantial amounts to the other party in addition we may have to seek a license to continue practices found to be in violation of a third partys rights which may not be available on reasonable terms or at all and may significantly increase our operating costs and expenses as a result we may also be required to develop alternative noninfringing technology or practices or discontinue the practices the development of alternative noninfringing technology or practices could require significant effort and expense or may not be feasible our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected as a result of an unfavorable resolution of the disputes and litigation referred to above 

we are involved in numerous class action lawsuits and other litigation matters that are expensive and time consuming and if resolved adversely could harm our business financial condition or results of operations 

in addition to intellectual property claims we are also involved in numerous other lawsuits including putative class action lawsuits many of which claim statutory damages andor seek significant changes to our business operations and we anticipate that we will continue to be a target for numerous lawsuits in the future because of the scale of our user base the plaintiffs in class action cases filed against us typically claim enormous monetary damages even if the alleged peruser harm is small or nonexistent in addition we may be subject to additional class action lawsuits based on product performance or other claims related to the use of consumer hardware and software as well as virtual reality technology and products which are new and unproven any negative outcome from any such lawsuits could result in payments of substantial monetary damages or fines or undesirable changes to our products or business practices and accordingly our business financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected although the results of such lawsuits and claims cannot be predicted with certainty we do not believe that the final outcome of those matters relating to our products that we currently face will have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations in addition we are currently the subject of stockholder class action suits in connection with our ipo and with our intention to create a new class of capital stock class c capital stock and to declare and pay a dividend of two shares of class c capital stock for each outstanding share of class a and class b common stock the reclassification we believe these lawsuits are without merit and are vigorously defending these lawsuits 

there can be no assurances that a favorable final outcome will be obtained in all our cases and defending any lawsuit is costly and can impose a significant burden on management and employees any litigation to which we are a party may result in an onerous or unfavorable judgment that may not be reversed upon appeal or in payments of substantial monetary damages or fines or we may decide to settle lawsuits on similarly unfavorable terms which could adversely affect our business financial conditions or results of operations 

we may incur liability as a result of information retrieved from or transmitted over the internet or published using our products or as a result of claims related to our products 

we have faced currently face and will continue to face claims relating to information that is published or made available on our products in particular the nature of our business exposes us to claims related to defamation dissemination of misinformation or news hoaxes intellectual property rights rights of publicity and privacy personal injury torts or local laws regulating hate speech or other types of content this risk is enhanced in certain jurisdictions outside the united states where our protection from liability for thirdparty actions may be unclear and where we may be less protected under local laws than we are in the united states we could incur significant costs investigating and defending such claims and if we are found liable significant damages we could also face orders restricting or blocking our services in particular geographies as a result of content hosted on our services if any of these events occur our business and financial results could be adversely affected 

our ceo has control over key decision making as a result of his control of a majority of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock 

mark zuckerberg our founder chairman and ceo is able to exercise voting rights with respect to a majority of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock and therefore has the ability to control the outcome of matters submitted to our stockholders for approval including the election of directors and any merger consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets this concentrated control could delay defer or prevent a change of control merger consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets that our other stockholders support or conversely this concentrated control could result in the consummation of such a transaction that our other stockholders do not support this concentrated control could also discourage a potential investor from acquiring our class a common stock which has limited voting power relative to the class b common stock or if issued our class c capital stock which will generally have no voting power and might harm the trading price of our class a common stock and if issued our class c capital stock in addition mr zuckerberg has the ability to control the management and major strategic investments of our company as a result of his position as our ceo and his ability to control the election or replacement of our directors in the event of his death the shares of our capital stock that mr zuckerberg owns will be transferred to the persons or entities that he has designated as a board member and officer mr zuckerberg owes a fiduciary duty to our stockholders and must act in good faith in a manner he reasonably believes to be in the best interests of our stockholders as a stockholder even a controlling stockholder mr zuckerberg 

is entitled to vote his shares and shares over which he has voting control as governed by a voting agreement in his own interests which may not always be in the interests of our stockholders generally 

moreover since our class c capital stock if issued will generally have no voting power the issuance of the class c capital stock including in connection with future financings acquisitions or the issuance of future equity awards could have the effect of prolonging the duration of mr zuckerbergs ability to exercise voting rights with respect to a majority of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock and therefore his ability to control the outcome of matters submitted to our stockholders for approval including the election of directors and any merger consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets we believe that mr zuckerbergs continued control of a majority of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock is beneficial to us and is in the best interests of our stockholders in the event that mr zuckerberg no longer controls a majority of the voting power whether as a result of the disposition of some or all his shares of class a or class b common stock or otherwise our business or the trading price of our class a common stock and if issued our class c capital stock may be adversely affected 

we plan to continue to make acquisitions which could harm our financial condition or results of operations and may adversely affect the price of our common stock 

as part of our business strategy we have made and intend to continue to make acquisitions to add specialized employees and complementary companies products or technologies we may not be able to find suitable acquisition candidates and we may not be able to complete acquisitions on favorable terms if at all in some cases the costs of such acquisitions may be substantial for example in 2014 we paid approximately 46 billion in cash and issued 178 million shares of our class a common stock in connection with our acquisition of whatsapp and we paid approximately 400 million in cash and issued 23 million shares of our class b common stock in connection with our acquisition of oculus we also issued a substantial number of rsus to help retain the employees of these companies there is no assurance that we will receive a favorable return on investment for these or other acquisitions 

we may pay substantial amounts of cash or incur debt to pay for acquisitions which could adversely affect our liquidity the incurrence of indebtedness would also result in increased fixed obligations increased interest expense and could also include covenants or other restrictions that would impede our ability to manage our operations we may also issue equity securities to pay for acquisitions and we regularly grant rsus to retain the employees of acquired companies which could increase our expenses adversely affect our financial results and result in dilution to our stockholders in addition any acquisitions we announce could be viewed negatively by users marketers developers or investors which may adversely affect our business or the price of our class a common stock 

in the future we may use shares of class c capital stock as consideration in connection with acquisitions however we may not be able to issue shares of class c capital stock because companies that we are interested in acquiring may not agree to accept shares that carry no voting rights or for other reasons if the class c capital stock trades at a discount to the class a common stock companies that we seek to acquire may also demand more shares of class c capital stock in exchange for accepting such stock as consideration in such instances we may need to pay cash issue shares of our class a or class b common stock as consideration or issue a relatively greater number of shares of class c capital stock to consummate the acquisitions 

we may also discover liabilities or deficiencies associated with the companies or assets we acquire that were not identified in advance which may result in significant unanticipated costs the effectiveness of our due diligence review and our ability to evaluate the results of such due diligence are dependent upon the accuracy and completeness of statements and disclosures made or actions taken by the companies we acquire or their representatives as well as the limited amount of time in which acquisitions are executed in addition we may fail to accurately forecast the financial impact of an acquisition transaction including tax and accounting charges acquisitions may also result in our recording of significant additional expenses to our results of operations and recording of substantial finitelived intangible assets on our balance sheet upon closing any of these factors may adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations 

we may not be able to successfully integrate our acquisitions and we may incur significant costs to integrate and support the companies we acquire 

the integration of acquisitions requires significant time and resources and we may not manage these processes successfully our ability to successfully integrate complex acquisitions is unproven particularly with respect to companies that have significant operations or that develop products where we do not have prior experience for example oculus and whatsapp are larger and more complex than companies we have historically acquired in particular oculus builds technology and products that are new to facebook and with which we did not have significant experience or structure in place to support prior to the acquisition we are making substantial investments of resources to support these acquisitions which will result in significant ongoing operating expenses and may divert resources and management attention from other areas of our business we cannot assure you that these investments will be successful if we fail to successfully integrate the companies we acquire we may not realize the benefits expected from the transaction and our business may be harmed 

if our goodwill or finitelived intangible assets become impaired we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings   

we review our finitelived intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable such as a decline in stock price and market capitalization we test goodwill for impairment at least annually if such goodwill or finitelived intangible assets are deemed to be impaired an impairment loss equal to the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the assets would be recognized we may be required to record a significant charge in our financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill or finitelived intangible assets is determined which would negatively affect our results of operations 

our business is dependent on our ability to maintain and scale our technical infrastructure and any significant disruption in our service could damage our reputation result in a potential loss of users and engagement and adversely affect our financial results 

our reputation and ability to attract retain and serve our users is dependent upon the reliable performance of our products and our underlying technical infrastructure our systems may not be adequately designed with the necessary reliability and redundancy to avoid performance delays or outages that could be harmful to our business if our products are unavailable when users attempt to access them or if they do not load as quickly as expected users may not use our products as often in the future or at all and our ability to serve ads may be disrupted as our user base and engagement continue to grow and the amount and types of information shared on facebook and our other products continue to grow and evolve such as increased engagement with video we will need an increasing amount of technical infrastructure including network capacity and computing power to continue to satisfy the needs of our users it is possible that we may fail to continue to effectively scale and grow our technical infrastructure to accommodate these increased demands in addition our business may be subject to interruptions delays or failures resulting from earthquakes adverse weather conditions other natural disasters power loss terrorism cyberattacks or other catastrophic events if such an event were to occur users may be subject to service disruptions or outages and we may not be able to recover our technical infrastructure and user data in a timely manner to restart or provide our services which may adversely affect our financial results 

a substantial portion of our network infrastructure is provided by third parties any disruption or failure in the services we receive from these providers including as a result of cyberattacks could harm our ability to handle existing or increased traffic and could significantly harm our business any financial or other difficulties these providers face may adversely affect our business and we exercise little control over these providers which increases our vulnerability to problems with the services they provide 

we could experience unforeseen difficulties in building and operating key portions of our technical infrastructure 

we have designed and built our own data centers and key portions of our technical infrastructure through which we serve our products and we plan to continue to significantly expand the size of our infrastructure primarily through data centers and other projects the infrastructure expansion we are undertaking is complex and unanticipated delays in the completion of these projects including due to any shortage of labor necessary in building portions of such projects or availability of components may lead to increased project costs operational inefficiencies or interruptions in the delivery or degradation of the quality of our products in addition there may be issues related to this infrastructure that are not identified during the testing phases of design and implementation which may only become evident after we have started to fully utilize the underlying equipment that could further degrade the user experience or increase our costs 

our products and internal systems rely on software that is highly technical and if it contains undetected errors or vulnerabilities our business could be adversely affected 

our products and internal systems rely on software including software developed or maintained internally andor by third parties that is highly technical and complex in addition our products and internal systems depend on the ability of such software to store retrieve process and manage immense amounts of data the software on which we rely has contained and will in the future contain undetected errors bugs or vulnerabilities some errors may only be discovered after the code has been released for external or internal use errors vulnerabilities or other design defects within the software on which we rely may result in a negative experience for users and marketers who use our products delay product introductions or enhancements result in targeting measurement or billing errors compromise our ability to protect the data of our users andor our intellectual property or lead to reductions in our ability to provide some or all of our services in addition any errors bugs vulnerabilities or defects discovered in the software on which we rely and any associated degradations or interruptions of service could result in damage to our reputation loss of users loss of revenue or liability for damages any of which could adversely affect our business and financial results 

technologies have been developed that can block the display of our ads which could adversely affect our financial results 

technologies have been developed and will likely continue to be developed that can block the display of our ads particularly advertising displayed on personal computers we generate substantially all of our revenue from advertising including revenue resulting from the display of ads on personal computers revenue generated from the display of ads on personal computers has been impacted 

by these technologies from time to time as a result these technologies have had an adverse effect on our financial results and if such technologies continue to proliferate in particular with respect to mobile platforms our future financial results may be harmed 

real or perceived inaccuracies in our user and other metrics may harm our reputation and negatively affect our business 

the numbers for our key metrics which include our daus maus and average revenue per user arpu are calculated using internal company data based on the activity of user accounts while these numbers are based on what we believe to be reasonable estimates of our user base for the applicable period of measurement there are inherent challenges in measuring usage of our products across large online and mobile populations around the world in addition we are continually seeking to improve our estimates of our user base and such estimates may change due to improvements or changes in our methodology for example the number of duplicate or false accounts maintained by users in violation of our terms of service may change as our methodologies evolve in 2016 we estimate that duplicate accounts an account that a user maintains in addition to his or her principal account may have represented approximately 6 of our worldwide maus we also seek to identify false accounts which we divide into two categories 1 usermisclassified accounts where users have created personal profiles for a business organization or nonhuman entity such as a pet such entities are permitted on facebook using a page rather than a personal profile under our terms of service and 2 undesirable accounts which represent user profiles that we determine are intended to be used for purposes that violate our terms of service such as spamming in 2016 for example we estimate that such usermisclassified and undesirable accounts may have represented approximately 1 of our worldwide maus we believe the percentage of accounts that are duplicate or false is meaningfully lower in developed markets such as the united states or united kingdom and higher in developing markets such as india and turkey however these estimates are based on an internal review of a limited sample of accounts and we apply significant judgment in making this determination such as identifying names that appear to be fake or other behavior that appears inauthentic to the reviewers as such our estimation of duplicate or false accounts may not accurately represent the actual number of such accounts 

our data limitations may affect our understanding of certain details of our business for example while userprovided data indicates a decline in usage among younger users this age data is unreliable because a disproportionate number of our younger users register with an inaccurate age accordingly our understanding of usage by age group may not be complete 

in addition our data regarding the geographic location of our users is estimated based on a number of factors such as the users ip address and selfdisclosed location these factors may not always accurately reflect the users actual location for example a user may appear to be accessing facebook from the location of the proxy server that the user connects to rather than from the users actual location the methodologies used to measure user metrics may also be susceptible to algorithm or other technical errors our estimates for revenue by user location and revenue by user device are also affected by these factors for example we discovered an error in the algorithm we used to attribute our revenue by user geography in late 2015 while this issue did not affect our overall worldwide revenue it did affect our attribution of revenue to different geographic regions the fourth quarter of 2015 revenue by user geography and arpu amounts were adjusted to reflect this reclassification we regularly review our processes for calculating these metrics and from time to time we may discover inaccuracies in our metrics or make adjustments to improve their accuracy including adjustments that may result in the recalculation of our historical metrics we believe that any such inaccuracies or adjustments are immaterial unless otherwise stated in addition our dau and mau estimates will differ from estimates published by third parties due to differences in methodology 

in addition from time to time we provide or rely on certain other metrics including those relating to the reach and effectiveness of our ads all of our metrics are subject to software bugs inconsistencies in our systems and human error if marketers developers or investors do not perceive our metrics to be accurate or if we discover material inaccuracies in our metrics we may be subject to liability our reputation may be harmed and marketers and developers may be less willing to allocate their budgets or resources to facebook which could negatively affect our business and financial results 

we cannot assure you that we will effectively manage our growth 

our employee headcount and the scope and complexity of our business have increased significantly with the number of employees increasing to 17048  as of december 31 2016 from 12691 as of december 31 2015 and we expect headcount growth to continue for the foreseeable future the growth and expansion of our business and products create significant challenges for our management operational and financial resources including managing multiple relations with users marketers developers and other third parties in the event of continued growth of our operations or in the number of our thirdparty relationships our information technology systems or our internal controls and procedures may not be adequate to support our operations in addition some members of our management do not have significant experience managing a large global business operation so our management may not be able to manage such growth effectively to effectively manage our growth we must continue to improve our operational financial and management processes and systems and to effectively expand train and manage our employee base as our organization continues to grow and we are required to implement more complex organizational management structures we may find it increasingly difficult to maintain the benefits of our corporate culture including our ability to quickly develop and launch new and innovative products this could negatively affect our business performance 

the loss of one or more of our key personnel or our failure to attract and retain other highly qualified personnel in the future could harm our business 

we currently depend on the continued services and performance of our key personnel including mark zuckerberg and sheryl k sandberg although we have entered into employment agreements with mr zuckerberg and ms sandberg the agreements have no specific duration and constitute atwill employment in addition many of our key technologies and systems are custommade for our business by our personnel the loss of key personnel including members of management as well as key engineering product development marketing and sales personnel could disrupt our operations and have an adverse effect on our business 

as we continue to grow we cannot guarantee we will continue to attract the personnel we need to maintain our competitive position in particular we intend to continue to hire a significant number of technical personnel in the foreseeable future and we expect to continue to face significant competition from other companies in hiring such personnel particularly in the san francisco bay area where our headquarters are located and where the cost of living is high as we continue to mature the incentives to attract retain and motivate employees provided by our equity awards or by future arrangements may not be as effective as in the past and if we issue significant equity to attract additional employees the ownership of our existing stockholders may be further diluted our ability to attract retain and motivate employees may also be adversely affected by stock price volatility additionally we have a number of current employees whose equity ownership in our company has provided them a substantial amount of personal wealth which could affect their decisions about whether or not to continue to work for us as a result of these factors it may be difficult for us to continue to retain and motivate our employees if we do not succeed in attracting hiring and integrating excellent personnel or retaining and motivating existing personnel we may be unable to grow effectively 

we may not be able to continue to successfully grow usage of and engagement with mobile and web applications that integrate with facebook and our other products 

we have made and are continuing to make investments to enable developers to build grow and monetize mobile and web applications that integrate with facebook and our other products such existing and prospective developers may not be successful in building growing or monetizing mobile andor web applications that create and maintain user engagement additionally developers may choose to build on other platforms including mobile platforms controlled by third parties rather than building products that integrate with facebook and our other products we are continuously seeking to balance the distribution objectives of our developers with our desire to provide an optimal user experience and we may not be successful in achieving a balance that continues to attract and retain such developers for example from time to time we have taken actions to reduce the volume of communications from these developers to users on facebook and our other products with the objective of enhancing the user experience and such actions have reduced distribution from user engagement with and our monetization opportunities from mobile and web applications integrated with our products in some instances these actions as well as other actions to enforce our policies applicable to developers have adversely affected our relationships with such developers if we are not successful in our efforts to continue to grow the number of developers that choose to build products that integrate with facebook and our other products or if we are unable to continue to build and maintain good relations with such developers our user growth and user engagement and our financial results may be adversely affected 

we currently generate substantially all of our payments revenue from developers that use facebook on personal computers and we expect that our payments revenue will continue to decline in the future as usage of facebook on personal computers continues to decline 

we currently generate substantially all of our payments revenue from developers that use facebook on personal computers specifically applications built by developers of social games are currently responsible for substantially all of our revenue derived from payments and the majority of the revenue from these applications has historically been generated by a limited number of the most popular games we have experienced and expect to see the continued decline in usage of facebook on personal computers for the foreseeable future which we expect will result in a continuing decline in payments revenue in addition a relatively small percentage of our users have transacted with facebook payments if the facebookintegrated applications fail to grow or maintain their users and engagement whether as a result of the continued decline in the usage of facebook on personal computers or otherwise if developers do not continue to introduce new applications that attract users and create engagement on facebook or if facebookintegrated applications outside of social games do not gain popularity and generate significant revenue for us our financial performance could be adversely affected 

payment transactions may subject us to additional regulatory requirements and other risks that could be costly and difficult to comply with or that could harm our business 

our users can purchase virtual and digital goods from developers that offer applications using our payments infrastructure on the facebook website in addition certain of our users can use our payments infrastructure including on messenger for other activities such as sending money to other users and making donations to certain charitable organizations we are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the united states europe and elsewhere including those governing antimoney laundering and counterterrorist financing money transmission gift cards and other prepaid access instruments electronic funds transfer charitable fundraising and import and export restrictions depending on how our payments product evolves we may also be subject to other laws and regulations including those governing gambling banking and lending in some jurisdictions the application or interpretation of these laws and regulations is not clear to increase flexibility in how our use of payments may evolve and to mitigate regulatory uncertainty we have received certain money transmitter licenses in the united states and an electronic money emoney license that allows us to conduct certain regulated payment activities in the participating member countries of the european economic area which will generally require us to demonstrate compliance with many domestic and foreign laws in these areas our efforts to comply with these laws and regulations could be costly and result in diversion of management time and effort and may still not guarantee compliance in the event that we are found to be in violation of any such legal or regulatory requirements we may be subject to monetary fines or other penalties such as a cease and desist order or we may be required to make product changes any of which could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results 

in addition we may be subject to a variety of additional risks as a result of payments transactions including 

 we have significant international operations and plan to continue expanding our operations abroad where we have limited operating experience and this may subject us to increased business and economic risks that could affect our financial results 

we have significant international operations and plan to continue the international expansion of our business operations and the translation of our products we currently make facebook available in more than 100 different languages and we have offices or data centers in more than 30 different countries we may enter new international markets where we have limited or no experience in marketing selling and deploying our products our products are generally available globally through the web and on mobile but some or all of our products or functionality may not be available in certain markets due to legal and regulatory complexities for example facebook is not generally available in china we also outsource certain operational functions to thirdparty vendors globally if we fail to deploy manage or oversee our international operations successfully our business may suffer in addition we are subject to a variety of risks inherent in doing business internationally including 



 if we are unable to expand internationally and manage the complexity of our global operations successfully our financial results could be adversely affected 

we face design manufacturing and supply chain risks that if not properly managed could adversely impact our financial results 

we face a number of risks related to design manufacturing and supply chain management with respect to our oculus products for example the oculus products we sell may have quality issues resulting from the design or manufacture of the products or from the software used in the products sometimes these issues may be caused by components we purchase from other manufacturers or suppliers if the quality of our oculus products does not meet our customers expectations or such products are found to be defective then our financial results could be adversely affected 

we rely on third parties to manufacture our oculus products we may experience supply shortages or other supply chain disruptions in the future that could result in shipping delays and negatively impact our operations we could be negatively affected if we are not able to engage third parties with the necessary capabilities or capacity on reasonable terms or if those we engage with fail to meet their obligations whether due to financial difficulties or other reasons or make adverse changes in the pricing or other material terms of such arrangements with them 

we also require the suppliers and business partners of our oculus products to comply with laws and certain company policies regarding sourcing practices but we do not control them or their practices if any of them violates laws or implements practices regarded as unethical or corrupt we could experience supply chain disruptions canceled orders or damage to our reputation 

in addition the securities and exchange commission’s conflict minerals rule requires disclosure by public companies of information relating to the origin source and chain of custody of specified minerals known as conflict minerals that are necessary to the functionality or production of products manufactured or contracted to be manufactured we may incur significant costs associated with complying with the rule such as costs related to the determination of the origin source and chain of custody of the minerals used in oculus products the adoption of conflict mineralsrelated governance policies processes and controls and possible changes to products or sources of supply as a result of such activities 

we may face inventory risk with respect to our oculus products 

we may be exposed to inventory risks with respect to our oculus products as a result of rapid changes in product cycles and pricing unsafe or defective merchandise changes in consumer demand and consumer spending patterns changes in consumer tastes with respect to oculus products and other factors we endeavor to accurately predict these trends and avoid overstocking or understocking products oculus may sell demand for products however can change significantly between the time inventory or components are ordered and the date of sale in addition when we begin selling or manufacturing a new oculus product it may be difficult to establish vendor relationships determine appropriate product or component selection and accurately forecast demand the acquisition of certain types of inventory or components may require significant leadtime and prepayment and they may not be returnable any one of these factors may adversely affect our operating results 

we may have exposure to greater than anticipated tax liabilities 

our income tax obligations are based in part on our corporate operating structure and intercompany arrangements including the manner in which we operate our business develop value manage protect and use our intellectual property and the valuations of our intercompany transactions the tax laws applicable to our business including the laws of the united states and other jurisdictions are subject to interpretation and certain jurisdictions are aggressively interpreting their laws in new ways in an effort to raise additional tax revenue from companies such as facebook the taxing authorities of the jurisdictions in which we operate may challenge our methodologies for valuing developed technology or intercompany arrangements which could increase our worldwide effective tax rate and harm our financial position and results of operations for example the irs recently issued us a formal assessment relating to transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries in conjunction with the examination of the 2010 tax year and although we disagree with the irss position and are contesting this issue the ultimate resolution is uncertain and if resolved in a manner unfavorable to us may adversely affect our financial results we are subject to regular review and audit by us federal and state and foreign tax authorities tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken and any adverse outcome of such a review or audit could have a negative effect on our financial position and results of operations in addition the determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires significant judgment by management and there are many transactions where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain our provision for income taxes is also determined by the manner in which we operate our business and any changes to such operations or laws applicable to such operations may affect our effective tax rate although we believe that our provision for income taxes is reasonable the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements and may materially affect our financial results in the period or periods for which such determination is made   in addition our future income taxes could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions that have lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions that have higher statutory tax rates by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities or by changes in tax laws regulations or accounting principles for example we have previously incurred losses in certain international subsidiaries that resulted in an effective tax rate that is significantly higher than the statutory tax rate in the united states and this could continue to happen in the future 

changes in tax laws or tax rulings could materially affect our financial position and results of operations 

the tax regimes we are subject to or operate under are unsettled and may be subject to significant change changes in tax laws or tax rulings or changes in interpretations of existing laws could materially affect our financial position and results of operations many countries in europe as well as a number of other countries and organizations have recently proposed or recommended changes to existing tax laws or have enacted new laws that could significantly increase our tax obligations in many countries where we do business or require us to change the manner in which we operate our business the organization for economic cooperation and development has been working on a base erosion and profit sharing project and has issued in 2015 and is expected to continue to issue guidelines and proposals that may change various aspects of the existing framework under which our tax obligations are determined in many of the countries in which we do business the european commission has conducted investigations in multiple countries focusing on whether local country tax rulings or tax legislation provides preferential tax treatment that violates european union state aid rules and concluded that certain countries including ireland have provided illegal state aid in certain cases these investigations may result in changes to the tax treatment of our foreign operations in addition the current us administration and key members of congress have made public statements indicating that tax reform is a priority certain changes to us tax laws including limitations on the ability to defer us taxation on earnings outside of the united states until those earnings are repatriated to the united states could affect the tax treatment of our foreign earnings due to the large and expanding scale of our international business activities many of these types of changes to the taxation of our activities could increase our worldwide effective tax rate and harm our financial position and results of operations 

we cannot guarantee that our recently announced share repurchase program will be fully consummated or that it will enhance longterm stockholder value share repurchases could also increase the volatility of the trading price of our stock and could diminish our cash reserves 

in november 2016 our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to 6 billion of our class a common stock commencing in 2017 the repurchase program does not have an expiration date although our board of directors has authorized this share repurchase program the program does not obligate us to repurchase any specific dollar amount or to acquire any specific number of shares the program could affect the trading price of our stock and increase volatility and any announcement of a termination of this program may result in a decrease in the trading price of our stock in addition this program could diminish our cash reserves 

risks related to ownership of our class a common stock 

the trading price of our class a common stock has been and will likely continue to be volatile and if the creation and dividend of class c capital stock is effected the trading price of that class will likely be volatile and may impact the trading price for the class a common stock 

the trading price of our class a common stock has been and is likely to continue to be volatile since shares of our class a common stock were sold in our ipo in may 2012 at a price of 3800 per share our stock price has ranged from 1755  to 13350  through december 31 2016 in addition to the factors discussed in this annual report on form 10k the trading price of our class a common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to numerous factors many of which are beyond our control including 

 in addition we recently announced a proposal to create a new class of nonvoting capital stock known as class c capital stock and to distribute two shares of class c capital stock as a dividend to the holders of our class a and class b common stock while this proposal has been approved by our stockholders the record and payment dates for this dividend will be determined by our board of directors in its discretion and there can be no assurance as to the timing of such dates once the dividend is distributed we expect that the market price for the shares of our class a common stock will generally reflect the effect of a threeforone stock split the pending reclassification is currently subject to class action lawsuits that were filed on behalf of our stockholders 

if issued we plan to list the class c capital stock on the nasdaq stock market llc the trading price for the class c capital stock may be volatile and affected by the factors noted with respect to our class a common stock above the trading price of the class c capital stock may also be affected by the difference in voting rights compared to our class a and class b common shares the liquidity of the market for class c capital stock and investor demand for class c capital stock including that of institutional investors that may be unwilling unable or choose not to hold nonvoting shares of our capital stock 

in addition the stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many technology companies stock prices of many technology companies have fluctuated in 

a manner unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies we are currently subject to securities litigation in connection with our ipo we may experience more such litigation following future periods of volatility any securities litigation could subject us to substantial costs divert resources and the attention of management from our business and adversely affect our business 

we do not intend to pay cash dividends for the foreseeable future 

we have never declared or paid cash dividends on our capital stock we currently intend to retain any future earnings to finance the operation and expansion of our business and we do not expect to declare or pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future as a result you may only receive a return on your investment in our class a common stock and if issued our class c capital stock if the trading price of your shares increases 

the dual class structure of our common stock and a voting agreement between certain stockholders have the effect of concentrating voting control with our ceo and certain other holders of our class b common stock this will limit or preclude your ability to influence corporate matters 

our class b common stock has ten votes per share and our class a common stock has one vote per share and we intend to create class c capital stock that generally has no voting rights stockholders who hold shares of class b common stock including certain of our executive officers employees and directors and their affiliates together hold a substantial majority of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock because of the tentoone voting ratio between our class b and class a common stock the holders of our class b common stock collectively control a majority of the combined voting power of our common stock and therefore are able to control all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval so long as the shares of class b common stock represent at least 91 of all outstanding shares of our class a and class b common stock this concentrated control will limit or preclude your ability to influence corporate matters for the foreseeable future 

transfers by holders of class b common stock will generally result in those shares converting to class a common stock subject to limited exceptions such as certain transfers effected for estate planning or charitable purposes the conversion of class b common stock to class a common stock will have the effect over time of increasing the relative voting power of those holders of class b common stock who retain their shares in the long term if for example mr zuckerberg retains a significant portion of his holdings of class b common stock for an extended period of time he could in the future continue to control a majority of the combined voting power of our outstanding capital stock 

our status as a controlled company could make our class a common stock less attractive to some investors or otherwise harm our stock price 

because we qualify as a controlled company under the corporate governance rules for nasdaqlisted companies we are not required to have a majority of our board of directors be independent nor are we required to have a compensation committee or an independent nominating function in connection with the pending reclassification we intend to amend our corporate governance guidelines to provide that we will not avail ourselves of the controlled company exemption with respect to the independence of the members of our compensation  governance committee however we do not have a separate and independent nominating function and will continue to have the full board of directors be directly responsible for nominating members of our board in addition in the future we could elect not to have a majority of our board of directors be independent or not to have a compensation committee accordingly should the interests of our controlling stockholder differ from those of other stockholders the other stockholders may not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the corporate governance rules for nasdaqlisted companies our status as a controlled company could make our class a common stock and if issued our class c capital stock less attractive to some investors or otherwise harm our stock price 

delaware law and provisions in our restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws could make a merger tender offer or proxy contest difficult thereby depressing the trading price of our class a common stock 

our status as a delaware corporation and the antitakeover provisions of the delaware general corporation law may discourage delay or prevent a change in control by prohibiting us from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years after the person becomes an interested stockholder even if a change of control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders in addition our current restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that may make the acquisition of our company more difficult including the following 



outcome of matters requiring stockholder approval even if he owns significantly less than a majority of the shares of our outstanding class a and class b common stock 

 we intend to amend and restate our restated certificate of incorporation to create as further described above a new class of nonvoting capital stock which may prolong mr zuckerberg’s ability to control the outcome of matters submitted to our stockholders for approval including the election of directors and any merger consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets

legal proceedings 

tableend beginning on may 22 2012 multiple putative class actions derivative actions and individual actions were filed in state and federal courts in the united states and in other jurisdictions against us our directors andor certain of our officers alleging violation of securities laws or breach of fiduciary duties in connection with our initial public offering ipo and seeking unspecified damages we believe these lawsuits are without merit and we intend to continue to vigorously defend them the vast majority of the cases in the united states along with multiple cases filed against the nasdaq omx group inc and the nasdaq stock market llc collectively referred to herein as nasdaq alleging technical and other tradingrelated errors by nasdaq in connection with our ipo were ordered centralized for coordinated or consolidated pretrial proceedings in the us district court for the southern district of new york in a series of rulings in 2013 and 2014 the court denied our motion to dismiss the consolidated securities class action and granted our motions to dismiss the derivative actions against our directors and certain of our officers on july 24 2015 the court of appeals affirmed the dismissal of the derivative actions on december 11 2015 the court granted plaintiffs motion for class certification in the consolidated securities action in addition the events surrounding our ipo became the subject of various state and federal government inquiries in may 2014 the securities and exchange commission sec notified us that it had terminated its inquiry and that no enforcement action had been recommended by the sec 

on april 27 2016 we announced a proposal to create a new class of nonvoting capital stock class c capital stock and our intention to declare and pay a dividend of two shares of class c capital stock for each outstanding share of class a and class b common stock the reclassification following our announcement of the reclassification beginning on april 29 2016 multiple purported class action lawsuits were filed on behalf of our stockholders in the delaware court of chancery against us certain of our board of directors and mark zuckerberg the lawsuits have been consolidated under the caption in re facebook inc class c reclassification litig  ca no 12286vcl and the consolidated complaint generally alleges that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties in connection with the reclassification among other remedies these lawsuits seek to enjoin the reclassification as well as unspecified money damages costs and attorneys’ fees we believe that the lawsuits are without merit and intend to vigorously defend against all claims asserted 

in addition we are also currently parties to multiple other lawsuits related to our products including intellectual property lawsuits as well as class action lawsuits brought by users and marketers among these matters the zenimax media inc v oculus vr inc trial was held in january 2017 in the us district court for the northern district of texas in the zenimax  case the plaintiff asserted a number of claims against us and certain individuals including trade secret misappropriation copyright infringement breach of contract tortious interference with contract unfair competition unjust enrichment trademark infringement and false designation the plaintiff was seeking actual damages of up to 20 billion punitive damages of up to 40 billion and equitable relief including an injunction on february 1 2017 the jury reached a verdict in favor of the plaintiff on claims related to copyright infringement breach of contract trademark infringement and false designation and found for the defendants on all other claims the amount of damages awarded by the jury was 500 million in the aggregate we believe we have multiple grounds to appeal this result and intend to vigorously pursue such appeals 

we are also involved in other claims government and regulatory investigations and proceedings arising from the ordinary course of our business and we may in the future be subject to additional lawsuits and disputes

certain revenue information in the section entitled  — revenue — foreign exchange impact on revenue is presented on a constant currency basis this information is a nongaap financial measure to calculate revenue on a constant currency basis we translated revenue for the full year 2016  using 2015 monthly exchange rates for our settlement currencies other than the us dollar this nongaap financial measure is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for or superior to financial information prepared and presented in accordance with gaap this measure may be different from nongaap financial measures used by other companies limiting its usefulness for comparison purposes moreover presentation of revenue on a constant currency basis is provided for yearoveryear comparison purposes and investors should be cautioned that the effect of changing foreign currency exchange rates has an actual effect on our operating results we believe this nongaap financial measure provides investors with useful supplemental information about the financial performance of our business enable comparison of financial results between periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance and allows for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in operating our business 

executive overview of full year 2016  results 

our key user metrics and financial results for 2016  are as follows 

user growth 

 financial results 

 in the fourth quarter of 2016 we elected to early adopt accounting standards update no 201609 compensationstock compensation topic 718 improvement to employee sharebased payment accounting asu 201609 which required us to reflect any adoption adjustments as of january 1 2016 the beginning of the annual period that includes the interim period of adoption as such certain full year 2016 financial results data above included the impacts of the asu 201609 adoption see note 1 of the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements for additional information related to this adoption 

in 2016  we continued to make progress on our three main revenue growth priorities i continuing to capitalize on the shift to mobile ii growing the number of marketers using our ad products and iii making our ads more relevant and effective through continued adoption of newer ad formats and tools for marketers 

we continued to invest based on our roadmap in i our most developed ecosystem the facebook app and platform as well as video ii driving growth and building ecosystems around our products and features that already have significant user bases such as messenger instagram and whatsapp and iii longterm technology initiatives that we believe will further our mission to connect the world such as virtual reality and artificial intelligence we intend to continue to invest based on this roadmap and we expect these investments and our increasingly global scale will drive significant overall yearoveryear expense growth compared to 2016 in addition we anticipate our expenses in 2017 will continue to grow as we execute on priorities such as i hiring top engineering talent ii investing in research and development content and sales and marketing efforts and iii expanding our data center capacity and office facilities to support our rapid growth 

trends in our user metrics 

the numbers for our key metrics our daus maus and average revenue per user arpu do not include instagram whatsapp or oculus users unless they would otherwise qualify as such users respectively based on their other activities on facebook in addition other user engagement metrics do not include instagram whatsapp or oculus unless otherwise specifically stated 

trends in the number of users affect our revenue and financial results by influencing the number of ads we are able to show the value of our ads to marketers the volume of payments transactions as well as our expenses and capital expenditures substantially all of our daily and monthly active users as defined below access facebook on mobile devices 

 

note for purposes of reporting daus maus and arpu by geographic region europe includes all users in russia and turkey and rest of world includes all users in africa latin america and the middle east 

worldwide daus increased 18  to 123 billion on average during december 2016  from 104 billion  during december 2015  we experienced growth in daus across major markets including india indonesia and brazil 

 

as of december 31 2016  we had 186 billion  maus an increase of 17  from december 31 2015  users in india indonesia and brazil represented key sources of growth in 2016  relative to the same period in 2015 

trends in our monetization by user geography 

we calculate our revenue by user geography based on our estimate of the geography in which ad impressions are delivered virtual and digital goods are purchased or virtual reality platform devices are shipped we define arpu as our total revenue in a given geography during a given quarter divided by the average of the number of maus in the geography at the beginning and end of the quarter while arpu includes all sources of revenue the number of maus used in this calculation only includes users of facebook and messenger as described in the definition of mau above the geography of our users affects our revenue and financial results because we currently monetize users in different geographies at different average rates our revenue and arpu in regions such as united states  canada and europe are relatively higher primarily due to the size and maturity of those online and mobile advertising markets for example arpu in 2016  in the united states  canada region was more than eight times higher than in the asiapacific region 

note our revenue by user geography in the charts above is geographically apportioned based on our estimation of the geographic location of our users when they perform a revenuegenerating activity this allocation differs from our revenue by geography disclosure in our consolidated financial statements where revenue is geographically apportioned based on the location of the marketer or developer we discovered an error in the algorithm we used to attribute our revenue by user geography in late 2015 while this issue did not affect our overall worldwide revenue it did affect our attribution of revenue to different geographic regions the fourth quarter of 2015 revenue by user geography and arpu amounts for all regions were adjusted to reflect this reclassification 

for 2016  worldwide arpu was 1598  an increase of 34  from 2015  over this period arpu increased by 49 in united states  canada 35 in europe 34 in asiapacific and 25 in rest of world in addition user growth was more rapid in geographies with relatively lower arpu such as asiapacific and rest of world we expect that user growth in the future will be primarily concentrated in those regions where arpu is relatively lower such that worldwide arpu may continue to increase at a slower rate relative to arpu in any geographic region or potentially decrease even if arpu increases in each geographic region 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue costs and expenses and related disclosures we evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis our estimates are based on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances our actual results could differ from these estimates 

an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made if different estimates reasonably could have been used or if changes in the estimate that are reasonably possible could materially impact the financial statements we believe that the assumptions and estimates associated with revenue recognition for payments and other fees income taxes sharebased compensation loss contingencies and business combinations and valuation of goodwill and other acquired intangible assets have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements therefore we consider these to be our critical accounting policies and estimates for further information on all of our significant accounting policies see note 1 of our accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data of this annual report on form 10k 

income taxes 

we are subject to income taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes and income tax assets and liabilities including evaluating uncertainties in the application of accounting principles and complex tax laws 

we record a provision for income taxes for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations using the asset and liability method under this method we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities as well as for loss and tax credit carryforwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the tax rates that are expected to apply to taxable income for the years in which those tax assets and liabilities are expected to be realized or settled we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the net amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized 

we recognize tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if we believe that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position these uncertain tax positions include our estimates for transfer pricing that have been developed based upon analyses of appropriate armslength prices similarly our estimates related to uncertain tax positions concerning research tax credits are based on an assessment of whether our available documentation corroborating the nature of our activities supporting the tax credits will be sufficient although we believe that we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions including net interest and penalties we can provide no assurance that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be materially different we make adjustments to these reserves in accordance with the income tax accounting guidance when facts and circumstances change such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded such differences will affect the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made and could have a material impact on our financial condition and operating results 

sharebased compensation 

we account for sharebased employee compensation plans under the fair value recognition and measurement provisions in accordance with applicable accounting standards which require all sharebased payments to employees including grants of stock options and restricted stock units rsus to be measured based on the grant date fair value of the awards with the resulting expense generally recognized on a straightline basis over the period during which the employee is required to perform service in exchange for the award   

we elected to early adopt asu 201609 in the fourth quarter of 2016 which among other items provides an accounting policy election to account for forfeitures as they occur rather than to account for them based on an estimate of expected forfeitures we elected to account for forfeitures as they occur and therefore sharebased compensation expense for the year ended december 31 2016 has been calculated based on actual forfeitures in our consolidated statements of income rather than our previous approach which was net of estimated forfeitures the net cumulative effect of this change was recognized as a 39 million  increase to paidin capital as of january 1 2016 sharebased compensation expense for the years ended december 31 2015 and 2014 were recorded net of estimated forfeitures which were based on historical forfeitures and adjusted to reflect changes in facts and circumstances if any 

we have historically issued unvested restricted shares to employee stockholders of certain acquired companies as these awards are generally subject to continued postacquisition employment we have accounted for them as postacquisition sharebased compensation expense we recognize compensation expense equal to the grant date fair value of the common stock on a straightline basis over the period during which the employee is required to perform service in exchange for the award 

loss contingencies 

we are involved in various lawsuits claims investigations and proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business certain of these matters include speculative claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts of damages we record a liability when we believe that it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated significant judgment is required to determine both probability and the estimated amount we review these provisions at least quarterly and adjust these provisions accordingly to reflect the impact of negotiations settlements rulings advice of legal counsel and updated information 

we believe that the amount or estimable range of reasonably possible loss will not either individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on our business consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows with respect to loss contingencies for legal and other contingencies as of december 31 2016  however the outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain therefore if one or more of these legal matters were resolved against us for amounts in excess of managements expectations our results of operations and financial condition including in a particular reporting period could be materially adversely affected 

business combinations and valuation of goodwill and other acquired intangible assets 

we allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired liabilities assumed and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values the excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill such valuations require management to make significant estimates and assumptions especially with respect to intangible assets significant estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from acquired users acquired technology and trade names from a market participant perspective useful lives and discount rates management’s estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and as a result actual results may differ from estimates during the measurement period which is one year from the acquisition date we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill upon the conclusion of the measurement period any subsequent adjustments are recorded to earnings 

we review goodwill for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances would more likely than not reduce the fair value of our single reporting unit below its carrying value as of december 31 2016  no impairment of goodwill has been identified 

acquired finitelived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives we evaluate the recoverability of our intangible assets for possible impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable the evaluation is performed at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities recoverability of these assets is measured by a comparison of the carrying amounts to the future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate if such review indicates that the carrying amount of property and equipment and intangible assets is not recoverable the carrying amount of such assets is reduced to fair value we have not recorded any significant impairment charges during the years presented 

in addition to the recoverability assessment we routinely review the remaining estimated useful lives of our finitelived intangible assets if we reduce the estimated useful life assumption for any asset the remaining unamortized balance would be amortized over the revised estimated useful life 

components of results of operations 

revenue 

advertising  we generate substantially all of our revenue from advertising our advertising revenue is generated by displaying ad products on facebook instagram and thirdparty affiliated websites or mobile applications marketers pay for ad products either directly or through their relationships with advertising agencies based on the number of clicks made by people the number of actions taken by people or the number of impressions delivered we recognize revenue from the delivery of clickbased ads in the period in which a person clicks on the content and actionbased ads in the period in which a person takes the action the marketer contracted for we recognize revenue from the display of impressionbased ads in the contracted period in which the impressions are delivered impressions are considered delivered when an ad is displayed to people the number of ads we show is subject to methodological changes as we continue to evolve our ads business and the structure of our ads products we calculate price per ad as total ad revenue divided by the number of ads delivered representing the effective price paid per impression by a marketer regardless of their desired objective such as impression click or action for advertising revenue arrangements where we are not the primary obligor we recognize revenue on a net basis 

payments and other fees  we enable payments from people to purchase virtual and digital goods from our developers people can transact and make payments on the facebook website by using debit and credit cards paypal mobile phone payments gift cards or other methods we receive a fee from developers when people make purchases in these applications using our payments infrastructure we recognize revenue net of amounts remitted to our developers we have mandated the use of our payments infrastructure for game applications on facebook and fees related to payments are generated almost exclusively from games our other fees revenue which has not been significant in recent periods consists primarily of revenue from the delivery of virtual reality platform devices and related platform sales and our ad serving and measurement products 

cost of revenue and operating expenses 

cost of revenue  our cost of revenue consists primarily of expenses associated with the delivery and distribution of our products these include expenses related to the operation of our data centers such as facility and server equipment depreciation salaries benefits and sharebased compensation for employees on our operations teams and energy and bandwidth costs cost of revenue also includes credit card and other transaction fees related to processing customer transactions amortization of intangible assets costs associated with data partner arrangements and cost of virtual reality platform device inventory sold 

research and development  research and development expenses consist primarily of sharebased compensation salaries and benefits for employees on our engineering and technical teams who are responsible for building new products as well as improving existing products we expense all of our research and development costs as they are incurred 

marketing and sales  our marketing and sales expenses consist of salaries sharebased compensation and benefits for our employees engaged in sales sales support marketing business development and customer service functions our marketing and sales expenses also include marketing and promotional expenditures as well as amortization of intangible assets

revenue 



  

2016  compared to 2015  revenue in 2016  increased 971 billion  or 54  compared to 2015  the increase was mostly due to an increase in advertising revenue 

the most important factor driving advertising revenue growth was an increase in revenue from ads in news feed for 2016  we estimate that mobile advertising revenue represented approximately 83  of total advertising revenue as compared with approximately 77  in 2015  factors that influenced our advertising revenue growth in 2016  included i an increase in demand for our ad inventory in part driven by an increase in the number of marketers actively advertising on facebook ii an increase in user growth and engagement and iii an increase in the number and frequency of ads displayed in news feed as well as the quality relevance and performance of those ads however we anticipate increases in the number and frequency of ads displayed in news feed will be a less significant driver of our revenue growth in the future 

in 2016  compared to 2015  the average price per ad increased by 5 and the number of ads delivered increased by 50 the increase in average price per ad was driven by a continued mix shift towards a greater percentage of our ads being shown in news feed while the increase in the ads delivered was driven by the same factors that influenced our advertising growth 

advertising spending is traditionally seasonally strong in the fourth quarter of each year we believe that this seasonality in advertising spending affects our quarterly results which generally reflect significant growth in advertising revenue between the third and fourth quarters and a decline in advertising spending between the fourth and subsequent first quarters for instance our advertising revenue increased 27 31 and 22 between the third and fourth quarters of 2016  2015  and 2014  respectively while advertising revenue for both the first quarters of 2016  and 2015  declined 8 compared to the fourth quarters of 2015  and 2014  

payments and other fees revenue in 2016  decreased 96 million  or 11  compared to 2015  the majority of the decrease in payments and other fees revenue was due to decreased payments revenue from games played on personal computers we anticipate payments and other fees revenue will continue to decline in 2017 

2015  compared to 2014  revenue in 2015 increased 546 billion or 44 compared to 2014 the increase was primarily due to an increase in advertising revenue 

the most important factor driving advertising revenue growth was an increase in revenue from ads in news feed on mobile devices in 2015 we estimate that mobile advertising revenue represented approximately 77 of total advertising revenue as compared with approximately 65 in 2014 factors that influenced our mobile advertising revenue growth in 2015 included i an increase in demand for our ad inventory in part driven by an increase in the number of marketers actively advertising on facebook ii an increase in mobile user growth and engagement and iii an increase in the number and frequency of ads displayed in news feed as well as the quality relevance and performance of those ads 

in 2015 compared to 2014 the average price per ad increased by 140 and the number of ads delivered decreased by 38 the increase in average price per ad was driven by a product change related to certain nonnews feed ads during the third quarter of 2014 which decreased the number of ads displayed but increased the prominence of each ad average price per ad was also driven by a mix shift towards a greater percentage of our ads being shown in news feed the reduction in ads delivered was driven by factors including the product change described above as well as the shift in usage towards mobile devices where people are shown fewer ads as compared to personal computers 

payments and other fees revenue in 2015 decreased 125 million or 13 compared to 2014 the decrease in payments and other fees revenue was a result of decreased payments revenue from games played on personal computers partially offset by an increase in other fees revenue related to acquisitions closed in the second half of 2014 

no customer represented 10 or more of total revenue during the years ended december 31 2016  2015  and 2014  

foreign exchange impact on revenue 

the general strengthening of the us dollar relative to certain foreign currencies from the full year 2015 compared to the same period in 2016 had an unfavorable impact on our revenue if we had translated revenue for the full year 2016 using the prior years monthly exchange rates for our settlement currencies other than the us dollar our total revenue and advertising revenue would have been 2791 billion  and 2715 billion  respectively using these constant rates revenue and advertising revenue would have been 270 million  and 269 million  higher than actual revenue and advertising revenue respectively for the full year 2016 

the general strengthening of the us dollar relative to certain foreign currencies primarily the euro from the full year 2014 to the same period in 2015 had an unfavorable impact on our revenue if we had translated revenue for the full year 2015 using 2014 monthly exchange rates for our settlement currencies other than the us dollar our total revenue and advertising revenue would have been 1911 billion and 1826 billion respectively using these constant rates both revenue and advertising revenue would have been 119 billion higher than actual revenue and advertising revenue for the full year 2015 

cost of revenue 

  

  

2016  compared to 2015  cost of revenue in 2016  increased 922 million  or 32  compared to 2015  the majority of the increase was due to an increase in operational expenses related to our data centers and technical infrastructure and to a lesser extent higher costs associated with ads payment processing and various partnership agreements 

2015  compared to 2014  cost of revenue in 2015 increased 714 million or 33 compared to 2014 the increase was primarily due to an increase in operational expenses related to our data centers and technical infrastructure compared to 2014 amortization of our intangible assets in 2015 also increased 100 million compared to 2014 mostly due to the full year impact of acquisitions completed in the second half of 2014 

in 2017  we anticipate that the cost of revenue will increase as we continue to expand our data center capacity and technical infrastructure to support user growth increased user engagement and the delivery of new products and services and to a lesser extent due to higher costs associated with ads payment processing and various partnership agreements 

research and development 



  

2016  compared to 2015  research and development expenses in 2016  increased 110 billion  or 23  compared to 2015  the majority of the increase was due to an increase in payroll and benefits as a result of a 34  growth in employee headcount from december 31 2015  to december 31 2016  in engineering and other technical functions additionally our equipment and related expenses in 2016 to support our research and development efforts increased 170 million compared to 2015 

2015  compared to 2014   research and development expenses in 2015 increased 215 billion or 81 compared to 2014 the majority of the increase was due to an increase in sharebased compensation expense of 102 billion compared to 2014 which reflected the full year impact of sharebased compensation related to the acquisitions completed in the second half of 2014 in addition other payroll and benefits expense increased as a result of a 43 growth in employee headcount from december 31 2014 to december 31 2015 in engineering and other technical functions 

in 2017  we plan to continue to accelerate the hiring of software engineers and other technical employees and increasing our investment to support our research and development initiatives 

marketing and sales 



  

2016  compared to 2015   marketing and sales expenses in 2016  increased 105 billion  or 38  compared to 2015  the majority of the increase was due to payroll and benefits expenses as a result of a 28  increase in employee headcount from december 31 2015  to december 31 2016  in our marketing and sales functions and increases in our consulting and other professional service fees additionally our marketing expenses increased 344 million in 2016 compared to 2015 

2015  compared to 2014  marketing and sales expenses in 2015 increased 105 billion or 62 compared to 2014 the majority of the increase was due to increases in amortization of our intangible assets of 305 million due to the full year impact of acquisitions completed in the second half of 2014 and in payroll and benefits expenses as a result of a 32 increase in employee headcount from december 31 2014 to december 31 2015 in our marketing and sales functions additionally our marketing expenses increased 258 million in 2015 compared to 2014 

in 2017  we plan to continue to increase our investment and the hiring of marketing and sales employees to support our marketing sales and partnership efforts 

general and administrative 



  

2016  compared to 2015  general and administrative expenses in 2016  increased 436 million  or 34  compared to 2015  the majority of the increase was due to an increase in payroll and benefits expenses as a result of a 43  increase in employee headcount from december 31 2015  to december 31 2016  in general and administrative functions and to a lesser extent higher professional services and legal fees 

2015  compared to 2014  general and administrative expenses in 2015 increased 322 million or 33 compared to 2014 the increase was primarily due to an increase in payroll and benefits expenses as a result of a 36 increase in employee headcount from december 31 2014 to december 31 2015 in general and administrative functions including an increase of 20 million in sharebased compensation expense in 2015 and to a lesser extent higher legal and other professional services fees 

in 2017  we plan to continue to increase general and administrative expenses to support overall company growth 

interest and other incomeexpense net 



  

2016  compared to 2015  interest and other incomeexpense net in 2016  increased 122 million  compared to 2015  interest incomeexpense net increased mostly due to increases in interest income driven by higher invested cash balances and interest rates in addition the majority of the decrease in other incomeexpense net was due to foreign exchange impact resulting from the periodic remeasurement of our foreign currency balances 

2015  compared to 2014  interest and other incomeexpense net in 2015 increased 53 million or 63 compared to 2014 other incomeexpense net increased primarily due to a decrease in foreign exchange losses resulting from the periodic remeasurement of our foreign currency balances in addition interest incomeexpense net increased due to higher invested cash balances and interest rates 

provision for income taxes 



  

2016  compared to 2015  our provision for income taxes in 2016  decreased 205 million  or 8  compared to 2015 primarily due to the impact of the adoption of asu 201609 and was partially offset by an increase in income before provision for income taxes our effective tax rate decreased due to more of our income before provision for income taxes being earned in jurisdictions with a tax rate lower than the us statutory rate where we have asserted our intention to indefinitely reinvest certain of those earnings as well as due to a lower increase in our unrecognized tax benefit in 2016  compared to 2015  and the adoption of asu 201609 effective january 1 2016 

the adoption of asu 201609 significantly impacts both the timing and method of how the tax effects of sharebased awards are recognized asu 201609 requires the income tax effects to be recognized in the provision for income taxes when the awards vest or are settled whereas previously such income tax benefits were recognized as part of additional paidin capital and could not be recognized until they were realized through a reduction in income taxes payable these combined effects had the impact of decreasing our provision for income taxes by 934 million  and our effective tax rate by 7  in 2016 excluding the adoption of asu 201609 our provision for income taxes and effective tax rate in 2016 would have been 324 billion and 26 respectively 

in july 2016 we received a statutory notice of deficiency notice from the irs related to transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries in conjunction with the examination of the 2010 tax year while the notice applies only to the 2010 tax year the irs states that it will also apply its position for tax years subsequent to 2010 which if the irs prevails in its position could result in an additional federal tax liability of approximately 30 billion to 50 billion in excess of the originally filed us return plus interest and any penalties asserted we do not agree with the position of the irs and have filed a petition in the united states tax court challenging the notice we have previously accrued an estimated unrecognized tax benefit consistent with the guidance in asc 740 that is lower than the potential additional federal tax liability of 30 to 50 billion in excess of the originally filed us return plus interest and penalties if the irs prevails in the assessment of additional tax due based on its position the assessed tax interest and penalties if any could have a material adverse impact on our financial position results of operations and cash flows 

2015  compared to 2014   our provision for income taxes in 2015 increased 536 million or 27 compared to 2014 primarily due to an increase in income before provision for income taxes our effective tax rate in 2015 remained flat due to an increase in income subject to tax in jurisdictions with tax rates lower than the us statutory rate offset by an increase in unrecognized tax benefits 

effective tax rate items our 2016 effective tax rate differs from the us statutory rate primarily due to more of our income before provision for income taxes being earned in jurisdictions with tax rates lower than the us statutory rate where we have the asserted our intention to indefinitely reinvest those earnings and the recognition of certain tax benefits from sharebased award activities after the adoption of asu 201609 our effective tax rate in the future will depend on the mix of our income before provision for income taxes earned in jurisdictions with a tax rate lower than the us statutory rate where we have the ability and intent to indefinitely reinvest those earnings as well as a number of other factors including integrating intellectual property from acquisitions research tax credits sharebased compensation settlement of tax contingency items and the impact of new legislation 

the portion of our income before provision for income taxes earned in jurisdictions with a tax rate lower than the us statutory rate will depend upon the proportion of revenue and costs associated with the respective jurisdictions our ability to assert our intention to indefinitely reinvest those future earnings will depend upon the amount location and cost of deploying those earnings to where they are needed by the business 

integrating intellectual property from acquisitions into our business generally involves intercompany transactions that have the impact of increasing our provision for income taxes consequently our provision for income taxes and our effective tax rate may initially increase following an acquisition and integration the magnitude of this impact will depend upon the specific type size and taxing jurisdictions of the intellectual property as well as the relative contribution to income in subsequent periods 

the accounting for sharebased compensation will increase or decrease our effective tax rate based upon the difference between our sharebased compensation expense and the benefits taken on our tax return which depends upon the share price at the time of employee award vesting 

we anticipate our 2017 annual effective tax rate will be lower than 2016 we anticipate that more of our income before provision for income taxes will be earned in jurisdictions with a tax rate lower than the us statutory rate where we intend to assert to indefinitely reinvest those earnings which we expect will result in a lower effective tax rate for 2017 in addition we anticipate that asu 201609 will further lower our effective tax rate relative to the us statutory rate if our share price remains constant to the january 31 2017 price of 13032 as asu 201609 requires recognition of certain tax benefits on a discrete basis we anticipate that our effective tax rate will vary from quarter to quarter depending on our share price in each period if our share price remains constant to the january 31 2017 price we anticipate that our effective tax rate will be lower in the first quarter of 2017 and increase in the remaining quarters throughout the year 

unrecognized tax benefits as of december 31 2016 our net unrecognized tax benefits are 243 billion  accrued as other liabilities and are predominantly accrued for uncertainties related to transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries which includes licensing of intellectual property providing services and other transactions as well as for uncertainties with our research tax credits the ultimate settlement of the liabilities will depend upon resolution of tax audits litigation or events that would otherwise change the assessment of such items based upon the status of litigation described above and the current status of tax audits in various jurisdictions we believe it is unlikely that a material change to our unrecognized tax benefits will occur within the next 12 months we expect to continue to accrue unrecognized tax benefits for certain recurring tax positions and anticipate that the amount accrued will be similar to 2016 absent any unanticipated event we do not expect our unrecognized tax benefits will have a significant impact on our effective tax rate in 2017

the following tables set forth our unaudited quarterly consolidated statements of income data in dollars and as a percentage of total revenue for each of the eight quarters in the period ended december 31 2016  we have prepared the quarterly consolidated statements of income data on a basis consistent with the audited consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data in this annual report on form 10k we elected to early adopt asu 201609 in the fourth quarter of 2016 as such certain consolidated statements of income data for the three months ended december 31 2016 september 30 2016 june 30 2016 and march 31 2016 included the impacts of early adoption of asu 201609 see note 1 of the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data of this annual report on form 10k for additional information related to this adoption in the opinion of management the financial information reflects all adjustments consisting only of normal recurring adjustments which we consider necessary for a fair presentation of this data this information should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included in part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data in this annual report on form 10k the results of historical periods are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations for any future period

sharebased compensation expense included in costs and expenses 



liquidity and capital resources 



 our principal sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents marketable securities and cash generated from operations cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities consist primarily of cash on deposit with banks investments in money market funds and investments in us government securities us government agency securities and corporate debt securities cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities were 2945 billion  as of december 31 2016  an increase of 1102 billion  from december 31 2015  primarily due to 1611 billion  of cash generated from operations partially offset by 449 billion  for purchases of property and equipment and 312 million  for principal payments on capital lease and other financing obligations 

cash paid for income taxes net of refunds was 121 billion  for the year ended december 31 2016  as of december 31 2016  our federal net operating loss carryforward was 314 billion  although we anticipate only a relatively small portion of this will be available to offset our federal taxable income in 2017 as of december 31 2016  we had 312 million  of federal tax credits of which a substantial portion will be available to offset our federal tax liabilities in 2017 we expect that the amount of cash paid for income taxes will significantly increase in 2017 

 in may 2016 we terminated our undrawn fiveyear senior unsecured revolving credit facility that allowed us to borrow up to 65 billion and entered into a 20 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility 2016 facility any amounts outstanding under the 2016 facility will be due and payable on may 20 2021 as of december 31 2016  no amounts had been drawn down and we were in compliance with the covenants under this credit facility 

in november 2016 our board of directors authorized a 60 billion share repurchase program of our class a common stock commencing in 2017 and does not have an expiration date the timing and actual number of shares repurchased depend on a variety of factors including price general business and market conditions and other investment opportunities through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions including through the use of trading plans intended to qualify under rule 10b51 under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended exchange act   

as of december 31 2016  510 billion  of the 2945 billion  in cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities was held by our foreign subsidiaries we have provided residual taxes in jurisdictions where we do not intend to indefinitely reinvest the earnings of the local subsidiary 

in january 2017 we began funding withholding taxes due on employee equity awards by net share settlement rather than our previous approach of requiring employees to sell shares of our common stock to cover taxes upon vesting of such awards we expect this net share settlement approach will increase our cash outflows and reduce the number of shares that will be issued in connection with the vesting of our employee equity awards if we had used the net share settlement approach in 2016 our cash outflows would have increased by approximately 23 billion for the year ended december 31 2016 and the number of shares of class a common stock issued in connection with the vesting of employee equity awards during this period would have decreased by approximately 20 million shares 

we currently anticipate that our available funds credit facility and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our operational cash needs for the foreseeable future 

cash provided by operating activities 

cash flow from operating activities during 2016  mostly consisted of net income adjusted for certain noncash items such as sharebased compensation expense of 322 billion  and total depreciation and amortization of 234 billion  the increase in cash flow from operating activities during 2016  compared to 2015  was mostly due to an increase in net income including the impact of asu 201609 adoption as adjusted for depreciation and amortization deferred income taxes and sharebased compensation expense 

cash flow from operating activities during 2015 mostly consisted of net income adjusted for certain noncash items such as sharebased compensation expense of 296 billion total depreciation and amortization of 195 billion and tax benefit from sharebased award activity of 172 billion  which had been reclassified from financing activity as a result of asu 201609 adoption the increase in cash flow from operating activities during 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily due to an increase in net income as adjusted for sharebased compensation expense and higher income tax payable as of december 31 2015 compared to 2014 

cash flow from operating activities during 2014 primarily consisted of net income adjusted for certain noncash items such as tax benefit from sharebased award activity of 185 billion  which had been reclassified from financing activity as a result of asu 201609 adoption sharebased compensation expense of 179 billion and total depreciation and amortization of 124 billion the cash flow from operating activities during 2014 compared to 2013 increased mainly due to an increase in net income of 144 billion as adjusted for certain noncash items described above partially offset by a decrease in income tax refunds of 415 million 

cash used in investing activities 

cash used in investing activities was 1174 billion  during 2016  mostly due to 719 billion  for net purchases of marketable securities and 449 billion  for capital expenditures as we continued to invest in data centers servers office buildings and network infrastructure the increase in cash used in investing activities during 2016  compared to 2015  was mostly due to increases in capital expenditures and net purchases of marketable securities 

cash used in investing activities during 2015 primarily resulted from 670 billion for net purchases of marketable securities and 252 billion for capital expenditures as we continued to invest in servers data centers network infrastructure and office buildings the increase in cash used in investing activities during 2015 compared to 2014 was mainly due to increases in net purchases of marketable securities partially offset by a decrease in acquisitions of businesses and purchases of intangible assets 

cash used in investing activities during 2014 primarily resulted from 498 billion for the acquisition of businesses and 183 billion for capital expenditures related to network infrastructure and the construction of data centers and office buildings partially offset by 124 billion for the net sales and maturities of marketable securities the increase in cash used in investing activities during 2014 compared to 2013 was mainly due to increases in acquisitions of businesses and purchases of intangible assets and capital expenditures partially offset by net sales of marketable securities 

we anticipate making capital expenditures in 2017  of approximately 70 billion to 75 billion 

cash used in financing activities 

cash used in financing activities during 2016  mostly consisted of principal payments on capital lease and other financing obligations the increase in cash used in financing activities was due to full repayment of our capital lease and other financing obligations in 2016 

cash used in financing activities during 2015 primarily consisted of principal payments on capital lease obligations the decrease in cash used in financing activities was primarily due to lower principal payments related to our capital lease transactions 

cash used in financing activities during 2014 was 298 million which primarily resulted from 243 million of payments related to our capital lease transactions and 55 million of other financing activities 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we did not have any offbalance sheet arrangements as of december 31 2016  

contractual obligations 

our principal commitments consist of obligations under operating leases for offices land facilities and data centers the following table summarizes our commitments to settle contractual obligations in cash as of december 31 2016  in millions 



 in addition our other liabilities include 243 billion  related to uncertain tax positions as of december 31 2016  due to uncertainties in the timing of the completion of tax audits the timing of the resolution of these positions is uncertain and we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years beyond 12 months as a result this amount is not included in the above contractual obligations table 

contingencies 

we are involved in claims lawsuits government investigations and other legal proceedings we record a provision for a liability when we believe that it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and that the amount can be reasonably estimated significant judgment is required to determine both probability and the estimated amount such legal proceedings are inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties some of which are beyond our control should any of these estimates and assumptions change or prove to be incorrect it could have a material impact on our results of operations financial position and cash flows

foreign currency exchange risk 

we have foreign currency risks related to our revenue and operating expenses denominated in currencies other than the us dollar primarily the euro in general we are a net receiver of currencies other than the us dollar accordingly changes in exchange rates and in particular a strengthening of the us dollar have negatively affected our revenue and other operating results as expressed in us dollars 

we have experienced and will continue to experience fluctuations in our net income as a result of transaction gains or losses related to revaluing certain current asset and current liability balances that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the entities in which they are recorded at this time we have not entered into but in the future we may enter into derivatives or other financial instruments in an attempt to hedge our foreign currency exchange risk it is difficult to predict the effect hedging activities would have on our results of operations we recognized foreign currency losses of 76 million  66 million  and 87 million  in 2016  2015  and 2014  respectively 

interest rate sensitivity 

our exposure to changes in interest rates relates primarily to interest earned and market value on our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities 

our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities consist of cash certificates of deposit time deposits money market funds us government securities us government agency securities and corporate debt securities  our investment policy and strategy are focused on preservation of capital and supporting our liquidity requirements changes in us interest rates affect the interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities and the market value of those securities a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would have resulted in a decrease of 403 million  and 173 million  in the market value of our availableforsale debt securities as of december 31 2016  and december 31 2015  respectively any realized gains or losses resulting from such interest rate changes would only occur if we sold the investments prior to maturity

 item 1a 

risk factors 

tableend certain factors may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations you should consider carefully the risks and uncertainties described below in addition to other information contained in this annual report on form 10k including our consolidated financial statements and related notes the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of or that we currently believe are not material may also become important factors that adversely affect our business if any of the following risks actually occurs our business financial condition results of operations and future prospects could be materially and adversely affected in that event the trading price of our class a common stock could decline and you could lose part or all of your investment 

risks related to our business and industry 

if we fail to retain existing users or add new users or if our users decrease their level of engagement with our products our revenue financial results and business may be significantly harmed 

the size of our user base and our users level of engagement are critical to our success our financial performance has been and will continue to be significantly determined by our success in adding retaining and engaging active users we anticipate that our active user growth rate will continue to decline over time as the size of our active user base increases and as we achieve higher market penetration rates if people do not perceive our products to be useful reliable and trustworthy we may not be able to attract or retain users or otherwise maintain or increase the frequency and duration of their engagement a number of other social networking companies that achieved early popularity have since seen their active user bases or levels of engagement decline in some cases precipitously there is no guarantee that we will not experience a similar erosion of our active user base or engagement levels our user engagement patterns have changed over time and user engagement can be difficult to measure particularly as we introduce new and different products and services any number of factors could potentially negatively affect user retention growth and engagement including if 

 8 

 if we are unable to maintain or increase our user base and user engagement our revenue and financial results may be adversely affected any decrease in user retention growth or engagement could render our products less attractive to users marketers and developers which is likely to have a material and adverse impact on our revenue business financial condition and results of operations if our active user growth rate continues to slow we will become increasingly dependent on our ability to maintain or increase levels of user engagement and monetization in order to drive revenue growth 

we generate substantially all of our revenue from advertising the loss of marketers or reduction in spending by marketers could seriously harm our business 

substantially all of our revenue is currently generated from third parties advertising on facebook for 2015 2014 and 2013 advertising accounted for 95  92  and 89  respectively of our revenue in addition we have recently introduced advertising on instagram as is common in the industry our marketers do not have longterm advertising commitments with us many of our marketers spend only a relatively small portion of their overall advertising budget with us we expect our ability to grow advertising revenue will continue to be dependent on our ability to generate revenue from ads displayed on mobile devices in addition marketers may view some of our products as experimental and unproven marketers will not continue to do business with us or they will reduce the prices they are willing to pay to advertise with us or the budgets they are willing to commit to us if we do not deliver ads in an effective manner or if they do not believe that their investment in advertising with us will generate a competitive return relative to other alternatives 

our advertising revenue could also be adversely affected by a number of other factors including 

 9 

 the occurrence of any of these or other factors could result in a reduction in demand for our ads which may reduce the prices we receive for our ads or cause marketers to stop advertising with us altogether either of which would negatively affect our revenue and financial results 

our user growth engagement and monetization on mobile devices depend upon effective operation with mobile operating systems networks and standards that we do not control 

there is no guarantee that popular mobile devices will continue to feature facebook or our other products or that mobile device users will continue to use our products rather than competing products we are dependent on the interoperability of facebook and our other products with popular mobile operating systems networks and standards that we do not control such as the android and ios operating systems any changes in such systems or changes in our relationships with mobile operating system partners handset manufacturers or mobile carriers or in their terms of service or policies that degrade our products functionality reduce or eliminate our ability to distribute our products give preferential treatment to competitive products limit our ability to deliver target or measure the effectiveness of ads or charge fees related to the distribution of our products or our delivery of ads could adversely affect the usage of facebook or our other products and monetization on mobile devices additionally in order to deliver high quality mobile products it is important that our products work well with a range of mobile technologies systems networks and standards that we do not control and that we have good relationships with handset manufacturers and mobile carriers we may not be successful in maintaining or developing relationships with key participants in the mobile industry or in developing products that operate effectively with these technologies systems networks or standards in the event that it is more difficult for our users to access and use facebook or our other products on their mobile devices or if our users choose not to access or use facebook or our other products on their mobile devices or use mobile products that do not offer access to facebook or our other products our user growth and user engagement could be harmed from time to time we may also take actions regarding the distribution of our products or the operation of our business based on what we believe to be in our longterm best interests such actions may adversely affect our users and our relationships with the operators of mobile operating systems handset manufacturers mobile carriers or other business partners and there is no assurance that these actions will result in the anticipated longterm benefits in the event that our users are adversely affected by these actions or if our relationships with such third parties deteriorate our user growth engagement and monetization could be adversely affected and our business could be harmed 

our business is highly competitive competition presents an ongoing threat to the success of our business 

we face significant competition in every aspect of our business including from companies that provide tools to facilitate communication and the sharing of information companies that enable marketers to display advertising and companies that provide development platforms for applications developers we compete with companies that offer products that replicate the full range of capabilities we provide for example google has integrated social functionality into a number of its products including search and android as well as other largely regional social networks that have strong positions in particular countries we also compete with companies that develop applications particularly mobile applications that provide social or other communications functionality such as messaging photo and videosharing and microblogging and companies that provide web and mobilebased information and entertainment products and services that are designed to engage users and capture time spent on mobile devices and online in addition we face competition from traditional online and mobile businesses that provide media for marketers to reach their audiences andor   develop tools and systems for managing and optimizing advertising campaigns 

some of our current and potential competitors may have significantly greater resources or better competitive positions in certain product segments geographic regions or user demographics than we do these factors may allow our competitors to respond more effectively than us to new or emerging technologies and changes in market conditions we believe that some of our users particularly our younger users are aware of and actively engaging with other products and services similar to or as a substitute for facebook products and services and we believe that some of our users have reduced their engagement with facebook in favor of increased engagement with these other products and services in the event that our users increasingly engage with other products and services we may experience a decline in user engagement in key user demographics or more broadly in which case our business would likely be harmed 

our competitors may develop products features or services that are similar to ours or that achieve greater acceptance may undertake more farreaching and successful product development efforts or marketing campaigns or may adopt more aggressive pricing policies in addition developers whose mobile and web applications are integrated with facebook may use information shared by our users through facebook in order to develop products or features that compete with us certain competitors including google could use strong or dominant positions in one or more markets to gain competitive advantage against us in areas where we operate including by integrating competing platforms applications or features into products they control such as mobile device operating 

systems search engines or web browsers by making acquisitions by limiting or denying our access to advertising measurement or delivery systems by limiting our ability to deliver target or measure the effectiveness of ads by imposing fees or other charges related to our delivery of ads by making access to our products more difficult or by making it more difficult to communicate with our users as a result our competitors may acquire and engage users or generate advertising or other revenue at the expense of our own efforts which may negatively affect our business and financial results in addition from time to time we may take actions in response to competitive threats but we cannot assure you that these actions will be successful or that they will not negatively affect our business and financial results 

we believe that our ability to compete effectively depends upon many factors both within and beyond our control including 

 if we are not able to compete effectively our user base and level of user engagement may decrease we may become less attractive to developers and marketers and our revenue and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected 

action by governments to restrict access to facebook or our other products in their countries could substantially harm our business and financial results 

it is possible that governments of one or more countries may seek to censor content available on facebook or our other products in their country restrict access to our products from their country entirely or impose other restrictions that may affect the accessibility of our products in their country for an extended period of time or indefinitely for example access to facebook has been or is currently restricted in whole or in part in china iran and north korea in addition government authorities in other countries may seek to restrict access to our products if they consider us to be in violation of their laws in the event that content shown on facebook or our other products is subject to censorship access to our products is restricted in whole or in part in one or more countries or other restrictions are imposed on our products or our competitors are able to successfully penetrate new geographic markets or capture a greater share of existing geographic markets that we cannot access or where we face other restrictions our ability to retain or increase our user base and user engagement may be adversely affected we may not be able to maintain or grow our revenue as anticipated and our financial results could be adversely affected 

our new products and changes to existing products could fail to attract or retain users or generate revenue and profits 

our ability to retain increase and engage our user base and to increase our revenue depends heavily on our ability to create successful new products both independently and in conjunction with developers or other third parties we may introduce significant changes to our existing products or acquire or introduce new and unproven products including using technologies with which we have little or no prior development or operating experience for example in july 2014 we acquired oculus vr inc oculus a company developing virtual reality technology we do not have prior experience with consumer hardware products or virtual reality technology which may adversely affect our ability to successfully develop and market oculus products or technology and we will incur increased costs in connection with the development and marketing of such products and technology in addition in october 2014 we acquired whatsapp inc whatsapp and we have also invested significant resources in growing messenger we have historically monetized messaging in only a very limited fashion and we may not be successful in our efforts to generate meaningful revenue from messaging over the long term if these or other new or enhanced products fail to engage users marketers or developers or if we are unsuccessful in our monetization efforts we may fail to attract or retain users or to generate sufficient revenue operating margin or other value to justify our investments and our business may be adversely affected 

we make product and investment decisions that may not prioritize shortterm financial results 

we frequently make product and investment decisions that may not prioritize shortterm financial results if we believe that the decisions are consistent with our mission and benefit the aggregate user experience and will thereby improve our financial performance over the long term for example from time to time we may change the size frequency or relative prominence of ads in order to improve ad quality and overall user experience similarly from time to time we update our news feed ranking algorithm to deliver the most relevant content to our users which may adversely affect the distribution of content of marketers and developers and could reduce their incentive to invest in their development and marketing efforts on facebook we also may introduce changes to existing products or introduce new standalone products that direct users away from properties where we have a proven means of monetization for example we have taken action to redirect users who send messages from within the facebook application to our standalone messenger application although we do not monetize the standalone messenger application in any significant manner in addition we plan to continue focusing on growing the user base for whatsapp and potentially other standalone applications that may have limited or no nearterm monetization and it is possible that these efforts may reduce engagement with the core facebook application we also may take steps that result in limiting distribution of mobile products and services in the short term in order to attempt to ensure the availability of our products and services to users over the long term these decisions may not produce the longterm benefits that we expect in which case our user growth and engagement our relationships with marketers and developers and our business and results of operations could be harmed 

if we are not able to maintain and enhance our brands or if events occur that damage our reputation and brands our ability to expand our base of users marketers and developers may be impaired and our business and financial results may be harmed 

we believe that our brands have significantly contributed to the success of our business we also believe that maintaining and enhancing our brands is critical to expanding our base of users marketers and developers many of our new users are referred by existing users maintaining and enhancing our brands will depend largely on our ability to continue to provide useful reliable trustworthy and innovative products which we may not do successfully we may introduce new products or terms of service or policies that users do not like which may negatively affect our brands additionally the actions of our developers may affect our brands if users do not have a positive experience using thirdparty mobile and web applications integrated with facebook we will also continue to experience media legislative or regulatory scrutiny of our decisions regarding user privacy and other issues which may adversely affect our reputation and brands we also may fail to provide adequate customer service which could erode confidence in our brands our brands may also be negatively affected by the actions of users that are deemed to be hostile or inappropriate to other users or by users acting under false or inauthentic identities by perceived or actual efforts by governments to obtain access to user information for securityrelated purposes or by the use of our products or services for illicit objectionable or illegal ends maintaining and enhancing our brands may require us to make substantial investments and these investments may not be successful certain of our past actions have eroded confidence in our brands and if we fail to successfully promote and maintain our brands or if we incur excessive expenses in this effort our business and financial results may be adversely affected 

security breaches and improper access to or disclosure of our data or user data or other hacking and phishing attacks on our systems could harm our reputation and adversely affect our business 

our industry is prone to cyber attacks with third parties seeking unauthorized access to our data or users’ data   any failure to prevent or mitigate security breaches and improper access to or disclosure of our data or user data could result in the loss or misuse of such data which could harm our business and reputation and diminish our competitive position in addition computer malware viruses and hacking and phishing attacks by third parties have become more prevalent in our industry have occurred on our systems in the past and may occur on our systems in the future as a result of our prominence we believe that we are a particularly attractive target for such breaches and attacks such attacks may cause interruptions to the services we provide degrade the user experience 

cause users to lose confidence in our products or result in financial harm to us our efforts to protect our company data or the information we receive may also be unsuccessful due to software bugs or other technical malfunctions employee error or malfeasance government surveillance or other factors in addition third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or users to disclose information in order to gain access to our data or our users data although we have developed systems and processes that are designed to protect our data and user data and to prevent data loss and other security breaches we cannot assure you that such measures will provide absolute security 

in addition some of our developers or other partners such as those that help us measure the effectiveness of ads may receive or store information provided by us or by our users through mobile or web applications integrated with facebook we provide limited information to such third parties based on the scope of services provided to us however if these third parties or developers fail to adopt or adhere to adequate data security practices or in the event of a breach of their networks our data or our users data may be improperly accessed used or disclosed 

affected users or government authorities could initiate legal or regulatory actions against us in connection with any security breaches or improper disclosure of data which could cause us to incur significant expense and liability or result in orders or consent decrees forcing us to modify our business practices any of these events could have a material and adverse effect on our business reputation or financial results 

unfavorable media coverage could negatively affect our business 

we receive a high degree of media coverage around the world unfavorable publicity regarding for example our privacy practices terms of service product changes product quality litigation or regulatory activity government surveillance the actions of our developers whose products are integrated with our products the use of our products or services for illicit objectionable or illegal ends the actions of our users or the actions of other companies that provide similar services to us could adversely affect our reputation such negative publicity also could have an adverse effect on the size engagement and loyalty of our user base and result in decreased revenue which could adversely affect our business and financial results 

our financial results will fluctuate from quarter to quarter and are difficult to predict 

our quarterly financial results have fluctuated in the past and will fluctuate in the future additionally we have a limited operating history with the current scale of our business which makes it difficult to forecast our future results as a result you should not rely upon our past quarterly financial results as indicators of future performance you should take into account the risks and uncertainties frequently encountered by companies in rapidly evolving markets our financial results in any given quarter can be influenced by numerous factors many of which we are unable to predict or are outside of our control including 

 13 

costeffective manner 

 we expect our rates of growth to decline in the future 

we expect that our user growth and revenue growth rates will decline over time as the size of our active user base increases and as we achieve greater market penetration for example the growth rate of our revenue declined from 58  from 2013 to 2014 to 44  from 2014 to 2015 we expect our revenue growth rate will generally decline over time as our revenue increases to higher levels as our growth rates decline investors perceptions of our business may be adversely affected and the trading price of our class a common stock could decline 

our costs are continuing to grow which could harm our business and profitability 

operating our business is costly and we expect our expenses to continue to increase in the future as we broaden our user base as users increase the amount of content they consume and the data they share with us as we develop and implement new products and as we continue to hire additional employees to support our expanding operations we expect to continue to invest in our global connectivity efforts which may not have a clear path to monetization we may also be subject to increased costs in order to obtain and attract thirdparty content or to facilitate the distribution of our products in addition we will incur increased costs in connection with the development and marketing of our oculus products any such investments may not be successful and any such increases in our costs may adversely affect our business and profitability 

our business is subject to complex and evolving us and foreign laws and regulations regarding privacy data protection and other matters many of these laws and regulations are subject to change and uncertain interpretation and could result in claims changes to our business practices monetary penalties increased cost of operations or declines in user growth or engagement or otherwise harm our business 

we are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the united states and abroad that involve matters central to our business including privacy and data protection rights of publicity content intellectual property advertising marketing distribution data security data retention and deletion personal information electronic contracts and other communications competition protection of minors consumer protection telecommunications product liability taxation economic or other trade prohibitions or sanctions securities law compliance and online payment services the introduction of new products or expansion of our activities in certain jurisdictions may subject us to additional laws and regulations in addition foreign data protection privacy and other laws and regulations can be more restrictive than those in the united states 

these us federal and state and foreign laws and regulations which in some cases can be enforced by private parties in addition to government entities are constantly evolving and can be subject to significant change as a result the application interpretation and enforcement of these laws and regulations are often uncertain particularly in the new and rapidly evolving industry in which we operate and may be interpreted and applied inconsistently from country to country and inconsistently with our current policies and practices for example regulatory or legislative actions affecting the manner in which we display content to our users could adversely affect user growth and engagement such actions could affect the manner in which we provide our services or adversely affect our financial results 

we are also subject to laws and regulations that dictate whether how and under what circumstances we can transfer process andor receive transnational data that is critical to our operations including data relating to users customers or partners outside the united states and those laws and regulations are uncertain and subject to change for example in october 2015 the european court of justice invalidated the european commissions 2000 safe harbour decision as a legitimate basis on which facebook could rely for the transfer of data from the european union to the united states in addition the other bases on which facebook relies are likely to be subject to regulatory or judicial scrutiny if facebook is unable to transfer data between and among countries and regions in which it operates it could affect the manner in which we provide our services or adversely affect our financial results 

proposed legislation and regulations could also significantly affect our business there currently are a number of proposals pending before federal state and foreign legislative and regulatory bodies including a data protection regulation that is pending final approval by the european legislature that may include operational requirements for companies that receive or process personal data that are different than those currently in place in the european union and that will include significant penalties for noncompliance similarly there are a number of legislative proposals in the united states at both the federal and state level that could impose new obligations in areas affecting our business such as liability for copyright infringement by third parties in addition some countries are considering or have passed legislation implementing data protection requirements or requiring local storage and processing of data or similar requirements that could increase the cost and complexity of delivering our services 

these existing and proposed laws and regulations as well as any associated inquiries investigations or actions can be costly to comply with and can delay or impede the development of new products result in negative publicity increase our operating costs require significant management time and attention and subject us to remedies that may harm our business including fines or demands or orders that we modify or cease existing business practices 

we have been subject to regulatory investigations and settlements and we expect to continue to be subject to such proceedings and other inquires in the future which could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner materially adverse to our business 

from time to time we receive formal and informal inquiries from government authorities and regulators regarding our compliance with laws and regulations many of which are evolving and subject to interpretation we are and expect to continue to be the subject of investigations inquiries actions and audits in the united states europe and around the world particularly in the areas of consumer and data protection as we continue to grow and expand our operations for example several data protection authorities in europe have initiated actions seeking to assert jurisdiction over facebook inc and our subsidiaries and to restrict the ways in which we collect and use information and other data protection authorities may do the same orders issued by or inquiries or enforcement actions initiated by government or regulatory authorities could cause us to incur substantial costs expose us to unanticipated civil and criminal liability or penalties including substantial monetary fines or require us to change our business practices in a manner materially adverse to our business 

if we are unable to protect our intellectual property the value of our brands and other intangible assets may be diminished and our business may be adversely affected 

we rely and expect to continue to rely on a combination of confidentiality assignment and license agreements with our employees consultants and third parties with whom we have relationships as well as trademark copyright patent trade secret and domain name protection laws to protect our proprietary rights in the united states and internationally we have filed various applications for protection of certain aspects of our intellectual property and we currently hold a number of issued patents in multiple jurisdictions and have acquired patents and patent applications from third parties in addition in the future we may acquire additional patents or patent portfolios which could require significant cash expenditures third parties may knowingly or unknowingly infringe our proprietary rights third parties may challenge proprietary rights held by us and pending and future trademark and patent applications may not be approved in addition effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which we operate or intend to operate our business in any or all of these cases we may be required to expend significant time and expense in order to prevent infringement or to enforce our rights although we have generally taken measures to protect our proprietary rights there can be no assurance that others will not offer products or concepts that are substantially similar to ours and compete with our business in addition we regularly contribute software source code under open source licenses and have made other technology we developed available under other open licenses and we include open source software in our products for example we have contributed certain specifications and designs related to our data center equipment to the open compute project foundation a nonprofit entity that shares and develops such information with the technology community under the open web foundation license as a result of our open source contributions and the use of open source in our products we may license or be required to license or disclose code andor innovations that turn out to be material to our business and may also be exposed to increased litigation risk if the protection of our proprietary rights is inadequate to prevent unauthorized use or appropriation by third parties the value of our brands and other intangible assets may be diminished and competitors may be able to more effectively mimic our products services and methods of operations any of these events could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results 

we are currently and expect to be in the future party to patent lawsuits and other intellectual property rights claims that are expensive and time consuming and if resolved adversely could have a significant impact on our business financial condition or results of operations 

companies in the internet technology and media industries own large numbers of patents copyrights trademarks and trade secrets and frequently enter into litigation based on allegations of infringement misappropriation or other violations of intellectual property or other rights in addition various nonpracticing entities that own patents and other intellectual property rights often attempt to aggressively assert their rights in order to extract value from technology companies furthermore from time to time we may introduce or acquire new products including in areas where we historically have not competed which could increase our exposure to patent and other intellectual property claims from competitors and nonpracticing entities 

from time to time we receive notice letters from patent holders alleging that certain of our products and services infringe their patent rights we presently are involved in a number of intellectual property lawsuits and as we face increasing competition and gain an increasingly high profile we expect the number of patent and other intellectual property claims against us to grow defending patent and other intellectual property litigation is costly and can impose a significant burden on management and employees and there can be no assurances that favorable final outcomes will be obtained in all cases in addition plaintiffs may seek and we may become subject to preliminary or provisional rulings in the course of any such litigation including potential preliminary injunctions requiring us to cease some or all of our operations we may decide to settle such lawsuits and disputes on terms that are unfavorable to us similarly if any litigation to which we are a party is resolved adversely we may be subject to an unfavorable judgment that may not be reversed upon appeal the terms of such a settlement or judgment may require us to cease some or all of our operations or pay substantial amounts to the other party in addition we may have to seek a license to continue practices found to be in violation of a third partys rights which may not be available on reasonable terms or at all and may significantly increase our operating costs and expenses as a result we may also be required to develop alternative noninfringing technology or practices or discontinue the practices the development of alternative noninfringing technology or practices could require significant effort and expense or may not be feasible our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected as a result of an unfavorable resolution of the disputes and litigation referred to above 

we are involved in numerous class action lawsuits and other litigation matters that are expensive and time consuming and if resolved adversely could harm our business financial condition or results of operations 

in addition to intellectual property claims we are also involved in numerous other lawsuits including putative class action lawsuits many of which claim statutory damages andor seek significant changes to our business operations and we anticipate that we will continue to be a target for numerous lawsuits in the future because of the scale of our user base the plaintiffs in class action cases filed against us typically claim enormous monetary damages even if the alleged peruser harm is small or nonexistent in addition we may be subject to additional class action lawsuits based on product performance or other claims related to the use of consumer hardware and software as well as virtual reality technology and products which are new and unproven any negative 

outcome from any such lawsuits could result in payments of substantial monetary damages or fines or undesirable changes to our products or business practices and accordingly our business financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected although the results of such lawsuits and claims cannot be predicted with certainty we do not believe that the final outcome of those matters relating to our products that we currently face will have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations in addition we are currently the subject of stockholder class action suits in connection with our ipo we believe these lawsuits are without merit and are vigorously defending these lawsuits 

there can be no assurances that a favorable final outcome will be obtained in all our cases and defending any lawsuit is costly and can impose a significant burden on management and employees any litigation to which we are a party may result in an onerous or unfavorable judgment that may not be reversed upon appeal or in payments of substantial monetary damages or fines or we may decide to settle lawsuits on similarly unfavorable terms which could adversely affect our business financial conditions or results of operations 

we may incur liability as a result of information retrieved from or transmitted over the internet or published using our products or as a result of claims related to our products 

we have faced currently face and will continue to face claims relating to information that is published or made available on our products in particular the nature of our business exposes us to claims related to defamation intellectual property rights rights of publicity and privacy and personal injury torts this risk is enhanced in certain jurisdictions outside the united states where our protection from liability for thirdparty actions may be unclear and where we may be less protected under local laws than we are in the united states we could incur significant costs investigating and defending such claims and if we are found liable significant damages if any of these events occur our business and financial results could be adversely affected 

our ceo has control over key decision making as a result of his control of a majority of our voting stock 

mark zuckerberg our founder chairman and ceo is able to exercise voting rights with respect to a majority of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock and therefore has the ability to control the outcome of matters submitted to our stockholders for approval including the election of directors and any merger consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets this concentrated control could delay defer or prevent a change of control merger consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets that our other stockholders support or conversely this concentrated control could result in the consummation of such a transaction that our other stockholders do not support this concentrated control could also discourage a potential investor from acquiring our class a common stock due to the limited voting power of such stock relative to the class b common stock and might harm the trading price of our class a common stock in addition mr zuckerberg has the ability to control the management and major strategic investments of our company as a result of his position as our ceo and his ability to control the election or replacement of our directors in the event of his death the shares of our capital stock that mr zuckerberg owns will be transferred to the persons or entities that he has designated as a board member and officer mr zuckerberg owes a fiduciary duty to our stockholders and must act in good faith in a manner he reasonably believes to be in the best interests of our stockholders as a stockholder even a controlling stockholder mr zuckerberg is entitled to vote his shares and shares over which he has voting control as governed by a voting agreement in his own interests which may not always be in the interests of our stockholders generally 

we plan to continue to make acquisitions which could harm our financial condition or results of operations and may adversely affect the price of our common stock 

as part of our business strategy we have made and intend to continue to make acquisitions to add specialized employees and complementary companies products or technologies we may not be able to find suitable acquisition candidates and we may not be able to complete acquisitions on favorable terms if at all in some cases the costs of such acquisitions may be substantial for example in 2014 we paid approximately 46 billion in cash and issued 178 million shares of our class a common stock in connection with our acquisition of whatsapp and we paid approximately 400 million in cash and issued 23 million shares of our class b common stock in connection with our acquisition of oculus we also issued a substantial number of rsus to help retain the employees of these companies there is no assurance that we will receive a favorable return on investment for these or other acquisitions 

in the future we may pay substantial amounts of cash or incur debt to pay for acquisitions which could adversely affect our liquidity the incurrence of indebtedness would also result in increased fixed obligations increased interest expense and could also include covenants or other restrictions that would impede our ability to manage our operations we may also issue equity securities to pay for acquisitions and we regularly grant rsus to retain the employees of acquired companies which could increase our expenses adversely affect our financial results and result in dilution to our stockholders in addition any acquisitions we announce could be viewed negatively by users marketers developers or investors which may adversely affect our business or the price of our common stock 

we may also discover liabilities or deficiencies associated with the companies or assets we acquire that were not identified in advance which may result in significant unanticipated costs the effectiveness of our due diligence review and our ability to evaluate the results of such due diligence are dependent upon the accuracy and completeness of statements and disclosures made or actions taken by the companies we acquire or their representatives as well as the limited amount of time in which acquisitions are executed in addition we may fail to accurately forecast the financial impact of an acquisition transaction including tax and accounting charges acquisitions may also result in our recording of significant additional expenses to our results of operations and recording of substantial finitelived intangible assets on our balance sheet upon closing any of these factors may adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations 

we may not be able to successfully integrate our acquisitions and we may incur significant costs to integrate and support the companies we acquire 

the integration of acquisitions requires significant time and resources and we may not manage these processes successfully our ability to successfully integrate complex acquisitions is unproven particularly with respect to companies that have significant operations or that develop products where we do not have prior experience for example oculus and whatsapp are larger and more complex than companies we have historically acquired in particular oculus builds technology and products that are new to facebook and with which we did not have significant experience or structure in place to support prior to the acquisition we are making substantial investments of resources to support these acquisitions which will result in significant ongoing operating expenses and may divert resources and management attention from other areas of our business we cannot assure you that these investments will be successful if we fail to successfully integrate the companies we acquire we may not realize the benefits expected from the transaction and our business may be harmed 

if our goodwill or finitelived intangible assets become impaired we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings   

we review our finitelived intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable such as a decline in stock price and market capitalization we test goodwill for impairment at least annually if such goodwill or finitelived intangible assets are deemed to be impaired an impairment loss equal to the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the assets would be recognized we may be required to record a significant charge in our financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill or finitelived intangible assets is determined which would negatively affect our results of operations 

our business is dependent on our ability to maintain and scale our technical infrastructure and any significant disruption in our service could damage our reputation result in a potential loss of users and engagement and adversely affect our financial results 

our reputation and ability to attract retain and serve our users is dependent upon the reliable performance of our products and our underlying technical infrastructure our systems may not be adequately designed with the necessary reliability and redundancy to avoid performance delays or outages that could be harmful to our business if our products are unavailable when users attempt to access them or if they do not load as quickly as expected users may not use our products as often in the future or at all and our ability to serve ads may be disrupted as our user base and engagement continue to grow and the amount and types of information shared on facebook and our other products continue to grow and evolve such as increased engagement with video we will need an increasing amount of technical infrastructure including network capacity and computing power to continue to satisfy the needs of our users it is possible that we may fail to effectively scale and grow our technical infrastructure to accommodate these increased demands in addition our business may be subject to interruptions delays or failures resulting from earthquakes adverse weather conditions other natural disasters power loss terrorism or other catastrophic events if such an event were to occur users may be subject to service disruptions or outages and we may not be able to recover our technical infrastructure and user data in a timely manner to restart or provide our services which may adversely affect our financial results 

a substantial portion of our network infrastructure is provided by third parties any disruption or failure in the services we receive from these providers could harm our ability to handle existing or increased traffic and could significantly harm our business any financial or other difficulties these providers face may adversely affect our business and we exercise little control over these providers which increases our vulnerability to problems with the services they provide 

we could experience unforeseen difficulties in building and operating key portions of our technical infrastructure 

we have designed and built our own data centers and key portions of our technical infrastructure through which we serve our products and we plan to continue to significantly expand the size of our infrastructure primarily through data centers and other projects the infrastructure expansion we are undertaking is complex and unanticipated delays in the completion of these projects or availability of components may lead to increased project costs operational inefficiencies or interruptions in the delivery or degradation of the quality of our products in addition there may be issues related to this infrastructure that are not identified during the testing phases of design and implementation which may only become evident after we have started to fully utilize the underlying equipment that could further degrade the user experience or increase our costs 

our products and internal systems rely on software that is highly technical and if it contains undetected errors or vulnerabilities our business could be adversely affected 

our products and internal systems rely on software including software developed or maintained internally andor by third parties that is highly technical and complex in addition our products and internal systems depend on the ability of such software to store retrieve process and manage immense amounts of data the software on which we rely has contained and may now or in the future contain undetected errors bugs or vulnerabilities some errors may only be discovered after the code has been released for external or internal use errors vulnerabilities or other design defects within the software on which we rely may result in a negative experience for users and marketers who use our products delay product introductions or enhancements result in measurement or billing errors compromise our ability to protect the data of our users andor our intellectual property or lead to reductions in our ability to provide some or all of our services for example social games on facebook rely on adobe flash which games are currently responsible for substantially all of our payments revenue in july 2015 certain vulnerabilities discovered in flash led to temporary interruption of support for flash by popular web browsers if similar interruptions occur in the future and disrupt our ability to provide social games to some or all of our users our ability to generate payments revenue would be harmed any errors bugs vulnerabilities or defects discovered in the software on which we rely and any associated degradations or interruptions of service could result in damage to our reputation loss of users loss of revenue or liability for damages any of which could adversely affect our business and financial results 

technologies have been developed that can block the display of our ads which could adversely affect our financial results 

technologies have been developed and will likely continue to be developed that can block the display of our ads particularly advertising displayed on personal computers we generate substantially all of our revenue from advertising including revenue resulting from the display of ads on personal computers revenue generated from the display of ads on personal computers has been impacted by these technologies from time to time as a result these technologies have had an adverse effect on our financial results and if such technologies continue to proliferate in particular with respect to mobile platforms our future financial results may be harmed 

certain of our user metrics are subject to inherent challenges in measurement and real or perceived inaccuracies in such metrics may harm our reputation and negatively affect our business 

the numbers for our key metrics which include our daus mobile daus maus mobile maus and average revenue per user arpu as well as certain other metrics such as mobileonly daus and mobileonly maus are calculated using internal company data based on the activity of user accounts while these numbers are based on what we believe to be reasonable estimates of our user base for the applicable period of measurement there are inherent challenges in measuring usage of our products across large online and mobile populations around the world 

for example there may be individuals who maintain one or more facebook accounts in violation of our terms of service we estimate for example that duplicate accounts an account that a user maintains in addition to his or her principal account may have represented less than 5 of our worldwide maus in 2015 we also seek to identify false accounts which we divide into two categories 1 usermisclassified accounts where users have created personal profiles for a business organization or nonhuman entity such as a pet such entities are permitted on facebook using a page rather than a personal profile under our terms of service and 2 undesirable accounts which represent user profiles that we determine are intended to be used for purposes that violate our terms of service such as spamming in 2015 for example we estimate that such usermisclassified and undesirable accounts may have represented less than 2 our worldwide maus we believe the percentage of accounts that are duplicate or false is meaningfully lower in developed markets such as the united states or united kingdom and higher in developing markets such as india and turkey however these estimates are based on an internal review of a limited sample of accounts and we apply significant judgment in making this determination such as identifying names that appear to be fake or other behavior that appears inauthentic to the reviewers as such our estimation of duplicate or false accounts may not accurately represent the actual number of such accounts we are continually seeking to improve our ability to identify duplicate or false accounts and estimate the total number of such accounts and such estimates may change due to improvements or changes in our methodology 

our data limitations may affect our understanding of certain details of our business for example while userprovided data indicates a decline in usage among younger users this age data is unreliable because a disproportionate number of our younger users register with an inaccurate age accordingly our understanding of usage by age group may not be complete 

some of our metrics have also been affected by applications on certain mobile devices that automatically contact our servers for regular updates with no user action involved and this activity can cause our system to count the user associated with such a device as an active user on the day such contact occurs the impact of this automatic activity on our metrics varied by geography because mobile usage varies in different regions of the world in addition our data regarding the geographic location of our users is estimated based on a number of factors such as the users ip address and selfdisclosed location these factors may not always accurately reflect the users actual location for example a mobileonly user may appear to be accessing facebook from the location of the proxy server that the user connects to rather than from the users actual location the methodologies used to measure user metrics may also be 

susceptible to algorithm or other technical errors our estimates for revenue by user location and revenue by user device are also affected by these factors we regularly review our processes for calculating these metrics and from time to time we may discover inaccuracies in our metrics or make adjustments to improve their accuracy including adjustments that may result in the recalculation of our historical metrics we believe that any such inaccuracies or adjustments are immaterial unless otherwise stated in addition our dau and mau estimates will differ from estimates published by third parties due to differences in methodology for example some third parties are not able to accurately measure mobile users or do not count mobile users for certain user groups or at all in their analyses 

if marketers developers or investors do not perceive our user metrics to be accurate representations of our user base or if we discover material inaccuracies in our user metrics our reputation may be harmed and marketers and developers may be less willing to allocate their budgets or resources to facebook which could negatively affect our business and financial results 

we cannot assure you that we will effectively manage our growth 

our employee headcount and the scope and complexity of our business have increased significantly with the number of employees increasing to 12691  as of december 31 2015 from 9199 as of december 31 2014 and we expect headcount growth to continue for the foreseeable future the growth and expansion of our business and products create significant challenges for our management operational and financial resources including managing multiple relations with users marketers developers and other third parties in the event of continued growth of our operations or in the number of our thirdparty relationships our information technology systems or our internal controls and procedures may not be adequate to support our operations in addition some members of our management do not have significant experience managing a large global business operation so our management may not be able to manage such growth effectively to effectively manage our growth we must continue to improve our operational financial and management processes and systems and to effectively expand train and manage our employee base as our organization continues to grow and we are required to implement more complex organizational management structures we may find it increasingly difficult to maintain the benefits of our corporate culture including our ability to quickly develop and launch new and innovative products this could negatively affect our business performance 

the loss of one or more of our key personnel or our failure to attract and retain other highly qualified personnel in the future could harm our business 

we currently depend on the continued services and performance of our key personnel including mark zuckerberg and sheryl k sandberg although we have entered into employment agreements with mr zuckerberg and ms sandberg the agreements have no specific duration and constitute atwill employment in addition many of our key technologies and systems are custommade for our business by our personnel the loss of key personnel including members of management as well as key engineering product development marketing and sales personnel could disrupt our operations and have an adverse effect on our business 

as we continue to grow we cannot guarantee we will continue to attract the personnel we need to maintain our competitive position in particular we intend to continue to hire a significant number of technical personnel in the foreseeable future and we expect to face significant competition from other companies in hiring such personnel particularly in the san francisco bay area where our headquarters are located and where the cost of living is high as we mature the incentives to attract retain and motivate employees provided by our equity awards or by future arrangements may not be as effective as in the past and if we issue significant equity to attract additional employees the ownership of our existing stockholders may be further diluted our ability to attract retain and motivate employees may also be adversely affected by stock price volatility additionally we have a number of current employees whose equity ownership in our company has provided them a substantial amount of personal wealth which could affect their decisions about whether or not to continue to work for us as a result of these factors it may be difficult for us to continue to retain and motivate our employees if we do not succeed in attracting hiring and integrating excellent personnel or retaining and motivating existing personnel we may be unable to grow effectively 

we may not be able to continue to successfully grow usage of and engagement with mobile and web applications that integrate with facebook and our other products 

we have made and are continuing to make investments to enable developers to build grow and monetize mobile and web applications that integrate with facebook and our other products such existing and prospective developers may not be successful in building growing or monetizing mobile andor web applications that create and maintain user engagement additionally developers may choose to build on other platforms including mobile platforms controlled by third parties rather than building products that integrate with facebook and our other products we are continuously seeking to balance the distribution objectives of our developers with our desire to provide an optimal user experience and we may not be successful in achieving a balance that continues to attract and retain such developers for example from time to time we have taken actions to reduce the volume of communications from these developers to users on facebook and our other products with the objective of enhancing the user experience and such actions have reduced distribution from user engagement with and our monetization opportunities from mobile and web applications integrated with our products in some instances these actions as well as other actions to enforce our policies applicable to developers have adversely affected our relationships with such developers if we are not successful in our efforts to continue to grow the number of developers that choose to build products that integrate with facebook and our other products or if we are unable to continue to build and maintain good relations with such developers our user growth and user engagement and our financial results may be adversely affected 

we currently generate all of our payments revenue from developers that use facebook on personal computers and we expect that our payments revenue will continue to decline in the future as usage of facebook on personal computers continues to decline 

we currently generate all of our payments revenue from developers that use facebook on personal computers specifically applications built by developers of social games are currently responsible for substantially all of our revenue derived from payments and the majority of the revenue from these applications has historically been generated by a limited number of the most popular games we have experienced and expect to see the continued decline in usage of facebook on personal computers for the foreseeable future which we expect will result in a continuing decline in payments revenue in addition a relatively small percentage of our users have transacted with facebook payments if the facebookintegrated applications fail to grow or maintain their users and engagement whether as a result of the continued decline in the usage of facebook on personal computers or otherwise if developers do not continue to introduce new applications that attract users and create engagement on facebook or if facebookintegrated applications outside of social games do not gain popularity and generate significant revenue for us our financial performance could be adversely affected 

payment transactions may subject us to additional regulatory requirements and other risks that could be costly and difficult to comply with or that could harm our business 

our users can purchase virtual and digital goods from developers that offer applications using our payments infrastructure on the facebook website in addition certain of our users can use our payments infrastructure for other activities such as sending money to other users and making donations to certain charitable organizations we are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the united states europe and elsewhere including those governing antimoney laundering and counterterrorist financing money transmission gift cards and other prepaid access instruments electronic funds transfer charitable fundraising and import and export restrictions depending on how our payments product evolves we may also be subject to other laws and regulations including those governing gambling banking and lending in some jurisdictions the application or interpretation of these laws and regulations is not clear to increase flexibility in how our use of payments may evolve and to mitigate regulatory uncertainty we have received certain money transmitter licenses in the united states and are applying for certain regulatory licenses in europe which will generally require us to demonstrate compliance with many domestic and foreign laws in these areas our efforts to comply with these laws and regulations could be costly and result in diversion of management time and effort and may still not guarantee compliance in the event that we are found to be in violation of any such legal or regulatory requirements we may be subject to monetary fines or other penalties such as a cease and desist order or we may be required to make product changes any of which could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results 

in addition we may be subject to a variety of additional risks as a result of payments transactions including 

 21 

we have significant international operations and plan to continue expanding our operations abroad where we have limited operating experience and this may subject us to increased business and economic risks that could affect our financial results 

we have significant international operations and plan to continue the international expansion of our business operations and the translation of our products we currently make facebook available in more than 90 different languages and we have offices or data centers in more than 30 different countries we may enter new international markets where we have limited or no experience in marketing selling and deploying our products our products are generally available globally through the web and on mobile but some or all of our products or functionality may not be available in certain markets due to legal and regulatory complexities for example facebook is not generally available in china we also outsource certain operational functions to thirdparty vendors globally if we fail to deploy manage or oversee our international operations successfully our business may suffer in addition we are subject to a variety of risks inherent in doing business internationally including 

 if we are unable to expand internationally and manage the complexity of our global operations successfully our financial results could be adversely affected 

we face design manufacturing and supply chain risks that if not properly managed could adversely impact our financial results 

we face a number of risks related to design manufacturing and supply chain management with respect to our oculus products for example the oculus products we sell may have quality issues resulting from the design or manufacture of the products or from the software used in the products sometimes these issues may be caused by components we purchase from other manufacturers or suppliers if the quality of our oculus products does not meet our customers expectations or such products are found to be defective then our financial results could be adversely affected 

we rely on third parties to manufacture our oculus products we may experience supply shortages or other supply chain disruptions in the future that could negatively impact our operations we could be negatively affected if we are not able to engage third parties with the necessary capabilities or capacity on reasonable terms or if those we engage with fail to meet their obligations whether due to financial difficulties or other reasons or make adverse changes in the pricing or other material terms of such arrangements with them 

we also require the suppliers and business partners of our oculus products to comply with law and certain company policies regarding sourcing practices but we do not control them or their practices if any of them violates laws or implements practices regarded as unethical we could experience supply chain disruptions canceled orders terminations of or damage to our reputation 

in addition the securities and exchange commission’s conflict minerals rule requires disclosure by public companies of the origin source and chain of custody of specified minerals known as conflict minerals that are necessary to the functionality or production of products manufactured or contracted to be manufactured we may incur significant costs associated with complying with the rule such as costs related to the determination of the origin source and chain of custody of the minerals used in oculus products the adoption of conflict mineralsrelated governance policies processes and controls and possible changes to products or sources of supply as a result of such activities 

we may face inventory risk with respect to our oculus products 

we may be exposed to inventory risks with respect to our oculus products as a result of rapid changes in product cycles and pricing defective merchandise changes in consumer demand and consumer spending patterns changes in consumer tastes with respect to oculus products and other factors we endeavor to accurately predict these trends and avoid overstocking or understocking products oculus may sell demand for products however can change significantly between the time inventory or components are ordered and the date of sale in addition when we begin selling or manufacturing a new oculus product it may be difficult to establish vendor relationships determine appropriate product or component selection and accurately forecast demand the acquisition of certain types of inventory or components may require significant leadtime and prepayment and they may not be returnable any one of these factors may adversely affect our operating results 

we may incur a substantial amount of indebtedness which could adversely affect our financial condition 

in august 2013 we entered into a fiveyear senior unsecured revolving credit facility under which we may borrow up to 65 billion to fund working capital and general corporate purposes as of december 31 2015 no amounts were outstanding under this facility if we draw down on this facility in the future our interest expense and principal repayment requirements will increase significantly which could have an adverse effect on our financial results 

we may require additional capital to support our business growth and this capital may not be available on acceptable terms if at all 

we may require additional capital to support our business growth or to respond to business opportunities challenges or unforeseen circumstances our ability to obtain additional capital if and when required will depend on our business plans investor demand our operating performance the condition of the capital markets and other factors if we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity equitylinked or debt securities those securities may have rights preferences or privileges senior to the rights of our class a common stock and our existing stockholders may experience dilution if we are unable to obtain additional capital when required or are unable to obtain additional capital on satisfactory terms our ability to continue to support our business growth or to respond to business opportunities challenges or unforeseen circumstances could be adversely affected and our business may be harmed 

we may have exposure to greater than anticipated tax liabilities 

our income tax obligations are based in part on our corporate operating structure and intercompany arrangements including the manner in which we operate our business develop value manage protect and use our intellectual property and the valuations of our intercompany transactions the tax laws applicable to our business including the laws of the united states and other jurisdictions are subject to interpretation and certain jurisdictions are aggressively interpreting their laws in new ways in an effort to raise additional tax revenue from companies such as facebook the taxing authorities of the jurisdictions in which we operate may challenge our methodologies for valuing developed technology or intercompany arrangements which could increase our worldwide effective tax rate and harm our financial position and results of operations we are subject to regular review and audit by us federal and state and foreign tax authorities tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken and any adverse outcome of such a review or audit could have a negative effect on our financial position and results of operations in addition the determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires significant judgment by management and there are many transactions where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain our provision for income taxes is also determined by the manner in which we operate our business and any changes to such operations or laws applicable to such operations may affect our effective tax rate although we believe that our estimates are reasonable the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements and may materially affect our financial results in the period or periods for which such determination is made   in addition our future income taxes could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions that have lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions that have higher statutory tax rates by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities or by changes in tax laws regulations or accounting principles for example we have previously incurred losses in certain international subsidiaries that resulted in an effective tax rate that is significantly higher than the statutory tax rate in the united states and this could continue to happen in the future 

changes in tax laws or tax rulings could materially affect our financial position and results of operations 

the tax regimes we are subject to or operate under are unsettled and may be subject to significant change changes in tax laws or tax rulings or changes in interpretations of existing laws could materially affect our financial position and results of operations many countries in europe as well as a number of other countries and organizations have recently proposed or recommended changes to existing tax laws or have enacted new laws that could significantly increase our tax obligations in many countries where we do business or require us to change the manner in which we operate our business for example in 2015 the united kingdom enacted the diverted profits tax and australia passed the tax integrity multinational antiavoidance law both of which could increase our tax obligations the organization for economic cooperation and development has been working on a base erosion and profit sharing project and has issued in 2015 and is expected to continue to issue guidelines and proposals that may change various aspects of the existing framework under which our tax obligations are determined in many of the countries in which we do business the european commission has conducted investigations in multiple countries focusing on whether local country tax rulings or tax legislation provides preferential tax treatment that violates european union state aid rules these investigations may result in changes to the tax treatment of our foreign operations in addition the current us administration and key members of congress have made public statements indicating that tax reform is a priority certain changes to us tax laws including limitations on the ability to defer us taxation on earnings outside of the united states until those earnings are repatriated to the united states could affect the tax treatment of our foreign earnings due to the large and expanding scale of our international business activities many of these types of changes to the taxation of our activities could increase our worldwide effective tax rate and harm our financial position and results of operations 

risks related to ownership of our class a common stock 

the trading price of our class a common stock has been and will likely continue to be volatile 

the trading price of our class a common stock has been and is likely to continue to be volatile since shares of our class a common stock were sold in our ipo in may 2012 at a price of 3800 per share our stock price has ranged from 1755  to 11065  through december 31 2015 in addition to the factors discussed in this annual report on form 10k the trading price of our class a common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to numerous factors many of which are beyond our control including 

 24 

in addition the stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many technology companies stock prices of many technology companies have fluctuated in a manner unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies we are currently subject to securities litigation in connection with our ipo we may experience more such litigation following future periods of volatility any securities litigation could subject us to substantial costs divert resources and the attention of management from our business and adversely affect our business 

we do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future 

we have never declared or paid cash dividends on our capital stock we currently intend to retain any future earnings to finance the operation and expansion of our business and we do not expect to declare or pay any dividends in the foreseeable future as a result you may only receive a return on your investment in our class a common stock if the trading price of our class a common stock increases in addition our credit facility contains restrictions on our ability to pay dividends 

the dual class structure of our common stock and a voting agreement between certain stockholders have the effect of concentrating voting control with our ceo and certain other holders of our class b common stock this will limit or preclude your ability to influence corporate matters 

our class b common stock has ten votes per share and our class a common stock has one vote per share stockholders who hold shares of class b common stock including certain of our executive officers employees and directors and their affiliates together hold a substantial majority of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock because of the tentoone voting ratio between our class b and class a common stock the holders of our class b common stock collectively control a majority of the combined voting power of our common stock and therefore are able to control all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval so long as the shares of class b common stock represent at least 91 of all outstanding shares of our class a and class b common stock this concentrated control will limit or preclude your ability to influence corporate matters for the foreseeable future 

transfers by holders of class b common stock will generally result in those shares converting to class a common stock subject to limited exceptions such as certain transfers effected for estate planning or charitable purposes the conversion of class b common stock to class a common stock will have the effect over time of increasing the relative voting power of those holders of class b common stock who retain their shares in the long term if for example mr zuckerberg retains a significant portion of his holdings of class b common stock for an extended period of time he could in the future continue to control a majority of the combined voting power of our class a common stock and class b common stock 

we have elected to take advantage of the controlled company exemption to the corporate governance rules for nasdaqlisted companies which could make our class a common stock less attractive to some investors or otherwise harm our stock price 

because we qualify as a controlled company under the corporate governance rules for nasdaqlisted companies we are not required to have a majority of our board of directors be independent nor are we required to have a compensation committee or an independent nominating function in light of our status as a controlled company our board of directors determined not to have an independent nominating function and chose to have the full board of directors be directly responsible for nominating members of our board and in the future we could elect not to have a majority of our board of directors be independent or not to have a compensation committee accordingly should the interests of our controlling stockholder differ from those of other stockholders the other stockholders may not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the corporate governance rules for nasdaqlisted companies our status as a controlled company could make our class a common stock less attractive to some investors or otherwise harm our stock price 

delaware law and provisions in our restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws could make a merger tender offer or proxy contest difficult thereby depressing the trading price of our class a common stock 

our status as a delaware corporation and the antitakeover provisions of the delaware general corporation law may discourage delay or prevent a change in control by prohibiting us from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years after the person becomes an interested stockholder even if a change of control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders in addition our restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that may make the acquisition of our company more difficult including the following

executive overview of full year 2015  results 

our key user metrics and financial results for 2015  are as follows 

user growth 

 financial results 

 in 2015  we continued to make progress on our three main revenue growth priorities i continuing to capitalize on the shift to mobile ii growing the number of marketers using our ad products and iii making our ads more relevant and effective through continued adoption of newer ad formats and tools for marketers 

in addition we invested and will continue to invest across three priorities i our core products and services to better serve our existing communities and businesses ii our next generation of services such as instagram messenger and whatsapp and iii our longterm innovation efforts such as connectivity efforts virtual reality and artificial intelligence research we expect these investments will continue to drive significant overall yearoveryear expense growth compared to 2015 

trends in our user metrics 

the numbers for our key metrics our daily active users daus mobile daus maus mobile maus and average revenue per user arpu and certain other metrics such as mobileonly daus and mobileonly maus do not include instagram or whatsapp users unless they would otherwise qualify as such users respectively based on their other activities on facebook in addition other user engagement metrics do not include instagram or whatsapp unless otherwise specifically stated 

trends in the number of users affect our revenue and financial results by influencing the number of ads we are able to show the value of our ads to marketers the volume of payments transactions as well as our expenses and capital expenditures 

 

note for purposes of reporting daus maus and arpu by geographic region europe includes all users in russia and turkey and rest of world includes all users in africa latin america and the middle east 

worldwide daus increased 17  to 104 billion on average during december 2015  from 890 million  during december 2014  we experienced growth in daus across major markets including india the united states and brazil overall growth in daus was driven by increased mobile usage of facebook and the number of daus accessing facebook on personal computers decreased in december 2015  compared to the same period in 2014  we believe that use of facebook through personal computers will continue to decline in all regions 

 worldwide mobile daus increased 25  to 934 million  on average during december 2015  from 745 million  during december 2014  in all regions an increasing number of our daus accessed facebook through mobile devices on average during december 2015  as compared to the same period during 2014  with users in india brazil and the united states representing key sources of mobile dau growth on average during december 2015  on average during december 2015  there were 789 million  mobileonly daus increasing 34  from 589 million  mobileonly daus during the same period in 2014  the remaining mobile daus accessed facebook from both mobile devices and personal computers we anticipate that growth in mobile users will continue to be the driver of our user growth for the foreseeable future 

   

as of december 31 2015  we had 159 billion  maus an increase of 14  from december 31 2014  users in india the united states and brazil represented key sources of growth in 2015  overall growth in maus was driven by increased mobile usage of facebook and the number of maus accessing facebook on personal computers decreased in december 2015  compared to the same period in 2014  we believe that use of facebook through personal computers will continue to decline in all regions 

 35 

worldwide mobile maus increased 21  to 144 billion  as of december 31 2015  from 119 billion  as of december 31 2014  in all regions an increasing number of our maus accessed facebook through mobile devices in 2015  as compared to the same period in 2014  with users in india brazil and the united states representing key sources of mobile mau growth in 2015  there were 823 million  mobileonly maus as of december 31 2015  increasing 56  from 526 million  mobileonly maus during the same period in 2014  the remaining 619 million  mobile maus accessed facebook from both mobile devices and personal computers during december 2015  we anticipate that growth in mobile users will continue to be the driver of our user growth for the foreseeable future

we calculate our revenue by user geography based on our estimate of the geography in which ad impressions are delivered or virtual and digital goods are purchased we define arpu as our total revenue in a given geography during a given quarter divided by the average of the number of maus in the geography at the beginning and end of the quarter while arpu includes all sources of revenue the number of maus used in this calculation only includes users of facebook and messenger as described in the definition of mau above the geography of our users affects our revenue and financial results because we currently monetize users in different geographies at different average rates our revenue and arpu in regions such as united states  canada and europe are relatively higher primarily due to the size and maturity of those online and mobile advertising markets for example arpu in 2015  in the united states  canada region was more than seven times higher than in the asiapacific region 

note our revenue by user geography in the charts above is geographically apportioned based on our estimation of the geographic location of our users when they perform a revenuegenerating activity this allocation differs from our revenue by geography disclosure in our consolidated financial statements where revenue is geographically apportioned based on the location of the marketer or developer 

for 2015  worldwide arpu was 1196  an increase of 27  from 2014  over this period arpu increased by 45 in united states  canada 23 in europe 22 in asiapacific and 15 in rest of world the general strengthening of the us dollar relative to certain foreign currencies from 2014  to 2015  had an unfavorable impact on the growth rate of our arpu outside the united states and canada region in addition user growth was more rapid in geographies with relatively lower arpu such as asiapacific and rest of world we expect that user growth in the future will be primarily concentrated in those regions where arpu is relatively lower such as asiapacific and rest of world such that worldwide arpu may continue to increase at a slower rate relative to arpu in any geographic region or potentially decrease even if arpu increases in each geographic region 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue costs and expenses and related disclosures we evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis our estimates are based on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances our actual results could differ from these estimates 

an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made if different estimates reasonably could have been used or if changes in the estimate that are reasonably possible could materially impact the financial statements we believe that the assumptions and estimates associated with revenue recognition for payments and other fees income taxes sharebased compensation loss contingencies and business combinations and valuation of goodwill and other acquired intangible assets have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements therefore we consider these to be our critical accounting policies and estimates for further information on all of our significant accounting policies see note 1 of our accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data of this annual report on form 10k 

revenue recognition for payments and other fees 

we enable payments from people to purchase virtual and digital goods from developers people can make payments on facebook by using debit and credit cards paypal mobile phone payments gift cards or other methods we receive a fee from developers when a person engages in a payment transaction for the purchase of a virtual or digital good on the facebook website the price of the virtual or digital good is a price that is solely determined by the developer we remit to the developer an amount that is based on the total amount of transaction less the processing fee that we charge the developer for the service performed our revenue is the net amount of the transaction representing our processing fee for the transaction we record revenue on a net basis as we do not consider ourselves to be the principal in the sale of the virtual or digital good to the person under gaap guidance related to reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent the indicators used to determine whether an entity is a principal or an agent to a transaction are subject to judgment we consider ourselves the agent to these transactions when we apply the indicators to our facts should material subsequent changes in the substance or nature of the transactions with developers result in us being considered the principal in such sales we would reflect the virtual and digital goods sale as revenue and the amounts paid to the developers as an associated cost 

income taxes 

we are subject to income taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes and income tax assets and liabilities including evaluating uncertainties in the application of accounting principles and complex tax laws 

we record a provision for income taxes for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations using the asset and liability method under this method we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities as well as for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the tax rates that are expected to apply to taxable income for the years in which those tax assets and liabilities are expected to be realized or settled we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the net amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized 

we recognize tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if we believe that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position although we believe that we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions we can provide no assurance that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be materially different we make adjustments to these reserves when facts and circumstances change such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded such differences will affect the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made and could have a material impact on our financial condition and operating results the provision for income taxes includes the effects of any reserves that we believe are appropriate as well as the related net interest and penalties 

sharebased compensation 

we account for sharebased employee compensation plans under the fair value recognition and measurement provisions in accordance with applicable accounting standards which require all sharebased payments to employees including grants of stock options and restricted stock units rsus to be measured based on the grant date fair value of the awards with the resulting expense generally recognized on a straightline basis over the period during which the employee is required to perform service in exchange for the award   

sharebased compensation expense is recorded net of estimated forfeitures in our consolidated statements of income and as such is recorded for only those sharebased awards that we expect to vest we estimate the forfeiture rate based on historical forfeitures of equity awards and adjust the rate to reflect changes in facts and circumstances if any we will revise our estimated forfeiture rate if actual forfeitures differ from our initial estimates 

we have historically issued unvested restricted shares to employee stockholders of certain acquired companies as these awards are generally subject to continued postacquisition employment we have accounted for them as postacquisition sharebased compensation expense we recognize compensation expense equal to the grant date fair value of the common stock on a straightline basis over the period during which the employee is required to perform service in exchange for the award 

loss contingencies 

we are involved in various lawsuits claims investigations and proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business certain of these matters include speculative claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts of damages we record a liability when we believe that it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated significant judgment is required to determine both probability and the estimated amount we review these provisions at least quarterly and adjust these provisions accordingly to reflect the impact of negotiations settlements rulings advice of legal counsel and updated information 

we believe that the amount or estimable range of reasonably possible loss will not either individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on our business consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows with respect to loss contingencies for legal and other contingencies as of december 31 2015  however the outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain therefore if one or more of these legal matters were resolved against us for amounts in excess of managements expectations our results of operations and financial condition including in a particular reporting period could be materially adversely affected 

business combinations and valuation of goodwill and other acquired intangible assets 

we allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired liabilities assumed and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values the excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill such valuations require management to make significant estimates and assumptions especially with respect to intangible assets significant estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from acquired users acquired technology and trade names from a market participant perspective useful lives and discount rates management’s estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and as a result actual results may differ from estimates during the measurement period which is one year from the acquisition date we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill upon the conclusion of the measurement period any subsequent adjustments are recorded to earnings 

we review goodwill for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances would more likely than not reduce the fair value of our single reporting unit below its carrying value we evaluate indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the asset is impaired as of december 31 2015  no impairment of goodwill or indefinitelived intangible assets has been identified 

acquired finitelived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives we evaluate the recoverability of our intangible assets for possible impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable the evaluation is performed at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities recoverability of these assets is measured by a comparison of the carrying amounts to the future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate if such review indicates that the carrying amount of property and equipment and intangible assets is not recoverable the carrying amount of such assets is reduced to fair value we have not recorded any significant impairment charges during the years presented 

in addition to the recoverability assessment we routinely review the remaining estimated useful lives of our finitelived intangible assets if we reduce the estimated useful life assumption for any asset the remaining unamortized balance would be amortized over the revised estimated useful life 

components of results of operations 

revenue 

advertising  we generate substantially all of our revenue from advertising our advertising revenue is generated by displaying ad products on facebook properties including our mobile applications and thirdparty affiliated websites or mobile applications marketers pay for ad products either directly or through their relationships with advertising agencies based on the number of clicks made by people the number of actions taken by people or the number of impressions delivered we recognize revenue from the delivery of clickbased ads in the period in which a person clicks on the content and actionbased ads in the period in which a person takes the action the marketer contracted for we recognize revenue from the display of impressionbased ads in the contracted period in which the impressions are delivered impressions are considered delivered when an ad is displayed to people the number of ads we show is subject to methodological changes as we continue to evolve our ads business and the structure of our ads products we calculate price per ad as total ad revenue divided by the number of ads delivered representing the effective price paid per impression by a marketer regardless of their desired objective such as impression click or action for advertising revenue arrangements where we are not the primary obligor we recognize revenue on a net basis 

payments and other fees  we enable payments from people to purchase virtual and digital goods from our developers people can transact and make payments on the facebook website by using debit and credit cards paypal mobile phone payments gift cards or other methods we receive a fee from developers when people make purchases in these applications using our payments infrastructure we recognize revenue net of amounts remitted to our developers we have mandated the use of our payments infrastructure for game applications on facebook and fees related to payments are generated almost exclusively from games our other fees revenue which has not been significant in recent periods consists primarily of revenue from our ad serving and measurement products and the delivery of virtual reality platform devices

revenue 



  

2015  compared to 2014  revenue in 2015  increased 546 billion  or 44  compared to 2014  the increase was primarily due to an increase in advertising revenue 

the most important factor driving advertising revenue growth was an increase in revenue from ads in news feed on mobile devices in 2015  we estimate that mobile advertising revenue represented approximately 77  of total advertising revenue as compared with approximately 65  in 2014  factors that influenced our mobile advertising revenue growth in 2015  included i an increase in demand for our ad inventory in part driven by an increase in the number of marketers actively advertising on facebook ii an increase in mobile user growth and engagement and iii an increase in the number and frequency of ads displayed in news feed as well as the quality relevance and performance of those ads 

in 2015  compared to 2014  the average price per ad increased by 140 and the number of ads delivered decreased by 38 the increase in average price per ad was driven by a product change related to certain nonnews feed ads during the third quarter of 2014 which decreased the number of ads displayed but increased the prominence of each ad average price per ad was also driven by a mix shift towards a greater percentage of our ads being shown in news feed the reduction in ads delivered was driven by factors including the product change described above as well as the shift in usage towards mobile devices where people are shown fewer ads as compared to personal computers 

advertising revenue in the fourth quarter of 2015  increased 57  compared to the same period in 2014  the increase in advertising revenue in the fourth quarter of 2015  was driven by the same factors that drove 2015  annual advertising revenue growth primarily an increase in revenue from ads in news feed on mobile devices for the fourth quarter of 2015  we estimate that mobile advertising revenue represented approximately 80  of total advertising revenue as compared with 69  in the same period in 2014  

advertising spending is traditionally seasonally strong in the fourth quarter of each year we believe that this seasonality in advertising spending affects our quarterly results which generally reflect significant growth in advertising revenue between the third and fourth quarters and a decline in advertising spending between the fourth and subsequent first quarters for instance our advertising revenue increased 31 22 and 30 between the third and fourth quarters of 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively while advertising revenue for the first quarters of 2015  and 2014  declined 8 and 3 compared to the fourth quarters of 2014  and 2013  respectively 

payments and other fees revenue in 2015  decreased 125 million  or 13  compared to 2014  the decrease in payments and other fees revenue was a result of decreased payments revenue from games played on personal computers partially offset by an increase in other fees revenue related to acquisitions closed in the second half of 2014 

payments and other fees revenue in the fourth quarter of 2015  decreased 53 million  or 21  compared to the same period in 2014  

payments and other fees revenue is currently based predominantly on payments revenue from games played on personal computers as users shift their usage to mobile devices facebook usage on personal computers has been declining and will continue to decline in the future resulting in a decline in our payments revenue 

2014  compared to 2013  revenue in 2014 increased 459 billion or 58 compared to 2013 the increase was due primarily to a 65  increase in advertising revenue during 2014 as compared to 2013 

the most important factor driving advertising revenue growth was an increase in revenue from ads in news feed on both mobile devices and personal computers news feed ads are displayed more prominently have significantly higher levels of engagement and a higher price per ad relative to our other ad placements in 2014 we estimate that mobile advertising revenue represented approximately 65 of total advertising revenue as compared with 45 in 2013 other factors that influenced our advertising revenue growth in 2014 included i an increase in the number of marketers actively advertising on facebook which we believe increased demand for our ad inventory ii other product changes to increase the value and performance of our ads and iii an increase in user growth and engagement 

in 2014 compared to 2013 the average price per ad increased by 173 and the number of ads delivered decreased by 40 the increase in average price per ad was driven by a product change related to certain nonnews feed ads during the third quarter of 2014 which decreased the number of ads displayed but increased the prominence of each ad average price per ad was also driven by a mix shift towards a greater percentage of our ads being shown in news feed the reduction in ads delivered was driven by factors including the product change described above as well as the shift in usage towards mobile devices where people are shown fewer ads as compared to personal computers 

payments and other fees revenue in 2014 increased 88 million or 10 compared to 2013 the increase in payments and other fees revenue is a result of increased revenue from our ad serving and measurement products and the delivery of virtual reality platform devices 

no customer represented 10 or more of total revenue during the years ended december 31 2015  2014  and 2013  

foreign exchange impact on revenue 

the general strengthening of the us dollar relative to certain foreign currencies primarily the euro from the fourth quarter of and full year 2014 to the same periods in 2015 had an unfavorable impact on our revenue if we had translated revenue for the fourth quarter of and full year 2015  using 2014 monthly exchange rates for our settlement currencies other than the us dollar our total revenue would have been 616 billion  and 1911 billion  respectively and our advertising revenue would have been 596 billion  and 1826 billion  respectively using these constant rates both revenue and advertising revenue would have been 322 million  and 119 billion  higher than actual revenue and advertising revenue for the fourth quarter of and full year 2015  respectively 

there were no material foreign exchange impacts on our revenue and advertising revenue from the full year 2013 to the same period in 2014 

cost of revenue 

  

  

2015  compared to 2014  cost of revenue in 2015  increased 714 million  or 33  compared to 2014  the increase was primarily due to an increase in operational expenses related to our data centers and technical infrastructure of 480 million compared to 2014  amortization of our intangible assets in 2015 also increased 100 million  compared to 2014  mostly due to the full year impact of acquisitions completed in the second half of 2014 

2014  compared to 2013  cost of revenue in 2014 increased 278 million or 15 compared to 2013 the increase was primarily due to operational expenses related to our data center and technical infrastructure and increased amortization of our intangible assets these increases were partially offset by items related to data center lease abandonment we reversed 34 million of lease abandonment expense in 2014 due to our decision to reoccupy and utilize a previously exited data center compared to a recognition of 117 million of lease abandonment expense in 2013 

in 2016  we anticipate that the cost of revenue will increase as we expand our data center capacity and technical infrastructure to support user growth increased user engagement and the delivery of new products and services 

research and development 



  

2015  compared to 2014  research and development expenses in 2015  increased 215 billion  or 81  compared to 2014  the majority of the increase was due to an increase in sharebased compensation expense of 102 billion  compared to 2014  which reflected the full year impact of sharebased compensation related to the acquisitions completed in the second half of 2014 in addition other payroll and benefits expense increased as a result of a 43  growth in employee headcount from december 31 2014  to december 31 2015  in engineering and other technical functions 

2014  compared to 2013   research and development expenses in 2014 increased 125 billion or 88 compared to 2013 the increase was primarily due to an increase of 724 million in sharebased compensation expense compared to 2013 and an increase in other payroll and benefits expense resulting from a 48 growth in employee headcount from december 31 2013 to december 31 2014 in engineering and other technical functions sharebased compensation expense also increased due to the acquisitions we completed in 2014 

in 2016  we plan to continue hiring software engineers and other technical employees and increasing our investment to support our research and development initiatives 

marketing and sales 



  

2015  compared to 2014   marketing and sales expenses in 2015  increased 105 billion  or 62  compared to 2014  the majority of the increase was due to increases in amortization of our intangible assets of 305 million  due to the full year impact of acquisitions completed in the second half of 2014 and in payroll and benefits expenses as a result of a 32  increase in employee headcount from december 31 2014  to december 31 2015  in our marketing and sales functions additionally our marketing expenses increased 258 million in 2015 compared to 2014 

2014  compared to 2013  marketing and sales expenses in 2014 increased 683 million or 69 compared to 2013 the increase was primarily due to an increase in payroll and benefits expenses resulting from a 44 increase in employee headcount from december 31 2013 to december 31 2014 in our marketing and sales functions our marketing expenses also increased 150 million in 2014 compared to 2013 additionally sharebased compensation expense also increased 116 million compared to 2013 

in 2016  we plan to continue to increase our investment and hire marketing and sales employees to support our marketing efforts 

general and administrative 



  

2015  compared to 2014  general and administrative expenses in 2015  increased 322 million  or 33  compared to 2014  the increase was primarily due to an increase in payroll and benefits expenses as a result of a 36  increase in employee headcount from december 31 2014  to december 31 2015  in general and administrative functions including an increase of 20 million  in sharebased compensation expense in 2015  and to a lesser extent higher legal and other professional services fees 

2014  compared to 2013  general and administrative expenses in 2014 increased 192 million or 25 compared to 2013 the increase was primarily due to an increase in payroll and benefits expenses resulting from a 55 increase in employee headcount in general and administrative functions sharebased compensation expense also increased 71 million compared to 2013 additionally professional services expense in 2014 also increased 58 million primarily due to higher consulting and other professional service fees 

in 2016  we plan to increase general and administrative employee headcount to support overall company growth 

interest and other incomeexpense net 



  

2015  compared to 2014  interest and other incomeexpense net in 2015  increased 53 million  or 63  compared to 2014  other incomeexpense net increased primarily due to a decrease in foreign exchange losses resulting from the periodic remeasurement of our foreign currency balances in addition interest incomeexpense net increased due to higher invested cash balances and interest rates 

2014  compared to 2013  interest and other incomeexpense net in 2014 decreased 34 million or 68 compared to 2013 other incomeexpense net decreased primarily due to 87 million in foreign exchange losses resulting from the periodic remeasurement of our foreign currency balances the decrease in other incomeexpense net was partially offset by a decrease in interest expense due to the repayment of our longterm debt in august 2013 and lower capital lease payments 

provision for income taxes 



  

2015  compared to 2014  our provision for income taxes in 2015  increased 536 million  or 27  compared to 2014 primarily due to an increase in income before provision for income taxes our effective tax rate in 2015  remained flat compared to 2014  

our effective tax rate differs from the us statutory rate primarily because of the impact of acquiring intellectual property and integrating it into our business nondeductible sharebased compensation operations in jurisdictions with tax rates lower than the us and tax research credits our effective tax rate in the future will depend on the portion of our profits earned within and outside the united states which will also be affected by our methodologies for valuing our intellectual property and intercompany transactions our future effective tax rate will also be affected by the timing size and integration of any acquisitions we make 

on july 27 2015 the united states tax court issued an opinion in altera corp v commissioner  related to the treatment of sharebased compensation expense in an intercompany costsharing arrangement this opinion concluded that related parties in a costsharing arrangement are not required to share sharebased compensation a final decision was issued by the tax court however this decision may be appealed by the commissioner the impact of the conclusions stated by the tax court in its opinion was not material to our consolidated financial statements 

2014  compared to 2013   our provision for income taxes in 2014 increased 716 million or 57 compared to 2013 primarily due to an increase in income before provision for income taxes our effective tax rate differs from the statutory rate due to nondeductible sharebased compensation operations in jurisdictions with tax rates lower than the us and tax research credits our effective tax rate decreased primarily due to a change in our geographic mix of pretax income 

quarterly results of operations data 

the following tables set forth our unaudited quarterly consolidated statements of income data in dollars and as a percentage of total revenue for each of the eight quarters in the period ended december 31 2015  we have prepared the quarterly consolidated statements of income data on a basis consistent with the audited consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data in this annual report on form 10k in the opinion of management the financial information reflects all adjustments consisting only of normal recurring adjustments which we consider necessary for a fair presentation of this data this information should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included in part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data in this annual report on form 10k the results of historical periods are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations for any future period 

  

sharebased compensation expense included in costs and expenses 



1 total costs and expenses increased in the fourth quarter of 2014 compared to the third quarter of 2014 primarily due to increases in sharebased compensation expense and amortization of intangible assets related to our acquisitions 



sharebased compensation expense included in costs and expenses 



liquidity and capital resources 



our principal sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents marketable securities and cash generated from operations cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities consist primarily of cash on deposit with banks investments in money market funds and investments in us government securities us government agency securities and corporate debt securities cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities were 1843 billion  as of december 31 2015  an increase of 724 billion  from december 31 2014  primarily due to 860 billion  of cash generated from operations and 172 billion  in excess tax benefits from sharebased award activity partially offset by 252 billion  for purchases of property and equipment and 313 million  for acquisitions of businesses and other assets 

cash paid for income taxes net of refunds was 270 million  for the year ended december 31 2015  as of december 31 2015  our federal net operating loss carryforward was 270 billion  although we anticipate only a relatively small portion of this will be available to offset our federal taxable income in 2016 as of december 31 2015  we had 108 billion  of federal tax credits substantially all of which will be available to offset our federal tax liabilities in 2016 we expect that the amount of cash paid for income taxes to significantly increase in 2016 

in august 2013 we entered into a fiveyear senior unsecured revolving credit facility 2013 revolving credit facility that allows us to borrow up to 65 billion to fund working capital and general corporate purposes with interest payable on the borrowed amounts set at libor plus 10 as well as an annual commitment fee of 010 on the daily undrawn balance of the facility we paid origination fees at closing of the 2013 revolving credit facility which fees are being amortized over the term of the facility any amounts outstanding under this facility will be due and payable on august 15 2018 as of december 31 2015  no amounts had been drawn down and we were in compliance with the covenants under this credit facility 

as of december 31 2015  190 billion  of the 1843 billion  in cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities was held by our foreign subsidiaries substantially all of these funds are in jurisdictions for which we are indefinitely reinvesting the earnings of the local subsidiary we have provided residual taxes in jurisdictions where we do not intend to indefinitely reinvest the earnings of the local subsidiary however the amount of taxes provided has been insignificant 

we currently anticipate that our available funds credit facility and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our operational cash needs for the foreseeable future 

cash provided by operating activities 

cash flow from operating activities during 2015  mostly consisted of net income adjusted for certain noncash items such as sharebased compensation expense of 296 billion  and total depreciation and amortization of 195 billion  the increase in cash flow from operating activities during 2015  compared to 2014  was primarily due to an increase in net income as adjusted for sharebased compensation expense and higher income tax payable as of december 31 2015 compared to 2014 

cash flow from operating activities during 2014 primarily consisted of net income adjusted for certain noncash items such as sharebased compensation expense of 179 billion and total depreciation and amortization of 124 billion the cash flow from operating activities during 2014 compared to 2013 increased mainly due to an increase in net income of 144 billion as adjusted for certain noncash items described above partially offset by a decrease in income tax refunds of 415 million 

cash flow from operating activities during 2013 primarily consisted of net income adjusted for certain noncash items such as depreciation and amortization of 101 billion and sharebased compensation expense of 906 million and an increase in other liabilities related to uncertain tax positions the cash flow from operating activities during 2013 compared to 2012 increased mainly due to an increase in net income of 145 billion and uncertain tax position of 786 million in addition we received income tax refunds of 421 million in 2013 

cash used in investing activities 

cash used in investing activities was 943 billion  during 2015  primarily due to 670 billion  for net purchases of marketable securities and 252 billion  for capital expenditures as we continued to invest in servers data centers network infrastructure and office buildings the increase in cash used in investing activities during 2015  compared to 2014  was mainly due to increases in net purchases of marketable securities partially offset by a decrease in acquisitions of businesses and purchases of intangible assets 

cash used in investing activities during 2014 primarily resulted from 498 billion for the acquisition of businesses and 183 billion for capital expenditures related to network infrastructure and the construction of data centers and office buildings partially offset by 124 billion for the net sales and maturities of marketable securities the increase in cash used in investing activities during 2014 compared to 2013 was mainly due to increases in acquisitions of businesses and purchases of intangible assets and capital expenditures partially offset by net sales of marketable securities 

cash used in investing activities during 2013 primarily resulted from 136 billion for capital expenditures related to the purchase of servers network infrastructure and the construction of data centers as well as 882 million for the net purchase of marketable securities and 368 million for the acquisition of businesses and other assets such as patents the decrease in cash used in investing activities during 2013 compared to 2012 was mainly due to decreases in the purchase of marketable securities and the acquisitions of businesses and purchases of intangible assets 

we anticipate making capital expenditures in 2016  of approximately 40 billion to 45 billion 

cash provided by used in financing activities 

cash flow from financing activities during 2015  mostly consisted of excess tax benefit from sharebased award activity and principal payments on capital lease obligations the increase in cash provided by financing activities was mostly due to lower principal payments related to our capital lease transactions and lower tax payments related to the net share settlement partially offset by a decrease of excess tax benefit from sharebased award activity 

cash provided by financing activities during 2014 was 157 billion which primarily resulted from 187 billion of excess tax benefit from sharebased award activity partially offset by 243 million of payments related to our capital lease transactions and 73 million of tax payments related to net share settlement resulting mainly from the vested merger consideration of an acquisition 

cash used in financing activities during 2013 was 667 million which primarily resulted from 150 billion for repayment of debt and 889 million of tax payments related to the net share settlement partially offset by 148 billion in net proceeds from the completion of our followon equity offering in december 2013 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we did not have any offbalance sheet arrangements as of december 31 2015  

contractual obligations 

our principal commitments consist of obligations under operating and capital leases for equipment office and data center facilities the following table summarizes our commitments to settle contractual obligations in cash as of december 31 2015  in millions 



 in addition our other liabilities include 246 billion  related to uncertain tax positions as of december 31 2015  due to uncertainties in the timing of the completion of tax audits the timing of the resolution of these positions is uncertain and we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years beyond 12 months as a result this amount is not included in the above contractual obligations table 

contingencies 

we are involved in claims lawsuits government investigations and other legal proceedings we record a provision for a liability when we believe that it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and that the amount can be reasonably estimated significant judgment is required to determine both probability and the estimated amount such legal proceedings are inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties some of which are beyond our control should any of these estimates and assumptions change or prove to be incorrect it could have a material impact on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

see note 10 of the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data and part i item 3 legal proceedings of this annual report on form 10k for additional information regarding these contingencies

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend we are exposed to market risks including changes to foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and inflation 

foreign currency exchange risk 

we have foreign currency risks related to our revenue and operating expenses denominated in currencies other than the us dollar primarily the euro in general we are a net receiver of currencies other than the us dollar accordingly changes in exchange rates and in particular a strengthening of the us dollar have negatively affected our revenue and other operating results as expressed in us dollars 

we have experienced and will continue to experience fluctuations in our net income as a result of transaction gains or losses related to revaluing certain current asset and current liability balances that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the entities in which they are recorded at this time we have not entered into but in the future we may enter into derivatives or other financial instruments in an attempt to hedge our foreign currency exchange risk it is difficult to predict the effect hedging activities would have on our results of operations we recognized foreign currency losses of 66 million  87 million  and 14 million  in 2015  2014  and 2013  respectively 

interest rate sensitivity 

our exposure to changes in interest rates relates primarily to interest earned and market value on our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities 

our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities consist of cash certificates of deposit time deposits money market funds us government securities us government agency securities and corporate debt securities  our investment policy and strategy are focused on preservation of capital and supporting our liquidity requirements changes in us interest rates affect the interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities and the market value of those securities a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would have resulted in a decrease of 173 million  and 63 million  in the market value of our availableforsale debt securities as of december 31 2015  and december 31 2014  respectively any realized gains or losses resulting from such interest rate changes would only occur if we sold the investments prior to maturity

government regulation 

we are subject to a number of us federal and state and foreign laws and regulations that affect companies conducting business on the internet many of these laws and regulations are still evolving and being tested in courts and could be interpreted in ways that could harm our business these may involve user privacy rights of publicity data protection content intellectual property distribution electronic contracts and other communications competition protection of minors consumer protection telecommunications product liability taxation economic or other trade prohibitions or sanctions securities law compliance and online payment services in particular we are subject to federal state and foreign laws regarding privacy and protection of peoples data foreign data protection privacy and other laws and regulations can be more restrictive than those in the united states us federal and state and foreign laws and regulations are constantly evolving and can be subject to significant change in addition the application interpretation and enforcement of these laws and regulations are often uncertain particularly in the new and rapidlyevolving industry in which we operate and may be interpreted and applied inconsistently from country to country and inconsistently with our current policies and practices there are also a number of legislative proposals pending before the us congress various state legislative bodies and foreign governments concerning privacy and data protection which could affect us for example the european commission is currently considering a data protection regulation that may include operational requirements for companies that receive personal data that are different than those currently in place in the european union and that may also include significant penalties for noncompliance 

in august 2012 the ftc approved a settlement agreement with us to resolve an investigation into various practices that among other things requires us to complete biannual independent privacy assessments and to establish and refine certain practices with respect to treatment of peoples information and the privacy settings we offer violation of existing or future regulatory orders or consent decrees could subject us to substantial monetary fines and other penalties that could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations 

various laws and regulations in the united states and abroad such as the us bank secrecy act the doddfrank act the usa patriot act and the credit card act impose certain antimoney laundering requirements on companies that are financial institutions or that provide financial products and services under these laws and regulations financial institutions are broadly defined to include money services businesses such as money transmitters check cashers and sellers or issuers of stored value or prepaid access products requirements imposed on financial institutions under these laws include customer identification and verification programs record retention policies and procedures and transaction reporting to increase flexibility in how our use of payments may evolve and to mitigate regulatory uncertainty we have received certain money transmitter licenses in the united states and are applying for or expect to apply for certain regulatory licenses in europe which will generally require us to demonstrate compliance with many domestic and foreign laws relating to money transmission gift cards and other prepaid access instruments electronic funds transfers antimoney laundering counterterrorist financing gambling banking and lending financial privacy and data security and import and export restrictions

 item 1a 

risk factors 

tableend certain factors may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations you should consider carefully the risks and uncertainties described below in addition to other information contained in this annual report on form 10k including our consolidated financial statements and related notes the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of or that we currently believe are not material may also become important factors that adversely affect our business if any of the following risks actually occurs our business financial condition results of operations and future prospects could be materially and adversely affected in that event the trading price of our class a common stock could decline and you could lose part or all of your investment 

risks related to our business and industry 

if we fail to retain existing users or add new users or if our users decrease their level of engagement with our products our revenue financial results and business may be significantly harmed 

the size of our user base and our users level of engagement are critical to our success our financial performance has been and will continue to be significantly determined by our success in adding retaining and engaging active users we anticipate that our active user growth rate will continue to decline over time as the size of our active user base increases and as we achieve higher market penetration rates if people do not perceive our products to be useful reliable and trustworthy we may not be able to attract or retain users or otherwise maintain or increase the frequency and duration of their engagement a number of other social networking companies that achieved early popularity have since seen their active user bases or levels of engagement decline in some cases precipitously there is no guarantee that we will not experience a similar erosion of our active user base or engagement levels our user engagement patterns have changed over time and user engagement can be difficult to measure particularly as users continue to engage increasingly via mobile devices and as we introduce new and different products and services any number of factors could potentially negatively affect user retention growth and engagement including if 

 9 

parties or otherwise 

 if we are unable to maintain or increase our user base and user engagement our revenue and financial results may be adversely affected any decrease in user retention growth or engagement could render our products less attractive to users marketers and developers which is likely to have a material and adverse impact on our revenue business financial condition and results of operations if our active user growth rate continues to slow we will become increasingly dependent on our ability to maintain or increase levels of user engagement and monetization in order to drive revenue growth 

we generate a substantial majority of our revenue from advertising the loss of marketers or reduction in spending by marketers with facebook could seriously harm our business 

the substantial majority of our revenue is currently generated from third parties advertising on facebook for 2014 2013 and 2012 advertising accounted for 92  89  and 84  respectively of our revenue as is common in the industry our marketers do not have longterm advertising commitments with us many of our marketers spend only a relatively small portion of their overall advertising budget with us we expect our ability to grow advertising revenue will continue to be dependent on our ability to generate revenue from ads displayed on mobile devices in addition marketers may view some of our products as experimental and unproven marketers will not continue to do business with us or they will reduce the prices they are willing to pay to advertise with us or the budgets they are willing to commit to us if we do not deliver ads in an effective manner or if they do not believe that their investment in advertising with us will generate a competitive return relative to other alternatives our advertising revenue could be adversely affected by a number of other factors including 

 10 

 the occurrence of any of these or other factors could result in a reduction in demand for our ads which may reduce the prices we receive for our ads or cause marketers to stop advertising with us altogether either of which would negatively affect our revenue and financial results 

we generate a significant portion of our revenue from mobile advertising mobile advertising is evolving and growth in the use of facebook through our mobile products as a substitute for use on personal computers may negatively affect our revenue and financial results 

facebook had 119 billion  mobile monthly active users maus in december 2014 we anticipate that growth in mobile users will continue to be the driver of our growth for the foreseeable future and that usage through personal computers will continue to decline worldwide we generate a significant portion of our revenue from mobile advertising which comprised approximately 69  of our overall advertising revenue in the fourth quarter of 2014 while our mobile advertising revenue continues to grow the mobile advertising market remains an evolving market if users continue to access facebook mobile products as a substitute for access through personal computers and if we are unable to continue to grow mobile revenue or unable to continue to successfully monetize mobile users or if we incur excessive expenses in these efforts our financial performance and ability to grow revenue would be negatively affected 

our user growth engagement and monetization on mobile devices depend upon effective operation with mobile operating systems networks and standards that we do not control 

there is no guarantee that popular mobile devices will continue to feature facebook or our other products or that mobile device users will continue to use our products rather than competing products we are dependent on the interoperability of facebook and our other products with popular mobile operating systems networks and standards that we do not control such as the android and ios operating systems and any changes in such systems our relationships with mobile operating system partners handset manufacturers or mobile carriers or in their terms of service or policies that degrade our products functionality reduce or eliminate our ability to distribute our products give preferential treatment to competitive products limit our ability to deliver target or measure the effectiveness of ads or impose fees or other charges related to our delivery of ads could adversely affect facebook usage and monetization on mobile devices additionally in order to deliver high quality mobile products it is important that our products work well with a range of mobile technologies systems networks and standards that we do not control and that we have good relationships with handset manufacturers and mobile carriers we may not be successful in maintaining or developing relationships with key participants in the mobile industry or in developing products that operate effectively with these technologies systems networks or standards in the event that it is more difficult for our users to access and use facebook or our other products on their mobile devices or if our users choose not to access or use facebook or our other products on their mobile devices or use mobile products that do not offer access to facebook or our other products our user growth and user engagement could be harmed from time to time we may also take actions regarding the distribution of our products or the operation of our business based on what we believe to be in our longterm best interests such actions may adversely affect our relationships with the operators of mobile operating systems handset manufacturers mobile carriers or other business partners and there is no assurance that these actions will result in the anticipated longterm benefits in the event that our relationships with such third parties deteriorate our user growth engagement and monetization could be adversely affected and our business could be harmed 

our business is highly competitive competition presents an ongoing threat to the success of our business 

we face significant competition in every aspect of our business including from companies that provide tools to facilitate the sharing of information companies that enable marketers to display advertising and companies that provide development platforms for applications developers we compete with companies that offer fullfeatured products that replicate the range of communications and related capabilities we provide these offerings include for example google which google has integrated with certain of its products including search and android as well as other largely regional social networks that have strong positions in particular countries we also compete with companies that develop applications particularly mobile applications that provide social or other communications functionality such as messaging photo and videosharing and microblogging and companies that provide web and mobilebased information and entertainment products and services that are designed to engage users and capture time spent online and on mobile devices in addition we face competition from traditional online and mobile businesses that provide media for marketers to reach their audiences andor   develop tools and systems for managing and optimizing advertising campaigns 

some of our current and potential competitors may have significantly greater resources or better competitive positions in certain product segments geographic regions or user demographics than we do these factors may allow our competitors to respond more effectively than us to new or emerging technologies and changes in market conditions we believe that some of our users particularly our younger users are aware of and actively engaging with other products and services similar to or as a substitute for facebook 

products and services and we believe that some of our users have reduced their engagement with facebook in favor of increased engagement with these other products and services in the event that our users increasingly engage with other products and services we may experience a decline in user engagement in key user demographics or more broadly in which our business would likely be harmed 

our competitors may develop products features or services that are similar to ours or that achieve greater acceptance may undertake more farreaching and successful product development efforts or marketing campaigns or may adopt more aggressive pricing policies in addition developers whose mobile and web applications are integrated with facebook may use information shared by our users through facebook in order to develop products or features that compete with us certain competitors including google could use strong or dominant positions in one or more markets to gain competitive advantage against us in areas where we operate including by integrating competing social networking platforms or features into products they control such as mobile device operating systems search engines or web browsers by making acquisitions by limiting or denying our access to advertising measurement or delivery systems by limiting our ability to deliver target or measure the effectiveness of ads by imposing fees or other charges related to our delivery of ads or by making access to our products more difficult as a result our competitors may acquire and engage users or generate advertising or other revenue at the expense of our own efforts which may negatively affect our business and financial results 

we believe that our ability to compete effectively depends upon many factors both within and beyond our control including 

 if we are not able to compete effectively our user base and level of user engagement may decrease we may become less attractive to developers and marketers and our revenue and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected 

action by governments to restrict access to facebook or our other products in their countries could substantially harm our business and financial results 

it is possible that governments of one or more countries may seek to censor content available on facebook or our other products in their country restrict access to our products from their country entirely or impose other restrictions that may affect the accessibility of our products in their country for an extended period of time or indefinitely for example access to facebook has been or is currently restricted in whole or in part in china iran and north korea in addition government authorities in other countries may seek to restrict access to our products if they consider us to be in violation of their laws in the event that content shown on facebook or our other products is subject to censorship access to our products is restricted in whole or in part in one or more countries or other restrictions are imposed on our products or our competitors are able to successfully penetrate geographic markets that we cannot access or where we face other restrictions our ability to retain or increase our user base and user engagement may be adversely affected we may not be able to maintain or grow our revenue as anticipated and our financial results could be adversely affected 

our new products and changes to existing products could fail to attract or retain users or generate revenue 

our ability to retain increase and engage our user base and to increase our revenue depends heavily on our ability to create successful new products both independently and in conjunction with developers or other third parties we may introduce significant changes to our existing products or acquire or introduce new and unproven products including using technologies with which we have little or no prior development or operating experience for example in july 2014 we completed our acquisition of oculus vr inc oculus a company developing virtual reality technology we do not have prior experience with consumer hardware products or virtual reality technology which may adversely affect our ability to successfully develop and market oculus products or technology in addition in october 2014 we acquired whatsapp inc whatsapp a crossplatform mobile messaging company we currently monetize whatsapp in only a very limited fashion and we may not be successful in our efforts to generate meaningful revenue from whatsapp over the long term if these or other new or enhanced products fail to engage users marketers or developers or if we are unsuccessful in our monetization efforts we may fail to attract or retain users or to generate sufficient revenue operating margin or other value to justify our investments and our business may be adversely affected 

we prioritize user growth and engagement and the user experience over shortterm financial results 

we frequently make product decisions that may reduce our shortterm revenue or profitability if we believe that the decisions are consistent with our mission and benefit the aggregate user experience and will thereby improve our financial performance over the long term for example from time to time we may change the size frequency or relative prominence of ads in order to improve ad quality and overall user experience similarly from time to time we update our news feed ranking algorithm to deliver the most relevant content to our users which may adversely affect the distribution of content of marketers and developers and could reduce their incentive to invest in their development and marketing efforts on facebook we also may introduce changes to existing products or introduce new standalone products that direct users away from properties where we have a proven means of monetization for example we have taken action to redirect users who send messages from within the facebook application to our standalone messenger application although we currently do not monetize the standalone messenger application in addition we plan to focus on growing the user base for instagram whatsapp and potentially other standalone applications that may have limited or no nearterm monetization and it is possible that these efforts may reduce engagement with the core facebook application we also may take steps that result in limiting distribution of mobile products and services in the short term in order to attempt to ensure the availability of our products and services to users over the long term these decisions may not produce the longterm benefits that we expect in which case our user growth and engagement our relationships with marketers and developers and our business and results of operations could be harmed 

if we are not able to maintain and enhance our brands or if events occur that damage our reputation and brands our ability to expand our base of users marketers and developers may be impaired and our business and financial results may be harmed 

we believe that our brands have significantly contributed to the success of our business we also believe that maintaining and enhancing our brands is critical to expanding our base of users marketers and developers many of our new users are referred by existing users maintaining and enhancing our brands will depend largely on our ability to continue to provide useful reliable trustworthy and innovative products which we may not do successfully we may introduce new products or terms of service or policies that users do not like which may negatively affect our brands additionally the actions of our developers may affect our brand if users do not have a positive experience using thirdparty mobile and web applications integrated with facebook we will also continue to experience media legislative or regulatory scrutiny of our decisions regarding user privacy and other issues which may adversely affect our reputation and brands we also may fail to provide adequate customer service which could erode confidence in our brands our brands may also be negatively affected by the actions of users that are deemed to be hostile or inappropriate to other users or by users acting under false or inauthentic identities by perceived or actual efforts by governments to obtain access to user information for securityrelated purposes or by the use of our products or services for illicit objectionable or illegal ends maintaining and enhancing our brands may require us to make substantial investments and these investments may not be successful certain of our past actions have eroded confidence in our brands and if we fail to successfully promote and maintain our brands or if we incur excessive expenses in this effort our business and financial results may be adversely affected 

security breaches and improper access to or disclosure of our data or user data or other hacking and phishing attacks on our systems could harm our reputation and adversely affect our business 

our industry is prone to cyber attacks with third parties seeking unauthorized access to our data or users’ data   any failure to prevent or mitigate security breaches and improper access to or disclosure of our data or user data could result in the loss or misuse of such data which could harm our business and reputation and diminish our competitive position in addition computer malware viruses and hacking and phishing attacks by third parties have become more prevalent in our industry have occurred on our systems in the past and may occur on our systems in the future as a result of our prominence we believe that we are a particularly attractive target for such breaches and attacks such attacks may cause interruptions to the services we provide degrade the user experience or cause users to lose confidence in our products our efforts to protect our company data or the information we receive may also be unsuccessful due to software bugs or other technical malfunctions employee error or malfeasance government surveillance or other factors in addition third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or users to disclose information in order to gain access to our data or our users data although we have developed systems and processes that are designed to protect our data and user data and to prevent data loss and other security breaches we cannot assure you that such measures will provide absolute security 

in addition some of our developers or other partners such as those that help us measure the effectiveness of ads may receive or store information provided by us or by our users through mobile or web applications integrated with facebook we provide limited information to such third parties based on the scope of services provided to us however if these third parties or developers fail to adopt or adhere to adequate data security practices or in the event of a breach of their networks our users data may be improperly accessed used or disclosed 

affected users or government authorities could initiate legal or regulatory actions against us in connection with any security breaches which could cause us to incur significant expense and liability or result in orders or consent decrees forcing us to modify our business practices any of these events could have a material and adverse effect on our business reputation or financial results 

unfavorable media coverage could negatively affect our business 

we receive a high degree of media coverage around the world unfavorable publicity regarding for example our privacy practices terms of service product changes product quality litigation or regulatory activity government surveillance the actions of our developers whose products are integrated with facebook the use of our products or services for illicit objectionable or illegal ends the actions of our users or the actions of other companies that provide similar services to us could adversely affect our reputation such negative publicity also could have an adverse effect on the size engagement and loyalty of our user base and result in decreased revenue which could adversely affect our business and financial results 

our financial results will fluctuate from quarter to quarter and are difficult to predict 

our quarterly financial results have fluctuated in the past and will fluctuate in the future additionally we have a limited operating history with the current scale of our business which makes it difficult to forecast our future results as a result you should not rely upon our past quarterly financial results as indicators of future performance you should take into account the risks and uncertainties frequently encountered by companies in rapidly evolving markets our financial results in any given quarter can be influenced by numerous factors many of which we are unable to predict or are outside of our control including 

 14 

 we expect our rates of growth to decline in the future 

we expect that our user growth and revenue growth rates will decline over time as the size of our active user base increases and as we achieve greater market penetration for example the growth rate of facebooks maus declined from 25 from 2011 to 2012 to 16 from 2012 to 2013 to 13  from 2013 to 2014 historically our user growth has been a primary driver of growth in our revenue in addition we expect our revenue growth rate will generally decline over time as our revenue increases to higher levels as our growth rates decline investors perceptions of our business may be adversely affected and the trading price of our class a common stock could decline 

our costs are continuing to grow which could harm our business and profitability 

operating our business is costly and we expect our expenses to continue to increase in the future as we broaden our user base as users increase the number of connections and amount of data they share with us as we develop and implement new products and as we continue to hire additional employees to support our expanding operations historically our costs have increased each year due to these factors and we expect to continue to incur increasing costs in particular for servers storage power data centers security systems and talent to support our anticipated future growth we expect to continue to invest in these and other efforts to operate and expand our business around the world including in countries andor projects where we may not have a clear path to monetization such as our commitment to the internetorg initiative to increase global internet access our costs will increase as a result of integrating and operating larger and more complex business acquisitions including our recent acquisitions of oculus and whatsapp in addition we intend to increase marketing sales and other operating expenses in order to continue to grow and expand our operations and to remain competitive increases in our costs may adversely affect our business and profitability our expenses are expected to grow faster than our revenue in the near term and may be greater than we anticipate and our investments may not be successful 

our business is subject to complex and evolving us and foreign laws and regulations regarding privacy data protection and other matters many of these laws and regulations are subject to change and uncertain interpretation and could result in claims changes to our business practices monetary penalties increased cost of operations or declines in user growth or engagement or otherwise harm our business 

we are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the united states and abroad that involve matters central to our business including privacy and data protection rights of publicity content intellectual property advertising marketing distribution data security data retention and deletion personal information electronic contracts and other communications competition protection of minors consumer protection telecommunications product liability taxation economic or other trade prohibitions or sanctions securities law compliance and online payment services the introduction of new products or expansion of our activities in certain jurisdictions may subject us to additional laws and regulations in addition foreign data protection privacy and other laws and regulations can be more restrictive than those in the united states these us federal and state and foreign laws and regulations which can be enforced by private parties or government entities are constantly evolving and can be subject to significant change in addition the application interpretation and enforcement of these laws and regulations are often uncertain particularly in the new and rapidly evolving industry in which we operate and may be interpreted and applied inconsistently from country to country and inconsistently with our current policies and practices for example the interpretation of some laws and regulations that govern the use of names and likenesses in connection with advertising and marketing activities is unsettled and developments in this area could affect the manner in which we design our products and offer services similarly any regulatory or legislative action affecting the manner in which we display content to our users could adversely affect user growth and engagement a number of proposals are pending before federal state and foreign legislative and regulatory bodies that could significantly affect our business for example the european commission is currently considering a data protection regulation that may include operational requirements for companies that receive personal data that are different than those currently in place in the european union and that may also include significant penalties for noncompliance similarly there are a number of legislative proposals in the united states at both the federal and state level that could impose new obligations in areas affecting our business such as privacy or liability for copyright infringement by third parties in addition some countries are considering or have passed legislation requiring local storage and processing of data or similar requirements that could increase the cost and complexity of delivering our services these existing and proposed laws and regulations can be costly to comply with and can delay or impede the development of new products result in negative publicity increase our operating costs require significant management time and attention and subject us to inquiries or investigations claims or other remedies including fines or demands that we modify or cease existing business practices 

we have been subject to regulatory investigations and settlements and we expect to continue to be subject to such proceedings in the future which could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner materially adverse to our business 

from time to time we receive formal and informal inquiries from government authorities and regulators regarding our compliance with laws and other matters we expect to continue to be the subject of investigations and audits in the future as we continue to grow and expand our operations violation of existing or future regulatory orders or consent decrees could subject us to substantial monetary fines and other penalties that could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations in addition it is possible that future orders issued by or inquiries or enforcement actions initiated by government or regulatory authorities could cause us to incur substantial costs expose us to unanticipated civil and criminal liability or penalties or require us to change our business practices in a manner materially adverse to our business 

if we are unable to protect our intellectual property the value of our brands and other intangible assets may be diminished and our business may be adversely affected 

we rely and expect to continue to rely on a combination of confidentiality assignment and license agreements with our employees consultants and third parties with whom we have relationships as well as trademark copyright patent trade secret and domain name protection laws to protect our proprietary rights in the united states and internationally we have filed various applications for protection of certain aspects of our intellectual property and we currently hold a number of issued patents in multiple jurisdictions and have acquired patents and patent applications from third parties in addition in the future we may acquire additional patents or patent portfolios which could require significant cash expenditures third parties may knowingly or unknowingly infringe our proprietary rights third parties may challenge proprietary rights held by us and pending and future trademark and patent applications may not be approved in addition effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which we operate or intend to operate our business in any or all of these cases we may be required to expend significant time and expense in order to prevent infringement or to enforce our rights although we have generally taken measures to protect our proprietary rights there can be no assurance that others will not offer products or concepts that are substantially similar to ours and compete with our business in addition we regularly contribute software source code under open source licenses and have made other technology we developed available under other open licenses and we include open source software in our products for example we have contributed certain specifications and designs related to our data center equipment to the open compute project foundation a nonprofit entity that shares and develops such information with the technology community under the open web foundation license as a result of our open source contributions and the use of open source in our products we may license or be required to license or disclose code andor innovations that turn out to be material to our business and may also be exposed to increased litigation risk if the protection of our proprietary rights is inadequate to prevent unauthorized use or appropriation by third parties the value of our brands and other intangible assets may be diminished and competitors may be able to more effectively mimic our products services and methods of operations any of these events could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results 

we are currently and expect to be in the future party to patent lawsuits and other intellectual property rights claims that are expensive and time consuming and if resolved adversely could have a significant impact on our business financial condition or results of operations 

companies in the internet technology and media industries own large numbers of patents copyrights trademarks and trade secrets and frequently enter into litigation based on allegations of infringement misappropriation or other violations of intellectual property or other rights in addition various nonpracticing entities that own patents and other intellectual property rights often attempt to aggressively assert their rights in order to extract value from technology companies furthermore from time to time we may introduce or acquire new products including in areas where we historically have not competed which could increase our exposure to patent and other intellectual property claims from competitors and nonpracticing entities 

from time to time we receive notice letters from patent holders alleging that certain of our products and services infringe their patent rights we presently are involved in a number of intellectual property lawsuits and as we face increasing competition and gain an increasingly high profile we expect the number of patent and other intellectual property claims against us to grow defending patent and other intellectual property litigation is costly and can impose a significant burden on management and employees and there can be no assurances that favorable final outcomes will be obtained in all cases in addition plaintiffs may seek and we may become subject to preliminary or provisional rulings in the course of any such litigation including potential preliminary injunctions requiring us to cease some or all of our operations we may decide to settle such lawsuits and disputes on terms that are unfavorable to us similarly if any litigation to which we are a party is resolved adversely we may be subject to an unfavorable judgment that may not be reversed upon appeal the terms of such a settlement or judgment may require us to cease some or all of our operations or pay substantial amounts to the other party in addition we may have to seek a license to continue practices found to be in violation of a third partys rights which may not be available on reasonable terms or at all and may significantly increase our operating costs and expenses as a result we may also be required to develop alternative noninfringing technology or practices or discontinue the practices the development of alternative noninfringing technology or practices could require significant effort and expense or may not be feasible our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected as a result of an unfavorable resolution of the disputes and litigation referred to above 

we are involved in numerous class action lawsuits and other litigation matters that are expensive and time consuming and if resolved adversely could harm our business financial condition or results of operations 

in addition to intellectual property claims we are also involved in numerous other lawsuits including putative class action lawsuits many of which claim statutory damages andor seek significant changes to our business operations and we anticipate that we will continue to be a target for numerous lawsuits in the future because facebook has over a billion users the plaintiffs in class action cases filed against us typically claim enormous monetary damages even if the alleged peruser harm is small or nonexistent in addition following our acquisition of oculus we may be subject to additional class action lawsuits based on product performance or other claims related to the use of consumer hardware and software as well as virtual reality technology and products which are new 

and unproven any negative outcome from any such lawsuits could result in payments of substantial monetary damages or fines or undesirable changes to our products or business practices and accordingly our business financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected although the results of such lawsuits and claims cannot be predicted with certainty we do not believe that the final outcome of those matters relating to our products that we currently face will have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations in addition we are currently the subject of stockholder class action suits in connection with our ipo we believe these lawsuits are without merit and are vigorously defending these lawsuits 

there can be no assurances that a favorable final outcome will be obtained in all our cases and defending any lawsuit is costly and can impose a significant burden on management and employees any litigation to which we are a party may result in an onerous or unfavorable judgment that may not be reversed upon appeal or in payments of substantial monetary damages or fines or we may decide to settle lawsuits on similarly unfavorable terms which could adversely affect our business financial conditions or results of operations 

we may incur liability as a result of information retrieved from or transmitted over the internet or published using our products or as a result of claims related to our products 

we have faced currently face and will continue to face claims relating to information that is published or made available on our products in particular the nature of our business exposes us to claims related to defamation intellectual property rights rights of publicity and privacy and personal injury torts this risk is enhanced in certain jurisdictions outside the united states where our protection from liability for thirdparty actions may be unclear and where we may be less protected under local laws than we are in the united states we could incur significant costs investigating and defending such claims and if we are found liable significant damages if any of these events occur our business and financial results could be adversely affected 

our ceo has control over key decision making as a result of his control of a majority of our voting stock 

mark zuckerberg our founder chairman and ceo is able to exercise voting rights with respect to a majority of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock and therefore has the ability to control the outcome of matters submitted to our stockholders for approval including the election of directors and any merger consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets this concentrated control could delay defer or prevent a change of control merger consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets that our other stockholders support or conversely this concentrated control could result in the consummation of such a transaction that our other stockholders do not support this concentrated control could also discourage a potential investor from acquiring our class a common stock due to the limited voting power of such stock relative to the class b common stock and might harm the trading price of our class a common stock in addition mr zuckerberg has the ability to control the management and major strategic investments of our company as a result of his position as our ceo and his ability to control the election or replacement of our directors in the event of his death the shares of our capital stock that mr zuckerberg owns will be transferred to the persons or entities that he designates as a board member and officer mr zuckerberg owes a fiduciary duty to our stockholders and must act in good faith in a manner he reasonably believes to be in the best interests of our stockholders as a stockholder even a controlling stockholder mr zuckerberg is entitled to vote his shares and shares over which he has voting control as a result of voting agreements in his own interests which may not always be in the interests of our stockholders generally 

we plan to continue to make acquisitions which could harm our financial condition or results of operations and may adversely affect the price of our common stock 

as part of our business strategy we have made and intend to continue to make acquisitions to add specialized employees and complementary companies products or technologies we may not be able to find suitable acquisition candidates and we may not be able to complete acquisitions on favorable terms if at all in some cases the costs of such acquisitions may be substantial for example in 2014 we paid approximately 46 billion in cash and issued 178 million shares of our class a common stock in connection with our acquisition of whatsapp and we paid approximately 400 million in cash and issued 23 million shares of our class b common stock in connection with our acquisition of oculus we also issued a substantial number of rsus to help retain the employees of these companies there is no assurance that we will receive a favorable return on investment for these or other acquisitions 

in the future we may pay substantial amounts of cash or incur debt to pay for acquisitions which could adversely affect our liquidity the incurrence of indebtedness would also result in increased fixed obligations increased interest expense and could also include covenants or other restrictions that would impede our ability to manage our operations we may also issue equity securities to pay for acquisitions and we regularly grant rsus to retain the employees of acquired companies which could increase our expenses adversely affect our financial results and result in dilution to our stockholders in addition any acquisitions we announce could be viewed negatively by users marketers developers or investors which may adversely affect our business or the price of our common stock 

we may also discover liabilities or deficiencies associated with the companies or assets we acquire that were not identified in advance which may result in significant unanticipated costs the effectiveness of our due diligence review and our ability to evaluate the results of such due diligence are dependent upon the accuracy and completeness of statements and disclosures made or actions taken by the companies we acquire or their representatives as well as the limited amount of time in which acquisitions are executed in addition we may fail to accurately forecast the financial impact of an acquisition transaction including tax and accounting charges acquisitions may also result in our recording of significant additional expenses to our results of operations and recording of substantial finitelived intangible assets on our balance sheet upon closing any of these factors may adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations 

we may not be able to successfully integrate our acquisitions and we may incur significant costs to integrate and support the companies we acquire 

the integration of acquisitions requires significant time and resources and we may not manage these processes successfully our ability to successfully integrate complex acquisitions is unproven particularly with respect to companies that have significant operations or that develop products where we do not have prior experience for example oculus and whatsapp are larger and more complex than previous companies we have acquired in particular oculus builds technology and products that are new to facebook and accordingly we did not have significant experience or structure in place to support this business prior to the acquisition we plan to make substantial investments of resources to support these acquisitions which will result in significant ongoing operating expenses and may divert resources and management attention from other areas of our business we cannot assure you that these investments will be successful if we fail to successfully integrate the companies we acquire we may not realize the benefits expected from the transaction and our business may be harmed 

if our goodwill or finitelived intangible assets become impaired we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings   

we review our finitelived intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable such as a decline in stock price and market capitalization we test goodwill for impairment at least annually if such goodwill or finitelived intangible assets are deemed to be impaired an impairment loss equal to the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the assets would be recognized we may be required to record a significant charge in our financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill or finitelived intangible assets is determined which would negatively affect our results of operations 

our business is dependent on our ability to maintain and scale our technical infrastructure and any significant disruption in our service could damage our reputation result in a potential loss of users and engagement and adversely affect our financial results 

our reputation and ability to attract retain and serve our users is dependent upon the reliable performance of our products and our underlying technical infrastructure our systems may not be adequately designed with the necessary reliability and redundancy to avoid performance delays or outages that could be harmful to our business if our products are unavailable when users attempt to access them or if they do not load as quickly as expected users may not use our products as often in the future or at all as our user base and engagement continue to grow and the amount and types of information shared on facebook and our other products continue to grow and evolve such as increased engagement with video we will need an increasing amount of technical infrastructure including network capacity and computing power to continue to satisfy the needs of our usersit is possible that we may fail to effectively scale and grow our technical infrastructure to accommodate these increased demands in addition our business may be subject to interruptions delays or failures resulting from earthquakes adverse weather conditions other natural disasters power loss terrorism or other catastrophic events if such an event were to occur users may be subject to service disruptions or outages and we may not be able to recover our technical infrastructure and user data in a timely manner to restart or provide our services which may adversely affect our financial results 

a substantial portion of our network infrastructure is provided by third parties any disruption or failure in the services we receive from these providers could harm our ability to handle existing or increased traffic and could significantly harm our business any financial or other difficulties these providers face may adversely affect our business and we exercise little control over these providers which increases our vulnerability to problems with the services they provide 

we could experience unforeseen difficulties in building and operating key portions of our technical infrastructure 

we have designed and built our own data centers and key portions of our technical infrastructure through which we serve our products and we plan to continue to significantly expand the size of our infrastructure primarily through data centers and other projects the infrastructure expansion we are undertaking is complex and unanticipated delays in the completion of these projects or availability of components may lead to increased project costs operational inefficiencies or interruptions in the delivery or degradation of the quality of our products in addition there may be issues related to this infrastructure that are not identified during the testing phases of design and implementation which may only become evident after we have started to fully utilize the underlying equipment that 

could further degrade the user experience or increase our costs 

our products and internal systems rely on software that is highly technical and if it contains undetected errors our business could be adversely affected 

our products and internal systems rely on software including software developed or maintained internally andor by third parties that is highly technical and complex in addition our products and internal systems depend on the ability of such software to store retrieve process and manage immense amounts of data the software on which we rely has contained and may now or in the future contain undetected errors bugs or vulnerabilities some errors may only be discovered after the code has been released for external or internal use errors or other design defects within the software on which we rely may result in a negative experience for users and marketers who use our products delay product introductions or enhancements result in measurement or billing errors or compromise our ability to protect the data of our users andor our intellectual property any errors bugs or defects discovered in the software on which we rely could result in damage to our reputation loss of users loss of revenue or liability for damages any of which could adversely affect our business and financial results 

certain of our user metrics are subject to inherent challenges in measurement and real or perceived inaccuracies in such metrics may harm our reputation and negatively affect our business 

the numbers for our key metrics which include our daus mobile daus maus mobile maus and average revenue per user arpu as well as certain other metrics such as mobileonly daus and mobileonly maus are calculated using internal company data based on the activity of user accounts while these numbers are based on what we believe to be reasonable estimates of our user base for the applicable period of measurement there are inherent challenges in measuring usage of our products across large online and mobile populations around the world 

for example there may be individuals who maintain one or more facebook accounts in violation of our terms of service we estimate for example that duplicate accounts an account that a user maintains in addition to his or her principal account may have represented less than 5 of our worldwide maus in 2014 we also seek to identify false accounts which we divide into two categories 1 usermisclassified accounts where users have created personal profiles for a business organization or nonhuman entity such as a pet such entities are permitted on facebook using a page rather than a personal profile under our terms of service and 2 undesirable accounts which represent user profiles that we determine are intended to be used for purposes that violate our terms of service such as spamming in 2014 for example we estimate that such usermisclassified and undesirable accounts may have represented less than 2 our worldwide maus we believe the percentage of accounts that are duplicate or false is meaningfully lower in developed markets such as the united states or united kingdom and higher in developing markets such as india and turkey however these estimates are based on an internal review of a limited sample of accounts and we apply significant judgment in making this determination such as identifying names that appear to be fake or other behavior that appears inauthentic to the reviewers as such our estimation of duplicate or false accounts may not accurately represent the actual number of such accounts we are continually seeking to improve our ability to identify duplicate or false accounts and estimate the total number of such accounts and such estimates may change due to improvements or changes in our methodology 

our data limitations may affect our understanding of certain details of our business for example while userprovided data indicates a decline in usage among younger users this age data is unreliable because a disproportionate number of our younger users register with an inaccurate age accordingly our understanding of usage by age group may not be complete 

some of our metrics have also been affected by applications on certain mobile devices that automatically contact our servers for regular updates with no user action involved and this activity can cause our system to count the user associated with such a device as an active user on the day such contact occurs the impact of this automatic activity on our metrics varied by geography because mobile usage varies in different regions of the world in addition our data regarding the geographic location of our users is estimated based on a number of factors such as the users ip address and selfdisclosed location these factors may not always accurately reflect the users actual location for example a mobileonly user may appear to be accessing facebook from the location of the proxy server that the user connects to rather than from the users actual location the methodologies used to measure user metrics may also be susceptible to algorithm or other technical errors our estimates for revenue by user location and revenue by user device are also affected by these factors we regularly review our processes for calculating these metrics and from time to time we may discover inaccuracies in our metrics or make adjustments to improve their accuracy including adjustments that may result in the recalculation of our historical metrics we believe that any such inaccuracies or adjustments are immaterial unless otherwise stated in addition our dau and mau estimates will differ from estimates published by third parties due to differences in methodology for example some third parties are not able to accurately measure mobile users or do not count mobile users for certain user groups or at all in their analyses 

if marketers developers or investors do not perceive our user metrics to be accurate representations of our user base or if we discover material inaccuracies in our user metrics our reputation may be harmed and marketers and developers may be less willing 

to allocate their budgets or resources to facebook which could negatively affect our business and financial results 

we cannot assure you that we will effectively manage our growth 

our employee headcount and the scope and complexity of our business have increased significantly with the number of employees increasing to 9199  as of december 31 2014 from 6337 as of december 31 2013 and we expect headcount growth to continue for the foreseeable future the growth and expansion of our business and products create significant challenges for our management operational and financial resources including managing multiple relations with users marketers developers and other third parties in the event of continued growth of our operations or in the number of our thirdparty relationships our information technology systems or our internal controls and procedures may not be adequate to support our operations in addition some members of our management do not have significant experience managing a large global business operation so our management may not be able to manage such growth effectively to effectively manage our growth we must continue to improve our operational financial and management processes and systems and to effectively expand train and manage our employee base as our organization continues to grow and we are required to implement more complex organizational management structures we may find it increasingly difficult to maintain the benefits of our corporate culture including our ability to quickly develop and launch new and innovative products this could negatively affect our business performance 

the loss of one or more of our key personnel or our failure to attract and retain other highly qualified personnel in the future could harm our business 

we currently depend on the continued services and performance of our key personnel including mark zuckerberg and sheryl k sandberg although we have entered into employment agreements with mr zuckerberg and ms sandberg the agreements have no specific duration and constitute atwill employment in addition many of our key technologies and systems are custommade for our business by our personnel the loss of key personnel including members of management as well as key engineering product development marketing and sales personnel could disrupt our operations and have an adverse effect on our business 

as we continue to grow we cannot guarantee we will continue to attract the personnel we need to maintain our competitive position in particular we intend to continue to hire a significant number of technical personnel in the foreseeable future and we expect to face significant competition from other companies in hiring such personnel particularly in the san francisco bay area as we mature the incentives to attract retain and motivate employees provided by our equity awards or by future arrangements may not be as effective as in the past and if we issue significant equity to attract additional employees the ownership of our existing stockholders may be further diluted additionally we have a number of current employees whose equity ownership in our company has provided them a substantial amount of personal wealth which could affect their decisions about whether or not to continue to work for us as a result of these factors it may be difficult for us to continue to retain and motivate our employees if we do not succeed in attracting hiring and integrating excellent personnel or retaining and motivating existing personnel we may be unable to grow effectively 

we may not be able to continue to successfully grow usage of and engagement with mobile and web applications that integrate with facebook 

we have made and are continuing to make investments to enable developers to build grow and monetize mobile and web applications that integrate with facebook such existing and prospective developers may not be successful in building growing or monetizing mobile andor web applications that create and maintain user engagement additionally developers may choose to build on other platforms including mobile platforms controlled by third parties rather than building products that integrate with facebook we are continuously seeking to balance the distribution objectives of our developers with our desire to provide an optimal user experience and we may not be successful in achieving a balance that continues to attract and retain such developers for example from time to time we have taken actions to reduce the volume of communications from these developers to users on facebook with the objective of enhancing the user experience and such actions have reduced distribution from user engagement with and our monetization opportunities from facebookintegrated mobile and web applications in some instances these actions as well as other actions to enforce our policies applicable to developers have adversely affected our relationships with such developers if we are not successful in our efforts to continue to grow the number of developers that choose to build products that integrate with facebook or if we are unable to continue to build and maintain good relations with such developers our user growth and user engagement and our financial results may be adversely affected 

we generate all of our payments revenue from developers that use facebook on personal computers and we expect that our payments revenue will decline in the future as usage of facebook on personal computers continues to decline 

         we currently generate all of our payments revenue from developers that use facebook on personal computers specifically applications built by developers of social games are currently responsible for substantially all of our revenue derived from payments and the majority of the revenue from these applications has historically been generated by a limited number of the most popular games we have experienced and expect to continue to see the continued decline in usage of facebook on personal computers for the foreseeable future which we expect will result in a decline in payments revenue in addition a relatively small percentage of our users have transacted with facebook payments if the facebookintegrated applications fail to grow or maintain their users and engagement whether as a result of the continued decline in the usage of facebook on personal computers or otherwise if developers do not continue to introduce new applications that attract users and create engagement on facebook or if facebookintegrated applications outside of social games do not gain popularity and generate significant revenue for us our financial performance could be adversely affected 

payment transactions on facebook may subject us to additional regulatory requirements and other risks that could be costly and difficult to comply with or that could harm our business 

our users can use facebook to purchase virtual and digital goods from developers that offer applications on the facebook website using our payments infrastructure we are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the united states europe and elsewhere including those governing antimoney laundering and counterterrorist financing money transmission gift cards and other prepaid access instruments and import and export restrictions depending on how our payments product evolves we may also be subject to other laws and regulations including those governing electronic funds transfers gambling banking and lending in some jurisdictions the application or interpretation of these laws and regulations is not clear to increase flexibility in how our use of payments may evolve and to mitigate regulatory uncertainty we have received certain money transmitter licenses in the united states and are applying for certain regulatory licenses in europe which will generally require us to demonstrate compliance with many domestic and foreign laws in these areas our efforts to comply with these laws and regulations could be costly and result in diversion of management time and effort and may still not guarantee compliance in the event that we are found to be in violation of any such legal or regulatory requirements we may be subject to monetary fines or other penalties such as a cease and desist order or we may be required to make product changes any of which could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results 

in addition we may be subject to a variety of additional risks as a result of payments on facebook including 

 we have significant international operations and plan to continue expanding our operations abroad where we have limited operating experience and this may subject us to increased business and economic risks that could affect our financial results 

we have significant international operations and plan to continue the international expansion of our business operations and the translation of our products we currently make facebook available in more than 80 different languages and we have offices or data centers in more than 25 different countries we may enter new international markets where we have limited or no experience in marketing selling and deploying our products our products are generally available globally through the web and on mobile but some or all of our products or functionality may not be available in certain markets due to legal and regulatory complexities for example facebook is not generally available in china if we fail to deploy or manage our operations in international markets successfully our business may suffer in addition we are subject to a variety of risks inherent in doing business internationally including 

 22 

 if we are unable to expand internationally and manage the complexity of our global operations successfully our financial results could be adversely affected 

we may incur a substantial amount of indebtedness which could adversely affect our financial condition 

in august 2013 we entered into a fiveyear senior unsecured revolving credit facility under which we may borrow up to 65 billion to fund working capital and general corporate purposes as of december 31 2014 no amounts were outstanding under this facility if we draw down on this facility in the future our interest expense and principal repayment requirements will increase significantly which could have an adverse effect on our financial results 

we may require additional capital to support our business growth and this capital may not be available on acceptable terms if at all 

we may require additional capital to support our business growth or to respond to business opportunities challenges or unforeseen circumstances our ability to obtain additional capital if and when required will depend on our business plans investor demand our operating performance the condition of the capital markets and other factors if we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity equitylinked or debt securities those securities may have rights preferences or privileges senior to the rights of our class a common stock and our existing stockholders may experience dilution if we are unable to obtain additional capital when required or are unable to obtain additional capital on satisfactory terms our ability to continue to support our business growth or to respond to business opportunities challenges or unforeseen circumstances could be adversely affected and our business may be harmed 

if we default on our leasing and credit obligations our operations may be interrupted and our business and financial results could be adversely affected 

we finance a significant portion of our expenditures through leasing arrangements some of which are not required to be reflected on our balance sheet and we may enter into additional similar arrangements in the future in particular we have used these types of arrangements to finance some of our equipment offices and data centers in addition we have a 65 billion revolving credit facility that we may draw upon to finance our operations or other corporate purposes if we default on these leasing and credit obligations our leasing partners and lenders may among other things 

 if some or all of these events were to occur our operations may be interrupted and our ability to fund our operations or obligations as well as our business financial results and financial condition could be adversely affected 

we may have exposure to greater than anticipated tax liabilities 

our income tax obligations are based in part on our corporate operating structure and intercompany arrangements including the manner in which we develop value and use our intellectual property and the valuations of our intercompany transactions the tax laws applicable to our business including the laws of the united states and other jurisdictions are subject to interpretation and certain jurisdictions are aggressively interpreting their laws in new ways in an effort to raise additional tax revenue from companies such as facebook the taxing authorities of the jurisdictions in which we operate may challenge our methodologies for valuing developed technology or intercompany arrangements which could increase our worldwide effective tax rate and harm our financial position and results of operations we are subject to regular review and audit by us federal and state and foreign tax authorities tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken and any adverse outcome of such a review or audit could have a negative effect on our financial position and results of operations in addition the determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires significant judgment by management and there are many transactions where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain although we believe that our estimates are reasonable the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements and may materially affect our financial results in the period or periods for which such determination is made   in addition our future income taxes could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions that have lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions that have higher statutory tax rates by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities or by changes in tax laws regulations or accounting principles for example we have previously incurred losses in certain international subsidiaries that resulted in an effective tax rate that is significantly higher than the statutory tax rate in the united states and this could continue to happen in the future 

changes in tax laws or tax rulings could materially affect our financial position and results of operations 

changes in tax laws or tax rulings could materially affect our financial position and results of operations for example the current us administration and key members of congress have made public statements indicating that tax reform is a priority certain changes to us tax laws including limitations on the ability to defer us taxation on earnings outside of the united states until those earnings are repatriated to the united states could affect the tax treatment of our foreign earnings in addition many countries in the european union as well as a number of other countries and organizations such as the organization for economic cooperation and development are actively considering changes to existing tax laws certain proposals could include recommendations that would significantly increase our tax obligations in many countries where we do business due to the large and expanding scale of our international business activities any changes in the taxation of such activities may increase our worldwide effective tax rate and harm our financial position and results of operations 

risks related to ownership of our class a common stock 

the trading price of our class a common stock has been and will likely continue to be volatile 

the trading price of our class a common stock has been and is likely to continue to be volatile since shares of our class a common stock were sold in our ipo in may 2012 at a price of 3800 per share our stock price has ranged from 1755  to 8217  through december 31 2014 in addition to the factors discussed in this annual report on form 10k the trading price of our class a common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to numerous factors many of which are beyond our control including 

 24 

developers and competitors 

 in addition the stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many technology companies stock prices of many technology companies have fluctuated in a manner unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies we are currently subject to securities litigation in connection with our ipo we may experience more such litigation following future periods of volatility any securities litigation could subject us to substantial costs divert resources and the attention of management from our business and adversely affect our business 

we do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future 

we have never declared or paid cash dividends on our capital stock we currently intend to retain any future earnings to finance the operation and expansion of our business and we do not expect to declare or pay any dividends in the foreseeable future as a result you may only receive a return on your investment in our class a common stock if the trading price of our class a common stock increases in addition our credit facility contains restrictions on our ability to pay dividends 

the dual class structure of our common stock and the voting agreements among certain stockholders have the effect of concentrating voting control with our ceo and certain other holders of our class b common stock this will limit or preclude your ability to influence corporate matters 

our class b common stock has ten votes per share and our class a common stock has one vote per share stockholders who hold shares of class b common stock including certain of our executive officers employees and directors and their affiliates together hold a substantial majority of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock because of the tentoone voting ratio between our class b and class a common stock the holders of our class b common stock collectively control a majority of the combined voting power of our common stock and therefore are able to control all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval so long as the shares of class b common stock represent at least 91 of all outstanding shares of our class a and class b common stock this concentrated control will limit or preclude your ability to influence corporate matters for the foreseeable future 

transfers by holders of class b common stock will generally result in those shares converting to class a common stock subject to limited exceptions such as certain transfers effected for estate planning or charitable purposes the conversion of class b common stock to class a common stock will have the effect over time of increasing the relative voting power of those holders of class b common stock who retain their shares in the long term if for example mr zuckerberg retains a significant portion of his holdings of class b common stock for an extended period of time he could in the future continue to control a majority of the combined voting power of our class a common stock and class b common stock 

we have elected to take advantage of the controlled company exemption to the corporate governance rules for nasdaqlisted companies which could make our class a common stock less attractive to some investors or otherwise harm our stock price 

because we qualify as a controlled company under the corporate governance rules for nasdaqlisted companies we are not required to have a majority of our board of directors be independent nor are we required to have a compensation committee or an independent nominating function in light of our status as a controlled company our board of directors determined not to have an independent nominating function and chose to have the full board of directors be directly responsible for nominating members of our board and in the future we could elect not to have a majority of our board of directors be independent or not to have a compensation committee accordingly should the interests of our controlling stockholder differ from those of other stockholders the other stockholders may not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the corporate governance rules for nasdaqlisted companies our status as a controlled company could make our class a common stock less attractive to some investors or otherwise harm our stock price 

delaware law and provisions in our restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws could make a merger tender offer or proxy contest difficult thereby depressing the trading price of our class a common stock 

our status as a delaware corporation and the antitakeover provisions of the delaware general corporation law may discourage delay or prevent a change in control by prohibiting us from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years after the person becomes an interested stockholder even if a change of control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders in addition our restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that may make the acquisition of our company more difficult including the following

tableend paul d ceglia filed suit against us and mark zuckerberg on or about june 30 2010 in the supreme court of the state of new york for the county of allegheny claiming substantial ownership of our company based on a purported contract between mr ceglia and mr zuckerberg allegedly entered into in april 2003 we removed the case to the us district court for the western district of new york where the case is now pending in his first amended complaint filed on april 11 2011 mr ceglia revised his claims to include an alleged partnership with mr zuckerberg he revised his claims for relief to seek a substantial share of mr zuckerbergs ownership in us and he included quotations from supposed emails that he claims to have exchanged with mr zuckerberg in 2003 and 2004 on march 26 2012 we filed a motion to dismiss mr ceglias complaint and a motion for judgment on the pleadings on march 26 2013 the magistrate judge overseeing the matter issued a report recommending that the court grant our motion to dismiss and that it deny as moot our motion for judgment on the pleadings on march 25 2014 the district judge adopted the magistrate judge’s report and recommendation and granted our motion to dismiss and denied our motion for judgment on the pleadings as moot on april 24 2014 mr ceglia filed a notice of appeal the appeal has been fully briefed we continue to believe that mr ceglia is perpetrating a fraud on the court and we intend to continue to defend the case vigorously 

beginning on may 22 2012 multiple putative class actions derivative actions and individual actions were filed in state and federal courts in the united states and in other jurisdictions against us our directors andor certain of our officers alleging violation of securities laws or breach of fiduciary duties in connection with our initial public offering ipo and seeking unspecified damages we believe these lawsuits are without merit and we intend to continue to vigorously defend them the vast majority of the cases in the united states along with multiple cases filed against the nasdaq omx group inc and the nasdaq stock market llc collectively referred to herein as nasdaq alleging technical and other tradingrelated errors by nasdaq in connection with our ipo were ordered centralized for coordinated or consolidated pretrial proceedings in the us district court for the southern district of new york in a series of rulings in 2013 and 2014 the court denied our motion to dismiss the consolidated securities class action and granted our motions to dismiss the derivative actions against our directors and certain of our officers the plaintiffs in four of these derivative actions have filed notices of appeal on december 23 2014 the plaintiffs in the consolidated securities class action filed their motion for class certification in addition the events surrounding our ipo became the subject of various state and federal government inquiries in may 2014 the securities and exchange commission sec notified us that it had terminated its inquiry and that no enforcement action had been recommended by the sec 

in addition we are also currently parties to multiple other lawsuits related to our products including other patent infringement lawsuits as well as class action lawsuits brought by users and marketers and we may in the future be subject to additional lawsuits and disputes we are also involved in other claims government investigations and proceedings arising from the ordinary course of our business

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

tableend you should read the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data of this annual report on form 10k in addition to our historical consolidated financial information the following discussion contains forwardlooking statements that reflect our plans estimates and beliefs our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forwardlooking statements factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k particularly in part i item 1a risk factors for a discussion of limitations in the measurement of certain of our user metrics see the section entitled limitations of key metrics and other data in this annual report on form 10k 

overview 

we generate substantially all of our revenue from advertising and from fees associated with our payments infrastructure that enables people who use facebook to purchase virtual and digital goods from developers for the year ended december 31 2014  we recorded revenue of 1247 billion  income from operations of 499 billion  and net income of 294 billion  

trends in our user metrics 

the numbers for our key metrics our daily active users daus mobile daus maus mobile maus and average revenue per user arpu and certain other metrics such as mobileonly daus and mobileonly maus do not include instagram or whatsapp users unless they would otherwise qualify as such users respectively based on their other activities on facebook in addition other user engagement metrics do not include instagram or whatsapp unless otherwise specifically stated 

trends in the number of users affect our revenue and financial results by influencing the number of ads we are able to show the value of our ads to marketers the volume of payments transactions as well as our expenses and capital expenditures 

 

note for purposes of reporting daus maus and arpu by geographic region europe includes all users in russia and turkey and rest of world includes all users in africa latin america and the middle east 

worldwide daus increased 18  to 890 million on average during december 2014  from 757 million  during december 2013  we experienced growth in daus across major markets including india brazil and the united states overall growth in daus was driven by increased mobile usage of facebook and the number of daus accessing facebook on personal computers decreased in december 2014 compared to the same period in 2013 we believe that use of facebook through personal computers will continue to decline in all regions 

 worldwide mobile daus increased 34  to 745 million  on average during december 2014  from 556 million  during december 2013  in all regions an increasing number of our daus accessed facebook through mobile devices on average during december 2014 as compared to the same period during 2013 with users in brazil india and the united states representing key sources of mobile dau growth on average during december 2014 on average during the month ended december 31 2014 there were 589 million  daus who accessed facebook solely through mobile applications or our mobile website increasing 49  from 395 million  mobileonly daus during the same period in 2013 the remaining mobile daus accessed facebook from both mobile devices and personal computers we anticipate that growth in mobile users will continue to be the driver of our user growth for the foreseeable future 

   

as of december 31 2014  we had 139 billion  maus an increase of 13  from december 31 2013  users in india brazil and indonesia represented key sources of growth in 2014 overall growth in maus was driven by increased mobile usage of facebook and the number of maus accessing facebook on personal computers decreased in december 2014 compared to the same period in 2013 we believe that use of facebook through personal computers will continue to decline in all regions 

 35 

worldwide mobile maus increased 26  to 119 billion  as of december 31 2014  from 945 million  as of december 31 2013  in all regions an increasing number of our maus accessed facebook through mobile devices in 2014 as compared to the same period in 2013 with users in india brazil and the united states representing key sources of mobile mau growth in 2014 there were 526 million  mobile maus who accessed facebook solely through mobile applications or our mobile website during the month ended december 31 2014  increasing 78  from 296 million  during the same period in 2013  the remaining 663 million  mobile maus accessed facebook from both mobile devices and personal computers during december 2014 we anticipate that growth in mobile users will continue to be the driver of our user growth for the foreseeable future 

  

trends in our monetization by user geography 

we calculate our revenue by user geography based on our estimate of the geography in which ad impressions are delivered or virtual and digital goods are purchased we define arpu as our total revenue in a given geography during a given quarter divided by the average of the number of maus in the geography at the beginning and end of the quarter the geography of our users affects our revenue and financial results because we currently monetize users in different geographies at different average rates our revenue and arpu in regions such as united states  canada and europe are relatively higher due to the size and maturity of those advertising markets as well as our greater sales presence and the number of payment methods that we make available to marketers and users for example arpu for an average user in 2014 in united states  canada was more than six times higher than for an average user in asiapacific 

  

note our revenue by user geography in the charts above is geographically apportioned based on our estimation of the geographic location of our users when they perform a revenuegenerating activity this allocation differs from our revenue by geography disclosure in our consolidated financial statements where revenue is geographically apportioned based on the location of the marketer or developer 

for 2014  worldwide arpu was 945  an increase of 39  from 2013  over this period arpu increased by approximately 53 in united states  canada 44 in europe 42 in asiapacific and 27 in rest of world user growth was more rapid in geographies with relatively lower arpu such as asiapacific and rest of world we expect that user growth in the future will be primarily concentrated in those regions where arpu is relatively lower such as asiapacific and rest of world such that worldwide arpu may continue to increase at a slower rate relative to arpu in any geographic region or potentially decrease even if arpu increases in each geographic region 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue costs and expenses and related disclosures we evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis our estimates are based on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances our actual results could differ from these estimates 

an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made if different estimates reasonably could have been used or if changes in the estimate that are reasonably possible could materially impact the financial statements we believe that the assumptions and estimates associated with revenue recognition for payments and other fees income taxes sharebased compensation loss contingencies and business combinations and valuation of goodwill and other acquired intangible assets have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements therefore we consider these to be our critical accounting policies and estimates for further information on all of our significant accounting policies see note 1 of our accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data of this annual report on form 10k 

revenue recognition for payments and other fees 

we enable payments from people to purchase virtual and digital goods from developers people can make payments on facebook by using debit and credit cards paypal mobile phone payments gift cards or other methods we receive a fee from developers when a person engages in a payment transaction for the purchase of a virtual or digital good on the facebook website the price of the virtual or digital good is a price that is solely determined by the developer we remit to the developer an amount that is based on the total amount of transaction less the processing fee that we charge the developer for the service performed our revenue is the net amount of the transaction representing our processing fee for the transaction we record revenue on a net basis as we do not consider ourselves to be the principal in the sale of the virtual or digital good to the person under gaap guidance related to reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent the indicators used to determine whether an entity is a principal or an agent to a transaction are subject to judgment we consider ourselves the agent to these transactions when we apply the indicators to our facts should material subsequent changes in the substance or nature of the transactions with developers result in us being considered the principal in such sales we would reflect the virtual and digital goods sale as revenue and the amounts paid to the developers as an associated cost 

income taxes 

we are subject to income taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes and income tax assets and liabilities including evaluating uncertainties in the application of accounting principles and complex tax laws 

we record a provision for income taxes for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations using the asset and liability method under this method we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities as well as for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the tax rates that are expected to apply to taxable income for the years in which those tax assets and liabilities are expected to be realized or settled we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the net amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized 

we recognize tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if we believe that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position although we believe that we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions we can provide no assurance that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be materially different we make adjustments to these reserves when facts and circumstances change such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded such differences will affect the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made and could have a material impact on our financial condition and operating results the provision for income taxes includes the effects of any reserves that we believe are appropriate as well as the related net interest and penalties 

sharebased compensation 

we account for sharebased employee compensation plans under the fair value recognition and measurement provisions in accordance with applicable accounting standards which require all sharebased payments to employees including grants of stock options and restricted stock units rsus to be measured based on the grant date fair value of the awards with the resulting expense generally recognized on a straightline basis over the period during which the employee is required to perform service in exchange for the award   

sharebased compensation expense is recorded net of estimated forfeitures in our consolidated statements of income and as such is recorded for only those sharebased awards that we expect to vest we estimate the forfeiture rate based on historical forfeitures of equity awards and adjust the rate to reflect changes in facts and circumstances if any we will revise our estimated forfeiture rate if actual forfeitures differ from our initial estimates 

we have historically issued unvested restricted shares to employee stockholders of certain acquired companies as these awards are generally subject to continued postacquisition employment we have accounted for them as postacquisition sharebased compensation expense we recognize compensation expense equal to the grant date fair value of the common stock on a straightline basis over the period during which the employee is required to perform service in exchange for the award 

loss contingencies 

we are involved in various lawsuits claims investigations and proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business certain of these matters include speculative claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts of damages we record a liability when we believe that it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated significant judgment is required to determine both probability and the estimated amount we review these provisions at least quarterly and adjust these provisions accordingly to reflect the impact of negotiations settlements rulings advice of legal counsel and updated information 

we believe that the amount or estimable range of reasonably possible loss will not either individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on our business consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows with respect to loss contingencies for legal and other contingencies as of december 31 2014  however the outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain therefore if one or more of these legal matters were resolved against us for amounts in excess of managements expectations our results of operations and financial condition including in a particular reporting period could be materially adversely affected 

business combinations and valuation of goodwill and other acquired intangible assets 

we allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired liabilities assumed and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values the excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill such valuations require management to make significant estimates and assumptions especially with respect to intangible assets significant estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from acquired users acquired technology and trade names from a market participant perspective useful lives and discount rates management’s estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and as a result actual results may differ from estimates during the measurement period which is one year from the acquisition date we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill upon the conclusion of the measurement period any subsequent adjustments are recorded to earnings 

we review goodwill for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable we have elected to first assess the qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of our single reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the twostep goodwill impairment under accounting standards update asu no 201108 goodwill and other topic 350 testing goodwill for impairment  issued by the financial accounting standards board fasb if we determine that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount then the twostep goodwill impairment test will be performed the first step identifying a potential impairment compares the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount if the carrying amount exceeds its fair value the second step will be performed otherwise no further step is required the second step measuring the impairment loss compares the implied fair value of the goodwill with the carrying amount of the goodwill any excess of the goodwill carrying amount over the applied fair value is recognized as an impairment loss and the carrying value of goodwill is written down to fair value as of december 31 2014  no impairment of goodwill has been identified 

acquired finitelived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives we evaluate the recoverability of our intangible assets for possible impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable recoverability of these assets is measured by a comparison of the carrying amounts to the future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate if such review indicates that the carrying amount of property and equipment and intangible assets is not recoverable the carrying amount of such assets is reduced to fair value we have not recorded any such impairment charge during the years presented 

in addition to the recoverability assessment we routinely review the remaining estimated useful lives of our finitelived intangible assets if we reduce the estimated useful life assumption for any asset the remaining unamortized balance would be amortized over the revised estimated useful life 

components of results of operations 

revenue 

we generate substantially all of our revenue from advertising and from fees associated with our payments infrastructure that enables people to purchase virtual and digital goods from our developers 

advertising  our advertising revenue is generated by displaying ad products on facebook properties including our mobile applications and thirdparty affiliated websites or mobile applications marketers pay for ad products either directly or through their relationships with advertising agencies based on the number of clicks made by people the number of actions taken by people or the number of impressions delivered we recognize revenue from the delivery of clickbased ads in the period in which a person clicks on the content and actionbased ads in the period in which a person takes the action the marketer contracted for we recognize revenue from the display of impressionbased ads in the contracted period in which the impressions are delivered impressions are considered delivered when an ad is displayed to people the number of ads we show is subject to methodological changes as we continue to evolve our ads business and the structure of our ads products we calculate price per ad as total ad revenue divided by the number of ads delivered representing the effective price paid per impression by a marketer regardless of their desired objective such as impression click or action 

payments and other fees  we enable payments from people to purchase virtual and digital goods from our developers people can transact and make payments on the facebook website by using debit and credit cards paypal mobile phone payments gift cards or other methods we receive a fee from developers when people make purchases in these applications using our payments infrastructure we recognize revenue net of amounts remitted to our developers we have mandated the use of our payments infrastructure for game applications on facebook and fees related to payments are generated almost exclusively from games our other fees revenue which has not been significant in recent periods consists primarily of revenue from our ad serving and measurement products and the delivery of virtual reality platform devices

2014  compared to 2013  revenue in 2014  increased 459 billion  or 58  compared to 2013  the increase was due primarily to a 65  increase in advertising revenue during 2014  as compared to 2013  

the most important factor driving advertising revenue growth was an increase in revenue from ads in news feed on both mobile devices and personal computers news feed ads are displayed more prominently have significantly higher levels of engagement and a higher price per ad relative to our other ad placements in 2014  we estimate that mobile advertising revenue represented approximately 65  of total advertising revenue as compared with 45  in 2013  other factors that influenced our advertising revenue growth in 2014  included i an increase in the number of marketers actively advertising on facebook which we believe increased demand for our ad inventory ii other product changes to increase the value and performance of our ads and iii an increase in user growth and engagement 

in 2014  compared to 2013  the average price per ad increased by 173 and the number of ads delivered decreased by 40 the increase in average price per ad was driven by a product change related to certain nonnews feed ads during the third quarter of 2014 which decreased the number of ads displayed but increased the prominence of each ad average price per ad was also driven by a mix shift towards a greater percentage of our ads being shown in news feed the reduction in ads delivered was driven by factors including the product change described above as well as the shift in usage towards mobile devices where people are shown fewer ads as compared to personal computers 

advertising revenue in the fourth quarter of 2014  increased 53  compared to the same period in 2013  the increase in advertising revenue in the fourth quarter of 2014  was driven by the same factors that drove 2014  annual advertising revenue growth primarily an increase in revenue from ads in news feed on both mobile devices and personal computers for the fourth quarter of 2014  we estimate that mobile advertising revenue represented approximately 69  of total advertising revenue as compared with 53  in the same period in 2013 

advertising spending is traditionally seasonally strong in the fourth quarter of each year we believe that this seasonality in advertising spending affects our quarterly results which generally reflect significant growth in advertising revenue between the third and fourth quarters and a decline in advertising spending between the fourth and subsequent first quarters for instance our advertising revenue increased 22 30 and 22 between the third and fourth quarters of 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively while advertising revenue for the first quarter of 2014 and 2013 declined 3 and 6 compared to the fourth quarters of 2013 and 2012 respectively 

payments and other fees revenue in 2014  increased 88 million  or 10  compared to 2013  the increase in payments and other fees revenue is a result of increased revenue from our ad serving and measurement products and the delivery of virtual reality platform devices 

payments and other fees revenue in the fourth quarter of 2014  was  257 million  as compared to 241 million  in the same period of 2013  payments and other fees revenue is currently based predominantly on payments revenue from games played on 

personal computers we expect facebook usage on personal computers will continue to decline in the future which we expect to result in a decline of our payments revenue 

2013  compared to 2012  revenue in 2013 increased 278 billion or 55 compared to 2012 the increase was due primarily to a 63 increase in advertising revenue during 2013 as compared to 2012 

the most important factor driving advertising revenue growth was an increase in revenue from ads in news feed on both mobile devices and personal computers news feed ads are displayed more prominently have significantly higher levels of engagement and a higher price per ad relative to our other ad placements in 2013 we estimate that mobile advertising revenue represented approximately 45 of total advertising revenue as compared with 11 in 2012 other factors that influenced our advertising revenue growth in 2013 included an increase in the number of marketers actively advertising on facebook which we believe increased demand for our ad inventory and a 22 growth in average daus from december 2012 to december 2013 

in 2013 compared to 2012 we increased the number of ads shown by 20 and the average price per ad by 36 the increase in average price per ad was driven primarily by the increased number of news feed ads on both mobile devices and personal computers offset partially by product changes including our decision to lower the market reserve price ie the minimum price threshold accepted in our auction the increase in the number of ads shown was driven by user growth and the reserve price change partially offset by a shift towards more usage on mobile devices where we show fewer ads than on personal computers 

payments and other fees revenue in 2013 increased 76 million or 9 compared to 2012 the increase in payments and other fees revenue is a result of increased payments revenue from games played on facebook on personal computers and to a lesser extent the inclusion of other fees revenue in 2013 from user promoted posts and our ad serving and measurement products 

in 2013 we generated approximately 46 of our revenue from marketers and developers based in the united states compared to 51 in 2012 the change is due to a faster growth rate of international users and to the expansion of international sales offices and payment methods the majority of our revenue outside of the united states came from customers located in western europe canada australia and brazil 

no customer represented 10 or more of total revenue during the years ended december 31 2014  2013  and 2012  

cost of revenue 

  

  

2014  compared to 2013  cost of revenue in 2014  increased 278 million  or 15  compared to 2013  the increase was primarily due to operational expenses related to our data center and technical infrastructure and increased amortization of our intangible assets these increases were partially offset by items related to data center lease abandonment we reversed 34 million of lease abandonment expense in 2014 due to our decision to reoccupy and utilize a previously exited data center compared to a recognition of 117 million of lease abandonment expense in 2013 

2013  compared to 2012  cost of revenue in 2013 increased 511 million or 37 compared to 2012 the increase was primarily due to operational expenses related to expanding our data center and technical infrastructure including a 275 million increase in depreciation in 2013 in addition we recognized 117 million of lease abandonment expense in 2013 primarily due to exiting certain leased data centers resulting from the migration of operations to our own data centers the increase in cost of revenue in 2013 was partially offset by a 46 million decrease in sharebased compensation expense compared to 2012 

in 2015 we anticipate that the cost of revenue will increase at a higher rate than it increased in 2014 as we expand our data center capacity and technical infrastructure to support user growth increased user engagement and the delivery of new products and services additionally we also expect an increase in amortization of our intangible assets 

research and development 



  

2014  compared to 2013  research and development expenses in 2014  increased 125 billion  or 88  compared to 2013  the increase was primarily due to an increase of 724 million  in sharebased compensation expense compared to 2013 and an increase in other payroll and benefits expense resulting from a 48  growth in employee headcount from december 31 2013 to december 31 2014 in engineering and other technical functions sharebased compensation expense also increased due to the acquisitions we completed in 2014 

2013  compared to 2012   research and development expenses in 2013 increased 16 million or 1 compared to 2012 the increase was primarily due to an increase in payroll and benefits expense resulting from a 50 growth in employee headcount from december 31 2012 to december 31 2013 in engineering and other technical functions this increase in 2013 was offset by a 239 million decrease in sharebased compensation expense compared to 2012 

in 2015 we plan to continue hiring software engineers and other technical employees to support our research and development initiatives 

marketing and sales 



  

2014  compared to 2013   marketing and sales expenses in 2014  increased 683 million  or 69  compared to 2013  the increase was primarily due to an increase in payroll and benefits expenses resulting from a 44  increase in employee headcount from december 31 2013 to december 31 2014 to support global sales business development and customer service our people marketer and developerfacing marketing expense also increased 150 million in 2014 compared to 2013 additionally sharebased compensation expense also increased 116 million  compared to 2013 

2013  compared to 2012  marketing and sales expenses in 2013 increased 101 million or 11 compared to 2012 the increase was primarily due to an increase in payroll and benefits expenses resulting from a 36 increase in employee headcount from december 31 2012 to december 31 2013 to support global sales business development and customer service our people marketer and developerfacing marketing expense also contributed to the increase in 2013 these increases in 2013 were partially offset by a decrease in sharebased compensation expense of 173 million compared to 2012 

in 2015 we plan to add sales and business development employees and increase our investment in marketing to our people marketers and developers 

general and administrative 



  

2014  compared to 2013  general and administrative expenses in 2014  increased 192 million  or 25  compared to 2013  the increase was primarily due to an increase in payroll and benefits expenses resulting from a 55  increase in employee headcount sharebased compensation expense also increased 71 million  compared to 2013 additionally professional services expense in 2014 also increased 58 million primarily due to higher consulting and other professional service fees 

2013  compared to 2012  general and administrative expenses in 2013 decreased 111 million or 12 compared to 2012 the decrease was primarily due to a 208 million decrease in sharebased compensation expense in 2013 compared to 2012 the decrease in 2013 was partially offset by increased payroll and benefits expense resulting from a 19 increase in employee headcount and increased amortization of acquired patents 

in 2015 we plan to increase general and administrative employee headcount to support overall company growth 

interest and other incomeexpense net 



  

2014  compared to 2013  interest and other incomeexpense net in 2014  decreased 34 million  or 68  compared to 2013  other incomeexpense net decreased primarily due to 87 million in foreign exchange losses resulting from the periodic remeasurement of our foreign currency balances the decrease in other incomeexpense net was partially offset by a decrease in interest expense due to the repayment of our longterm debt in august 2013 and lower capital lease payments 

2013  compared to 2012  interest and other incomeexpense net in 2013 decreased 6 million or 14 compared to 2012 other incomeexpense net decreased primarily due to foreign exchange losses resulting from the periodic remeasurement of our foreign currency balances in addition interest expense increased by 5 million primarily due to interest on the 15 billion term loan that was drawn down in the fourth quarter of 2012 and fully repaid in august 2013 offset by an increase in interest income resulting from higher invested cash balances 

provision for income taxes 



  

2014  compared to 2013  our provision for income taxes in 2014  increased 716 million  or 57  compared to 2013  primarily due to an increase in income before provision for income taxes our effective tax rate differs from the statutory rate due to nondeductible sharebased compensation operations in jurisdictions with tax rates lower than the us and tax research credits our effective tax rate decreased primarily due to a change in our geographic mix of pretax income 

2013  compared to 2012   our provision for income taxes in 2013 increased 813 million or 184 compared to 2012 primarily due to an increase in income before provision for income taxes our effective tax rate decreased primarily due to a lower amount of nondeductible sharebased compensation our effective tax rate in 2013 was also lower due to the reinstatement in 2013 of the federal tax credit for research and development activities we recognized the benefit from the reinstatement of the tax credit for 2012 and 2013 during the year ended december 31 2013

sharebased compensation expense included in costs and expenses 

  

liquidity and capital resources 



our principal sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents marketable securities and cash generated from operations cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities consist primarily of cash on deposit with banks investments in money market funds and investments in us government securities us government agency securities and corporate debt securities cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities were 1120 billion  as of december 31 2014  a decrease of 250 million  from december 31 2013  primarily due to 498 billion  for acquisitions of businesses and 250 billion  for other cash outflows mainly related to purchases of property and equipment these decreases were partially offset by 546 billion  of cash generated from operations and 187 billion  in excess tax benefit from sharebased award activity 

in october 2014 the tax withholdings related to the whatsapp vested merger consideration were funded by net share settlement the amount remitted to the tax authorities for the employees tax obligation to the tax authorities was reflected as a financing activity within our consolidated statements of cash flows 

in january 2014 we began requiring that employees sell a portion of the shares that they receive upon the vesting of rsus in order to cover any required withholding taxes selltocover rather than our previous approach of net share settlement this selltocover approach reduces our cash outflows compared to the net share settlement approach 

in august 2013 we entered into a fiveyear senior unsecured revolving credit facility 2013 revolving credit facility that allows us to borrow up to 65 billion to fund working capital and general corporate purposes with interest payable on the borrowed amounts set at libor plus 10 as well as an annual commitment fee of 010 on the daily undrawn balance of the facility we paid origination fees at closing of the 2013 revolving credit facility which fees are being amortized over the term of the facility any amounts outstanding under this facility will be due and payable on august 15 2018 as of december 31 2014  no amounts had been drawn down and we were in compliance with the covenants under this credit facility 

as of december 31 2014  157 billion  of the 1120 billion  in cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities was held by our foreign subsidiaries substantially all of these funds are in jurisdictions for which we are indefinitely reinvesting the earnings of the local subsidiary these subsidiaries have historically incurred losses as such repatriating the funds will likely incur no residual tax liability we have provided residual taxes in jurisdictions where we do not intend to indefinitely reinvest the earnings of the local subsidiary however the amount of taxes provided has been insignificant 

 we currently anticipate that our available funds credit facilities and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our operational cash needs for the foreseeable future 

cash provided by operating activities 

cash flow from operating activities during 2014  primarily consisted of net income adjusted for certain noncash items including sharebased compensation expense of 179 billion  and total depreciation and amortization of 124 billion  the cash flow from operating activities during 2014  compared to 2013  increased mainly due to an increase in net income of 144 billion  as adjusted for certain noncash items described above partially offset by a decrease in income tax refunds of 415 million

cash flow from operating activities during 2012 primarily consisted of adjustments to net income for certain noncash items such as sharebased compensation expense of 157 billion and depreciation and amortization of 649 million partially offset by income tax refundable of 451 million the cash flow from operating activities during 2012 compared to 2011 increased modestly as the increases in adjustments for noncash items as described above were offset by a reduction in net income of 947 million and an increase in income tax refundable

cash used in investing activities during 2013 primarily resulted from 136 billion for capital expenditures related to the purchase of servers network infrastructure and the construction of data centers as well as 882 million for the net purchase of marketable securities and 368 million for the acquisition of businesses and other assets such as patents the decrease in cash used in investing activities during 2013 compared to 2012 was mainly due to decreases in the purchase of marketable securities and the acquisition of businesses and other assets 

cash used in investing activities during 2012 primarily resulted from 487 billion for the net purchase of marketable securities 124 billion for capital expenditures related to the purchase of servers network infrastructure and the construction of data centers as well as 911 million for the acquisition of businesses and other assets such as patents the increase in cash used in investing activities during 2012 compared to 2011 was mainly due to increases in the purchase of marketable securities the acquisition of businesses and other assets and capital expenditures

 in addition our other liabilities include 119 billion  related to uncertain tax positions as of december 31 2014  due to uncertainties in the timing of the completion of tax audits the timing of the resolution of these positions is uncertain and we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years beyond 12 months as a result this amount is not included in the above contractual obligations table 

contingencies 

we are involved in claims lawsuits government investigations and proceedings we record a provision for a liability when we believe that it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated significant judgment is required to determine both probability and the estimated amount such legal proceedings are inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties some of which are beyond our control should any of these estimates and assumptions change or prove to be incorrect it could have a material impact on our results of operations financial position and cash flows

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend we are exposed to market risks including changes to foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and inflation 

foreign currency exchange risk 

we have foreign currency risks related to our revenue and operating expenses denominated in currencies other than the us dollar primarily the euro in general we are a net receiver of currencies other than the us dollar accordingly changes in exchange rates and in particular a strengthening of the us dollar will negatively affect our revenue and other operating results as expressed in us dollars 

we have experienced and will continue to experience fluctuations in our net income as a result of transaction gains or losses related to revaluing certain current asset and current liability balances that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the entities in which they are recorded at this time we have not entered into but in the future we may enter into derivatives or other financial instruments in an attempt to hedge our foreign currency exchange risk it is difficult to predict the effect hedging activities would have on our results of operations we recognized foreign currency losses of 87 million  14 million  and 9 million  in 2014  2013  and 2012  respectively 

interest rate sensitivity 

our exposure to changes in interest rates relates primarily to interest earned and market value on our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities 

our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities consist of cash certificates of deposit time deposits money market funds us government securities us government agency securities and corporate debt securities  our investment policy and strategy are focused on preservation of capital and supporting our liquidity requirements changes in us interest rates affect the interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities and the market value of those securities a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would result in a decrease of approximately 63 million  and 73 million  in the market value of our availableforsale debt securities as of december 31 2014  and december 31 2013  respectively any realized gains or losses resulting from such interest rate changes would only occur if we sold the investments prior to maturity

government regulation   

we are subject to a number of us federal and state and foreign laws and regulations that affect companies conducting business on the internet many of these laws and regulations are still evolving and being tested in courts and could be interpreted in ways that could harm our business these may involve user privacy rights of publicity data protection content intellectual property distribution electronic contracts and other communications competition protection of minors consumer protection taxation and online payment 

services in particular we are subject to federal state and foreign laws regarding privacy and protection of user data foreign data protection privacy and other laws and regulations can be more restrictive than those in the united states us federal and state and foreign laws and regulations are constantly evolving and can be subject to significant change in addition the application and interpretation of these laws and regulations are often uncertain particularly in the new and rapidlyevolving industry in which we operate and may be interpreted and applied inconsistently from country to country and inconsistently with our current policies and practices there are also a number of legislative proposals pending before the us congress various state legislative bodies and foreign governments concerning data protection which could affect us for example the european commission is currently considering a data protection regulation that may include operational requirements for companies that receive personal data that are different than those currently in place in the european union and that may also include significant penalties for noncompliance 

in august 2012 the ftc approved a settlement agreement with us to resolve an investigation into various practices that among other things requires us to complete biannual independent privacy assessments and to establish and refine certain practices with respect to treatment of user information and the privacy settings we offer violation of existing or future regulatory orders or consent decrees could subject us to substantial monetary fines and other penalties that could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations 

various laws and regulations in the united states and abroad such as the bank secrecy act the doddfrank act the usa patriot act and the credit card act impose certain antimoney laundering requirements on companies that are financial institutions or that provide financial products and services under these laws and regulations financial institutions are broadly defined to include money services businesses such as money transmitters check cashers and sellers or issuers of stored value requirements imposed on financial institutions under these laws include customer identification and verification programs record retention policies and procedures and transaction reporting to increase flexibility in how our use of payments may evolve and to mitigate regulatory uncertainty we have received certain money transmitter licenses in the united states and expect to apply for certain regulatory licenses in europe which will generally require us to demonstrate compliance with many domestic and foreign laws relating to money transmission gift cards and other prepaid access instruments electronic funds transfers antimoney laundering counterterrorist financing gambling banking and lending and import and export restrictions

risk factors 

tableend certain factors may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations you should consider carefully the risks and uncertainties described below in addition to other information contained in this annual report on form 10k including our consolidated financial statements and related notes the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of or that we currently believe are not material may also become important factors that adversely affect our business if any of the following risks actually occurs our business financial condition results of operations and future prospects could be materially and adversely affected in that event the trading price of our class a common stock could decline and you could lose part or all of your investment 

risks related to our business and industry 

if we fail to retain existing users or add new users or if our users decrease their level of engagement with facebook our revenue financial results and business may be significantly harmed 

the size of our user base and our users level of engagement are critical to our success our financial performance has been and will continue to be significantly determined by our success in adding retaining and engaging active users we anticipate that our active user growth rate will continue to decline over time as the size of our active user base increases and as we achieve higher market penetration rates if people do not perceive our products to be useful reliable and trustworthy we may not be able to attract or retain users or otherwise maintain or increase the frequency and duration of their engagement a number of other social networking companies that achieved early popularity have since seen their active user bases or levels of engagement decline in some cases precipitously there is no guarantee that we will not experience a similar erosion of our active user base or engagement levels our user engagement patterns have changed over time and can be difficult to measure particularly as users engage increasingly via mobile devices and as we introduce new and different services any number of factors could potentially negatively affect user retention growth and engagement including if 

 13 

adverse media reports or other negative publicity or 

 if we are unable to maintain or increase our user base and user engagement our revenue and financial results may be adversely affected any decrease in user retention growth or engagement could render facebook less attractive to users developers and marketers which may have a material and adverse impact on our revenue business financial condition and results of operations to the extent our active user growth rate slows we will become increasingly dependent on our ability to maintain or increase levels of user engagement and monetization in order to drive revenue growth 

we generate a substantial majority of our revenue from advertising the loss of marketers or reduction in spending by marketers with facebook could seriously harm our business 

the substantial majority of our revenue is currently generated from third parties advertising on facebook for 2013 2012 and 2011 advertising accounted for 89  84  and 85  respectively of our revenue as is common in the industry our marketers do not have longterm advertising commitments with us many of our marketers spend only a relatively small portion of their overall advertising budget with us we expect our ability to grow advertising revenue will become increasingly dependent on our ability to generate revenue from ads displayed on mobile devices in addition marketers may view some of our products as experimental and unproven marketers will not continue to do business with us or they will reduce the prices they are willing to pay to advertise with us or the budgets they are willing to commit to us if we do not deliver ads in an effective manner or if they do not believe that their investment in advertising with us will generate a competitive return relative to other alternatives our advertising revenue could be adversely affected by a number of other factors including 

 14 

the occurrence of any of these or other factors could result in a reduction in demand for our ads which may reduce the prices we receive for our ads or cause marketers to stop advertising with us altogether either of which would negatively affect our revenue and financial results 

mobile advertising is new and evolving and growth in the use of facebook through our mobile products as a substitute for use on personal computers may negatively affect our revenue and financial results 

we had 945 million  mobile monthly active users maus in december 2013 while most of our mobile users also access facebook through personal computers we anticipate that the rate of growth in mobile usage will continue to be the primary driver of our growth for the foreseeable future and that usage through personal computers will decline worldwide including in key markets such as the united states and other developed markets in europe and asia for example during the fourth quarter of 2013 the number of mobile maus exceeded the number of maus using personal computers for the first time and the number of maus on personal computers declined relative to the third quarter of 2013 while our mobile advertising revenue continues to grow and comprised over half of our overall advertising revenue in the fourth quarter of 2013 the mobile advertising market remains a new and evolving market in addition we do not currently offer our payments infrastructure to applications on mobile devices if users increasingly access facebook mobile products as a substitute for access through personal computers and if we are unable to continue to grow mobile revenues or successfully monetize mobile users or if we incur excessive expenses in these efforts our financial performance and ability to grow revenue would be negatively affected 

facebook user growth engagement and monetization on mobile devices depend upon effective operation with mobile operating systems networks and standards that we do not control 

there is no guarantee that popular mobile devices will continue to feature facebook or that mobile device users will continue to use facebook rather than competing products we are dependent on the interoperability of facebook with popular mobile operating systems that we do not control such as android and ios and any changes in such systems and terms of service that degrade our products functionality give preferential treatment to competitive products or prevent our ability to show ads could adversely affect facebook usage and monetization on mobile devices additionally in order to deliver high quality mobile products it is important that our products work well with a range of mobile technologies systems networks and standards that we do not control we may not be successful in developing relationships with key participants in the mobile industry or in developing products that operate effectively with these technologies systems networks or standards in the event that it is more difficult for our users to access and use facebook on their mobile devices or if our users choose not to access or use facebook on their mobile devices or use mobile products that do not offer access to facebook our user growth and user engagement could be harmed 

our business is highly competitive competition presents an ongoing threat to the success of our business 

we face significant competition in every aspect of our business including from companies that provide tools to facilitate the sharing of information companies that enable marketers to display advertising and companies that provide development platforms for applications developers we compete with companies that offer fullfeatured products that replicate the range of communications and related capabilities we provide these offerings include for example google which google has integrated with certain of its products including search and android as well as other largely regional social networks that have strong positions in particular countries we also compete with companies that develop applications particularly mobile applications that provide social functionality such as messaging photo and videosharing and microblogging and companies that provide web and mobilebased information and entertainment products and services that are designed to engage users and capture time spent online and on mobile devices in addition we face competition from traditional and online businesses that provide media for marketers to reach their audiences andor   develop tools and systems for managing and optimizing advertising campaigns 

some of our current and potential competitors may have significantly greater resources or better competitive positions in certain product segments geographic regions or user demographics than we do these factors may allow our competitors to respond more effectively than us to new or emerging technologies and changes in market conditions we believe that some of our users particularly our younger users are aware of and actively engaging with other products and services similar to or as a substitute for facebook and we believe that some of our users have reduced their engagement with facebook in favor of increased engagement with these other products and services for example in the third quarter of 2013 the best data available to us suggested that while usage by us teens overall was stable daus among younger teens in the united states had declined in the event that our users increasingly engage with other products and services we may experience a decline in user engagement in key user demographics or more broadly and our business could be harmed 

our competitors may develop products features or services that are similar to ours or that achieve greater acceptance may undertake more farreaching and successful product development efforts or marketing campaigns or may adopt more aggressive pricing policies in addition developers whose mobile and web applications are integrated with facebook may use information shared by our users through facebook in order to develop products or features that compete with us certain competitors including google could use strong or dominant positions in one or more markets to gain competitive advantage against us in areas where we operate 

including by integrating competing social networking platforms or features into products they control such as search engines web browsers or mobile device operating systems by making acquisitions by limiting or denying our access to advertising measurement or delivery systems or by making access to facebook more difficult as a result our competitors may acquire and engage users at the expense of the growth or engagement of our user base which may negatively affect our business and financial results 

we believe that our ability to compete effectively depends upon many factors both within and beyond our control including 

 if we are not able to compete effectively our user base and level of user engagement may decrease we may become less attractive to developers and marketers and our revenue and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected 

we may not be successful in our efforts to grow usage of and engagement with mobile and web applications that integrate with facebook 

we have made and are continuing to make investments to enable developers to build mobile and web applications that integrate with facebook such existing and prospective developers may not be successful in building mobile andor web applications that create and maintain user engagement additionally developers may choose to build on other platforms including mobile platforms controlled by third parties rather than building products that integrate with facebook we are continuously seeking to balance the distribution objectives of our developers with our desire to provide an optimal user experience and we may not be successful in achieving a balance that continues to attract and retain such developers for example from time to time we have taken actions to reduce the volume of communications from these developers to users on facebook with the objective of enhancing the user experience and such actions have reduced distribution from user engagement with and our monetization opportunities from facebookintegrated mobile and web applications in some instances these actions as well as other actions to enforce our policies applicable to developers have adversely affected our relationships with such developers if we are not successful in our efforts to grow the number of developers that choose to build products that integrate with facebook or if we are unable to build and maintain good relations with such developers our user growth and user engagement and our financial results may be adversely affected 

we may not be successful in our efforts to further monetize how developers use facebook 

we currently generate revenue from developers that use facebook in several ways including ads on pages generated by developers applications on the facebook website direct advertising on facebook purchased by developers to drive traffic to their mobile and web applications and fees from developers use of our payments infrastructure to sell virtual and digital goods to users accessing facebook via personal computers applications built by developers of social games are currently responsible for substantially all of our revenue derived from payments and the majority of the revenue from these applications has historically been generated by a limited number of the most popular games in addition a relatively small percentage of our users have transacted with facebook payments if the facebookintegrated applications that currently generate revenue fail to grow or maintain their users and engagement if developers do not continue to introduce new applications that attract users and create engagement on facebook if developers reduce their advertising on facebook if we fail to maintain good relationships with existing developers or to attract new developers who build products that integrate with facebook or if facebookintegrated applications outside of social games do not gain popularity and generate significant revenue for us our financial performance and ability to grow revenue could be adversely affected 

additionally we are actively supporting developers efforts to develop their own mobile and web applications that integrate with facebook unlike applications that run within the facebook website which enable us to show ads and offer payments we generally do not directly monetize from developers integrating their own mobile and web applications with facebook therefore our developers efforts to prioritize their own mobile or web applications may reduce or slow the growth of our user activity that generates advertising and payments opportunities which could negatively affect our revenue although we believe that there are significant longterm benefits to facebook resulting from increased engagement on facebookintegrated mobile and web applications these benefits may not offset the possible loss of revenue in which case our business could be harmed 

action by governments to restrict access to facebook in their countries could substantially harm our business and financial results 

it is possible that governments of one or more countries may seek to censor content available on facebook in their country restrict access to facebook from their country entirely or impose other restrictions that may affect the accessibility of facebook in their country for an extended period of time or indefinitely for example access to facebook has been or is currently restricted in whole or in part in china iran and north korea in addition governments in other countries may seek to restrict access to facebook if they consider us to be in violation of their laws in the event that access to facebook is restricted in whole or in part in one or more countries or our competitors are able to successfully penetrate geographic markets that we cannot access our ability to retain or increase our user base and user engagement may be adversely affected we may not be able to maintain or grow our revenue as anticipated and our financial results could be adversely affected 

our new products and changes to existing products could fail to attract or retain users or generate revenue 

our ability to retain increase and engage our user base and to increase our revenue depends heavily on our ability to create successful new products both independently and in conjunction with developers or other third parties we may introduce significant changes to our existing products or develop and introduce new and unproven products including using technologies with which we have little or no prior development or operating experience if new or enhanced products fail to engage users developers or marketers we may fail to attract or retain users or to generate sufficient revenue operating margin or other value to justify our investments and our business may be adversely affected in the future we may invest in new products and initiatives to generate revenue but there is no guarantee these approaches will be successful for example we recently began showing ads on instagram in the united states and we cannot assure you that these ads will generate meaningful revenue for our business if we are not successful with new products or new approaches to monetization we may not be able to maintain or grow our revenue as anticipated or recover any associated development costs and our financial results could be adversely affected 

we prioritize user growth and engagement and the user experience over shortterm financial results 

we frequently make product decisions that may reduce our shortterm revenue or profitability if we believe that the decisions are consistent with our mission and benefit the aggregate user experience and will thereby improve our financial performance over the long term for example from time to time we may change the size frequency or relative prominence of ads in order to improve ad quality and overall user experience similarly from time to time we update our news feed ranking algorithm to deliver the most relevant content to our users which may adversely affect the distribution of content of developers and marketers and could reduce their incentive to invest in their development and marketing efforts on facebook we also may introduce changes to existing products or introduce new standalone products that direct users away from properties where we have a proven means of monetization for example we have taken action to redirect users who send messages from within the facebook application to our standalone messenger application although we currently do not monetize the standalone messenger application in addition we plan to focus on growing the user base for instagram and potentially other standalone applications that may have limited or no monetization and it is possible that these efforts may reduce engagement with the core facebook application these decisions may not produce the longterm benefits that we expect in which case our user growth and engagement our relationships with developers and marketers and our business and results of operations could be harmed 

if we are not able to maintain and enhance our brand or if events occur that damage our reputation and brand our ability to expand our base of users developers and marketers may be impaired and our business and financial results may be harmed 

we believe that the facebook brand has significantly contributed to the success of our business we also believe that maintaining and enhancing our brand is critical to expanding our base of users developers and marketers many of our new users are referred by existing users maintaining and enhancing our brand will depend largely on our ability to continue to provide useful reliable trustworthy and innovative products which we may not do successfully we may introduce new products or terms of service that users do not like which may negatively affect our brand additionally the actions of our developers may affect our brand if users do not have a positive experience using thirdparty mobile and web applications integrated with facebook we have in the past experienced and we expect that in the future we will continue to experience media legislative or regulatory scrutiny of our decisions regarding user privacy or other issues which may adversely affect our reputation and brand we also may fail to provide adequate customer service which could erode confidence in our brand our brand may also be negatively affected by the actions of users that are deemed to be hostile or inappropriate to other users or by users acting under false or inauthentic identities or by perceived or actual efforts by governments to obtain access to user information for securityrelated purposes maintaining and enhancing our brand may require us to make substantial investments and these investments may not be successful if we fail to successfully promote and maintain the facebook brand or if we incur excessive expenses in this effort our business and financial results may be adversely affected 

improper access to or disclosure of user information or violation of our terms of service or policies could harm our reputation and adversely affect our business 

our data use policy governs the collection and use of information we receive in connection with our services our efforts to protect the information we receive may be unsuccessful due to the actions of third parties software bugs or other technical malfunctions employee error or malfeasance government surveillance or other factors in addition third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or users to disclose information in order to gain access to our data or our users data if any of these events occur our users information could be accessed or disclosed improperly some of our developers or other partners such as those that help us measure the effectiveness of ads may receive or store information provided by us or by our users through mobile or web applications integrated with facebook if these third parties or developers fail to adopt or adhere to adequate data security practices or fail to comply with our terms and policies or in the event of a breach of their networks our users data may be improperly accessed used or disclosed 

any incidents involving unauthorized access to or improper use of user information or incidents involving violation of our terms of service or policies including our data use policy could damage our reputation and our brand and diminish our competitive position in addition the affected users or government authorities could initiate legal or regulatory actions against us in connection with such incidents which could cause us to incur significant expense and liability or result in orders or consent decrees forcing us to modify our business practices any of these events could have a material and adverse effect on our business reputation or financial results 

unfavorable media coverage could negatively affect our business 

we receive a high degree of media coverage around the world unfavorable publicity regarding for example our privacy practices product changes product quality litigation or regulatory activity government surveillance the actions of our developers whose products are integrated with facebook the actions of our users or the actions of other companies that provide similar services to us could adversely affect our reputation such negative publicity also could have an adverse effect on the size engagement and loyalty of our user base and result in decreased revenue which could adversely affect our business and financial results 

our financial results will fluctuate from quarter to quarter and are difficult to predict 

our quarterly financial results have fluctuated in the past and will fluctuate in the future additionally we have a limited operating history with the current scale of our business which makes it difficult to forecast our future results as a result you should not rely upon our past quarterly financial results as indicators of future performance you should take into account the risks and uncertainties frequently encountered by companies in rapidly evolving markets our financial results in any given quarter can be influenced by numerous factors many of which we are unable to predict or are outside of our control including 

 18 

 we expect our rates of growth may decline in the future 

we believe that our rates of user and revenue growth may decline over time while we have recently experienced increased revenue growth compared to prior periods we expect that our user growth and revenue growth rates will decline over time as the size of our active user base increases and as we achieve greater market penetration for example our maus grew 16  from december 31 2012 to 2013 25 from december 31 2011 to 2012 and 39 from 2010 to 2011 historically our user growth has been a primary driver of growth in our revenue as our growth rates decline investors perceptions of our business may be adversely affected and the trading price of our class a common stock could decline 

our costs are continuing to grow which could harm our business and profitability 

operating our business is costly and we expect our expenses to continue to increase in the future as we broaden our user base as users increase the number of connections and amount of data they share with us and as we develop and implement new products historically our costs have increased each year due to these factors and we expect to continue to incur increasing costs in particular for servers storage power and data centers to support our anticipated future growth we expect to continue to invest in these and other efforts to operate and expand our business around the world including in countries andor projects where we may not have a clear path to monetization such as our commitment to the internetorg initiative to increase global internet access in addition our costs may increase as we hire additional employees particularly as a result of the significant competition that we face to attract and retain technical talent our expenses may grow faster than our revenue and may be greater than we anticipate in a particular period or over time and our investments may not be successful in addition we may increase marketing sales and other operating expenses in order to grow and expand our operations and to remain competitive increases in our costs may adversely affect our business and profitability 

our business is subject to complex and evolving us and foreign laws and regulations regarding privacy data protection and other matters many of these laws and regulations are subject to change and uncertain interpretation and could result in claims changes to our business practices monetary penalties increased cost of operations or declines in user growth or engagement or otherwise harm our business 

we are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the united states and abroad that involve matters central to our business including user privacy rights of publicity data protection content intellectual property advertising marketing distribution electronic contracts and other communications competition protection of minors consumer protection taxation securities law compliance and online payment services the introduction of new products or expansion of our activities in certain jurisdictions may subject us to additional laws and regulations in addition foreign data protection privacy and other laws and regulations can be more restrictive than those in the united states these us federal and state and foreign laws and regulations which can be enforced by private parties or government entities are constantly evolving and can be subject to significant change in addition the application and interpretation of these laws and regulations are often uncertain particularly in the new and rapidly evolving industry in which we operate and may be interpreted and applied inconsistently from country to country and inconsistently with our current policies and practices for example the interpretation of some laws and regulations that govern the use of names and likenesses in connection with advertising and marketing activities is unsettled and developments in this area could affect the manner in which we design our products as well as our terms of use a number of proposals are pending before federal state and foreign legislative and regulatory bodies that could significantly affect our business for example the european commission is currently considering a data protection regulation that may include operational requirements for companies that receive personal data that are different than those currently in place in the european union and that may also include significant penalties for noncompliance similarly there have been a number of recent legislative proposals in the united states at both the federal and state level that would impose new obligations in areas such as privacy and liability for copyright infringement by third parties in addition some countries are considering legislation requiring local storage and processing of data that if enacted could increase the cost and complexity of delivering our services these existing and proposed laws and regulations can be costly to comply with and can delay or impede the development of new products result in negative publicity increase our operating costs require significant management time and attention and subject us to inquiries or investigations claims or other remedies including fines or demands that we modify or cease existing business practices 

we have been subject to regulatory investigations and settlements and we expect to continue to be subject to such proceedings in the future which could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner materially adverse to our business 

from time to time we receive formal and informal inquiries from regulators regarding our compliance with laws and other matters in 2012 the federal trade commission approved a settlement agreement with us that among other things requires us to complete biannual independent privacy assessments and to establish and refine certain practices with respect to treatment of user information and the privacy settings we offer in 2011 and 2012 the irish data protection commissioner audited the data security and privacy practices and policies of facebook ireland we expect to continue to be the subject of regulatory investigations and audits in the future by these and other regulators throughout the world 

violation of existing or future regulatory orders or consent decrees could subject us to substantial monetary fines and other penalties that could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations in addition it is possible that future orders issued by or inquiries or enforcement actions initiated by regulatory authorities could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner materially adverse to our business 

if we are unable to protect our intellectual property the value of our brand and other intangible assets may be diminished and our business may be adversely affected 

we rely and expect to continue to rely on a combination of confidentiality and license agreements with our employees consultants and third parties with whom we have relationships as well as trademark copyright patent trade secret and domain name protection laws to protect our proprietary rights in the united states and internationally we have filed various applications for protection of certain aspects of our intellectual property and we currently hold a number of issued patents in multiple jurisdictions and have acquired patents and patent applications from third parties in addition in the future we may acquire additional patents or patent portfolios which could require significant cash expenditures third parties may knowingly or unknowingly infringe our proprietary rights third parties may challenge proprietary rights held by us and pending and future trademark and patent applications may not be approved in addition effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which we operate or intend to operate our business in any or all of these cases we may be required to expend significant time and expense in order to prevent infringement or to enforce our rights although we have taken measures to protect our proprietary rights there can be no assurance that others will not offer products or concepts that are substantially similar to ours and compete with our business in addition we regularly contribute software source code under open source licenses and have made other technology we developed available under other open licenses and we include open source software in our products for example we have contributed certain specifications and designs related to our data center equipment to the open compute project foundation a nonprofit entity that shares and develops such information with the technology community under the open web foundation license as a result of our open source contributions and the use of open source in our products we may license or be required to license or disclose code andor innovations that turn out to be material to our business and may also be exposed to increased litigation risk if the protection of our proprietary rights is inadequate to prevent unauthorized use or appropriation by third parties the value of our brand and other intangible assets may be diminished and competitors may be able to more effectively mimic our service and methods of operations any of these events could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results 

we are currently and expect to be in the future party to patent lawsuits and other intellectual property rights claims that are expensive and time consuming and if resolved adversely could have a significant impact on our business financial condition or results of operations 

companies in the internet technology and media industries own large numbers of patents copyrights trademarks and trade secrets and frequently enter into litigation based on allegations of infringement misappropriation or other violations of intellectual property or other rights in addition various nonpracticing entities that own patents and other intellectual property rights often attempt to aggressively assert their rights in order to extract value from technology companies furthermore from time to time we may introduce new products including in areas where we currently do not compete which could increase our exposure to patent and other intellectual property claims from competitors and nonpracticing entities 

from time to time we receive notice letters from patent holders alleging that certain of our products and services infringe their patent rights we presently are involved in a number of intellectual property lawsuits and as we face increasing competition and gain an increasingly high profile we expect the number of patent and other intellectual property claims against us to grow defending patent and other intellectual property litigation is costly and can impose a significant burden on management and employees and there can be no assurances that favorable final outcomes will be obtained in all cases in addition plaintiffs may seek and we may become subject to preliminary or provisional rulings in the course of any such litigation including potential preliminary injunctions requiring us to cease some or all of our operations we may decide to settle such lawsuits and disputes on terms that are unfavorable to us similarly if any litigation to which we are a party is resolved adversely we may be subject to an unfavorable judgment that may not be reversed upon appeal the terms of such a settlement or judgment may require us to cease some or all of our operations or pay substantial amounts to the other party in addition we may have to seek a license to continue practices found to be in violation of a third partys rights which may not be available on reasonable terms or at all and may significantly increase our operating costs and expenses as a result we may also be required to develop alternative noninfringing technology or practices or discontinue the practices the development of alternative noninfringing technology or practices could require significant effort and expense or may not be feasible our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected as a result of an unfavorable resolution of the disputes and litigation referred to above 

we are involved in numerous class action lawsuits and other litigation matters that are expensive and time consuming and if resolved adversely could harm our business financial condition or results of operations 

in addition to intellectual property claims we are also involved in numerous other lawsuits including putative class action lawsuits brought by users and marketers many of which claim statutory damages or seek significant changes to our business operations and we anticipate that we will continue to be a target for numerous lawsuits in the future because we have over a billion users the plaintiffs in class action cases filed against us typically claim enormous monetary damages even if the alleged peruser harm is small or nonexistent any negative outcome from such lawsuits could result in payments of substantial monetary damages or fines or undesirable changes to our products or business practices and accordingly our business financial condition or results of operations 

could be materially and adversely affected although the results of such lawsuits and claims cannot be predicted with certainty we do not believe that the final outcome of those matters relating to our products that we currently face will have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations in addition we are currently the subject of stockholder class action suits in connection with our ipo we believe these lawsuits are without merit and are vigorously defending these lawsuits 

there can be no assurances that a favorable final outcome will be obtained in all our cases and defending any lawsuit is costly and can impose a significant burden on management and employees any litigation to which we are a party may result in an onerous or unfavorable judgment that may not be reversed upon appeal or in payments of substantial monetary damages or fines or we may decide to settle lawsuits on similarly unfavorable terms which could adversely affect our business financial conditions or results of operations 

our ceo has control over key decision making as a result of his control of a majority of our voting stock 

mark zuckerberg our founder chairman and ceo is able to exercise voting rights with respect to a majority of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock and therefore has the ability to control the outcome of matters submitted to our stockholders for approval including the election of directors and any merger consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets this concentrated control could delay defer or prevent a change of control merger consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets that our other stockholders support or conversely this concentrated control could result in the consummation of such a transaction that our other stockholders do not support this concentrated control could also discourage a potential investor from acquiring our class a common stock due to the limited voting power of such stock relative to the class b common stock and might harm the trading price of our class a common stock in addition mr zuckerberg has the ability to control the management and major strategic investments of our company as a result of his position as our ceo and his ability to control the election or replacement of our directors in the event of his death the shares of our capital stock that mr zuckerberg owns will be transferred to the persons or entities that he designates as a board member and officer mr zuckerberg owes a fiduciary duty to our stockholders and must act in good faith in a manner he reasonably believes to be in the best interests of our stockholders as a stockholder even a controlling stockholder mr zuckerberg is entitled to vote his shares and shares over which he has voting control as a result of voting agreements in his own interests which may not always be in the interests of our stockholders generally 

we plan to continue to make acquisitions which could require significant management attention disrupt our business result in dilution to our stockholders and adversely affect our financial results 

as part of our business strategy we have made and intend to make acquisitions to add specialized employees complementary companies products or technologies our ability to acquire and integrate larger or more complex companies products or technologies in a successful manner is unproven   in the future we may not be able to find other suitable acquisition candidates and we may not be able to complete acquisitions on favorable terms if at all any future acquisitions we complete could be viewed negatively by users developers marketers or investors and our acquisitions may not achieve our goals for example in august 2012 we acquired instagram and since the acquisition we have been focused on user growth and the users experience we just recently began showing ads on instagram in the united states and we cannot assure you that these ads will generate meaningful revenue for our business in addition if we fail to successfully close or integrate any acquisitions integrate the products or technologies associated with such acquisitions into our company or identify and address liabilities associated with the acquired business or assets our business revenue and operating results could be adversely affected any integration process may require significant time and resources and we may not be able to manage the process successfully we may not successfully evaluate or utilize the acquired products technology or personnel or accurately forecast the financial impact of an acquisition transaction including accounting charges in addition our ability to conduct due diligence with respect to acquisitions and our ability to evaluate the results of such due diligence is dependent upon the accuracy and completeness of statements and disclosures made or actions taken by the companies we acquire or their representatives despite our efforts there could be significant liabilities or deficiencies associated with the business assets products financial condition or accounting practices related to the assets or companies we acquire in addition we may have to pay cash or incur debt to pay for acquisitions which could adversely affect our financial results and liquidity additionally we may issue equity securities to pay for acquisitions or to retain the employees of the acquired company which could increase our expenses adversely affect our financial results and result in dilution to our stockholders the incurrence of indebtedness would result in increased fixed obligations and could also include covenants or other restrictions that would impede our ability to manage our operations 

our business is dependent on our ability to maintain and scale our technical infrastructure and any significant disruption in our service could damage our reputation result in a potential loss of users and engagement and adversely affect our financial results 

our reputation and ability to attract retain and serve our users is dependent upon the reliable performance of our products and our underlying technical infrastructure our systems may not be adequately designed with the necessary reliability and redundancy to avoid performance delays or outages that could be harmful to our business if facebook is unavailable when users attempt to access it or if it does not load as quickly as they expect users may not use our products as often in the future or at all as our user base and the amount and types of information shared on facebook continue to grow we will need an increasing amount of technical infrastructure including network capacity and computing power to continue to satisfy the needs of our users it is possible that we may fail to effectively scale and grow our technical infrastructure to accommodate these increased demands in addition our business may be subject to interruptions delays or failures resulting from earthquakes adverse weather conditions other natural disasters power loss terrorism or other catastrophic events 

a substantial portion of our network infrastructure is provided by third parties any disruption or failure in the services we receive from these providers could harm our ability to handle existing or increased traffic and could significantly harm our business any financial or other difficulties these providers face may adversely affect our business and we exercise little control over these providers which increases our vulnerability to problems with the services they provide 

we could experience unforeseen difficulties in building and operating key portions of our technical infrastructure 

we have designed and built our own data centers and key portions of our technical infrastructure through which we serve our products and we plan to continue to significantly expand the size of our infrastructure primarily through data centers and other projects the infrastructure expansion we are undertaking is complex and unanticipated delays in the completion of these projects or availability of components may lead to increased project costs operational inefficiencies or interruptions in the delivery or degradation of the quality of our products in addition there may be issues related to this infrastructure that are not identified during the testing phases of design and implementation which may only become evident after we have started to fully utilize the underlying equipment that could further degrade the user experience or increase our costs 

our products and internal systems rely on software that is highly technical and if it contains undetected errors our business could be adversely affected          

our products and internal systems rely on software that is highly technical and complex in addition our products and internal systems depend on the ability of our software to store retrieve process and manage immense amounts of data our software has contained and may now or in the future contain undetected errors bugs or vulnerabilities some errors in our software may only be discovered after the code has been released for external or internal use errors or other design defects within our software may result in a negative experience for users and marketers who use our products delay product introductions or enhancements or result in measurement or billing errors any errors bugs or defects discovered in our software could result in damage to our reputation loss of users loss of revenue or liability for damages any of which could adversely affect our business and financial results 

certain of our user metrics are subject to inherent challenges in measurement and real or perceived inaccuracies in such metrics may harm our reputation and negatively affect our business 

the numbers for our key metrics which include our daus mobile daus maus mobile maus and average revenue per user arpu as well as certain other metrics such as mobileonly daus and mobileonly maus are calculated using internal company data based on the activity of user accounts while these numbers are based on what we believe to be reasonable estimates of our user base for the applicable period of measurement there are inherent challenges in measuring usage of our products across large online and mobile populations around the world for example there may be individuals who maintain one or more facebook accounts in violation of our terms of service we estimate for example that duplicate accounts an account that a user maintains in addition to his or her principal account may have represented between approximately 43 and 79 of our worldwide maus in 2013 we also seek to identify false accounts which we divide into two categories 1 usermisclassified accounts where users have created personal profiles for a business organization or nonhuman entity such as a pet such entities are permitted on facebook using a page rather than a personal profile under our terms of service and 2 undesirable accounts which represent user profiles that we determine are intended to be used for purposes that violate our terms of service such as spamming in 2013 for example we estimate usermisclassified accounts may have represented between approximately 08 and 21 of our worldwide maus and undesirable accounts may have represented between approximately 04 and 12 of our worldwide maus we believe the percentage of accounts that are duplicate or false is meaningfully lower in developed markets such as the united states or united kingdom and higher in developing markets such as india and turkey however these estimates are based on an internal review of a limited sample of accounts and we apply significant judgment in making this determination such as identifying names that appear to be fake or other behavior that appears inauthentic to the reviewers as such our estimation of duplicate or false accounts may not accurately represent the actual number of such accounts we are continually seeking to improve our ability to identify duplicate or false accounts and estimate the total number of such accounts and such estimates may change due to improvements or changes in our methodology due 

to inherent variability in such estimates at particular dates of measurement we disclose these estimates as a range over a recent period 

our data limitations may affect our understanding of certain details of our business for example while userprovided data indicates a decline in usage among younger users this age data is unreliable because a disproportionate number of our younger users register with an inaccurate age in the third quarter of 2013 we worked with third parties to develop models to analyze user data by age in the united states these models suggested that usage by us teens overall was stable but that daus among younger us teens had declined the data and models we are using are not precise and our understanding of usage by age group may not be complete 

some of our historical metrics through the second quarter of 2012 have also been affected by applications on certain mobile devices that automatically contact our servers for regular updates with no user action involved and this activity can cause our system to count the user associated with such a device as an active user on the day such contact occurs for example we estimate that less than 5 of our estimated worldwide daus as of december 31 2011 and 2010 resulted from this type of automatic mobile activity and that this type of activity had a substantially smaller effect on our estimate of worldwide maus and mobile maus the impact of this automatic activity on our metrics varied by geography because mobile usage varies in different regions of the world in addition our data regarding the geographic location of our users is estimated based on a number of factors such as the users ip address and selfdisclosed location these factors may not always accurately reflect the users actual location for example a mobileonly user may appear to be accessing facebook from the location of the proxy server that the user connects to rather than from the users actual location the methodologies used to measure user metrics may also be susceptible to algorithm or other technical errors for example in early june 2012 we discovered an error in the algorithm we use to estimate the geographic location of our users that affected our attribution of certain user locations for the period ended march 31 2012 while this issue did not affect our overall worldwide dau and mau numbers it did affect our attribution of users across different geographic regions we estimate that the number of maus as of march 31 2012 for the united states  canada region was overstated as a result of the error by approximately 3 and this overstatement was offset by understatements in other regions the number of such users for the period ended march 31 2012 disclosed in managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  trends in our user metrics reflect the reclassification to more correctly attribute users by geographic region our estimates for revenue by user location and revenue by user device are also affected by these factors we regularly review and may adjust our processes for calculating these metrics to improve their accuracy in addition our dau and mau estimates will differ from estimates published by third parties due to differences in methodology for example some third parties are not able to accurately measure mobile users or do not count mobile users for certain user groups or at all in their analyses if marketers developers or investors do not perceive our user metrics to be accurate representations of our user base or if we discover material inaccuracies in our user metrics our reputation may be harmed and marketers and developers may be less willing to allocate their budgets or resources to facebook which could negatively affect our business and financial results 

we cannot assure you that we will effectively manage our growth 

our employee headcount and the scope and complexity of our business have increased significantly with the number of employees increasing to 6337  as of december 31 2013 from 4619  as of december 31 2012 and we expect headcount growth to continue for the foreseeable future the growth and expansion of our business and products create significant challenges for our management operational and financial resources including managing multiple relations with users marketers developers and other third parties in the event of continued growth of our operations or in the number of our thirdparty relationships our information technology systems or our internal controls and procedures may not be adequate to support our operations in addition some members of our management do not have significant experience managing a large global business operation so our management may not be able to manage such growth effectively to effectively manage our growth we must continue to improve our operational financial and management processes and systems and to effectively expand train and manage our employee base as our organization continues to grow and we are required to implement more complex organizational management structures we may find it increasingly difficult to maintain the benefits of our corporate culture including our ability to quickly develop and launch new and innovative products this could negatively affect our business performance 

the loss of one or more of our key personnel or our failure to attract and retain other highly qualified personnel in the future could harm our business 

we currently depend on the continued services and performance of our key personnel including mark zuckerberg and sheryl k sandberg although we have entered into employment agreements with mr zuckerberg and ms sandberg the agreements have no specific duration and constitute atwill employment in addition many of our key technologies and systems are custommade for our business by our personnel the loss of key personnel including members of management as well as key engineering product development marketing and sales personnel could disrupt our operations and have an adverse effect on our business 

as we continue to grow we cannot guarantee we will continue to attract the personnel we need to maintain our competitive position in particular we intend to continue to hire a significant number of technical personnel in 2014 and the foreseeable future and we expect to face significant competition from other companies in hiring such personnel particularly in the san francisco bay 

area as we mature the incentives to attract retain and motivate employees provided by our equity awards or by future arrangements may not be as effective as in the past and if we issue significant equity to attract additional employees the ownership of our existing stockholders may be further diluted additionally we have a number of current employees whose equity ownership in our company has provided them a substantial amount of personal wealth which could affect their decisions about whether or not to continue to work for us as a result of these factors it may be difficult for us to continue to retain and motivate our employees if we do not succeed in attracting hiring and integrating excellent personnel or retaining and motivating existing personnel we may be unable to grow effectively 

we may incur liability as a result of information retrieved from or transmitted over the internet or posted to facebook and claims related to our products 

we have faced currently face and will continue to face claims relating to information that is published or made available on facebook in particular the nature of our business exposes us to claims related to defamation intellectual property rights rights of publicity and privacy and personal injury torts this risk is enhanced in certain jurisdictions outside the united states where our protection from liability for thirdparty actions may be unclear and where we may be less protected under local laws than we are in the united states we could incur significant costs investigating and defending such claims and if we are found liable significant damages if any of these events occur our business and financial results could be adversely affected 

computer malware viruses hacking and phishing attacks and spamming could harm our business and results of operations 

computer malware viruses and computer hacking and phishing attacks have become more prevalent in our industry have occurred on our systems in the past and may occur on our systems in the future because of our prominence we believe that we are a particularly attractive target for such attacks though it is difficult to determine what if any harm may directly result from any specific interruption or attack any failure to maintain performance reliability security and availability of our products and technical infrastructure any such failure may harm our reputation our ability to retain existing users and attract new users and our results of operations 

in addition spammers attempt to use our products to send targeted and untargeted spam messages to users which may embarrass or annoy users and make facebook less userfriendly we cannot be certain that the technologies and employees that we have to attempt to defeat spamming attacks will be able to curb spam messages from being sent on our platform as a result of spamming activities our users may use facebook less or stop using our products altogether 

payment transactions on facebook may subject us to additional regulatory requirements and other risks that could be costly and difficult to comply with or that could harm our business 

our users can use facebook to purchase virtual and digital goods from developers that offer applications on the facebook website using our payments infrastructure we are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the united states europe and elsewhere including those governing antimoney laundering and counterterrorist financing money transmission gift cards and other prepaid access instruments and import and export restrictions depending on how our payments product evolves we may also be subject to other laws and regulations including those governing electronic funds transfers gambling banking and lending in some jurisdictions the application or interpretation of these laws and regulations is not clear to increase flexibility in how our use of payments may evolve and to mitigate regulatory uncertainty we have received certain money transmitter licenses in the united states and expect to apply for certain regulatory licenses in europe which will generally require us to demonstrate compliance with many domestic and foreign laws in these areas our efforts to comply with these laws and regulations could be costly and result in diversion of management time and effort and may still not guarantee compliance in the event that we are found to be in violation of any such legal or regulatory requirements we may be subject to monetary fines or other penalties such as a cease and desist order or we may be required to make product changes any of which could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results 

in addition we may be subject to a variety of additional risks as a result of payments on facebook including 

 25 

we plan to continue expanding our operations abroad where we have limited operating experience and may be subject to increased business and economic risks that could affect our financial results 

we plan to continue the international expansion of our business operations and the translation of our products we currently make facebook available in more than 70 different languages and we have offices or data centers in more than 25 different countries we may enter new international markets where we have limited or no experience in marketing selling and deploying our products for example we continue to evaluate making facebook generally available in china however this market has substantial legal and regulatory complexities that have prevented this to date if we fail to deploy or manage our operations in international markets successfully our business may suffer in addition we are subject to a variety of risks inherent in doing business internationally including 

 if we are unable to expand internationally and manage the complexity of our global operations successfully our financial results could be adversely affected 

we may incur a substantial amount of indebtedness which could adversely affect our financial condition 

in august 2013 we entered into a fiveyear senior unsecured revolving credit facility under which we may borrow up to 65 billion to fund working capital and general corporate purposes as of december 31 2013 no amounts were outstanding under this facility if we draw down on this facility in the future our interest expense and principal repayment requirements will increase significantly which could have an adverse effect on our financial results 

we may require additional capital to support our business growth and this capital may not be available on acceptable terms if at all 

we may require additional capital to support our business growth or to respond to business opportunities challenges or unforeseen circumstances our ability to obtain additional capital if and when required will depend on our business plans investor demand our operating performance the condition of the capital markets and other factors if we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity equitylinked or debt securities those securities may have rights preferences or privileges senior to the rights of our class a common stock and our existing stockholders may experience dilution if we are unable to obtain additional capital or are unable to obtain additional capital on satisfactory terms our ability to continue to support our business growth or to respond to business opportunities challenges or unforeseen circumstances could be adversely affected and our business may be harmed 

if we default on our leasing and credit obligations our operations may be interrupted and our business and financial results could be adversely affected 

we finance a significant portion of our expenditures through leasing arrangements some of which are not required to be reflected on our balance sheet and we may enter into additional similar arrangements in the future in particular we have used these types of 

arrangements to finance some of our equipment and data centers in addition we have a 65 billion revolving credit facility that we may draw upon to finance our operations or other corporate purposes if we default on these leasing and credit obligations our leasing partners and lenders may among other things 

 if some or all of these events were to occur our operations may be interrupted and our ability to fund our operations or obligations as well as our business financial results and financial condition could be adversely affected 

we may have exposure to greater than anticipated tax liabilities 

our income tax obligations are based in part on our corporate operating structure and intercompany arrangements including the manner in which we develop value and use our intellectual property and the valuations of our intercompany transactions the tax laws applicable to our business including the laws of the united states and other jurisdictions are subject to interpretation and certain jurisdictions are aggressively interpreting their laws in new ways in an effort to raise additional tax proceeds from companies such as facebook the taxing authorities of the jurisdictions in which we operate may challenge our methodologies for valuing developed technology or intercompany arrangements which could increase our worldwide effective tax rate and harm our financial position and results of operations we are subject to regular review and audit by us federal and state and foreign tax authorities tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken and any adverse outcome of such a review or audit could have a negative effect on our financial position and results of operations in addition the determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires significant judgment by management and there are many transactions where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain although we believe that our estimates are reasonable the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements and may materially affect our financial results in the period or periods for which such determination is made   in addition our future income taxes could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions that have lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions that have higher statutory tax rates by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities or by changes in tax laws regulations or accounting principles for example we have previously incurred losses in certain international subsidiaries that resulted in an effective tax rate that is significantly higher than the statutory tax rate in the united states and this could continue to happen in the future 

changes in tax laws or tax rulings could materially affect our financial position and results of operations 

changes in tax laws or tax rulings could materially affect our financial position and results of operations for example the current us administration and key members of congress have made public statements indicating that tax reform is a priority certain changes to us tax laws including limitations on the ability to defer us taxation on earnings outside of the united states until those earnings are repatriated to the united states could affect the tax treatment of our foreign earnings in addition many countries in the european union as well as a number of other countries and organizations such as the organization for economic cooperation and development are actively considering changes to existing tax laws certain proposals could include recommendations that would significantly increase our tax obligations in many countries where we do business due to the large and expanding scale of our international business activities any changes in the taxation of such activities may increase our worldwide effective tax rate and harm our financial position and results of operations 

risks related to ownership of our class a common stock 

the trading price of our class a common stock has been and will likely continue to be volatile 

the trading price of our class a common stock has been and is likely to continue to be volatile since shares of our class a common stock were sold in our ipo in may 2012 at a price of 3800 per share our stock price has ranged from 1755  to 5858  through december 31 2013 in addition to the factors discussed in this annual report on form 10k the trading price of our class a common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to numerous factors many of which are beyond our control including 

 27 

projections 

 in addition the stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many technology companies stock prices of many technology companies have fluctuated in a manner unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies we are currently subject to securities litigation in connection with our ipo we may experience more such litigation following future periods of volatility any securities litigation could subject us to substantial costs divert resources and the attention of management from our business and adversely affect our business 

if securities or industry analysts publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business our stock price could decline 

the trading market for our class a common stock depends in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business if one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade the rating of our class a common stock or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business our class a common stock price could decline 

we do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future 

we have never declared or paid cash dividends on our capital stock we currently intend to retain any future earnings to finance the operation and expansion of our business and we do not expect to declare or pay any dividends in the foreseeable future as a result you may only receive a return on your investment in our class a common stock if the trading price of our class a common stock increases in addition our credit facility contains restrictions on our ability to pay dividends 

if we are unable to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting in the future investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and the trading price of our class a common stock may be negatively affected 

we are subject to section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act sox which requires us to maintain internal controls over financial reporting and to report any material weaknesses in such internal controls we have consumed and will continue to consume management resources and incur expenses for sox compliance on an ongoing basis if we identify material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting or if we are unable to comply with the requirements of section 404 in a timely manner or assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and the trading price of our class a common stock could be negatively affected and we could become subject to investigations by the stock exchange on which our securities are listed the securities and exchange commission sec or other regulatory authorities which could require additional financial and management resources 

the requirements of being a public company may strain our resources and divert managements attention 

we also are subject to the reporting requirements of the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended the doddfrank act the listing requirements of the nasdaq global select market and other applicable securities rules and regulations compliance with these rules and regulations has increased and likely will continue to increase our legal and financial compliance costs make some activities more difficult timeconsuming or costly and increase demand on our systems and resources as a result managements attention may be diverted from other business concerns which could harm our business and operating results 

in addition complying with public disclosure rules makes our business more visible which we believe may result in threatened or actual litigation including by competitors and other third parties if such claims are successful our business and operating results could be harmed and even if the claims do not result in litigation or are resolved in our favor these claims and the time and resources necessary to resolve them could divert the resources of our management and harm our business and operating results 

the dual class structure of our common stock and the voting agreements among certain stockholders have the effect of concentrating voting control with our ceo and also with certain employees and directors and their affiliates this will limit or preclude your ability to influence corporate matters 

our class b common stock has ten votes per share and our class a common stock has one vote per share stockholders who hold shares of class b common stock including certain of our executive officers employees and directors and their affiliates together hold a substantial majority of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock because of the tentoone voting ratio between our class b and class a common stock the holders of our class b common stock collectively control a majority of the combined voting power of our common stock and therefore are able to control all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval so long as the shares of class b common stock represent at least 91 of all outstanding shares of our class a and class b common stock this concentrated control will limit or preclude your ability to influence corporate matters for the foreseeable future 

transfers by holders of class b common stock will generally result in those shares converting to class a common stock subject to limited exceptions such as certain transfers effected for estate planning or charitable purposes the conversion of class b common stock to class a common stock will have the effect over time of increasing the relative voting power of those holders of class b common stock who retain their shares in the long term if for example mr zuckerberg retains a significant portion of his holdings of class b common stock for an extended period of time he could in the future continue to control a majority of the combined voting power of our class a common stock and class b common stock 

we have elected to take advantage of the controlled company exemption to the corporate governance rules for nasdaqlisted companies which could make our class a common stock less attractive to some investors or otherwise harm our stock price 

because we qualify as a controlled company under the corporate governance rules for nasdaqlisted companies we are not required to have a majority of our board of directors be independent nor are we required to have a compensation committee or an independent nominating function in light of our status as a controlled company our board of directors determined not to have an independent nominating function and chose to have the full board of directors be directly responsible for nominating members of our board and in the future we could elect not to have a majority of our board of directors be independent or not to have a compensation committee accordingly should the interests of our controlling stockholder differ from those of other stockholders the other stockholders may not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the corporate governance rules for nasdaqlisted companies our status as a controlled company could make our class a common stock less attractive to some investors or otherwise harm our stock price 

delaware law and provisions in our restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws could make a merger tender offer or proxy contest difficult thereby depressing the trading price of our class a common stock 

our status as a delaware corporation and the antitakeover provisions of the delaware general corporation law may discourage 

delay or prevent a change in control by prohibiting us from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years after the person becomes an interested stockholder even if a change of control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders in addition our restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that may make the acquisition of our company more difficult including the following

tableend paul d ceglia filed suit against us and mark zuckerberg on or about june 30 2010 in the supreme court of the state of new york for the county of allegheny claiming substantial ownership of our company based on a purported contract between mr ceglia and mr zuckerberg allegedly entered into in april 2003 we removed the case to the us district court for the western district of new york where the case is now pending in his first amended complaint filed on april 11 2011 mr ceglia revised his claims to include an alleged partnership with mr zuckerberg he revised his claims for relief to seek a substantial share of mr zuckerbergs ownership in us and he included quotations from supposed emails that he claims to have exchanged with mr zuckerberg in 2003 and 2004 on march 26 2012 we filed a motion to dismiss mr ceglias complaint and a motion for judgment on the pleadings on november 27 2012 mr ceglia was indicted on mail and wire fraud charges based on his prosecution of this lawsuit on march 26 2013 the magistrate judge overseeing the matter issued a report recommending that the court grant our motion to dismiss and that it deny as moot our motion for judgment on the pleadings we continue to believe that mr ceglia is attempting to perpetrate a fraud on the court and we intend to continue to defend the case vigorously 

beginning on may 22 2012 multiple putative class actions derivative actions and individual actions were filed in state and federal courts in the united states and in other jurisdictions against us our directors andor certain of our officers alleging violation of securities laws or breach of fiduciary duties in connection with our initial public offering ipo and seeking unspecified damages we believe these lawsuits are without merit and we intend to continue to vigorously defend them on october 4 2012 on our motion the vast majority of the cases in the united states along with multiple cases filed against the nasdaq omx group inc and the nasdaq stock market llc collectively referred to herein as nasdaq alleging technical and other tradingrelated errors by nasdaq in connection with our ipo were ordered centralized for coordinated or consolidated pretrial proceedings in the united states district court for the southern district of new york on february 13 2013 the court granted our motion to dismiss four derivative actions against our directors and certain of our officers with leave to amend on october 8 2013 the court heard argument on our motion to dismiss the consolidated securities class action as well as our motion to dismiss and the plaintiffs motion to remand to state court certain other derivative actions on december 18 2013 the court denied our motion to dismiss the consolidated securities class action on december 23 2013 the court granted our motion to dismiss and denied the plaintiffs’ motion to remand to state court certain other derivative actions in addition the events surrounding our ipo have become the subject of various government inquiries and we are cooperating with those inquiries any such inquiries could subject us to substantial costs divert resources and the attention of management from our business and adversely affect our business 

we are also party to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business among these pending legal matters one case rembrandt social media lp v facebook inc et al  was scheduled to begin trial in december 2013 in the us district court for the eastern district of virginia in this case the plaintiff alleges that we infringe certain patents held by the plaintiff the plaintiff is seeking significant monetary damages and equitable relief the trial date was vacated in december 2013 and the case is currently on appeal we believe the claims made by the plaintiff in the rembrandt  case are without merit and we intend to continue to defend ourselves vigorously 

in addition we are also currently parties to multiple other lawsuits related to our products including other patent infringement lawsuits as well as class action lawsuits brought by users and marketers and we may in the future be subject to additional lawsuits and disputes we are also involved in other claims government investigations and proceedings arising from the ordinary course of our business

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

tableend you should read the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data of this annual report on form 10k in addition to our historical consolidated financial information the following discussion contains forwardlooking statements that reflect our plans estimates and beliefs our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forwardlooking statements factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k particularly in part i item 1a risk factors for a discussion of limitations in the measurement of certain of our user metrics see the section entitled limitations of key metrics and other data 

overview 

our mission is to give people the power to share and make the world more open and connected 

we build products that support our mission by creating value for users marketers and developers 

users  we enable people who use facebook to stay connected with their friends and family to discover and learn what is going on in the world around them and to share and express what matters to them to the people they care about 

marketers  we enable marketers to engage with more than 12 billion  monthly active users maus on facebook or subsets of our users based on information they have chosen to share with us such as their age location gender or interests we offer marketers benefits such as targeted reach engagement facebook ads facebook ad system and ad measurement 

developers  we enable developers to use facebooks developer services to build grow and monetize their mobile and web applications that integrate with facebook more rapidly and successfully 

we generate substantially all of our revenue from advertising and from fees associated with our payments infrastructure that enables users to purchase virtual and digital goods from developers with applications on the facebook website f or the year ended december 31 2013  we recorded revenue of 787 billion  income from operations of 28 billion  and net income of 15 billion  

trends in our user metrics 

the numbers for our key metrics our daily active users daus mobile daus maus mobile maus and average revenue per user arpu and certain other metric such as mobileonly daus and mobileonly maus do not include instagram users unless they would otherwise qualify as such users respectively based on their other activities on facebook in addition other user engagement metrics do not include instagram unless otherwise specifically stated 

trends in the number of our users affect our revenue and financial results by influencing the number of ads we are able to show the volume of payments transactions as well as our expenses and capital expenditures 

 

note for purposes of reporting daus maus and arpu by geographic region europe includes all users in russia and turkey asia includes all users in australia and new zealand and rest of world includes all users in africa latin america and the middle east 

worldwide daus increased 22  to 757 million on average during december 2013  from 618 million  during december 2012  we experienced growth in daus across major markets including brazil india and the united states overall growth in daus was driven largely by increased mobile usage of facebook the number of daus using personal computers decreased modestly in december 2013 compared to the same period in 2012  

 worldwide mobile daus increased 49  to 556 million  on average during december 2013  from 374 million  during december 2012  in all regions an increasing number of our daus are accessing facebook through mobile devices with users in brazil united states and india representing key sources of mobile growth on average during december 2013  as compared to the same period during 2012  there were 395 million  mobile daus who accessed facebook solely through mobile applications or our mobile website on average during the month ended december 31 2013  increasing 65  from 240 million  during the same period in 2012  the remaining 161 million  mobile daus accessed facebook from both personal computers and mobile devices during december 2013  we anticipate that the rate of growth in mobile usage will continue to be the primary driver of our user growth for the foreseeable future and that usage through personal computers may be flat or decline worldwide including in key markets such as the united states and other developed markets in europe and asia 

   

as of december 31 2013  we had 123 billion  maus an increase of 16  from december 31 2012  users in india brazil and mexico represented key sources of growth in 2013  relative to the prior year 

 39 

worldwide mobile maus increased 39  to 945 million  as of december 31 2013  from 680 million  as of december 31 2012  in all regions an increasing number of our maus are accessing facebook through mobile devices with users in india brazil and the united states representing key sources of mobile growth over the fourth quarter of 2013  as compared to the same period in 2012  there were 296 million  mobile maus who accessed facebook solely through mobile applications or our mobile website during the month ended december 31 2013  increasing 89  from 157 million  during the same period in 2012  the remaining 649 million  mobile maus accessed facebook from both personal computers and mobile devices during december 2013  we anticipate that the rate of growth in mobile usage will continue to be the primary driver of our user growth for the foreseeable future and that usage through personal computers will decline worldwide including in key markets such as the united states and other developed markets in europe and asia 

    

trends in our monetization by user geography 

we calculate our revenue by user geography based on our estimate of the geography in which ad impressions are delivered or virtual and digital goods are purchased we define arpu as our total revenue in a given geography during a given quarter divided by the average of the number of maus in the geography at the beginning and end of the quarter annual arpu is the sum of respective quarterly arpu amounts in that year the geography of our users affects our revenue and financial results because we currently monetize users in different geographies at different average rates our revenue and arpu in regions such as united states  canada and europe are relatively higher due to the size and maturity of those advertising markets as well as our greater sales presence and the number of payment methods that we make available to marketers and users for example arpu for an average user in 2013 in united states  canada is more than five times higher than for an average user in asia 

  

    

note our revenue by user geography in the charts above is geographically apportioned based on our estimation of the geographic location of our users when they perform a revenuegenerating activity this allocation differs from our revenue by geography disclosure in our consolidated financial statements where revenue is geographically apportioned based on the location of the marketer or developer 

for 2013  worldwide arpu was 681  an increase of 28  from 2012  over this period arpu increased by approximately 43 in rest of world 38 in the united states  canada 36 in europe and 34 in asia user growth was more rapid in geographies with relatively lower arpu such as asia and rest of world we expect that user growth in the future will continue to be higher in those regions where arpu is relatively lower such as asia and rest of world such that worldwide arpu may continue to increase at a slower rate relative to arpu in any geographic region or potentially decrease even if arpu increases in each geographic region 

critical accounting policies and estimates   

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue costs and expenses and related disclosures we evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis our estimates are based on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances our actual results could differ from these estimates 

an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made if different estimates reasonably could have been used or if changes in the estimate that are reasonably possible could materially impact the financial statements we believe that the assumptions and estimates associated with revenue recognition for payments and other fees income taxes sharebased compensation loss contingencies and business combinations and valuation of goodwill and other acquired intangible assets have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements therefore we consider these to be our critical accounting policies and estimates for further information on all of our significant accounting policies see note 1 of our accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data of this annual report on form 10k 

revenue recognition for payments and other fees 

we enable payments from our users to developers with applications on the facebook website our users can make payments on facebook by using debit and credit cards paypal mobile phone payments gift cards or other methods we receive a fee from developers when a user engages in a payment transaction for the purchase of a virtual or digital good on the facebook website the price of the virtual or digital good is a price that is solely determined by the developer we remit to the developer an amount that is based on the total amount of transaction less the processing fee that we charge the developer for the service performed our revenue is the net amount of the transaction representing our processing fee for the transaction we record revenue on a net basis as we do not consider ourselves to be the principal in the sale of the virtual or digital good to the user under gaap guidance related to reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent the indicators used to determine whether an entity is a principal or an agent to a transaction are subject to judgment we consider ourselves the agent to these transactions when we apply the indicators to our facts should material subsequent changes in the substance or nature of the transactions with developers result in us being considered the principal in such sales we would reflect the virtual and digital goods sale as revenue and the amounts paid to the developers as an associated cost 

income taxes   

we are subject to income taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes and income tax assets and liabilities including evaluating uncertainties in the application of accounting principles and complex tax laws   

we record a provision for income taxes for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations using the asset and liability method under this method we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities as well as for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the tax rates that are expected to apply to taxable income for the years in which those tax assets and liabilities are expected to be realized or settled we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the net amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized   

we recognize tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if we believe that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position although we believe that we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions we can provide no assurance that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be materially different we make adjustments to these reserves when facts and circumstances change such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded such differences will affect the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made and could have a material impact on our financial condition and operating results the provision for income taxes includes the effects of any reserves that we believe are appropriate as well as the related net interest and penalties   

sharebased compensation   

prior to january 1 2011 we granted rsus pre2011 rsus to our employees and members of our board of directors that vested upon the satisfaction of both a servicebased condition generally over four years and a liquidity condition the liquidity condition was 

satisfied in connection with our ipo in may 2012 therefore we did not recognize any expense relating to the granting of the pre2011 rsus until the completion of our ipo for the pre2011 rsus we recognize sharebased compensation expense using the accelerated attribution method net of estimated forfeitures in which compensation cost for each vesting tranche in an award is recognized ratably from the service inception date to the vesting date for that tranche 

rsus granted on or after january 1 2011 post2011 rsus are not subject to a liquidity condition in order to vest and compensation expense related to these grants is based on the grant date fair value of the rsus and is recognized on a straightline basis over the applicable service period the majority of post2011 rsus are earned over a service period of four  to five years  for post2011 rsus which are only subject to a service condition we recognize sharebased compensation expense on a ratable basis over the requisite service period for the entire award 

we account for sharebased employee compensation plans under the fair value recognition and measurement provisions in accordance with applicable accounting standards which require all sharebased payments to employees including grants of stock options and rsus to be measured based on the grantdate fair value of the awards   

sharebased compensation expense is recorded net of estimated forfeitures in our consolidated statements of income and as such is recorded for only those sharebased awards that we expect to vest we estimate the forfeiture rate based on historical forfeitures of equity awards and adjust the rate to reflect changes in facts and circumstances if any we will revise our estimated forfeiture rate if actual forfeitures differ from our initial estimates   

we have historically issued unvested restricted shares to employee stockholders of certain acquired companies as these awards are generally subject to continued postacquisition employment we have accounted for them as postacquisition sharebased compensation expense we recognize compensation expense equal to the grant date fair value of the common stock on a straightline basis over the employees required service period   

loss contingencies   

we are involved in various lawsuits claims investigations and proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business certain of these matters include speculative claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts of damages we record a liability when we believe that it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated significant judgment is required to determine both probability and the estimated amount we review these provisions at least quarterly and adjust these provisions accordingly to reflect the impact of negotiations settlements rulings advice of legal counsel and updated information 

we believe that the amount or estimable range of reasonably possible loss will not either individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on our business consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows with respect to loss contingencies for legal and other contingencies as of december 31 2013  however the outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain therefore if one or more of these legal matters were resolved against us for amounts in excess of managements expectations our results of operations and financial condition including in a particular reporting period could be materially adversely affected 

business combinations and valuation of goodwill and other acquired intangible assets   

we allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired liabilities assumed and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values the excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill such valuations require management to make significant estimates and assumptions especially with respect to intangible assets during the measurement period which is one year from the acquisition date we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill upon the conclusion of the measurement period any subsequent adjustments are recorded to earnings 

we review goodwill for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable we have elected to first assess the qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of our single reporting operating unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the twostep goodwill impairment under accounting standards update asu no 201108 goodwill and other topic 350 testing goodwill for impairment  issued by the financial accounting standards board fasb if we determine that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount then the twostep goodwill impairment test will be performed the first step identifying a potential impairment compares the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount if the carrying amount exceeds its fair value the second step will be performed otherwise no further step is required the second step measuring the impairment loss compares the implied fair value of the goodwill with the carrying amount of the goodwill any excess of the goodwill carrying amount over the applied fair value is recognized as an impairment loss and the carrying value of goodwill is written down to fair value as of december 31 2013  no impairment of goodwill has been identified 

acquired intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives we evaluate the recoverability of amortizable intangible assets for possible impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable recoverability of these assets is measured by a comparison of the carrying amounts to the future undiscounted cash flows the assets are 

expected to generate if such review indicates that the carrying amount of property and equipment and intangible assets is not recoverable the carrying amount of such assets is reduced to fair value we have not recorded any such impairment charge during the years presented 

in addition to the recoverability assessment we routinely review the remaining estimated useful lives of our amortizable intangible assets if we reduce the estimated useful life assumption for any asset the remaining unamortized balance would be amortized over the revised estimated useful life 

components of results of operations 

revenue 

we generate substantially all of our revenue from advertising and from fees associated with our payments infrastructure that enables users to purchase virtual and digital goods from our developers with applications on the facebook website 

advertising  our advertising revenue is generated by displaying ad products on the facebook website or mobile application and thirdparty affiliated websites or mobile applications marketers pay for ad products either directly or through their relationships with advertising agencies based on the number of clicks made by our users the number of actions taken by our users or the number of impressions delivered we recognize revenue from the delivery of clickbased ads in the period in which a user clicks on the content and actionbased ads in the period in which a user takes the action the marketer contracted for we recognize revenue from the display of impressionbased ads in the contracted period in which the impressions are delivered impressions are considered delivered when an ad is displayed to users the number of ads we show is subject to methodological changes as we continue to evolve our ads business and the structure of our ads products whether we count the initial display only or every display of an ad as an impression is dependent on where the ad is displayed for example an individual ad in news feed that is purchased on an impression basis may be displayed to users more than once during a day however only the initial display of the ad is considered an impression regardless of how many times the ad is actually displayed within the news feed to a particular user we calculate price per ad as total ad revenue divided by the number of ads delivered representing the effective price paid per impression by a marketer regardless of their desired objective such as impression click or action 

payments and other fees  we enable payments from our users to purchase virtual and digital goods from our developers with applications on the facebook website our users can transact and make payments on the facebook website by using debit and credit cards paypal mobile phone payments gift cards or other methods we receive a fee from developers when users make purchases in these applications using our payments infrastructure we recognize revenue net of amounts remitted to our developers we have mandated the use of our payments infrastructure for game applications on facebook and fees related to payments are generated almost exclusively from games our other fees revenue which has not been significant in recent periods consists primarily of user promoted posts and our ad serving and measurement products 

cost of revenue and operating expenses 

cost of revenue  our cost of revenue consists primarily of expenses associated with the delivery and distribution of our products these include expenses related to the operation of our data centers such as facility and server equipment depreciation facility and server equipment rent expense energy and bandwidth costs support and maintenance costs and salaries benefits and sharebased compensation for employees on our operations teams cost of revenue also includes credit card and other transaction fees related to processing customer transactions 

research and development  research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries benefits and sharebased compensation for employees on our engineering and technical teams who are responsible for building new products as well as improving existing products we expense all of our research and development costs as they are incurred 

marketing and sales  our marketing and sales expenses consist primarily of salaries benefits and sharebased compensation for our employees engaged in sales sales support marketing business development and customer service functions our marketing and sales expenses also include user developer and marketerfacing marketing and promotional expenditures 

general and administrative  our general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries benefits and sharebased compensation for our executives as well as our legal finance human resources corporate communications and policy and other administrative employees in addition general and administrative expenses include outside consulting fees and legal and accounting services general and administrative expenses also include legal settlements and amortization of patents we acquired

revenue   



  

2013  compared to 2012  revenue in 2013  increased 278 billion  or 55  compared to 2012  the increase was due primarily to a 63  increase in advertising revenue during 2013  as compared to 2012  

the most important factor driving advertising revenue growth was an increase in revenue from ads in news feed on both mobile devices and personal computers news feed ads are displayed more prominently have significantly higher levels of engagement and a higher price per ad relative to our other ad placements in 2013  we estimate that mobile advertising revenue represented approximately 45  of total advertising revenue as compared with 11  in 2012  other factors that influenced our advertising revenue growth in 2013  included an increase in the number of marketers actively advertising on facebook which we believe increased demand for our ad inventory and a 22  growth in average daus from december 2012 to december 2013 

in 2013 compared to 2012 we increased the number of ads shown by 20 and the average price per ad by 36 the increase in average price per ad was driven primarily by the increased number of news feed ads on both mobile devices and personal computers offset partially by product changes including our decision to lower the market reserve price ie the minimum price threshold accepted in our auction the increase in the number of ads shown was driven by user growth and the reserve price change partially offset by a shift towards more usage on mobile devices where we show fewer ads than on personal computers 

advertising revenue in the fourth quarter of 2013  increased 76  compared to the same period in 2012  the increase in ad revenue in the fourth quarter of 2013 was driven by the same factors that drove 2013 annual ad revenue growth primarily an increase in revenue from ads in news feed on both mobile devices and personal computers for the fourth quarter of 2013 we estimate that mobile advertising revenue represented approximately 53  of total advertising revenue as compared with 23  in the same period in 2012 

advertising spending is traditionally seasonally strong in the fourth quarter of each year we believe that this seasonality in advertising spending affects our quarterly results which generally reflect significant growth in advertising revenue between the third and fourth quarters and a decline in advertising spending between the fourth and subsequent first quarters for instance our advertising revenue increased 30 22 and 18 between the third and fourth quarters of 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively while advertising revenue for the first quarter of 2013 and 2012 declined 6 and 8 compared to the fourth quarters of 2012 and 2011 respectively 

payments and other fees revenue in 2013 increased 76 million  or 9  compared to 2012 the increase in payments and other fees revenue is a result of increased payments revenue from games played on facebook on personal computers and to a lesser extent the inclusion of other fees revenue in 2013 from user promoted posts and our ad serving and measurement products 

payments and other fees revenue in the fourth quarter of 2013 was  241 million  as compared to 256 million  in the same period of 2012 which was affected by a onetime increase in payments revenue in the fourth quarter of 2012 our payments terms and conditions provide for a 30day claim period subsequent to a payments transaction during which the customer may dispute the virtual or digital goods transaction due to lack of historical transactional information through the third quarter of 2012 we deferred recognition of payments revenue until the expiration of the claim period as we were unable to make reasonable and reliable estimates 

of future refunds or chargebacks arising during this period beginning in the fourth quarter of 2012 we had 24 months of historical transactional information which enabled us to estimate future refunds and chargebacks accordingly commencing in the fourth quarter of 2012 we recorded all payments revenues at the time of the purchase of the related virtual or digital goods net of estimated refunds or chargebacks this change resulted in a onetime increase in payments revenue in the fourth quarter of 2012 of approximately 66 million  as we recognized revenue from four months of transactions 

in 2013 we generated approximately 46 of our revenue from marketers and developers based in the united states compared to 51  in 2012 the change is due to a faster growth rate of international users and to the expansion of international sales offices and payment methods the majority of our revenue outside of the united states came from customers located in western europe canada australia and brazil 

2012  compared to 2011  revenue in 2012 increased 138 billion or 37 compared to 2011 the increase was due primarily to a 36 increase in advertising revenue during 2012 as compared to 2011 

advertising revenue grew due to a 32 increase in the number of ads delivered during 2012 and to a 3 increase in the average price per ad the increase in ads delivered was driven primarily by user growth average daus grew 28 from december 2011 to december 2012 and maus grew 25 from december 31 2011 to december 31 2012 various product changes and changes in user engagement generally offset in their impact on the average number of ads per user for example the shift to greater mobile use generally reduced ads per user while the introduction of ads in news feed increased the number of ads per user the rate of change in number of ads delivered also differs by geography driven by factors such as mobile penetration for example europe and rest of world increased at a faster rate than the united states and asia 

growth in the average price per ad during 2012 compared to 2011 was driven primarily by an increase in price per ad in the united states which benefited from growth in ads in news feed across desktop and mobile devices ads in news feed have a significantly higher average price per ad due to factors which include the prominent position of the ads the increase in price per ad in the united states was partially offset by an increased percentage of our worldwide ads being delivered in the asia and rest of world geographies where the average price per ad while growing on a yearoveryear basis is relatively lower the average price per ad was also affected by a decline in the average price per ad in europe in 2012 compared to 2011 due to the impact of foreign exchange rate changes an increase in the percentage of ads being delivered in european regions where the average price per ads is relatively lower and in part we believe to continuing weak economic conditions in that region affecting advertiser demand 

in 2012 we estimate that mobile advertising revenue as a percentage of advertising revenue was approximately 11  as mobile advertising was not offered prior to the first quarter of 2012 comparisons to prior year are not meaningful 

payments and other fees revenue in 2012 increased 253 million or 45 compared to 2011 excluding the onetime increase in payments revenue described above payments and other fees revenue in 2012 increased 34 compared to 2011 facebook payments became mandatory for all game developers accepting payments on the facebook website with limited exceptions on july 1 2011 accordingly comparisons of payments and other fees revenue to periods before this date may not be meaningful 

in 2012 we generated approximately 51  of our revenue from marketers and developers based in the united states compared to 56 in 2011 the change is due primarily to a faster growth rate of international users and to a lesser extent to the expansion of international sales offices and payment methods the majority of our revenue outside of the united states came from customers located in western europe canada australia and brazil 

no customer represented 10 or more of total revenue during the years ended december 31 2013  and 2012 and one customer represented 12  of total revenue for the year ended december 31 2011 

cost of revenue 

  

  

2013  compared to 2012  cost of revenue in 2013  increased 511 million  or 37  compared to 2012  the increase was primarily due to operational expenses related to expanding our data center and technical infrastructure including a 275 million increase in depreciation in 2013 in addition we recognized 117 million  of lease abandonment expense in 2013 primarily due to exiting certain 

leased data centers resulting from the migration of operations to our own data centers in the event that circumstances change such that we decide to reoccupy and utilize any of the data centers we have exited we would reverse the remaining lease abandonment liability associated with those facilities the increase in cost of revenue in 2013 was partially offset by a 46 million  decrease in sharebased compensation expense compared to 2012 mainly due to the recognition of expense in the prior period related to pre2011 rsus as a result of our ipo in may 2012 

2012  compared to 2011  cost of revenue in 2012 increased 504 million or 59 compared to 2011 the increase was primarily due to expenses related to expanding our data center operations including a 257 million increase in depreciation in 2012 sharebased compensation expense increased by 79 million in 2012 compared to 2011 mainly due to the recognition of expenses related to pre2011 rsus triggered by the completion of our ipo in may 2012 and to a lesser extent post2011 rsus increases in payroll and benefits expenses resulting from a 65 increase in employee headcount also contributed to the increase in cost of revenue in 2012 these expenses supported our user growth the increased usage of products by users developers and marketers and the launch of new products 

we anticipate that the cost of revenue will increase in dollar amount in 2014 and for the foreseeable future as we expand our data center capacity and technical infrastructure to support user growth increased user engagement and the delivery of new products and offerings the expected increase in cost of revenue may be partially mitigated to the extent we are able to realize improvements in server and network performance and the efficiency of our technical operations 

research and development 



  

2013  compared to 2012  research and development expenses in 2013  increased 16 million  or 1  compared to 2012  the increase was primarily due to an increase in payroll and benefits expense resulting from a 50  growth in employee headcount from december 31 2012 to december 31 2013 in engineering and other technical functions this increase in 2013 was offset by a 239 million  decrease in sharebased compensation expense compared to 2012 mainly due to the recognition of expense in the prior period related to pre2011 rsus as a result of our ipo in may 2012 

2012  compared to 2011   research and development expenses in 2012 increased 101 billion or 261 compared to 2011 the increase was primarily due to an increase in sharebased compensation expense of 729 million in 2012 resulting primarily from the recognition of expenses related to pre2011 rsus triggered by the completion of our ipo in may 2012 and to a lesser extent post2011 rsus payroll and benefits expense also increased due to a 73 growth in employee headcount in engineering design product management and other technical functions this investment supported our efforts to improve existing products and build new products for users developers and marketers 

in 2014 we plan to continue hiring software engineers and other technical employees we expect research and development expenses will rise in 2014 at a higher rate than it rose in 2013 due to the large sharebased compensation expense in 2012 associated with pre2011 rsus as a result of our ipo which lowered the growth rate between 2012 and 2013

2013  compared to 2012   marketing and sales expenses in 2013  increased 101 million  or 11  compared to 2012  the increase was primarily due to an increase in payroll and benefits expenses resulting from a 36  increase in employee headcount from december 31 2012 to december 31 2013 to support global sales business development and customer service our user developer and marketerfacing marketing expense also contributed to the increase in 2013 these increases in 2013 were partially offset by a decrease 

in sharebased compensation expense of 173 million  compared to 2012 primarily due to the recognition of expense in the prior period related to pre2011 rsus as a result of our ipo in may 2012 

2012  compared to 2011  marketing and sales expenses in 2012 increased 503 million or 128 compared to 2011 the increase was primarily due to an increase in sharebased compensation expense of 269 million in 2012 resulting primarily from the recognition of expenses related to pre2011 rsus triggered by the completion of our ipo in may 2012 and to a lesser extent post2011 rsus payroll and benefits expenses also increased due to a 19 increase in employee headcount to support global sales business development and customer service an increase in our user developer and marketerfacing marketing expense also contributed to the increase in 2012 

in 2014 we plan to add sales and business development employees and increase our investment in user developer and marketerfacing marketing we expect marketing and sales expenses will rise in 2014 at a higher rate than it rose in 2013 due to the large sharebased compensation expense in 2012 associated with pre2011 rsus as a result of our ipo which lowered the growth rate between 2012 and 2013 

general and administrative 



  

2013  compared to 2012  general and administrative expenses in 2013  decreased 111 million  or 12  compared to 2012  the decrease was primarily due to a 208 million  decrease in sharebased compensation expense in 2013 compared to 2012 resulting from recognition of expense related to pre2011 rsus as a result of our ipo in may 2012 the decrease in 2013 was partially offset by increased payroll and benefits expense resulting from a 19  increase in employee headcount and increased amortization of acquired patents 

2012  compared to 2011  general and administrative expenses in 2012 increased 578 million or 184 compared to 2011 the increase was primarily due to an increase in sharebased compensation expense of 278 million resulting from recognition of expense related to pre2011 rsus and to a lesser extent post2011 rsus the increase was also due to growth in legal fees and settlement costs amortization of acquired patents and other professional service fees payroll and benefits expenses also increased for 2012 due to a 38 increase in employee headcount in corporate communications and policy human resources legal finance and other functions 

in 2014 we expect general and administrative expenses will grow relative to 2013 as we continue to increase general and administrative employee headcount to support our growth 

interest and other expense net 



  

2013  compared to 2012  interest and other expense net in 2013  increased 6 million  or 14  compared to 2012  interest expense increased by 5 million  primarily due to interest on the 15 billion term loan that was drawn down in the fourth quarter of 2012 and fully repaid in august 2013 other income net in 2013 decreased 1 million compared to 2012 primarily due to an increase in foreign exchange loss resulting from the periodic remeasurement of our foreign currency balances offset by an increase in interest income resulting from higher invested cash balances 

2012  compared to 2011  interest and other expense net in 2012 decreased 17 million or 28 compared to 2011 interest expense increased by 9 million primarily due to an increased volume of property and equipment financed by capital leases for 2012 

and interest on the 15 billion term loan that was drawn down in the fourth quarter of 2012 changes in other income expense net were primarily due to lower foreign exchange losses in 2012 resulting from the periodic remeasurement of our foreign currency balances and an increase in interest income driven by higher invested cash balances 

provision for income taxes   



  

2013  compared to 2012  our provision for income taxes in 2013  increased 813 million  or 184  compared to 2012  primarily due to an increase in pretax income our effective tax rate decreased primarily due to a lower amount of nondeductible sharebased compensation resulting from recognition of expense related to pre2011 rsus as a result of our ipo in may 2012 our effective tax rate in 2013 was also lower due to the reinstatement in 2013 of the federal tax credit for research and development activities we recognized the benefit from the reinstatement of the tax credit for 2012 and 2013 during the year ended december 31 2013 

2012  compared to 2011   our provision for income taxes in 2012 decreased 254 million or 37 compared to 2011 primarily due to a decrease in pretax income our effective tax rate increased primarily due to the impact of nondeductible sharebased compensation and the losses arising outside the united states in jurisdictions where we do not receive a tax benefit our effective tax rate in 2012 was also higher due to the expiration of the federal tax credit for research and development activities

in january 2014 we began requiring that employees sell a portion of the shares that they receive upon the vesting of rsus in order to cover any required withholding taxes selltocover rather than our previous approach of net share settlement we expect this selltocover approach will reduce our cash outflows 

 we currently anticipate that our available funds credit facilities and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our operational cash needs for the foreseeable future 

in august 2013 in connection with the termination of our existing credit facilities we entered into a fiveyear senior unsecured revolving credit facility 2013 revolving credit facility that allows us to borrow up to 65 billion to fund working capital and general corporate purposes with interest payable on the borrowed amounts set at libor plus 10 as well as an annual commitment fee of 010 on the daily undrawn balance of the facility we paid origination fees at closing of the 2013 revolving credit facility which fees are being amortized over the term of the facility any amounts outstanding under this facility will be due and payable on august 15 2018 as of december 31 2013  no amounts had been drawn down and we were in compliance with the covenants under this credit facility see note 9 in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 for additional detail

 in addition our other liabilities include 886 million  related to uncertain tax positions as of december 31 2013  due to uncertainties in the timing of the completion of tax audits the timing of the resolution of these positions is uncertain and we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years beyond 12 months as a result this amount is not included in the above contractual obligations table 

contingencies 

we are involved in claims lawsuits government investigations and proceedings we record a provision for a liability when we believe that it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated significant judgment is required to determine both probability and the estimated amount such legal proceedings are inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties some of which are beyond our control should any of these estimates and assumptions change or prove to be incorrect it could have a material impact on our results of operations financial position and cash flows

foreign currency exchange risk 

we have foreign currency risks related to our revenue and operating expenses denominated in currencies other than the us dollar primarily the euro in general we are a net receiver of currencies other than the us dollar accordingly changes in exchange rates and in particular a strengthening of the us dollar will negatively affect our revenue and other operating results as expressed in us dollars 

we have experienced and will continue to experience fluctuations in our net income as a result of transaction gains or losses related to revaluing certain current asset and current liability balances that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the entities in which they are recorded at this time we have not entered into but in the future we may enter into derivatives or other financial instruments in an attempt to hedge our foreign currency exchange risk it is difficult to predict the effect hedging activities would have on our results of operations we recognized foreign currency losses of 14 million  9 million  and 29 million  in 2013  2012  and 2011  respectively 

interest rate sensitivity 

our exposure to changes in interest rates relates primarily to interest earned and market value on our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities 

our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities consist of cash certificates of deposit time deposits money market funds and us government and us government agency securities  our investment policy and strategy are focused on preservation of capital and supporting our liquidity requirements changes in us interest rates affect the interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities and the market value of those securities a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would result in a decrease of approximately 73 million  and 55 million  in the market value of our availableforsale debt securities as of december 31 2013  and december 31 2012  respectively any realized gains or losses resulting from such interest rate changes would only occur if we sold the investments prior to maturity

government regulation   

we are subject to a number of us federal and state and foreign laws and regulations that affect companies conducting business on the internet many of which are still evolving and being tested in courts and could be interpreted in ways that could harm our business these may involve user privacy rights of publicity data protection content intellectual property distribution electronic contracts and other communications competition protection of minors consumer protection taxation and online payment services in particular we are subject to federal state and foreign laws regarding privacy and protection of user data foreign data protection privacy and other laws and regulations are often more restrictive than those in the united states us federal and state and foreign laws and regulations are constantly evolving and can be subject to significant change in addition the application and interpretation of these laws and regulations are often uncertain particularly in the new and rapidlyevolving industry in which we operate there 

are also a number of legislative proposals pending before the us congress various state legislative bodies and foreign governments concerning data protection which could affect us for example a revision to the 1995 european union data protection directive is currently being considered by legislative bodies that may include more stringent operational requirements for data processors and significant penalties for noncompliance 

in august 2012 the ftc approved a settlement agreement with us to resolve an investigation into various practices that among other things requires us to establish and refine certain practices with respect to treatment of user data and privacy settings and also requires we complete biannual independent privacy assessments violation of existing or future regulatory orders or consent decrees could subject us to substantial monetary fines and other penalties that could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations 

various laws and regulations in the united states and abroad such as the bank secrecy act the doddfrank act the usa patriot act and the credit card act impose certain antimoney laundering requirements on companies that are financial institutions or that provide financial products and services under these laws and regulations financial institutions are broadly defined to include money services businesses such as money transmitters check cashers and sellers or issuers of stored value requirements imposed on financial institutions under these laws include customer identification and verification programs record retention policies and procedures and transaction reporting to increase flexibility in how our use of payments may evolve and to mitigate regulatory uncertainty we have applied through subsidiaries for certain money transmitter licenses in the united states and similar licenses in certain foreign countries which will generally require us to show compliance with many domestic and foreign laws relating to money transmission gift cards and other prepaid access instruments electronic funds transfers antimoney laundering counterterrorist financing gambling banking and lending and import and export restrictions

risk factors 

tableend certain factors may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations you should consider carefully the risks and uncertainties described below in addition to other information contained in this annual report on form 10k including our consolidated financial statements and related notes the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of or that we currently believe are not material may also become important factors that adversely affect our business if any of the following risks actually occurs our business financial condition results of operations and future prospects could be materially and adversely affected in that event the trading price of our class a common stock could decline and you could lose part or all of your investment 

risks related to our business and industry 

if we fail to retain existing users or add new users or if our users decrease their level of engagement with facebook our revenue financial results and business may be significantly harmed 

the size of our user base and our users level of engagement are critical to our success we had 106 billion  monthly active users maus as of december 31 2012  our financial performance has been and will continue to be significantly determined by our success in adding retaining and engaging active users we anticipate that our active user growth rate will decline over time as the size of our active user base increases and as we achieve higher market penetration rates to the extent our active user growth rate slows our business performance will become increasingly dependent on our ability to increase levels of user engagement and monetization if people do not perceive our products to be useful reliable and trustworthy we may not be able to attract or retain users or otherwise maintain or increase the frequency and duration of their engagement a number of other social networking companies that achieved early popularity have since seen their active user bases or levels of engagement decline in some cases precipitously there is no guarantee that we will not experience a similar erosion of our active user base or engagement levels our user engagement patterns have changed over time and can be difficult to measure particularly as users engage increasingly via mobile devices and as we introduce new and different services any decrease in user retention growth or engagement could render facebook less attractive to developers and marketers which may have a material and adverse impact on our revenue business financial condition and results of operations any number of factors could potentially negatively affect user retention growth and engagement including if 

 13 

our users to interact and share on thirdparty websites 

if we are unable to maintain and increase our user base and user engagement our revenue and financial results may be adversely affected 

we generate a substantial majority of our revenue from advertising the loss of marketers or reduction in spending by marketers with facebook could seriously harm our business 

the substantial majority of our revenue is currently generated from third parties advertising on facebook for 2012 2011 and 2010 advertising accounted for 84  85  and 95  respectively of our revenue as is common in the industry our marketers do not have longterm advertising commitments with us many of our marketers spend only a relatively small portion of their overall advertising budget with us in addition marketers may view some of our products as experimental and unproven marketers will not continue to do business with us or they will reduce the prices they are willing to pay to advertise with us if we do not deliver ads in an effective manner or if they do not believe that their investment in advertising with us will generate a competitive return relative to other alternatives our advertising revenue could be adversely affected by a number of other factors including 

 the occurrence of any of these or other factors could result in a reduction in demand for our ads which may reduce the prices we receive for our ads or cause marketers to stop advertising with us altogether either of which would negatively affect our revenue and financial results 

growth in the use of facebook through our mobile products as a substitute for use on personal computers may negatively affect our revenue and financial results 

we had 680 million mobile maus in december 2012 while most of our mobile users also access facebook through personal computers we anticipate that the rate of growth in mobile usage will exceed the growth in usage through personal computers for the foreseeable future and that the usage through personal computers may decline or continue to decline in certain markets in part due to our focus on developing mobile products to encourage mobile usage of facebook for example during the fourth quarter of 2012 the number of daily active users daus using personal computers declined modestly compared to the third quarter of 2012 including declines in key markets such as the united states while mobile daus continued to increase while we began showing ads in users mobile news feeds in early 2012 we have generated only a small portion of our revenue from the use of facebook mobile products to date in addition we do not currently offer our payments infrastructure to applications on mobile devices if users increasingly access facebook mobile products as a substitute for access through personal computers and if we are unable to continue to grow mobile revenues or if we incur excessive expenses in this effort our financial performance and ability to grow revenue would be negatively affected 

facebook user growth and engagement on mobile devices depend upon effective operation with mobile operating systems networks and standards that we do not control 

there is no guarantee that popular mobile devices will continue to feature facebook or that mobile device users will continue to use facebook rather than competing products we are dependent on the interoperability of facebook with popular mobile operating systems that we do not control such as android and ios and any changes in such systems that degrade our products functionality or give preferential treatment to competitive products could adversely affect facebook usage on mobile devices additionally in order to deliver high quality mobile products it is important that our products work well with a range of mobile technologies systems networks and standards that we do not control we may not be successful in developing relationships with key participants in the mobile industry or in developing products that operate effectively with these technologies systems networks or standards in the event that it is more difficult for our users to access and use facebook on their mobile devices or if our users choose not to access or use facebook on their mobile devices or use mobile products that do not offer access to facebook our user growth and user engagement could be harmed 

our business is highly competitive competition presents an ongoing threat to the success of our business 

we face significant competition in every aspect of our business including from companies that provide tools to facilitate the sharing of information companies that enable marketers to display personalized advertising and companies that provide development platforms for applications developers we compete with companies that offer fullfeatured products that replicate the range of communications and related capabilities we provide these offerings include for example google which google has integrated with certain of its products including search and android as well as other largely regional social networks that have strong positions in particular countries such as mixi in japan and vkontakte and odnoklassniki in russia we also complete with companies that develop applications particularly mobile applications that replicate discrete capabilities we provide such as photosharing messaging and microblogging and companies that provide web and mobilebased information and entertainment products and services that are designed to engage users and capture time spent online and on mobile devices in addition we face competition from traditional and online businesses that provide media for marketers to reach their audiences andor   develop tools and systems for managing and optimizing advertising campaigns 

some of our current and potential competitors may have significantly greater resources or better competitive positions in certain product segments geographic regions or user demographics than we do these factors may allow our competitors to respond more effectively than us to new or emerging technologies and changes in market conditions we believe that some of our users particularly our younger users are aware of and actively engaging with other products and services similar to or as a substitute for facebook for example we believe that some of our users have reduced their engagement with facebook in favor of increased engagement with other products and services such as instagram in the event that our users increasingly engage with other products and services we may experience a decline in user engagement and our business could be harmed 

our competitors may develop products features or services that are similar to ours or that achieve greater acceptance may undertake more farreaching and successful product development efforts or marketing campaigns or may adopt more aggressive pricing policies in addition platform partners may use information shared by our users through the facebook platform in order to develop products or features that compete with us certain competitors including google could use strong or dominant positions in one or more markets to gain competitive advantage against us in areas where we operate including by integrating competing social networking platforms or features into products they control such as search engines web browsers or mobile device operating systems by making acquisitions or by making access to facebook more difficult as a result our competitors may acquire and engage users at the expense of the growth or engagement of our user base which may negatively affect our business and financial results 

we believe that our ability to compete effectively depends upon many factors both within and beyond our control including 

 if we are not able to compete effectively our user base and level of user engagement may decrease which could make us less attractive to developers and marketers and materially and adversely affect our revenue and results of operations 

we may not be successful in our efforts to grow usage of and engagement with the facebook platform 

we have made and are continuing to make investments to enable developers to build applications apps and websites that integrate with the facebook platform existing and prospective platform developers may not be successful in building apps or websites that create and maintain user engagement additionally developers may choose to build on other platforms including mobile platforms controlled by third parties rather than building on the facebook platform we are continuously seeking to balance the distribution objectives of our platform developers with our desire to provide an optimal user experience and we may not be successful in achieving a balance that continues to attract and retain platform developers from time to time we have taken actions to reduce the volume of communications from platform developers to users on facebook with the objective of enhancing the user experience and such actions have reduced distribution from user engagement with and our monetization opportunities from facebookintegrated apps and websites in some instances these actions have adversely affected our relationships with platform developers if we are not successful in our efforts to grow our platform or if we are unable to build and maintain good relations with platform developers our user growth and user engagement and our financial results may be adversely affected 

we may not be successful in our efforts to further monetize the facebook platform 

we currently monetize the facebook platform in several ways including ads on pages generated by apps on facebook direct advertising on facebook purchased by platform developers to drive traffic to their apps and websites and fees from our platform developers use of our payments infrastructure to sell virtual and digital goods to users accessing facebook via personal computers apps built by developers of social games are currently responsible for substantially all of our revenue derived from payments while we have expanded the number of developers using our payments infrastructure our overall payments revenue may decrease or stay flat in future periods in addition a relatively small percentage of our users have transacted with facebook payments for example for the fiscal year ended december 31 2012  approximately 27 million users purchased virtual goods using facebook payments if the platform apps that currently generate revenue fail to grow or maintain their users and engagement if platform developers do not continue to introduce new apps that attract users and create engagement if platform developers reduce their advertising on facebook if we fail to maintain good relationships with platform developers or attract new developers or if platform apps outside of social games do not gain popularity and generate significant revenue for us our financial performance and ability to grow revenue could be adversely affected 

additionally we are actively supporting platform developers efforts to develop their own mobile apps and websites that integrate with facebook unlike apps that run within the facebook website which enable us to show ads and offer payments we generally do not directly monetize from platform developers integrating their own mobile apps and websites with facebook therefore our platform developers efforts to prioritize facebook integrations with their own mobile apps or websites may reduce or slow the growth of our user activity that generates advertising and payments opportunities which could negatively affect our revenue although we believe that there are significant longterm benefits to facebook resulting from increased engagement on facebookintegrated websites and mobile apps these benefits may not offset the possible loss of revenue in which case our business could be harmed 

action by governments to restrict access to facebook in their countries could substantially harm our business and financial results 

it is possible that governments of one or more countries may seek to censor content available on facebook in their country restrict access to facebook from their country entirely or impose other restrictions that may affect the accessibility of facebook in their country for an extended period of time or indefinitely for example access to facebook has been or is currently restricted in whole or in part in china iran north korea and syria in addition governments in other countries may seek to restrict access to facebook if they consider us to be in violation of their laws in the event that access to facebook is restricted in whole or in part in one or more countries or our competitors are able to successfully penetrate geographic markets that we cannot access our ability to retain or increase our user base and user engagement may be adversely affected we may not be able to maintain or grow our revenue as anticipated and our financial results could be adversely affected 

our new products and changes to existing products could fail to attract or retain users or generate revenue 

our ability to retain increase and engage our user base and to increase our revenue will depend heavily on our ability to create successful new products both independently and in conjunction with platform developers or other third parties we may introduce significant changes to our existing products or develop and introduce new and unproven products including using technologies with which we have little or no prior development or operating experience if new or enhanced products fail to engage users developers or marketers we may fail to attract or retain users or to generate sufficient revenue operating margin or other value to justify our investments and our business may be adversely affected in the future we may invest in new products and initiatives to generate revenue but there is no guarantee these approaches will be successful for example in 2012 we launched our gifts product that enables users to send physical or digital gifts to friends we may not be successful in generating meaningful revenue from this product if we are not successful with new approaches to monetization we may not be able to maintain or grow our revenue as anticipated or recover any associated development costs and our financial results could be adversely affected 

our culture emphasizes rapid innovation and prioritizes user engagement over shortterm financial results 

we have a culture that encourages employees to quickly develop and launch new and innovative products as our business grows and becomes more complex our cultural emphasis on moving quickly may result in unintended outcomes or decisions that are poorly received by users developers or marketers our culture also prioritizes user engagement over shortterm financial results and we frequently make product decisions that may reduce our shortterm revenue or profitability if we believe that the decisions are consistent with our mission and benefit the aggregate user experience and will thereby improve our financial performance over the long term these decisions may not produce the longterm benefits that we expect in which case our user growth and engagement our relationships with developers and marketers and our business and results of operations could be harmed 

if we are not able to maintain and enhance our brand or if events occur that damage our reputation and brand our ability to expand our base of users developers and marketers may be impaired and our business and financial results may be harmed 

we believe that the facebook brand has significantly contributed to the success of our business we also believe that maintaining and enhancing our brand is critical to expanding our base of users developers and marketers many of our new users are referred by existing users maintaining and enhancing our brand will depend largely on our ability to continue to provide useful reliable trustworthy and innovative products which we may not do successfully we may introduce new products or terms of service that users do not like which may negatively affect our brand additionally the actions of our platform developers may affect our brand if users do not have a positive experience using thirdparty apps and websites integrated with facebook we have in the past experienced and we expect that in the future we will continue to experience media legislative or regulatory scrutiny of our decisions regarding user privacy or other issues which may adversely affect our reputation and brand we also may fail to provide adequate customer service which could erode confidence in our brand our brand may also be negatively affected by the actions of users that are deemed to be hostile or inappropriate to other users or by users acting under false or inauthentic identities maintaining and enhancing our brand may require us to make substantial investments and these investments may not be successful if we fail to successfully promote and maintain the facebook brand or if we incur excessive expenses in this effort our business and financial results may be adversely affected 

improper access to or disclosure of our users information or violation of our terms of service or policies could harm our reputation and adversely affect our business 

our efforts to protect the information that our users have chosen to share using facebook may be unsuccessful due to the actions of third parties software bugs or other technical malfunctions employee error or malfeasance or other factors in addition third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or users to disclose information in order to gain access to our data or our users data if any of these events occur our users information could be accessed or disclosed improperly our data use policy governs the use of information that users have chosen to share using facebook and how that information may be used by us and third parties some platform developers may store information provided by our users through apps on the facebook platform or websites integrated with facebook if these third parties or platform developers fail to adopt or adhere to adequate data security practices or fail to comply with our terms and policies or in the event of a breach of their networks our users data may be improperly accessed or disclosed 

any incidents involving unauthorized access to or improper use of the information of our users or incidents involving violation of our terms of service or policies including our data use policy could damage our reputation and our brand and diminish our competitive position in addition the affected users or government authorities could initiate legal or regulatory action against us in connection with such incidents which could cause us to incur significant expense and liability or result in orders or consent decrees forcing us to modify our business practices any of these events could have a material and adverse effect on our business reputation or financial results 

unfavorable media coverage could negatively affect our business 

we receive a high degree of media coverage around the world unfavorable publicity regarding for example our privacy practices product changes product quality litigation or regulatory activity or the actions of our platform developers or our users could adversely affect our reputation such negative publicity also could have an adverse effect on the size engagement and loyalty of our user base and result in decreased revenue which could adversely affect our business and financial results 

our financial results will fluctuate from quarter to quarter and are difficult to predict 

our quarterly financial results have fluctuated in the past and will fluctuate in the future additionally we have a limited operating history with the current scale of our business which makes it difficult to forecast our future results as a result you should not rely upon our past quarterly financial results as indicators of future performance you should take into account the risks and uncertainties frequently encountered by companies in rapidly evolving markets our financial results in any given quarter can be influenced by numerous factors many of which we are unable to predict or are outside of our control including 

 18 

costeffective manner 

 we expect our rates of growth will decline in the future 

we believe that our rates of user and revenue growth will decline over time for example our revenue grew 37  from 2011 to 2012 88  from 2010 to 2011 and 154 from 2009 year to 2010 historically our user growth has been a primary driver of growth in our revenue while our periodic rates of growth may be flat or increase from time to time we expect that our user growth and revenue growth rates will decline over time as the size of our active user base increases and as we achieve higher market penetration rates as our growth rates decline investors perceptions of our business may be adversely affected and the trading price of our class a common stock could decline 

our costs are continuing to grow which could harm our business and profitability 

providing our products to our users is costly and we expect our expenses to continue to increase in the future as we broaden our user base as users increase the number of connections and amount of data they share with us as we develop and implement new product features that require more computing infrastructure historically our costs have increased each year due to these factors and we expect to continue to incur increasing costs in particular for servers storage power and data centers to support our anticipated future growth we expect to continue to invest in our global infrastructure in order to provide our products rapidly and reliably to all users around the world including in countries where we do not expect significant shortterm monetization in addition our costs may increase as we hire additional employees particularly as a result of the significant competition that we face to attract and retain technical talent our expenses may continue to grow faster than our revenue over time our expenses may be greater than we anticipate and our investments may not be successful in addition we may increase marketing sales and other operating expenses in order to grow and expand our operations and to remain competitive increases in our costs may adversely affect our business and profitability 

our business is subject to complex and evolving us and foreign laws and regulations regarding privacy data protection and other matters many of these laws and regulations are subject to change and uncertain interpretation and could result in claims changes to our business practices monetary penalties increased cost of operations or declines in user growth or engagement or otherwise harm our business 

we are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the united states and abroad that involve matters central to our business including user privacy rights of publicity data protection content intellectual property distribution electronic contracts and other communications competition protection of minors consumer protection taxation securities law compliance and online payment services the introduction of new products may subject us to additional laws and regulations for example depending on how our new gifts product evolves we may be subject to laws and regulations governing returns taxability of purchases purchase of restricted products such as alcohol product liability and international import and export restrictions in addition foreign data protection privacy and other laws and regulations are often more restrictive than those in the united states these us federal and state and foreign laws and regulations which can be enforced by private parties or government entities are constantly evolving and can be subject to significant change in addition the application and interpretation of these laws and regulations are often uncertain particularly in the new and rapidly evolving industry in which we operate for example the interpretation of some laws and regulations that govern the use of names and likenesses in connection with advertising and marketing activities is unsettled and developments in this area could 

affect the manner in which we design our products as well as our terms of use a number of proposals are pending before federal state and foreign legislative and regulatory bodies that could significantly affect our business for example a revision to the 1995 european union data protection directive is currently being considered by european legislative bodies that may include more stringent operational requirements for data processors and significant penalties for noncompliance similarly there have been a number of recent legislative proposals in the united states at both the federal and state level that would impose new obligations in areas such as privacy and liability for copyright infringement by third parties these existing and proposed laws and regulations can be costly to comply with and can delay or impede the development of new products result in negative publicity increase our operating costs require significant management time and attention and subject us to inquiries or investigations claims or other remedies including fines or demands that we modify or cease existing business practices 

we have been subject to regulatory investigations and settlements and we expect to continue to be subject to such proceedings in the future which could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner materially adverse to our business 

from time to time we receive inquiries from regulators regarding our compliance with laws and other matters for example in 2012 the federal trade commission approved a settlement agreement with us that among other things requires us to establish and refine certain practices with respect to treatment of user data and privacy settings and also requires that we complete biannual independent privacy assessments as another example in 2011 and 2012 the irish data protection commissioner audited the data security and privacy practices and policies of facebook ireland we expect to continue to be the subject of regulatory investigations and audits in the future by these and other regulators throughout the world 

it is possible that a regulatory inquiry might result in changes to our policies or practices violation of existing or future regulatory orders or consent decrees could subject us to substantial monetary fines and other penalties that could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations in addition it is possible that future orders issued by or enforcement actions initiated by regulatory authorities could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner materially adverse to our business 

if we are unable to protect our intellectual property the value of our brand and other intangible assets may be diminished and our business may be adversely affected 

we rely and expect to continue to rely on a combination of confidentiality and license agreements with our employees consultants and third parties with whom we have relationships as well as trademark copyright patent trade secret and domain name protection laws to protect our proprietary rights in the united states and internationally we have filed various applications for protection of certain aspects of our intellectual property and we currently hold a number of issued patents in multiple jurisdictions and have acquired patents and patent applications from third parties in addition in the future we may acquire additional patents or patent portfolios which could require significant cash expenditures third parties may knowingly or unknowingly infringe our proprietary rights third parties may challenge proprietary rights held by us and pending and future trademark and patent applications may not be approved in addition effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which we operate or intend to operate our business in any or all of these cases we may be required to expend significant time and expense in order to prevent infringement or to enforce our rights although we have taken measures to protect our proprietary rights there can be no assurance that others will not offer products or concepts that are substantially similar to ours and compete with our business in addition we regularly contribute software source code under open source licenses and have made other technology we developed available under other open licenses and we include open source software in our products for example we have contributed certain specifications and designs related to our data center equipment to the open compute project foundation a nonprofit entity that shares and develops such information with the technology community under the open web foundation license as a result of our open source contributions and the use of open source in our products we may license or be required to license innovations that turn out to be material to our business and may also be exposed to increased litigation risk if the protection of our proprietary rights is inadequate to prevent unauthorized use or appropriation by third parties the value of our brand and other intangible assets may be diminished and competitors may be able to more effectively mimic our service and methods of operations any of these events could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results 

we are currently and expect to be in the future party to patent lawsuits and other intellectual property rights claims that are expensive and time consuming and if resolved adversely could have a significant impact on our business financial condition or results of operations 

companies in the internet technology and media industries own large numbers of patents copyrights trademarks and trade secrets and frequently enter into litigation based on allegations of infringement misappropriation or other violations of intellectual property or other rights in addition various nonpracticing entities that own patents and other intellectual property rights often attempt to aggressively assert their rights in order to extract value from technology companies furthermore from time to time we may introduce new products including in areas where we currently do not compete which could increase our exposure to patent and 

other intellectual property claims from competitors and nonpracticing entities 

from time to time we receive notice letters from patent holders alleging that certain of our products and services infringe their patent rights we presently are involved in a number of intellectual property lawsuits and as we face increasing competition and gain an increasingly high profile we expect the number of patent and other intellectual property claims against us to grow defending patent and other intellectual property litigation is costly and can impose a significant burden on management and employees and there can be no assurances that favorable final outcomes will be obtained in all cases in addition plaintiffs may seek and we may become subject to preliminary or provisional rulings in the course of any such litigation including potential preliminary injunctions requiring us to cease some or all of our operations we may decide to settle such lawsuits and disputes on terms that are unfavorable to us similarly if any litigation to which we are a party is resolved adversely we may be subject to an unfavorable judgment that may not be reversed upon appeal the terms of such a settlement or judgment may require us to cease some or all of our operations or pay substantial amounts to the other party in addition we may have to seek a license to continue practices found to be in violation of a third partys rights which may not be available on reasonable terms or at all and may significantly increase our operating costs and expenses as a result we may also be required to develop alternative noninfringing technology or practices or discontinue the practices the development of alternative noninfringing technology or practices could require significant effort and expense or may not be feasible our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected as a result of an unfavorable resolution of the disputes and litigation referred to above 

we are involved in numerous class action lawsuits and other litigation matters that are expensive and time consuming and if resolved adversely could harm our business financial condition or results of operations 

in addition to intellectual property claims we are also involved in numerous other lawsuits including putative class action lawsuits brought by users and marketers many of which claim statutory damages and we anticipate that we will continue to be a target for numerous lawsuits in the future because we have over a billion users the plaintiffs in class action cases filed against us typically claim enormous monetary damages even if the alleged peruser harm is small or nonexistent any negative outcome from such lawsuits could result in payments of substantial monetary damages or fines or changes to our products or business practices and accordingly our business financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected although the results of such lawsuits and claims cannot be predicted with certainty we do not believe that the final outcome of those matters relating to our products that we currently face will have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations in addition following our initial public offering ipo we became the subject of stockholder class action suits we believe these lawsuits are without merit and are vigorously defending these lawsuits 

there can be no assurances that a favorable final outcome will be obtained in all our cases and defending any lawsuit is costly and can impose a significant burden on management and employees any litigation to which we are a party may result in an onerous or unfavorable judgment that may not be reversed upon appeal or in payments of substantial monetary damages or fines or we may decide to settle lawsuits on similarly unfavorable terms which could adversely affect our business financial conditions or results of operations 

our ceo has control over key decision making as a result of his control of a majority of our voting stock 

as a result of voting agreements with certain stockholders together with the shares he holds mark zuckerberg our founder chairman and ceo is able to exercise voting rights with respect to a majority of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock as of december 31 2012  mr zuckerberg therefore has the ability to control the outcome of matters submitted to our stockholders for approval including the election of directors and any merger consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets this concentrated control could delay defer or prevent a change of control merger consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets that our other stockholders support or conversely this concentrated control could result in the consummation of such a transaction that our other stockholders do not support this concentrated control could also discourage a potential investor from acquiring our class a common stock due to the limited voting power of such stock relative to the class b common stock and might harm the trading price of our class a common stock in addition mr zuckerberg has the ability to control the management and major strategic investments of our company as a result of his position as our ceo and his ability to control the election or replacement of our directors in the event of his death the shares of our capital stock that mr zuckerberg owns will be transferred to the persons or entities that he designates as a board member and officer mr zuckerberg owes a fiduciary duty to our stockholders and must act in good faith in a manner he reasonably believes to be in the best interests of our stockholders as a stockholder even a controlling stockholder mr zuckerberg is entitled to vote his shares and shares over which he has voting control as a result of voting agreements in his own interests which may not always be in the interests of our stockholders generally 

we plan to continue to make acquisitions which could require significant management attention disrupt our business result in dilution to our stockholders and adversely affect our financial results 

as part of our business strategy we have made and intend to make acquisitions to add specialized employees complementary companies products or technologies our ability to acquire and integrate larger or more complex companies products or technologies 

in a successful manner is unproven   in the future we may not be able to find other suitable acquisition candidates and we may not be able to complete acquisitions on favorable terms if at all any future acquisitions we complete could be viewed negatively by users developers marketers or investors and our acquisitions may not achieve our goals for example in august 2012 we acquired instagram but we are still focused on user growth and the users experience and do not yet derive any direct revenue from instagram in addition if we fail to successfully close or integrate any acquisitions integrate the products or technologies associated with such acquisitions into our company or identify and address liabilities associated with the acquired business or assets our business revenue and operating results could be adversely affected any integration process may require significant time and resources and we may not be able to manage the process successfully we may not successfully evaluate or utilize the acquired products technology or personnel or accurately forecast the financial impact of an acquisition transaction including accounting charges in addition our ability to conduct due diligence with respect to acquisitions and our ability to evaluate the results of such due diligence is dependent upon the accuracy and completeness of statements and disclosures made or actions taken by the companies we acquire or their representatives despite our efforts there could be significant liabilities or deficiencies associated with the business assets products financial condition or accounting practices related to the assets or companies we acquire in addition we may have to pay cash incur debt or issue equity securities to pay for acquisitions any of which could adversely affect our financial results the sale of equity or issuance of debt to finance any such acquisitions could result in dilution to our stockholders the incurrence of indebtedness would result in increased fixed obligations and could also include covenants or other restrictions that would impede our ability to manage our operations 

our business is dependent on our ability to maintain and scale our technical infrastructure and any significant disruption in our service could damage our reputation result in a potential loss of users and engagement and adversely affect our financial results 

our reputation and ability to attract retain and serve our users is dependent upon the reliable performance of facebook and our underlying technical infrastructure our systems may not be adequately designed with the necessary reliability and redundancy to avoid performance delays or outages that could be harmful to our business if facebook is unavailable when users attempt to access it or if it does not load as quickly as they expect users may not return to our website as often in the future or at all as our user base and the amount and types of information shared on facebook continue to grow we will need an increasing amount of technical infrastructure including network capacity and computing power to continue to satisfy the needs of our users it is possible that we may fail to effectively scale and grow our technical infrastructure to accommodate these increased demands in addition our business is subject to interruptions delays or failures resulting from earthquakes adverse weather conditions other natural disasters power loss terrorism or other catastrophic events 

a substantial portion of our network infrastructure is provided by third parties any disruption or failure in the services we receive from these providers could harm our ability to handle existing or increased traffic and could significantly harm our business any financial or other difficulties these providers face may adversely affect our business and we exercise little control over these providers which increases our vulnerability to problems with the services they provide 

we could experience unforeseen difficulties in building and operating key portions of our technical infrastructure 

we have designed and built our own data centers and key portions of our technical infrastructure through which we serve our products and we plan to continue to significantly expand the size of our infrastructure primarily through data centers and other projects the infrastructure expansion we are undertaking is complex and unanticipated delays in the completion of these projects or availability of components may lead to increased project costs operational inefficiencies or interruptions in the delivery or degradation of the quality of our products in addition there may be issues related to this infrastructure that are not identified during the testing phases of design and implementation which may only become evident after we have started to fully utilize the underlying equipment that could further degrade the user experience or increase our costs 

our software is highly technical and if it contains undetected errors our business could be adversely affected 

our products incorporate software that is highly technical and complex our software has contained and may now or in the future contain undetected errors bugs or vulnerabilities some errors in our software code may only be discovered after the code has been released any errors bugs or vulnerabilities discovered in our code after release could result in damage to our reputation loss of users loss of revenue or liability for damages any of which could adversely affect our business and financial results 

certain of our user metrics are subject to inherent challenges in measurement and real or perceived inaccuracies in such metrics may harm our reputation and negatively affect our business 

the numbers of our maus daus and mobile maus and average revenue per user arpu are calculated using internal company data based on the activity of user accounts while these numbers are based on what we believe to be reasonable estimates of our user base for the applicable period of measurement there are inherent challenges in measuring usage of our products across large online and mobile populations around the world for example there may be individuals who maintain one or more facebook accounts in violation of our terms of service we estimate for example that duplicate accounts an account that a user maintains 

in addition to his or her principal account may have represented approximately 50 of our worldwide maus as of december 31 2012 we also seek to identify false accounts which we divide into two categories 1 usermisclassified accounts where users have created personal profiles for a business organization or nonhuman entity such as a pet such entities are permitted on facebook using a page rather than a personal profile under our terms of service and 2 undesirable accounts which represent user profiles that we determine are intended to be used for purposes that violate our terms of service such as spamming as of december 31 2012 for example we estimate usermisclassified accounts may have represented approximately 13 of our worldwide maus and undesirable accounts may have represented approximately 09 of our worldwide maus we believe the percentage of accounts that are duplicate or false is meaningfully lower in developed markets such as the united states or australia and higher in developing markets such as indonesia and turkey however these estimates are based on an internal review of a limited sample of accounts and we apply significant judgment in making this determination such as identifying names that appear to be fake or other behavior that appears inauthentic to the reviewers as such our estimation of duplicate or false accounts may not accurately represent the actual number of such accounts we are continually seeking to improve our ability to identify duplicate or false accounts and estimate the total number of such accounts and such estimates may change due to improvements or changes in our methodology 

some of our historical metrics through the second quarter of 2012 have also been affected by applications on certain mobile devices that automatically contact our servers for regular updates with no user action involved and this activity can cause our system to count the user associated with such a device as an active user on the day such contact occurs for example we estimate that less than 5 of our estimated worldwide daus as of december 31 2011 and 2010 resulted from this type of automatic mobile activity and that this type of activity had a substantially smaller effect on our estimate of worldwide maus and mobile maus the impact of this automatic activity on our metrics varied by geography because mobile usage varies in different regions of the world in addition our data regarding the geographic location of our users is estimated based on a number of factors such as the users ip address and selfdisclosed location these factors may not always accurately reflect the users actual location for example a mobileonly user may appear to be accessing facebook from the location of the proxy server that the user connects to rather than from the users actual location the methodologies used to measure user metrics may also be susceptible to algorithm or other technical errors for example in early june 2012 we discovered an error in the algorithm we use to estimate the geographic location of our users that affected our attribution of certain user locations for the period ended march 31 2012 while this issue did not affect our overall worldwide mau and dau numbers it did affect our attribution of users across different geographic regions we estimate that the number of maus as of march 31 2012 for the united states  canada region was overstated as a result of the error by approximately 3 and this overstatement was offset by understatements in other regions our estimates for revenue by user location and revenue by user device are also affected by these factors we regularly review and may adjust our processes for calculating these metrics to improve their accuracy in addition our mau and dau estimates will differ from estimates published by third parties due to differences in methodology for example some third parties are not able to accurately measure mobile users or do not count mobile users for certain user groups or at all in their analyses if marketers developers or investors do not perceive our user metrics to be accurate representations of our user base or if we discover material inaccuracies in our user metrics our reputation may be harmed and marketers and developers may be less willing to allocate their budgets or resources to facebook which could negatively affect our business and financial results 

we cannot assure you that we will effectively manage our growth 

our employee headcount and the scope and complexity of our business have increased significantly with the number of employees increasing to 4619  as of december 31 2012  from 3200  as of december 31 2011  and we expect headcount growth to continue for the foreseeable future the growth and expansion of our business and products create significant challenges for our management operational and financial resources including managing multiple relations with users marketers platform developers and other third parties in the event of continued growth of our operations or in the number of our thirdparty relationships our information technology systems or our internal controls and procedures may not be adequate to support our operations in addition some members of our management do not have significant experience managing a large global business operation so our management may not be able to manage such growth effectively to effectively manage our growth we must continue to improve our operational financial and management processes and systems and to effectively expand train and manage our employee base as our organization continues to grow and we are required to implement more complex organizational management structures we may find it increasingly difficult to maintain the benefits of our corporate culture including our ability to quickly develop and launch new and innovative products this could negatively affect our business performance 

the loss of one or more of our key personnel or our failure to attract and retain other highly qualified personnel in the future could harm our business 

we currently depend on the continued services and performance of our key personnel including mark zuckerberg and sheryl k sandberg although we have entered into employment agreements with mr zuckerberg and ms sandberg the agreements have no specific duration and constitute atwill employment in addition many of our key technologies and systems are custommade for our business by our personnel the loss of key personnel including members of management as well as key engineering product development marketing and sales personnel could disrupt our operations and have an adverse effect on our business 

as we continue to grow we cannot guarantee we will continue to attract the personnel we need to maintain our competitive position in particular we intend to hire a significant number of technical personnel in 2013 and we expect to face significant competition from other companies in hiring such personnel particularly in the san francisco bay area as we mature the incentives to attract retain and motivate employees provided by our equity awards or by future arrangements may not be as effective as in the past and if we issue significant equity to attract additional employees the ownership of our existing stockholders may be further diluted additionally we have a number of current employees whose equity ownership in our company gives them a substantial amount of personal wealth which could affect their decisions about whether or not to continue to work for us as a result of these factors it may be difficult for us to continue to retain and motivate our employees if we do not succeed in attracting hiring and integrating excellent personnel or retaining and motivating existing personnel we may be unable to grow effectively 

we may incur liability as a result of information retrieved from or transmitted over the internet or posted to facebook and claims related to our products 

we have faced currently face and will continue to face claims relating to information that is published or made available on facebook in particular the nature of our business exposes us to claims related to defamation intellectual property rights rights of publicity and privacy and personal injury torts this risk is enhanced in certain jurisdictions outside the united states where our protection from liability for thirdparty actions may be unclear and where we may be less protected under local laws than we are in the united states we could incur significant costs investigating and defending such claims and if we are found liable significant damages if any of these events occur our business and financial results could be adversely affected 

computer malware viruses hacking and phishing attacks and spamming could harm our business and results of operations 

computer malware viruses and computer hacking and phishing attacks have become more prevalent in our industry have occurred on our systems in the past and may occur on our systems in the future because of our prominence we believe that we are a particularly attractive target for such attacks though it is difficult to determine what if any harm may directly result from any specific interruption or attack any failure to maintain performance reliability security and availability of our products and technical infrastructure any such failure may harm our reputation and our ability to retain existing users and attract new users 

in addition spammers attempt to use our products to send targeted and untargeted spam messages to users which may embarrass or annoy users and make facebook less userfriendly we cannot be certain that the technologies and employees that we have to attempt to defeat spamming attacks will be able to eliminate all spam messages from being sent on our platform as a result of spamming activities our users may use facebook less or stop using our products altogether 

payment transactions on the facebook platform may subject us to additional regulatory requirements and other risks that could be costly and difficult to comply with or that could harm our business 

our users can use the facebook platform to purchase virtual and digital goods from our platform developers using our payments infrastructure depending on how our payments product evolves we may be subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the united states europe and elsewhere including those governing money transmission gift cards and other prepaid access instruments electronic funds transfers antimoney laundering counterterrorist financing gambling banking and lending and import and export restrictions in some jurisdictions the application or interpretation of these laws and regulations is not clear to increase flexibility in how our use of payments may evolve and to mitigate regulatory uncertainty we have applied for and received certain money transmitter licenses in the united states and expect to apply for certain regulatory licenses in europe which will generally require us to demonstrate compliance with many domestic and foreign laws in these areas our efforts to comply with these laws and regulations could be costly and result in diversion of management time and effort and may still not guarantee compliance in the event that we are found to be in violation of any such legal or regulatory requirements we may be subject to monetary fines or other penalties such as a cease and desist order or we may be required to make product changes any of which could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results 

in addition we may be subject to a variety of additional risks as a result of payments on the facebook platform including 

 24 

we plan to continue expanding our operations abroad where we have limited operating experience and may be subject to increased business and economic risks that could affect our financial results 

we plan to continue the international expansion of our business operations and the translation of our products we currently make facebook available in more than 70 different languages and we have offices or data centers in more than 20 different countries we may enter new international markets where we have limited or no experience in marketing selling and deploying our products for example we continue to evaluate entering china however this market has substantial legal and regulatory complexities that have prevented our entry into china to date if we fail to deploy or manage our operations in international markets successfully our business may suffer in addition we are subject to a variety of risks inherent in doing business internationally including 

 if we are unable to expand internationally and manage the complexity of our global operations successfully our financial results could be adversely affected 

we have a substantial amount of indebtedness which could adversely affect our financial condition and our ability to obtain additional capital on reasonable terms when required 

as of december 31 2012  we had 15 billion  outstanding under our term loan facility by drawing on our term loan facility our interest expense and principal repayment requirements have increased significantly which could have an adverse effect on our financial results 

in addition we may require additional capital to support our business growth or to respond to business opportunities challenges or unforeseen circumstances we also expect to expend substantial amounts to fund tax withholding and remittance obligations related to the vesting and settlement of restricted stock units rsus in the future if we continue to net settle such rsus our ability to obtain additional capital if and when required will depend on our business plans investor demand our operating performance the condition of the capital markets and other factors and our substantial indebtedness may limit our ability to borrow such additional funds if we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity equitylinked or debt securities those securities may have rights preferences or privileges senior to the rights of our class a common stock and our existing stockholders may experience dilution 

if we default on our leasing and credit obligations our operations may be interrupted and our business and financial results could be adversely affected 

we finance a significant portion of our expenditures through leasing arrangements some of which are not required to be reflected on our balance sheet and we may enter into additional similar arrangements in the future in particular we have used these types of arrangements to finance some of our equipment and data centers in addition we have a revolving credit facility that we may draw upon to finance our operations or other corporate purposes and have a term loan facility from which we drew 15 billion  to fund a portion of our tax withholding and remittance obligations in connection with the settlement of rsus if we default on these leasing and credit obligations our leasing partners and lenders may among other things 

 if some or all of these events were to occur our operations may be interrupted and our ability to fund our operations or obligations as well as our business financial results and financial condition could be adversely affected 

we may have exposure to greater than anticipated tax liabilities 

our income tax obligations are based in part on our corporate operating structure and intercompany arrangements including the manner in which we develop value and use our intellectual property and the valuations of our intercompany transactions the tax laws applicable to our business including the laws of the united states and other jurisdictions are subject to interpretation the taxing authorities of the jurisdictions in which we operate may challenge our methodologies for valuing developed technology or intercompany arrangements which could increase our worldwide effective tax rate and harm our financial position and results of operations we are subject to regular review and audit by us federal and state and foreign tax authorities tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken and any adverse outcome of such a review or audit could have a negative effect on our financial position and results of operations in addition the determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires significant judgment by management and there are many transactions where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain although we believe that our estimates are reasonable the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements and may materially affect our financial results in the period or periods for which such determination is made   in addition our future income taxes could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions that have lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions that have higher statutory tax rates by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities or by changes in tax laws regulations or accounting principles for example we have previously incurred losses in certain international subsidiaries that resulted in an effective tax rate that is significantly higher than the statutory tax rate in the united states and this could continue to happen in the future 

changes in tax laws or tax rulings could materially affect our financial position and results of operations 

changes in tax laws or tax rulings could materially affect our financial position and results of operations for example the current us administration and key members of congress have made public statements indicating that international tax is a priority certain changes to us tax laws including limitations on the ability to defer us taxation on earnings outside of the united states until those earnings are repatriated to the united states could affect the tax treatment of our foreign earnings in addition other countries are considering changes to their tax regimes in an effort to raise additional tax proceeds from companies such as facebook due to the large and expanding scale of our international business activities any changes in the taxation of such activities may increase our worldwide effective tax rate and harm our financial position and results of operations 

risks related to ownership of our class a common stock 

the trading price of our class a common stock has been and will likely continue to be volatile 

the trading price of our class a common stock has been and is likely to continue to be volatile since shares of our class a common stock were sold in our ipo in may 2012 at a price of 3800 per share our stock price has ranged from 1755 to 4500 through december 31 2012  in addition to the factors discussed in this annual report on form 10k the trading price of our class a common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to numerous factors many of which are beyond our control including 

 26 

 in addition the stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many technology companies stock prices of many technology companies have fluctuated in a manner unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies following our ipo the events surrounding the offering became the subject of securities litigation we may experience more such litigation following future periods of volatility any securities litigation could subject us to substantial costs divert resources and the attention of management from our business and adversely affect our business 

substantially all of our total outstanding shares are available for sale into the public market and any substantial sales of our stock could cause the price of our class a common stock to decline 

the price of our class a common stock could decline if there are substantial sales of our common stock particularly sales by our directors executive officers employees and significant stockholders or when there is a large number of shares of our common stock available for sale as of december 31 2012  there were 1671277621  shares of our class a common stock and 701427574  shares of our class b common stock outstanding shares of our class b common stock are convertible into an equivalent number of shares of our class a common stock and generally convert into shares of our class a common stock upon transfer 

as of december 31 2012  substantially all of our outstanding shares are available for sale into the market except for 47315862 shares held by mailru group limited and dst global limited and their respective affiliates which will be eligible for sale in the public market on may 18 2013 and 426 million outstanding shares and 60 million shares issuable upon the exercise of an option held by mark zuckerberg mr zuckerberg has informed us that he has no intention to conduct any sale transactions in our securities until at least september 2013 

if securities or industry analysts publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business our stock price could decline 

the trading market for our class a common stock depends in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business if one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade the rating of our class a common stock or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business our class a common stock price could decline 

we do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future 

we have never declared or paid cash dividends on our capital stock we currently intend to retain any future earnings to finance the operation and expansion of our business and we do not expect to declare or pay any dividends in the foreseeable future as a result you may only receive a return on your investment in our class a common stock if the trading price of our class a common stock increases in addition our credit facilities contain restrictions on our ability to pay dividends 

if we are unable to implement and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting in the future investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and the trading price of our class a common stock may be negatively affected 

we are required to maintain internal controls over financial reporting and to report any material weaknesses in such internal controls in addition beginning with our 2013 annual report on form 10k to be filed in 2014 we will be required to furnish a report by management on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act we are in the process of designing implementing and testing the internal control over financial reporting required to comply with this obligation which process is time consuming costly and complicated if we identify material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting if we are unable to comply with the requirements of section 404 in a timely manner or assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to express an opinion as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and the trading price of our class a common stock could be negatively affected and we could become subject to investigations by the stock exchange on which our securities are listed the sec or other regulatory authorities which could require additional financial and management resources 

the requirements of being a public company may strain our resources and divert managements attention 

we are subject to the reporting requirements of the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended  the sarbanesoxley act the doddfrank act the listing requirements of the nasdaq global select market and other applicable securities rules and regulations compliance with these rules and regulations has increased and maywill continue to increase our legal and financial compliance costs make some activities more difficult timeconsuming or costly and increase demand on our systems and resources as a result managements attention may be diverted from other business concerns which could harm our business and operating results although we have hired additional employees to comply with these requirements we may need to hire more employees in the future which will increase our costs and expenses 

in addition complying with public disclosure rules makes our business more visible which we believe may result in threatened or actual litigation including by competitors and other third parties if such claims are successful our business and operating results could be harmed and even if the claims do not result in litigation or are resolved in our favor these claims and the time and resources necessary to resolve them could divert the resources of our management and harm our business and operating results 

the dual class structure of our common stock and the voting agreements among certain stockholders have the effect of concentrating voting control with our ceo and also with employees and directors and their affiliates this will limit or preclude your ability to influence corporate matters 

our class b common stock has ten votes per share and our class a common stock has one vote per share stockholders who hold shares of class b common stock including our executive officers employees and directors and their affiliates together hold a substantial majority of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock because of the tentoone voting ratio between our class b and class a common stock the holders of our class b common stock collectively control a majority of the combined voting power of our common stock and therefore are able to control all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval so long as the shares of class b common stock represent at least 91 of all outstanding shares of our class a and class b common stock this concentrated control will limit or preclude your ability to influence corporate matters for the foreseeable future 

future transfers by holders of class b common stock will generally result in those shares converting to class a common stock subject to limited exceptions such as certain transfers effected for estate planning or charitable purposes the conversion of class b common stock to class a common stock will have the effect over time of increasing the relative voting power of those holders of class b common stock who retain their shares in the long term if for example mr zuckerberg retains a significant portion of his holdings of class b common stock for an extended period of time he could in the future continue to control a majority of the combined voting power of our class a common stock and class b common stock 

we have elected to take advantage of the controlled company exemption to the corporate governance rules for nasdaqlisted companies which could make our class a common stock less attractive to some investors or otherwise harm our stock price 

because we qualify as a controlled company under the corporate governance rules for nasdaqlisted companies we are not required to have a majority of our board of directors be independent nor are we required to have a compensation committee or an independent nominating function in light of our status as a controlled company our board of directors determined not to have an independent nominating function and chose to have the full board of directors be directly responsible for nominating members of our board and in the future we could elect not to have a majority of our board of directors be independent or not to have a compensation committee accordingly should the interests of our controlling stockholder differ from those of other stockholders the other stockholders may not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the corporate governance rules for nasdaqlisted companies our status as a controlled company could make our class a common stock less attractive to 

some investors or otherwise harm our stock price 

delaware law and provisions in our restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws could make a merger tender offer or proxy contest difficult thereby depressing the trading price of our class a common stock 

our status as a delaware corporation and the antitakeover provisions of the delaware general corporation law may discourage delay or prevent a change in control by prohibiting us from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years after the person becomes an interested stockholder even if a change of control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders in addition our restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that may make the acquisition of our company more difficult including the following

 item 3 legal proceedings 

paul d ceglia filed suit against us and mark zuckerberg on or about june 30 2010 in the supreme court of the state of new york for the county of allegheny claiming substantial ownership of our company based on a purported contract between mr ceglia and mr zuckerberg allegedly entered into in april 2003 we removed the case to the us district court for the western district of new york where the case is now pending in his first amended complaint filed on april 11 2011 mr ceglia revised his claims to include an alleged partnership with mr zuckerberg he revised his claims for relief to seek a substantial share of mr zuckerbergs ownership in us and he included quotations from supposed emails that he claims to have exchanged with mr zuckerberg in 2003 and 2004 on june 2 2011 we filed a motion for expedited discovery based on evidence we submitted to the court showing that the alleged contract and emails upon which mr ceglia bases his complaint are fraudulent on july 1 2011 the court granted our motion and ordered mr ceglia to produce among other things all hard copy and electronic versions of the purported contract and emails on january 10 2012 the court granted our request for sanctions against mr ceglia for his delay in compliance with that order on march 26 2012 we filed a motion to dismiss mr ceglias complaint and a motion for judgment on the pleadings we continue to believe that mr ceglia is attempting to perpetrate a fraud on the court and we intend to continue to defend the case vigorously 

beginning on may 22 2012 multiple putative class actions derivative actions and individual actions were filed in state and federal courts in the united states and in other jurisdictions against us our directors andor certain of our officers alleging violation of securities laws or breach of fiduciary duties in connection with our ipo and seeking unspecified damages we believe these lawsuits are without merit and we intend to continue to vigorously defend them on october 4 2012 on our motion the vast majority of the cases in the united states along with multiple cases filed against the nasdaq omx group inc and the nasdaq stock market llc collectively referred to herein as nasdaq alleging technical and other tradingrelated errors by nasdaq in connection with our ipo were ordered centralized for coordinated or consolidated pretrial proceedings in the united states district court for the southern district of new york in addition the events surrounding our ipo have become the subject of various government inquiries and we are cooperating with those inquiries any such inquiries could subject us to substantial costs divert resources and the attention of management from our business and adversely affect our business 

we are also party to various legal proceedings and claims which arise in the ordinary course of business among these pending legal matters two cases are currently scheduled for trial in the near future summit 6 llc v research in motion corporation et al  case no 311cv00367 is scheduled to begin trial as early as february 19 2013 in the us district court for the northern district of texas and timelines inc v facebook inc  case no 12011cv06867 is scheduled to begin trial on april 22 2013 in the us district court for the northern district of illinois in the summit 6  case the plaintiffs allege that facebook infringes certain patents held by the plaintiffs in the timelines  case the plaintiffs allege that facebook infringes a trademark held by the plaintiffs in both cases the plaintiffs are seeking significant monetary damages and equitable relief 

we believe the claims made by the summit 6  plaintiffs and the timelines  plaintiffs are without merit and we intend to continue to defend ourselves vigorously in both cases although the outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain we do not believe the possibility of loss in either of these cases is probable we are unable to estimate a range of loss if any that could result were there to be an adverse final decision and we have not accrued a liability for either matter if an unfavorable outcome were to occur in the summit 6  case andor the  timelines  case it is possible that the impact could be material to our results of operations in the periods in which any such outcome becomes probable and estimable 

in addition we are also currently parties to multiple other lawsuits related to our products including other patent infringement lawsuits as well as class action lawsuits brought by users and marketers and we may in the future be subject to additional lawsuits and disputes we are also involved in other claims government investigations and proceedings arising from the ordinary course of our business although the results of these other lawsuits claims government investigations and proceedings in which we are involved cannot be predicted with certainty we do not believe that the final outcome of these other matters will have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations

we generate substantially all of our revenue from advertising and from fees associated with our payments infrastructure that enables users to purchase virtual and digital goods from our platform developers for the year ended december 31 2012 we recorded revenue of 509 billion  income from operations of 538 million  and net income of 53 million  total costs and expenses increased 133  compared to revenue growth of 37  due to significant increases in sharebased compensation and related payroll tax expenses for restricted stock units rsus and increases in headcount for the year ended december 31 2012 during fiscal 2012 we recognized 172 billion  of sharebased compensation and related payroll tax expenses of these amounts 113 billion  was due to the recognition of sharebased compensation and related payroll tax expenses related to rsus granted prior to january 1 2011 pre2011 rsus triggered by the completion of our initial public offering ipo in may 2012 our effective tax rate for the year ended december 31 2012 has exceeded the us statutory rate primarily due to the impact of nondeductible sharebased compensation and losses arising outside the united states in jurisdictions where we do not receive a tax benefit 

trends in our user metrics 

the numbers of maus daus and mobile maus discussed below as well as average revenue per user arpu do not include instagram users unless such users would otherwise qualify as maus daus andor mobile maus based on activity that is shared back to facebook 

 36 

note for purposes of reporting maus daus and arpu by geographic region europe includes all users in russia and turkey asia includes all users in australia and new zealand and rest of world includes africa latin america and the middle east in june 2012 we discovered an error in the algorithm we used to estimate the geographic location of our users that affected our attribution of certain user locations for the first quarter of 2012 while this issue did not affect our overall worldwide mau number it did affect our attribution of users to different geographic regions the first quarter of 2012 user metrics as pictured in the charts above reflect the reclassification to more correctly attribute users by geographic region 

as of december 31 2012 we had 106 billion  maus an increase of 25  from december 31 2011 users in brazil india and indonesia represented key sources of growth in fiscal 2012 relative to the prior year we had 67 million maus in brazil as of december 31 2012 an increase of 81 compared to the same period in 2011 we had 71 million maus in india as of december 31 2012 an increase of 54 compared to the same period in 2011 and we had 60 million maus in indonesia as of december 31 2012 an increase of 25 compared to the same period in 2011 additionally we had 174 million maus in the united states as of december 31 2012 an increase of 8 compared to the same period in 2011

note for nonworldwide dau user numbers presented for the periods marked march 31 2012 and june 30 2012 the figures represent an average of the first 25 days of the former period and the last 27 days of the latter period in order to avoid using data subject to the algorithm error described in the mau section above these average numbers do not meaningfully differ from the average numbers when calculated over a full month 

worldwide daus increased 28  to 618 million on average during december 2012 from 483 million  during december 2011 we experienced growth in daus across major markets including brazil india and japan overall growth in daus was driven largely by increased mobile usage of facebook relative to september 30 2012 daus increased from 584 million  to 618 million  due to an increase in mobile users during the fourth quarter of 2012 the number of daus using personal computers declined modestly compared to the third quarter of 2012 including declines in key markets such as the united states while mobile daus continued to increase 

 worldwide mobile maus increased 57  to 680 million  as of december 31 2012 from 432 million  as of december 31 2011 in all regions an increasing number of our maus are accessing facebook through mobile devices with users in the united states india and brazil representing key sources of mobile growth over the fourth quarter of 2012 as compared to the third quarter of 2012 approximately 157 million  mobile maus accessed facebook solely through mobile apps or our mobile website during the month ended december 31 2012 increasing 25  from 126 million  during the month ended september 30 2012 the remaining 523 million  mobile maus accessed facebook from both personal computers and mobile devices during that month while most of our mobile users also access facebook through personal computers we anticipate that the rate of growth in mobile usage will exceed the growth in usage through personal computers for the foreseeable future and that the usage through personal computers may be flat or continue to decline in certain markets including key developed markets such as the united states in part due to our focus on developing mobile products to encourage mobile usage of facebook 

    

trends in our monetization by user geography 

we calculate our revenue by user geography based on our estimate of the geography in which ad impressions are delivered or virtual goods are purchased we define arpu as our total revenue in a given geography during a given quarter divided by the average of the number of maus in the geography at the beginning and end of the quarter annual arpu is the sum of respective quarterly arpu amounts in that year our revenue and arpu in markets such as united states  canada and europe are relatively higher due to the size and maturity of those advertising markets as well as our greater sales presence and the number of payment methods that we make available to marketers and users 

  

    

note our revenue by user geography in the charts above is geographically apportioned based on our estimation of the geographic location of our users when they perform a revenuegenerating activity this allocation differs from our revenue by geography disclosure in our consolidated financial statements where revenue is geographically apportioned based on the location of the advertiser or developer in june 2012 we discovered an error in the algorithm we used to estimate the geographic location of our users that affected our attribution of certain user locations for the first quarter of 2012 the first quarter of 2012 arpu amount for the united states  canada region reflects an adjustment based on the reclassification to more correctly attribute users by geographic region the amounts above for the fourth quarter of 2012 include a onetime increase in payments revenue as described in results of operations 

for 2012 worldwide arpu was 532 an increase of 6 from 2011 arpu increased in 2012 by approximately 20 in the united states  canada and rest of world by approximately 15 in asia and 8 in europe compared to 2011 during the fourth quarter of 2012 worldwide arpu was 154  an increase of 12  from the fourth quarter of 2011 over this period arpu increased by approximately 37 in rest of world by over 20 in united states  canada and asia and by approximately 7 in europe user growth was more rapid in geographies with relatively lower arpu such as asia and rest of world we expect that user growth in the future will continue to be higher in those regions where arpu is relatively lower such as asia and rest of world such that worldwide arpu may continue to increase at a slower rate relative to arpu in any geographic region or potentially decrease even if arpu increases in each geographic region we also expect worldwide arpu will decline in the first quarter of 2013 driven by seasonality which is consistent with historical trends 

factors affecting our performance   

number of maus and daus  trends in our maus and daus affect our revenue and financial results by influencing the number of ads we are able to show the volume of payments transactions as well as our expenses and capital expenditures in 2012 maus increased by 25  and daus increased by 28  we expect our growth rates for maus and daus to decline as the size of our active user base increases and as we achieve higher market penetration rates additionally as we grow our business and expand internationally we expect to face challenges entering new markets such as china where access to facebook is restricted in whole or in part as user growth rates slow we expect the rate of growth in revenue will likely decline over time which will affect our income from operations and net income   

user geography the geography of our users affects our revenue and financial results because we currently monetize users in different geographies at different average rates for example arpu for an average user in united states  canada is more than five times higher than for an average user in asia user geography also has some impact on our costs though in general new users in asia and rest of world do not require material incremental infrastructure investments because we are able to utilize existing infrastructure such as our data centers in the united states to make our products available to these users in addition user growth by geography does not necessarily affect our overall headcount requirements or headcountrelated expenses since we are generally able to support users in all geographies from our existing facilities in 2012 we grew users relatively faster in asia and rest of world where on average users generate less revenue as compared with users in the united states or europe in the future we expect to continue to grow more rapidly in asia and rest of world markets where our current penetration rates are lower we plan to continue to invest in user growth across the world including in geographies where current per user monetization is relatively lower   

user engagement  changes in user engagement as measured by metrics such as frequency of visitation will also affect our revenue and financial performance growth in user engagement should generally increase the opportunities for us to display advertising and to deliver relevant commercial content to users growth in user engagement also generally results in increases in our expenses and capital expenditures required to support user activity user engagement as measured by daus as a percentage of maus increased from 57 at the end of 2011 to 59 at the end of 2012 our product development investments are focused on increasing user engagement over time 

facebook usage on mobile devices  increasing facebook use on mobile devices may affect our revenue and financial results as we currently show fewer ads on average to mobile users compared to users on personal computers the lower volume of ads per mobile user is partially offset by the higher price per ad for mobile and we are investing to try to make our mobile ads more valuable over time in 2012 we began showing ads in mobile users news feeds and for the fourth quarter of 2012 and for the year ended december 31 2012 we estimate that approximately 23 and 11 of our ads revenue came from mobile products respectively we expect mobile usage to increase at a faster rate than usage through personal computers for the foreseeable future particularly in developed markets and our success in ramping up mobile monetization will likely have a material impact on our financial performance 

value of our advertising products  we believe that increasing the value of our advertising products and the consequent return on investment to marketers from working with facebook will increase marketer demand and thereby increase the amount marketers spend with us we aim to increase the value of our advertising products through such means as increasing the size and engagement of our user base improving our ability to select relevant advertising content for each user developing new ads formats and products and improving the measurement tools available to marketers to optimize their campaigns for example in 2012 we launched advertising in news feed and custom audiences in order to enable marketers to more effectively reach their target customers   

management of ad inventory  our revenue trends are also affected by ad inventory management changes affecting the number size or prominence of ads we display for example in 2012 we began showing ads in news feed these news feed ads are displayed more prominently and we receive a higher price per ad compared to ads displayed on the right hand column of our web page   

product innovation  we make ongoing product changes intended to enhance the user experience and increase user engagement for example in 2012 we launched new versions of our iphone app that are faster and more reliable than the prior versions of our app the new versions of the apps significantly increased news feed loads and user feedback shared our new products often also increase costs if they require additional compute power and infrastructure 

investment in infrastructure  our investments in the scope reliability redundancy and efficiency of our infrastructure affects our expenses and capital expenditures in 2012 we continued to make significant investments in our technical infrastructure to ensure that our growing user base can access facebook rapidly and reliably by expanding the capacity of our data centers in prineville oregon and forest city north carolina and by initiating construction of a new data center project in lulea sweden we also invested in hardware and software efficiency projects to improve the performance of our infrastructure 

investment in talent  as of december 31 2012 we had 4619  employees an increase of 44  from the end of 2011 our employee headcount has increased significantly and we expect headcount growth to continue in 2013 as we ramp up our investment in technical staff sales and marketing and general and administrative personnel we have also made and intend to make acquisitions with the primary objective of adding software engineers product designers and other personnel with certain technology expertise 

business development and acquisitions as part of our business strategy we periodically make acquisitions to add specialized employees complementary companies products technologies or other assets for example in 2012 we acquired instagram inc and certain aol patent assets from microsoft corporation our acquisitions will affect our future financial results due to factors such as the amortization of acquired intangible assets and may also result in potential charges such as restructuring costs or impairment expense 

geographic earnings mix  in 2012 our tax rate was 89  up from 41  in 2011 primarily due to significant amounts of sharebased compensation expense being allocated to our international subsidiaries in low tax jurisdictions leading to nondeductible losses in those subsidiaries our future tax rate and financial results will be affected by the relative profitability of our corporate entities in higher versus lower tax jurisdictions 

seasonality advertising spending is traditionally seasonally strong in the fourth quarter of each year we believe that this seasonality in advertising spending affects our quarterly results which generally reflect significant growth in advertising revenue between the third and fourth quarters and a decline in advertising spending between the fourth and subsequent first quarters for instance our advertising revenue increased 46 18 and 22 between the third and fourth quarters of 2010 2011 and 2012 respectively while advertising revenue for the first quarter of 2011 and 2012 declined 3 and 8 compared to the fourth quarters of 2010 and 2011 respectively 

sharebased compensation expense  during the year ended december 31 2012 we recognized 157 billion  of sharebased compensation expense of these amounts 104 billion was due to the recognition of sharebased compensation related to pre2011 rsus triggered by the completion of our ipo in may 2012 as of december 31 2012 there was 221 billion  of unrecognized sharebased compensation expense of which 196 billion  is related to rsus and 244 million  is related to restricted shares and stock options this unrecognized sharebased compensation expense is expected to be recognized over a weightedaverage period of approximately three  years 

critical accounting policies and estimates   

our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue costs and expenses and related disclosures we evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis our estimates are based on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances our actual results could differ from these estimates 

an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made if different estimates reasonably could have been used or if changes in the estimate that are reasonably possible could materially impact the financial statements we believe that the assumptions and estimates associated with revenue recognition for payments and other fees income taxes sharebased compensation loss contingencies and business combinations and valuation of goodwill and other acquired intangible assets have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements therefore we consider these to be our critical accounting policies and estimates for further information on all of our significant accounting policies see note 1 of our accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data of this annual report on form 10k 

revenue recognition for payments and other fees   

we enable payments from our users to our platform developers our users can make payments on the facebook platform by using credit cards or other payment methods available on our website the primary process for these transactions is through the purchase of our virtual currency our users then use this virtual currency to purchase virtual and digital goods in games and apps from developers on the facebook platform upon the initial sale of the virtual currency we record consideration received from a user as a deposit   

when a user engages in a payment transaction utilizing the virtual currency for the purchase of a virtual or digital good from a 

platform developer we reduce the virtual currency balance of the user by the price of the purchase which is a price that is solely determined by the platform developer we remit to the platform developer an amount that is based on the total amount of virtual currency redeemed less the processing fee that we charge the platform developer for the service performed our revenue is the net amount of the transaction representing our processing fee for the transaction we record revenue on a net basis as we do not consider ourselves to be the principal in the sale of the virtual or digital good to the user under gaap guidance related to reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent the indicators used to determine whether an entity is a principal or an agent to a transaction are subject to judgment we consider ourselves the agent to these transactions when we apply the indicators to our facts should material subsequent changes in the substance or nature of the transactions with platform developers result in us being considered the principal in such sales we would reflect the virtual and digital goods sale as revenue and the amounts paid to the platform developers as an associated cost 

income taxes   

we are subject to income taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes and income tax assets and liabilities including evaluating uncertainties in the application of accounting principles and complex tax laws   

we record a provision for income taxes for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations using the asset and liability method under this method we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities as well as for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the tax rates that are expected to apply to taxable income for the years in which those tax assets and liabilities are expected to be realized or settled we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the net amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized   

we recognize tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if we believe that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position although we believe that we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions we can provide no assurance that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be materially different we make adjustments to these reserves when facts and circumstances change such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded such differences will affect the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made and could have a material impact on our financial condition and operating results the provision for income taxes includes the effects of any reserves that we believe are appropriate as well as the related net interest and penalties   

sharebased compensation   

prior to january 1 2011 we granted pre2011 rsus to our employees and members of our board of directors that vested upon the satisfaction of both a servicebased condition generally over four years and a liquidity condition the liquidity condition was satisfied in connection with our ipo in may 2012 because the liquidity condition was not satisfied until our ipo in prior periods we had not recorded any expense relating to the granting of the pre2011 rsus in the second quarter of 2012 we recognized 986 million  of stockbased compensation expense associated with pre2011 rsus that vested in connection with our ipo for the pre2011 rsus we recognize sharebased compensation expense using the accelerated attribution method net of estimated forfeitures in which compensation cost for each vesting tranche in an award is recognized ratably from the service inception date to the vesting date for that tranche 

rsus granted on or after january 1 2011 post2011 rsus are not subject to a liquidity condition in order to vest and compensation expense related to these grants is based on the grant date fair value of the rsus and is recognized on a straightline basis over the applicable service period the majority of post2011 rsus are earned over a service period of four  to five years  for post2011 rsus which are only subject to a service condition we recognize sharebased compensation expense on a ratable basis over the requisite service period for the entire award 

we account for sharebased employee compensation plans under the fair value recognition and measurement provisions in accordance with applicable accounting standards which require all sharebased payments to employees including grants of stock options and rsus to be measured based on the grantdate fair value of the awards   

sharebased compensation expense is recorded net of estimated forfeitures in our consolidated statements of income and as such is recorded for only those sharebased awards that we expect to vest we estimate the forfeiture rate based on historical forfeitures of equity awards and adjust the rate to reflect changes in facts and circumstances if any we will revise our estimated forfeiture rate if actual forfeitures differ from our initial estimates   

we have historically issued unvested restricted shares to employee stockholders of certain acquired companies as these awards are generally subject to continued postacquisition employment we have accounted for them as postacquisition sharebased compensation expense we recognize compensation expense equal to the grant date fair value of the common stock on a straightline basis over the employees required service period   

we capitalize sharebased employee compensation expense when appropriate we did not capitalize any sharebased compensation 

expense in the three years ended december 31 2012  

loss contingencies   

we are involved in various lawsuits claims investigations and proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business certain of these matters include speculative claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts of damages we record a liability when we believe that it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated significant judgment is required to determine both probability and the estimated amount we review these provisions at least quarterly and adjust these provisions accordingly to reflect the impact of negotiations settlements rulings advice of legal counsel and updated information 

in the opinion of management there was not at least a reasonable possibility we may have incurred a material loss or a material loss in excess of a recorded accrual with respect to loss contingencies for legal and other contingencies as of december 31 2012 however the outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain therefore although management considers the likelihood of such an outcome to be remote if one or more of these legal matters were resolved against us in the same reporting period for amounts in excess of managements expectations our consolidated financial statements of a particular reporting period could be materially adversely affected 

business combinations and valuation of goodwill and other acquired intangible assets   

we allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired liabilities assumed and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values the excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill such valuations require management to make significant estimates and assumptions especially with respect to intangible assets during the measurement period which is one year from the acquisition date we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill upon the conclusion of the measurement period any subsequent adjustments are recorded to earnings 

we review goodwill for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable we have elected to first assess the qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of our single reporting operating unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the twostep goodwill impairment under the new authoritative guidance issued by the financial accounting standards board fasb if we determine that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount then the twostep goodwill impairment test will be performed the first step identifying a potential impairment compares the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount if the carrying amount exceeds its fair value the second step will be performed otherwise no further step is required the second step measuring the impairment loss compares the implied fair value of the goodwill with the carrying amount of the goodwill any excess of the goodwill carrying amount over the applied fair value is recognized as an impairment loss and the carrying value of goodwill is written down to fair value as of december 31 2012  no impairment of goodwill has been identified 

acquired intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives we evaluate the recoverability of amortizable intangible assets for possible impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable recoverability of these assets is measured by a comparison of the carrying amounts to the future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate if such review indicates that the carrying amount of property and equipment and intangible assets is not recoverable the carrying amount of such assets is reduced to fair value we have not recorded any such impairment charge during the years presented 

in addition to the recoverability assessment we routinely review the remaining estimated useful lives of our amortizable intangible assets if we reduce the estimated useful life assumption for any asset the remaining unamortized balance would be amortized over the revised estimated useful life 

components of results of operations 

revenue 

we generate substantially all of our revenue from advertising and from fees associated with our payments infrastructure that enables users to purchase virtual and digital goods from our platform developers 

advertising  our advertising revenue is generated by displaying ad products on the facebook website or mobile app and thirdparty affiliated websites or mobile apps marketers pay for ad products either directly or through their relationships with advertising agencies based on the number of impressions delivered or the number of clicks made by our users we recognize revenue from the delivery of clickbased ads in the period in which a user clicks on the content we recognize revenue from the display of impressionbased ads in the contracted period in which the impressions are delivered impressions are considered delivered when an ad is displayed to users the number of ads we show is subject to methodological changes as we continue to evolve our ads business and the structure of our ads products whether we count the initial display only or every display of an ad as an impression is dependent on where the ad is displayed for example an individual ad in news feed that is purchased on an impression basis may be displayed to users more than once during a day however only the initial display of the ad is considered an impression regardless of how many times the ad is actually displayed within the news feed 

payments and other fees  we enable payments from our users to our platform developers our users can transact and make payments on the facebook platform by using credit cards paypal or other payment methods available on our website we receive a fee from our platform developers when users make purchases from our platform developers using our payments infrastructure we recognize revenue net of amounts remitted to our platform developers we have mandated the use of our payments infrastructure for game apps on facebook and fees related to payments are generated almost exclusively from games cumulatively to date games from zynga have generated the majority of our payments and other fees revenue however zyngas contribution to our payments and other fees revenue has decreased over time and this trend may continue our other fees revenue consists primarily of user promoted posts and to a lesser extent facebook gifts revenue and has been immaterial in recent periods 

cost of revenue and operating expenses 

cost of revenue  our cost of revenue consists primarily of expenses associated with the delivery and distribution of our products these include expenses related to the operation of our data centers such as facility and server equipment depreciation facility and server equipment rent expense energy and bandwidth costs support and maintenance costs and salaries benefits and sharebased compensation for employees on our operations teams cost of revenue also includes credit card and other transaction fees related to processing customer transactions 

research and development  research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries benefits and sharebased compensation for employees on our engineering and technical teams who are responsible for building new products as well as improving existing products we expense all of our research and development costs as they are incurred 

marketing and sales  our marketing and sales expenses consist primarily of salaries benefits and sharebased compensation for our employees engaged in sales sales support marketing business development and customer service functions our marketing and sales expenses also include user developer and advertiserfacing marketing and promotional expenditures 

general and administrative  our general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries benefits and sharebased compensation for our executives as well as our legal finance human resources corporate communications and policy and other administrative employees in addition general and administrative expenses include outside consulting fees legal and accounting services and facilities and other supporting overhead costs general and administrative expenses also include legal settlements and amortization of patents we acquired 

we have reclassified certain prior period expense amounts from marketing and sales to general and administrative within our consolidated statements of income to conform to our current year presentation these reclassifications did not affect previously reported revenue total costs and expenses income from operations or net income in our consolidated statements of income

revenue   



  

2012 compared to 2011 revenue in 2012 increased 138 billion  or 37  compared to 2011 the increase was due primarily to a 36  increase in advertising revenue during 2012 as compared to 2011 

advertising revenue grew due to a 32 increase in the number of ads delivered during 2012 and to a 3 increase in the average price per ad the increase in ads delivered was driven primarily by user growth maus grew 25  from december 31 2011 to december 31 2012 and average daus grew 28  from december 2011 to december 2012 various product changes and changes in user engagement generally offset in their impact on the average number of ads per user for example the shift to greater mobile use generally reduced ads per user while the introduction of ads in news feed increased the number of ads per user the rate of change in number of ads delivered also differs by geography driven by factors such as mobile penetration for example europe and rest of world increased at a faster rate than the united states and asia 

growth in the average price per ad during 2012 compared to 2011 was driven primarily by an increase in price per ad in the united states which benefited from growth in ads in news feed across desktop and mobile devices ads in news feed have a significantly higher average price per ad due to factors which include the prominent position of the ads the increase in price per ad in the united states was partially offset by an increased percentage of our worldwide ads being delivered in the asia and rest of world geographies where the average price per ad while growing on a yearoveryear basis is relatively lower the average price per ad was also affected by a decline in the average price per ad in europe in 2012 compared to 2011 due to the impact of foreign exchange rate changes an increase in the percentage of ads being delivered in european regions where the average price per ads is relatively lower and in part we believe to continuing weak economic conditions in that region affecting advertiser demand 

for the year ended december 31 2012 we estimate that mobile advertising revenue as a percentage of advertising revenue was approximately 11 as mobile advertising was not offered prior to the first quarter of 2012 comparisons to prior year are not meaningful 

advertising revenue in the fourth quarter of 2012 increased 41 compared to the same period in 2011 due to a 46 increase in the number of ads delivered partially offset by a 4 decrease in the average price per ad the increase in ads delivered was driven by user growth and certain product changes including the addition of news feed ads on personal computers and mobile devices maus grew 25 from december 31 2011 to december 31 2012 and average daus grew 28 from december 2011 to december 2012 additionally in the fourth quarter of 2012 we lowered our market reserve price ie the minimum price threshold accepted in our ads auction and this product change had the effect of increasing the number of ads delivered and decreasing the average price per ad this change primarily affected the rest of world and asia markets where the average price per ad is relatively lower and the change increased the percentage of our ads that are shown in relatively lower priced markets which has the effect of decreasing the overall average price per ad for the fourth quarter of 2012 we estimate that mobile advertising revenue as a percentage of advertising revenue was approximately 23 

payments and other fees revenue in 2012 increased 253 million  or 45  compared to 2011 excluding the onetime increase in payments revenue described below payments and other fees revenue in 2012 increased 34 compared to 2011 facebook payments became mandatory for all game developers accepting payments on the facebook platform with limited exceptions on july 1 2011 accordingly comparisons of payments and other fees revenue to periods before this date may not be meaningful 

payments and other fees revenue in the fourth quarter of 2012 was 256 million comparisons to prior periods are not meaningful due to the onetime increase in payments revenue described below 

our payments terms and conditions provide for a 30day claim period subsequent to a payments transaction during which the customer may dispute the virtual or digital goods transaction through the third quarter of 2012 we had deferred recognition of payments revenue until the expiration of this period as we were unable to make reasonable and reliable estimates of future refunds or chargebacks arising during this claim period due to lack of historical transactional information beginning in the fourth quarter of 2012 we had 24 months of historical transactional information which enabled us to estimate future refunds and chargebacks accordingly in the fourth quarter of 2012 we recorded all payments revenues at the time of the purchase of the related 

virtual or digital goods net of estimated refunds or chargebacks this change resulted in a onetime increase in payments revenue in the fourth quarter of 2012 of approximately 66 million  as we recognized revenue from four months of transactions 

seven and nine percent of our total revenue for the three and twelve months ended december 31 2012 respectively and 11 and 12 of our total revenue for the three and twelve months ended december 31 2011 respectively came from a single customer zynga revenue from zynga consisted of payments processing fees related to their sale of virtual goods and from direct advertising purchased by zynga 

in 2012 we generated approximately 51 of our revenue from marketers and platform developers based in the united states compared to 56 in 2011 the change is due primarily to a faster growth rate of international users and to a lesser extent to the expansion of international sales offices and payment methods the majority of our revenue outside of the united states came from customers located in western europe canada australia and brazil 

2011 compared to 2010 revenue in 2011 increased 174 billion  or 88  compared to 2010 the increase was due primarily to a 69  increase in advertising revenue to 315 billion  advertising revenue grew due to a 42 increase in the number of ads delivered and an 18 increase in the average price per ad delivered the increase in ads delivered was driven primarily by user growth maus grew 39 from december 31 2010 to december 31 2011 and average daus grew 48 from december 2010 to december 2011 the number of ads delivered was also affected by many other factors including product changes that significantly increased the number of ads on many facebook pages beginning in the fourth quarter of 2010 partially offset by an increase in usage of our mobile products where we did not show ads and by various product changes implemented in 2011 that in aggregate modestly reduced the number of ads on certain pages the increase in average price per ad delivered was affected by factors including improvements in our ability to deliver more relevant ads to users and product changes that contributed to higher user interaction with the ads by increasing their relative prominence   

payments and other fees revenue increased to 557 million  in 2011 due to the adoption of facebook payments which has been gradually adopted by our platform developers and began generating significant revenue in the fourth quarter of 2010 facebook payments became mandatory for all game developers accepting payments on the facebook platform with limited exceptions on july 1 2011 accordingly comparisons of payments and other fees revenue to periods before that date may not be meaningful in 2011 other fees revenue was immaterial   

in 2011 we generated approximately 56 of our revenue from marketers and platform developers based in the united states compared to 62 in 2010 this change is due to factors including a faster growth rate of international users and the expansion of international sales offices and payment methods the majority of our revenue outside of the united states came from customers located in western europe canada and australia   

cost of revenue 

  

  

2012 compared to 2011 cost of revenue in 2012 increased 504 million  or 59  compared to 2011 the increase was primarily due to expenses related to expanding our data center operations including a 257 million increase in depreciation in 2012 sharebased compensation expense increased by 79 million  in 2012 compared to 2011 mainly due to the recognition of expenses related to pre2011 rsus triggered by the completion of our ipo in may 2012 and to a lesser extent post2011 rsus increases in payroll and benefits expenses resulting from a 65  increase in employee headcount also contributed to the increase in cost of revenue in 2012 these expenses supported our user growth the increased usage of products by users developers and marketers and the launch of new products 

2011 compared to 2010 cost of revenue in 2011 increased 367 million or 74 compared to 2010 the increase was primarily due to expenses related to expanding our data center operations including a 164 million increase in depreciation and a 35 million increase in data center facility rent these expenses supported our user growth the increased usage of our products by users developers and marketers and the launch of new products additionally credit card and other related revenue processing fees increased by 60 million 

we anticipate that the cost of revenue will increase in dollar amount for the foreseeable future as we expand our data center 

capacity to support user growth increased user engagement and the delivery of new products and offerings the expected increase in cost of revenue may be partially mitigated to the extent we are able to realize improvements in server performance and the efficiency of our technical operations we expect cost of revenue in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue to increase in 2013 compared to 2012 due to our investment in technical infrastructure   

  research and development   



  

2012 compared to 2011 research and development expenses in 2012 increased 101 billion  or 261  compared to 2011 the increase was primarily due to an increase in sharebased compensation expense of 729 million  in 2012 resulting primarily from the recognition of expenses related to pre2011 rsus triggered by the completion of our ipo in may 2012 and to a lesser extent post2011 rsus payroll and benefits expense also increased due to a 73  growth in employee headcount in engineering design product management and other technical functions this investment supported our efforts to improve existing products and build new products for users developers and marketers 

2011 compared to 2010  research and development expenses in 2011 increased 244 million  or 169  compared to 2010 the increase was primarily due to an increase from 9 million  in 2010 to 114 million  in 2011 for sharebased compensation expense related to post2011 rsus payroll and benefits expense also increased due to a 57 growth in employee headcount in engineering design product management and other technical functions this investment supported our efforts to improve existing products and build new products for users developers and marketers 

in 2013 we plan to continue rapidly hiring engineering design product management and other technical employees however we expect research and development expenses will rise in 2013 at a lower rate than it rose in 2012 due to the large sharebased compensation expense in the second quarter of 2012 associated with pre2011 rsus triggered by the completion of our ipo 

marketing and sales 



  

 2012 compared to 2011 marketing and sales expenses in 2012 increased 503 million  or 128  compared to 2011 the increase was primarily due to an increase in sharebased compensation expense of 269 million  in 2012 resulting primarily from the recognition of expenses related to pre2011 rsus triggered by the completion of our ipo in may 2012 and to a lesser extent post2011 rsus payroll and benefits expenses also increased due to a 19  increase in employee headcount to support global sales business development and customer service an increase in our user developer and advertiserfacing marketing expense also contributed to the increase in 2012 

2011 compared to 2010 marketing and sales expenses in 2011 increased 226 million or 135 compared to 2010 the increase was primarily due to an increase in payroll and benefits expenses resulting from a 45 increase in employee headcount to support global sales business development and customer service and to a lesser extent an increase in our user developer and advertiserfacing marketing additionally sharebased compensation expense increased from 2 million in 2010 to 37 million in 2011 due to recognition of expense related to post2011 rsus 

in 2013 we plan to add sales business development and customer service employees and increase our investment in user developer and marketerfacing marketing however we expect marketing and sales expenses will rise in 2013 at a lower rate than it rose in 2012 due to the large sharebased compensation expense in the second quarter of 2012 associated with pre2011 rsus triggered by the completion of our ipo 

general and administrative 



  

2012 compared to 2011 general and administrative expenses in 2012 increased 578 million  or 184  compared to 2011 the increase was primarily due to an increase in sharebased compensation expense of 278 million  resulting from recognition of expense related to pre2011 rsus and to a lesser extent post2011 rsus the increase was also due to growth in legal fees and settlement costs amortization of acquired patents and other professional service fees payroll and benefits expenses also increased for 2012 due to a 38  increase in employee headcount in corporate communications and policy human resources legal finance and other functions 

2011 compared to 2010 general and administrative expenses in 2011 increased 176 million or 128 compared to 2010 the increase was primarily due to an increase in payroll and benefits expenses resulting from a 60 increase in employee headcount in finance legal human resources and other functions additionally outside consulting and legal fees contributed to the increase sharebased compensation expense increased from 9 million in 2010 to 57 million in 2011 due to recognition of expense related to post2011 rsus 

in 2013 we plan to continue to increase general and administrative employee headcount to support our growth however we expect general and administrative expenses will rise in 2013 at a lower rate than it rose in 2012 due to the large sharebased compensation expense in the second quarter of 2012 associated with pre2011 rsus triggered by the completion of our ipo   

interest and other income expense net 



  

2012 compared to 2011 interest and other income expense net in 2012 decreased 17 million  or 28  compared to 2011 interest expense increased by 9 million  primarily due to an increased volume of property and equipment financed by capital leases for 2012 and interest on the 15 billion  term loan that was drawn down in the fourth quarter of 2012 changes in other income expense net were primarily due to lower foreign exchange losses in 2012 resulting from the periodic remeasurement of our foreign currency balances and an increase in interest income driven by higher invested cash balances 

2011 compared to 2010 interest and other income expense net in 2011 increased 37 million or 154 compared to 2010 interest expense increased by 20 million driven by an increase in fees related to our credit facility as described in —liquidity and capital resources and the payments related to an increased volume of property and equipment financed by capital leases the change in other income expense net was primarily due to 29 million in foreign exchange related losses in 2011 foreign exchange losses in 2011 stemmed from the periodic remeasurement of our intercompany euro balances foreign currency balances were immaterial in 2010 these expenses were partially offset by an increase in interest income driven by larger invested cash balances   

provision for income taxes   



  

2012 compared to 2011 our provision for income taxes in 2012 decreased 254 million  or 37  compared to 2011 primarily due to a decrease in pretax income our effective tax rate increased primarily due to the impact of nondeductible sharebased compensation and the losses arising outside the united states in jurisdictions where we do not receive a tax benefit our effective tax rate in 2012 was also higher due to the expiration of the federal tax credit for research and development activities 

on january 2 2013 the american taxpayer relief act of 2012 was enacted which includes a reinstatement of the federal research and development credit for the tax year ended december 31 2012 we estimate that our tax credit for 2012 would have been approximately 80 million to 120 million which we will record as a discrete benefit in the first quarter of 2013 

2011 compared to 2010  our provision for income taxes in 2011 increased 293 million or 73 compared to 2010 primarily due to an increase in pretax income our effective tax rate increased primarily due to losses arising outside the united states in jurisdictions where we do not receive a tax benefit and the impact of nondeductible sharebased compensation expense during the year 

  quarterly results of operations data

in february 2012 we entered into an agreement for an unsecured fiveyear revolving credit facility that allows us to borrow up to 5 billion  for general corporate purposes with interest payable on the borrowed amounts set at london interbank offered rate libor plus 10  under the terms of the agreement we are obligated to pay a commitment fee of 010 per annum on the daily undrawn balance no  amounts were drawn down under this credit facility as of december 31 2012 

concurrent with our entering into the revolving credit facility we also entered into a bridge credit facility agreement that allowed us to borrow up to 3 billion  to fund tax withholding and remittance obligations related to the settlement of rsus in connection with our ipo 

in october 2012 we amended and restated our bridge credit facility converting it to an unsecured term loan facility amended and restated term loan that allowed us to borrow up to 15 billion  to fund tax withholding and remittance obligations related to the settlement of rsus in connection with our ipo with interest payable on the borrowed amounts set at libor plus 10 we paid origination fees at closing of the amended and restated term loan which fees are being amortized over the term of the facility we drew down the 15 billion  of the amended and restated term loan in october 2012 and paid an upfront fee of 015 on the loan amount which fee is being amortized over the remaining term of the facility any amounts outstanding will become due and payable on october 25 2015 

in connection with the draw down of the amended and restated term loan to hedge our exposure to interest rate fluctuation we entered into an interest rate swap agreement the net effect of this swap agreement is to convert the variable interest rate to a fixed interest rate of 146  the interest rate swap has a maturity date of october 25 2015 

as of december 31 2012 our income tax refundable of 451 million  reflects the expected refund from income tax loss carrybacks to 2010 and 2011 we expect to receive this refund in the first six months of 2013

cash provided by operating activities 

cash flow from operating activities during 2012  primarily consisted of adjustments to net income for certain noncash items such as sharebased compensation expense of 157 billion  and total depreciation and amortization of 649 million  partially offset by income tax refundable of 451 million  the cash flow from operating activities during 2012 compared to 2011 increased modestly 

as the increases in adjustments for noncash items as described above were offset by a reduction in net income of 947 million  and an increase in income tax refundable 

cash flow from operating activities during 2011 primarily resulted from net income of 1 billion  adjusted for certain noncash items including depreciation and amortization of 323 million  and sharebased compensation expense of 217 million  

cash flow from operating activities during 2010 primarily resulted from net income of 606 million  adjusted for certain noncash items including depreciation and amortization of 139 million  and sharebased compensation expense of 20 million  partially offset by cash consumed by working capital of 70 million

cash used in investing activities during 2011 primarily related to the use of approximately 24 billion  for the net purchase of marketable securities our cash used in investing activities in 2011 also consisted of capital expenditures of 606 million  related to the purchase of servers networking equipment storage infrastructure and the construction of data centers

offbalance sheet arrangements 

we did not have any offbalance sheet arrangements as of december 31 2012  

contractual obligations   

our principal commitments consist of obligations under capital and operating leases for equipment and office and data center facilities the following table summarizes our commitments to settle contractual obligations in cash as of december 31 2012    



 

 in addition our other liabilities include 100 million  related to uncertain tax positions as of december 31 2012  due to uncertainties in the timing of the completion of tax audits the timing of the resolution of these positions is uncertain and we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years beyond 12 months as a result this amount is not included in the above table 

contingencies 

we are involved in claims lawsuits government investigations and proceedings we record a provision for a liability when we believe that it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated significant judgment is required to determine both probability and the estimated amount such legal proceedings are inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties some of which are beyond our control should any of these estimates and assumptions change or prove to be incorrect it could have a material impact on our results of operations financial position and cash flows 

see note 10 in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data and part i item 3 legal proceedings of this annual report on form 10k for additional information regarding contingencies   

recently issued and adopted accounting pronouncement   

comprehensive income 

in may 2011 the fasb issued guidance that changed the requirement for presenting comprehensive income in the consolidated financial statements the update requires an entity to present the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements the update is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after december 15 2011 and should be applied retrospectively we adopted this new guidance on january 1 2012 

goodwill impairment testing 

 in september 2011 the fasb issued an amendment to an existing accounting standard which provides entities an option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether further impairment testing on goodwill is necessary an entity now has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the current twostep impairment test if an entity believes as a result of its qualitative assessment that it is morelikelythannot that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount the quantitative impairment test is required otherwise no further testing is required this standard is effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2011 we adopted this new standard on january 1 2012 and the adoption did not have a material impact on our financial statements

 item 7a 

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

tableend we are exposed to market risks including changes to foreign currency exchange rates interest rates and inflation 

foreign currency exchange risk 

we have foreign currency risks related to our revenue and operating expenses denominated in currencies other than the us dollar primarily the euro in general we are a net receiver of currencies other than the us dollar accordingly changes in exchange rates and in particular a strengthening of the us dollar will negatively affect our revenue and other operating results as expressed in us dollars 

we have experienced and will continue to experience fluctuations in our net income as a result of transaction gains or losses related to revaluing certain current asset and current liability balances that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the entities in which they are recorded at this time we do not but in the future we may enter into derivatives or other financial instruments in an attempt to hedge our foreign currency exchange risk it is difficult to predict the impact hedging activities would have on our results of operations we recognized foreign currency losses of 9 million  and 29 million  for the year ended december 31 2012  and 2011  respectively foreign currency losses were not significant in 2010 

interest rate sensitivity 

our exposure to changes in interest rates relates primarily to interest earned and market value on our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities and interest paid on our longterm debt 

our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities consist of cash certificates of deposit time deposits money market funds and us government and us government agency securities  our investment policy and strategy are focused on preservation of capital and supporting our liquidity requirements changes in us interest rates affect the interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities and the market value of those securities a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would result in a decrease of approximately 55 million  and 15 million  in the market value of our availableforsale debt securities as of december 31 2012  and december 31 2011  respectively any realized gains or losses resulting from such interest rate changes would only occur if we sold the investments prior to maturity 

our longterm debt consists of the 15 billion  draw down on our threeyear unsecured term loan facility that bears variable interest at 1month libor plus 10 as our risk management objective is to mitigate the risk of changes in cash flows attributable to changes in the designated 1month libor for the loan we have entered into an interest rate swap agreement for the exact notional amount of 15 billion  and a fixed interest rate of 146  at the same time the term loan was drawn down to hedge this exposure both the term loan and interest rate swap have a maturity date of october 25 2015 changes in the cash flows of the interest rate swap are expected to exactly offset the changes in cash flows attributable to fluctuations in the 1month libor based interest payments on the longterm debt the net effect of this swap agreement is to convert the variable interest rate to a fixed rate of 146  

inflation risk 

we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our business financial condition or results of operations

there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in managements evaluation pursuant to rules 13a15d or 15d15d of the exchange act during the period covered by this annual report on form 10k that materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting

the annual report on form 10k does not include a report of managements assessment regarding internal control over financial reporting or an attestation report of our independent registered public accounting firm due to a transition period established by the rules of the sec for newly public companies 

limitations on effectiveness of controls and procedures 

in designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures management recognizes that any controls and procedures no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives in addition the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs
